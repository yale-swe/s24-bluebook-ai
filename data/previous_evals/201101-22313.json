   "comments": [
    "Yes, but you won't have Brian Scholl so I have no idea what this class will be like with another instructor.",
    "I absolutely recommend this class to all students in Psychology or Cognitive Science, regardless of whether they are specifically interested in vision science or social psychology. This class provides an interesting perspective on psychology as a whole, and the discussions and readings will help students learn how to identify (and create) well-designed studies.",
    "fantastic course, take it.",
    "typical seminar--new topic each week, ~400 word reading responses, final 15 pg paper. professor scholl is fantastic.",
    "It's less social than I anticipated and thus I was less interested than I thought I'd be. I think the other people in the course really liked it but it wasn't for me.",
    "This seminar was interesting, but not life-changing. The readings were good, and I actually enjoyed doing the reading responses (despite their pesky 6pm deadline) - I'd spent my Wednesday afternoons going through psych articles and getting excited about section the next day. The work wasn't too overwhelming - an average of 60 pages a week - and brought everyone up to a level at which we could engage in conversation with one another instead of just the professor. The mix of students in the class - undergraduates and various grad students - was also really fascinating for conversation. Most of the topics were really fantastic, too - particularly thin-slicing& voting behavior\/judgments based on faces. I enjoyed class sessions, although sometimes I'd leave feeling more confused about the topic than when I'd entered the room. We talked a LOT about automaticity, every class. I wish we'd done more cross-cultural stuff but that's more a problem with the literature on social perception than it is with the course structure. The final project is pesky - unless you've done a research study before or are currently working in a lab, there's basically no way you can pull one off on your own, because Brian Scholl is way too busy to help you figure out how to do it. So you're left basically on your own, trying to figure out how to pull meaning from some topic of your choosing. Overall, though, it was a great seminar, and a fine choice in which to base your senior thesis.",
    "Social Perception is a great senior seminar for it integrates many different lines of research, studied throughout the psychology major. The seminar integrates findings from social psychology, perception research, cognitive science, neuroscience, and even cultural studies and some anthropology. Most of the readings are very interesting - though there are some that are either too dense or way too technical. Each week, however, always has a variety of readings relating to one topic to try to get at the topic from different angles.The one thing I didn't like about the class was that it went on many tangents all the time. There would be some class sessions when we would talk about a random topic, but not really start addressing the actual topic until late into the session, which was a little annoying - but we still got to cover most of the topics extensively. Maybe it'dbe helpful to have an agenda or something so as to not go off topic.",
    "Definitely a great seminar to take - gets you to read many interesting papers. Just be prepared for a rather solid workload - reading response required every week, plus a final paper."
