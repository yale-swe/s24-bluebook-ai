    "Learned how to do so much from my thesis!!! I learned how to design a study, program, clean data, and analyze data!",
    "I learned how to conduct an experiment and write an experimental paper in a journal format. It was very rewarding to hear my peers talk about their own projects as well.",
    "The format of the senior colloquium is simple: delve deep into your focus area, and learn about the wide swath of projects being conducted by your peers. In that vein, I learned the programming language R for this class, read more about political and social psychology than in more structured classes, and heard presentations of topics ranging from comparative psychology to education studies to public health.",
    "I learned how to develop a research question into a full-fledged research design, picked up management and programming skills along the way, and learned how to work most efficiently with a team of diverse skillsets.",
    "Learned about my classmates incredible work over the past 1-4 years!!",
    "I learned about a variety of topics that the other seniors were investigating in their theses. There obviously wasn't any constant thread throughout the \"course,\" but it as fun dipping my toes into the various areas that people were studying.",
    "In this course, we listened to the other cognitive science majors present on their projects. It was fun and interesting to hear what everyone was up to."

   "comments": [
    "I loved having a class where I got to learn about my classmates' theses. Everyone is doing really different but really cool stuff and it's awesome to learn about the research they're passionate about. Grateful that this class exists, and feel like it helped create a nice community within our major. Helpful to get peer feedback, and Mark Sheskin is the greatest teacher of all teachers.",
    "Mark is the best. Mark is the greatest strength h and the only strength. Get more Marks.",
    "It is a very well designed course that allows one to be involved in the scientific process of designing and critiquing experiments.",
    "This is hard to answer given that students had such different experiences with their theses (and levels of engagement), but my comments for the Senior Colloquium itself are included in my responses to the survey Mark sent out.",
    "Mark was the highlight of my time with major and with Yale in general. Truly a gem of the Yale experience and I've felt lucky to have him along the way through my time with the department.",
    "This class was really nice because it was very low commitment and work level (apart from actually writing the thesis, but come one, you know you're doing that anyway). I don't think there's much to improve in the course. It's pretty straightforward. You present and then lean back and listen to other people present their work. It's generally fun and pretty chill. I might recommend some kind of system of making sure that people's presentations were up to par...some of them were a bit embarrassing or just plain dull. But all in all, this class was low commitment and mostly fun and interesting.",
    "This course was valuable to get feedback on our senior project. It was fun to hear what other cognitive science majors were doing because the projects were all so different. The end of the year party was very nice, too."

   "comments": [
    "You have to take it so this isn't much of a recommendation but it's a great class!!!!! Mark is the most giving teacher and your peers will become a great community as you do your thesis.",
    "Definitely- Mark was a great resource as well.",
    "Absolutely! Well, it's required for the Cognitive Science major, but Mark Sheskin is an incredible facilitator, and it's a really supportive environment to develop your own thesis while hearing what other students are doing. I really enjoyed it!",
    "You'll take it whether you want to or not. Basically, this course isn't rigorous in any sense of the word. It's an opportunity for you to present your research and to hear about other people's. It's fun if you're not expecting too much out of it (hopefully the junior colloquium prepared you for that). I'd encourage asking questions after the presentations cuz that makes it more fun for everyone.",
    "If you are a cogsci major, I would recommend that you take this class. Otherwise you will not graduate. Also Mark baked us a cake on the last day, and it was delicious."
