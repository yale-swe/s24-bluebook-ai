   "comments": [
    "Spanish 110 08 is a great introductory language course that prepares you for writing, reading, and speaking spanish at an elementary level. The course satisfactorily integrates various approaches to grammar concepts in the use of multimedia.",
    "You will learn A LOT of spanish. It is very fast paced and by the end of it, you will be able to somewhat converse in Spanish.",
    "Oscar is so much fun!! Not that difficult of a class, and really enjoyable.",
    "Oscar Gonzalez is a very good professor. He is understanding and a good instructor. Take the class if you're interested in Spanish, and in my opinion, the time might be more important than the instructor. Don't take 9:20 classes if you can't wake up. You only get 5 absences and it's a lot more awkward to show up late to a small class.",
    "I would recommend this class. It is a great language to learn, though, be aware that many students who have taken L1 Spanish have actually had previous experience in the language, so do not fall behind if it is indeed your first time with the language.",
    "It is an intro into the world of Spanish and the class moves at a rapid pace. We finished each chapter in roughly a week. There is homework everyday in the class which would take about an hour.",
    "Spanish 110 is an introductory Spanish course, taught in Spanish. Engaging well in this class will enable you to build the foundations in studying Spanish, and even to speak Spanish in fundamental vocabulary.If you are interested in studying Spanish, I definitely recommend taking this class because the you will have a lot of opportunities to speak Spanish and learn it actively.",
    "Spanish 110 is a very good introductory course for spanish. I would highly recommend this course to anyone who is interested in beginning with spanish."
