   "comments": [
    "It is a lot of work, but very worth it in the end. I learned so much about a wide range of topics, and more importantly learned how to read papers, summarize them, and critically think about important next step experiments and how to perform them.",
    "You read a few papers and write a specific aims page every week. I would recommend it to a first year as it is a good way to learn a variety of different things. For second years it is a significant amount of work which seems a bit unnecessary.",
    "PHAR 502 01 is a seminar course that emphasizes experimental design and grant writing. I would recommend this course to another student because it has greatly improved my ability to design experiments and explain them in writing.",
    "PHAR 502 01 provides excellent training in grant proposal writing and is extremely helpful for career development in academia. Besides, the in-class discussions are quite inspirational and evoked strong scientific interests in many research areas. I would definitely recommend this course to another student.",
    "This course is an excellent way to become familiar with the strengths of the Yale pathology, pharmacology, and physiology departments. I would recommend this course to another MMPP student because it is a great way to learn about research and techniques that are accessible to you through rotations.",
    "Yes, I would, however not a first year graduate student. While this course was very useful, I felt it was not step one and was very difficult and intimidating way to start. I believe a more useful way would have been to ease us into this way of thinking by first talking about how to properly read a paper and understand it. Next, talk us through properly identifying good and not so good ideas for specific aims and what makes a great question through a discussion, then move on to specific aims pages.",
    "PHAR 502 is a seminar course that helps to introduce students to topics in the fields of pharmacology, physiology, and pathology, while also improving grant writing skills. I would recommend this course to another students because it has been helpful in introducing me to new techniques and topics and improved my writing and critical thinking skills."

   "comments": [
    "This course taught me how to efficiently and effectively read papers and propose further experiments based on these papers. I feel comfortable writing specific aims, and more prepared to being my dissertation\/research.",
    "Exposure to a variety of different things. Would help me rule out things\/direct my interests if I was a first year. Not sure yet helped with dissertation.",
    "PHAR 502 01 deepens my knowledge of my discipline mostly by providing the opportunity to exchange ideas in group on selected topics and directly interact with experts in these fields. Learning about the techniques and future directions in different research areas contributes a lot to dissertation\/research topic development.",
    "This course gave me an introduction to select topics in physiology, pharmacology, and pathology. It gave me a better idea of what research labs I wanted to pursue for my second and third rotations. While the papers weren't directly related to my current research, this course has helped me develop questions into an organized research proposal, which is invaluable to my graduate training.",
    "The course taught me how to read a paper and determine where there is still information to be understood, and good and bad ways to approach questions. It also allowed me to practice giving a presentation. In addition it introduced me to up to date information on major diseases and techniques being used to address them as well as different physiological systems.",
    "This course allowed me to practice thinking of new questions to ask and techniques with which to ask them based on previous work, which will be helpful in my research. It also helped improve my grant writing skills."
