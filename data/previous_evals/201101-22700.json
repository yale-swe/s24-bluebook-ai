    "This was a good survey course for gender studies. It doesn't give too much on any one topic which can be fristrating, but you will see the cohesiveness of it at the end of the course. The writing is consistent, so don't think you will slack off. You can get a lot out of the course if you engage. You can also learn a lot in your writing as Chanda is a harsh grader.",
    "This is an interesting class that raises very relevant questions about gender and its intersectional interactions with other identities, transnationally. Be prepared to leave the class disappointed, though, because none of these questions will be adequately explored or answered.",
    "This class is a broad look at gender issues around the world. There are two papers, and 10 reading responses. My favorite part of the class is the guest speakers and movies. Class discussions were okay, but our class wasn't too diverse (only 1 male). Class is limited to 12, so e-mail ahead if you want to reserve a spot. Professor Chanda fills the spots first come first serve (no preference for seniors or WGSS majors).",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student. Even if you are not interested in WGSS or have never thought about it before, it is a great class to open your world to the ideas of gender equality as well as global issues that we do not necessarily all know about. I am a prospective science major and this class was one of my favorite classes this semester. I would say that it is a really good class to expand your boundaries and learn in a new way from the typical science lectures. All the classes are group discussions and debates,with Prof. Chanda facilitating. There is kind of a lot of reading, but it is all very interesting and there is a diverse range of ideas explored. We also had guest lecturers and watched a few movies as a class, which were great. I took it originally because I needed a writing credit, but I am so glad I did and I plan to take more WGSS classes in the future. The writing aspect of the class is also very manageable.",
    "Yes absolutely",
    "Good course. Very manageable.",
    "I would recommend it to anyone who has an interest in Women's Studies. It is a good introduction course.",
    "really depends on the class dynamic so shop it",
    "Yes. Not bad...",
    "Really frustrating class. I would not recommend it.",
    "Globalizing Gender provides an overview of global gender by piecing together distinct gender issues from around the world. The class topics were always thought provoking, ranging from critiques on feminist views of stay-at-home mothers, to women's role in the US civil rights movement, to LGBTQ rights in India. I would suggest the class to anyone who wants to analyze their own views of gender and gain a new framework for viewing society, but would suggest taking other WGSS classes as well. Because the class covers such a wide range of topics, you will leave with more questions than you started with (which isn't necessarily a bad thing)."
