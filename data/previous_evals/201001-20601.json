   "comments": [
    "I would most definitely recommend this interdisciplinary course that illuminates several different generations of the High Middle Ages. The course allows for students from a few different fields to gain both breadth and depth in their knowledge of the Middle ages.",
    "For those who find Isaiah Berlin's binary useful, this was a \"fox\" class. You learn a great number of discrete things. You deal with scriptural elements, art history, architecture, literature, philosophy, theology...",
    "This course is an excellent introduction to the art of the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, providing in-depth information on the literature of the period.",
    "A general survey that seeks to bring together textual and visual cultural production during the High Middle Ages.",
    "This course would be especially good for people new to the Middle Ages.",
    "The course is a good introduction to art, architecture and literature in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries. I would recommend it to those unfamiliar with either art or literature during this time, though someone well-grounded in both might find it too foundational. Definitely take it if it is a seminar rather than a lecture format.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course as a wonderful survey of Medieval French literature, architecture and culture. I entered the course with very little understanding of the Medieval period which, now, I feel like I understand much better. My understanding of French literature was deepened during this course."

   "comments": [
    "The course, although not the time period I study, has opened up pathways for my research via methodologies and genealogies.",
    "I appreciated the interdisciplinary approach to the material.",
    "Though the art side was fairly basic for me, the course covered a lot of literature I had not read. I imagine someone from a literature background would say the same thing, vice versa.",
    "One thing I really enjoyed was how Professor Bloch framed his discussion of medieval topics using contemporary themes, such as globalism, post-modernism, etc. To a non-specialist or modernist, it made everything surprisingly relevant."
