   "comments": [
    "This course is honestly more of a neuroscience course than a linguistics course, so it was focused pretty heavily on the brain systems that give rise to reading, as well as what can go wrong with those systems (spoiler alert: a lot). We also spent a significant amount of time talking about brain imaging technologies and reading empirical studies. I can definitely see why this is cross-listed as a grad course; it was much more focused on research approaches than other STEM courses I've taken at Yale (although, to be fair, I've only taken introductory lectures so far).",
    "Learned about the neurological and behavioral basis of reading",
    "I learned a lot about the cognitive and neurological processes that go into reading, comprehension, and general literacy skills in humans across languages. Learned a lot about fMRI, neuroimaging study design, and the work of Haskins Laboratories in Linguistics and Cognitive Science",
    "This class is hyper-focused on reading (as you'd assume by the title), so in the broadest sense, I learned an insane amount about how the human mind reads. I received an in depth understanding of the human mind, as well as a vast array of complications that arise in reading and how some are able to overcome such problems. One of the things I appreciated the most about the class was that despite a greater focus on dyslexia, I had a freedom to focus on other topics for assignments. I now feel much more familiar with scientific papers. This class gave me an amazing opportunity to read and draw connections between studies to form ideas of my own. I can also say with absolute certainty that I will never forget how reading is parasitic on speech and how to draw an orth-phon-sem triangle.",
    "I learned about the principles and applications of brain imaging techniques, such as fMRI, EEG, fNIRs, and MEG. I learned how to use this new knowledge to design a research project. Most importantly, however, I learned about the neural complexities involved in reading, which changed my view on dyslexia. Before this course, I didnt really know much about dyslexia and it never crossed my mind. However, LING 233 taught me that dyslexia is a very convoluted problem that impacts a large part of society and that prevents so many talented individuals from attaining success.",
    "I'm honestly not sure what I learned in this course. Prof. Pugh talked about many many different things, and I'm sure in his mind there were takeaways, but if you ask me all I can give you are some loose facts, nothing really structured. Writing a proposal was a nice skill to develop though.",
    "Learned a great deal about cogsci outside of the classroom",
    "I learned a lot about how the brain processes print for typically developing and atypically developing readers including some discussion across languages and culture. As someone who personally struggles with reading, I gained insights into my own learning and abilities.",
    "An overview of the cognitive neuroscience of reading and reading disorders",
    "Learned about the human brain and how it develops literacy in regards to theory and research.",
    "I learned a lot about the brain and literacy. The course introduced me to things I never would have thought about before. Learning about reading disabilities and how the brain adapts for reading is really interesting."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Ken is a great professor; as the president of Haskins Labs, he's quite arguably the best source of information about this field. I really appreciated that the course focused so heavily on research approaches, although we also spent a significant amount of time talking about underlying theories. Basically, it was a nice combination of concepts and methods. That said, Ken's lecture style is somewhat freewheeling, which is not necessarily a bad thing, but if you're not consistently paying attention, it's easy to get lost in one of his tangents. I hate to count this as a weakness, but it's a 9 a.m. in Watson, so maybe take that into consideration if you're not a morning person.",
    "The course could be more structured with more assignments and class involvement",
    "Strengths: the easy-going, but still in-depth nature of the class, professor Pugh was an absolute gem and amazing resource, always very responsive and excited to help out, offer suggestions on research and papers we were interested in, and was very illustrative when it came to explaining the science and social implications of the class content. Weaknesses: though I don't think this is a weakness and actually found this most endearing, the class was often a game of 'do we learn what we were supposed to today, or are we learning something completely different and unplanned', which is to say, while the class overall was well structured, the individual lessons were less organized. I found this to not be a big problem, but some might have an issue with class regularly starting and finishing a couple minutes late.",
    "Strengths: professor is insanely dedicated to the topic, well-taught, small class size, low stress Weaknesses: we often went over the time limit, early in the morning (but still worth it)",
    "The material is very interesting. I got to learn about reading from many different approaches: social, neuroscientific, cognitive, and linguistic. We were also given opportunities to apply our knowledge, with the midterm literature review and the final research grant proposal. Overall, I think the course is very well organized. I do think the lectures could have been a little better paced. We spent a lot of time on the fundamentals (which is wonderful), but had to rush through the latter parts of the semester.",
    "I like that it wasnt test heavy, and that the assignments mirrored actual grants and research",
    "Could be more organized: due dates on the syllabus and decided at the beginning of the semester and lectures being a little less jumpy.",
    "This class was taught very much as an introductory survey style lecture with pieces and bits of information; however, the assignments required mostly independent research-like work and it was at a fairly involved level, which I feel like I wasn't adequately prepared for. I wish the class had a narrower focus, as it probably would have helped with tying everything together in a more cohesive way",
    "Strengths: interesting lecture, great and flexible teacher Weaknesses: hard to grasp topics if you don't have experience in research and brains...",
    "I wish the class was better organized. The pacing felt kind of off; it was particularly slow in the beginning because Prof. Pugh loves tangents, which are always interesting, if numerous. The content was fascinating, though, and the assignments were never cumbersome. I got the sense that Prof. Pugh really just wanted us to learn how to be good researchers if we were ever going to think about doing research in the field, which was really nice. There was really good feedback all along the way."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "Yes! The material is super interesting and Ken is great. Office hours are also super helpful, and the final paper is a grant proposal for a research study (which you can actually carry out in his lab if you're up to it and it's not too complicated, so that's very cool!). It was different (in a good way) from other STEM courses I've taken. Especially if you're looking to get involved in neuroscience or linguistics research, this course would be a great place to start.",
    "I've been recommending this class to people since the very first lecture I attended. I believe it's one of Yale's \"hidden gems\", and everyone should at least shop it.",
    "I would! I'd suggest that they have some interest in linguistics or the mind, as well as a little bit of background (i.e taken intro cogsci, ling, or even psych). We did a lot of deep dives, so you're not just meaninglessly memorizing facts or concepts. You're genuinely learning\/internalizing everything without realizing it.",
    "I took this course just as a fun class and to fulfill my social science credit. But it surpassed my expectations and actually made me think if I want to further pursue neuroscience. The course load is on the lighter side, but the course itself has been very engaging. Every single lecture has been fascinating, informative, and thought-provoking. I never got a sense that lecture was boring, even during times when Prof. Pugh repeated himself a lot. Speaking of Prof. Pugh, hes a great professor. He repeats things a lot, but thats because he really tries to drill the big ideas into us at the end, it all ties together and makes sense. Hes very willing to meet up with you and spend hours talking about your midterm and final projects. I think hes a gem that not a lot of people know about. Lastly, this course focuses heavily on dyslexia. Dyslexia never really crossed my mind before taking this course, but now I understand why its such a convoluted social issue that affects so many talented youth. I now understand that dyslexia research is a way to attain social justice. For me, this class restored my faith in science that it can do social good and that its not just done for the intellectual satisfaction (which is of course important, but its so important in todays world that we do meaningful work that improves lives).",
    "If Prof. Pugh revamps his content into something linear or more structure, sure. Otherwise, it was just one big ramble.",
    "Absolutely, great class with unique material",
    "Absolutely. You have to be interested in the content, but if you are, you'll love the course. Professor Pugh is really nice and extremely knowledgeable and influential in the field, but he does sometimes ramble, get off topic, or repeat material, so if you have a low tolerance for that this course may be less enjoyable.",
    "Yes if you have prior experience with research and brains No if not",
    "I would totally recommend this course! Prof. Pugh is a great guy who is worth knowing. He is a passionate instructor who really cares about what he's teaching and who he's teaching it to. It was a relatively chill class that expanded my interests in ways I was not expecting. Works really well with other language\/neuro classes."
