    "It's unfortunate that this class develops the intro micro concepts mathematically and not conceptually at all. Be aware of what you are signing up for -- applied math. That said, Samuelson's a good guy.",
    "pretty good class. emphasis on problem solving. psets are tough (tricky).",
    "What you'd expect. Take it if you must.",
    "Econ 121 is a class in intermediate economics that covers some interesting topics. The curve is very generous, but everyone does so badly that it doesn't really matter at times. It tends to have a B average it seems. But don't be disheartened because I'm a freshman (I took the APs) and I'm doing fine in the class.",
    "Never take this class unless you plan on majoring in economics or a connected major. The class is very hard and not worth taking otherwise. The workload is manageable but the tests are extremely difficult. If you are a first semester freshman like myself, I would especially not recommend taking this class; you will be in over your head from the first day.",
    "DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS UNLESS YOU HAVE TO. And to you dear freshmen, think twice. I know it feels like you can do it at first, and the first midterm is a piece of cake. But beware. And when you are crying over the 13 hour psets and the horrific grades, just know that you HAVE BEEN WARNED. The lectures are slightly painful but that is just not the problem with it. The material is HARD TOUGH TERRIBLE. Sophomores probably have to take it, but I would advice doing it in the spring. Juniors, good luck.",
    "I would not recommend the class for the previously stated reasons.",
    "Useful tool to understand microeconomics behavior. Dull if you're not interested in it, or in math modeling.",
    "This course is simple multivariable calculus thinly disguised as economics. Take at your own risk.",
    "Take it if you're going to major in econ (because you have to!). I probably wouldn't recommend it for a non-major because the concepts don't really seem to connect to reality as much as introductory economics did.",
    "This is the first econ course I've taken at Yale (after having taken AP in high school) so I'm not sure how it compares to other econ classes. It's a tough course, especially when you get to firms in the last 1\/3 of the semester. It's also fairly math-heavy, though the math isn't hard (lots of optimization problems). I feel like a lot of the class is in it just because they have to be there for their major, but Professor Samuelson is quite good and he tries to keep the class interesting. The CRUCIAL part of this class is the problem sets. Not for your grade, but for your understanding of the material. The lectures teach you how to solve a problem in theory and only in the problem sets do you put that theory to work and understand what you've learned.",
    "It is a very math heavy course, and you need to keep up with the work or you will be in trouble. The test are hard, but Samuelson is really helpful during office hours, and his lectures are really good so if you put in the work you can keep up ok.",
    "ONLY TAKE THIS CLASS IF YOU'RE AN ECON MAJOR. seriously- you will regret if after the first problem set. problem sets are HARD and you need to find a study group, so it's good to take this class with friends. i also feel like i didn't learn much because the lectures are so broad and easy to understand conceptually, but problem sets are so specific.",
    "It's a great class, and Professor Samuelson is a great lecturer - but really tough so only take it if you have to.",
    "I don't know why you're even reading the reviews. Everyone knows this class is hard. Everyone knows econ majors have to take it. It's difficult and the problem sets can drive you insane. My friends with Bergemann had a much easier time. Larry is a good teacher and very understanding, but I wish he gave us more examples in class as opposed to purely notational derivations. Also, the composition of this class is like 50% asian, at least. Good luck beating that curve.",
    "It is very difficult. You move very fast and the book doesn't help for reference.",
    "A lot better than I was expecting. Samuelson managed to keep me awake most of the 9 AM classes, which is saying a lot. This class sin't easy, and is a lot different from Intro Micro. It's basically an optimization class with applications. The topics covered are overall really interesting. Problem sets take a while. Exams are tough. But the curve is really nice. Take it if you're a math person, or if you have to.",
    "1. Take this class2. It makes you think critically. Really, it constantly challenges you, whatever math\/econ background you have. Very intellectually engaging\/enreaching experience it was. You don't necessarily learn new concepts compared to intro micro, but it's more like proving each idea or mathematically showing each idea.3. Professor : Professor Samuelson was amazing. Always helpful when asking questions, trying his best to make students understand concepts, not just trying to just pass on knowledge.4. Workload : P-sets take quite a lot of time. Not necessarily busy work, but it really forces you to think critically, which I enjoyed a lot. Also, make sure you have other people to work on P-sets with. Or at least check answers with them and go over. Group work is the key to the success in this class.5. TA: I had Tae. He was amazingly helpful. Make sure you don't miss any sections. Sections are great supplements to the lectures to understand materials.6. Midterms\/Finals - first one was easy and had high average. Second one, it gets really tough. Final, I have yet to take, but past years' finals were hard as well.",
    "Take it only if its for your major. Seriously.",
    "If you have to take it, you have to take it. If not, don't.",
    "With a course this difficult and fundamentally similar (in material) to intro micro, I would advise those not in the major to stay away. Problem sets are long ordeals, and exams are nightmares. If you're in the major, I suspect in the end you'll be glad you took it with Samuelson, who really is a pleasure to learn from.",
    "It's a class that you should only take if it is required for your major. You're not going to learn any shocking material from the class. Honestly, you're going to just spend Sundays doing algebra. Samuelson is an OK professor. The tests can be weird, and they are somewhat hard to study for. My advice is to review the problem sets.",
    "good explanation of the mathematical applications of the concepts of intro micro, take it with Samuelson he is a good lecturer: clear, interesting, fair midterms and final, challenging material but the curve will save your grade, useful applications",
    "Yes, it gives one a good foundation in Calculus-based microeconomics.",
    "Unfortunately, this is a required class, so a lot of people take it because of that. At the same time, it isn't that bad. Make sure you have a good TA.",
    "If you're an economics major, you just have to deal with it or wait for another professor. More math-intensive than expected, problem sets take hours, midterm materials don't necessary actually show up in class, and the lectures aren't great. Be prepared to spend a lot of time on this class. And get a good TA if you want to understand what's going on in the problem sets, because he won't explain it during lecture.",
    "Take it if you have to. Its interesting but I think it gets pretty hard and arduous near the end. Taking it credit D if you think you might be interested in the material but don't need to take it. Get your math skills ready.",
    "Basically intro micro with calculus and additional mathematical techniques. The course emphasized learning the techniques. I would recommend to econ majors and people who enjoy math. As a warning - psets take a looong time.",
    "It's required...it could be much better. So unless you have to take it, I wouldn't recommend taking it until it gets better. If you want to learn about economics for fun, start listening to podcasts like Planet Money from NPR. It'll make your life simpler than taking this course.",
    "This course is a quick introduction to the principles of microeconomics from a quantitative standpoint. If you're comfortable with math, it will be great. If not, you'll struggle.The material is interesting and applicable.The psets are long.There's a lot of practice material for the exams.Prof Samuelson lectures well and answers questions. The TF's for mycourse weren't great, though.",
    "Only take it if you have to, no matter what.",
    "Only if you need to. Seriously.",
    "It's \"the hard core econ class\" and I'm happy to have it over so I can move onto some other higher level economics classes. The final went well for me (I think) so I feel ok about the class, even though during the class I was kind of miserable.",
    "Take it if you have to or are really, really interested in the subject AND are good with QRs.",
    "I would recommend taking this class over the intermediate econ in the spring because with Samuelson you at least learn something. He has been teaching this class for a long time, and really knows what he's saying. I don't think the same can be said for the spring term professor. It's really hard, but you will feel like you know a substantial amount of economics after the course.",
    "If you're an econ major, you;re probably are going to take this class. And, it's something that you're just going to have to get through. It's a very, very difficult class. The problem sets took me about eight to ten hours to complete on average. There were two at the end that took me longer, with the seventh taking me around 16 hours to finish. Just a note: the problem sets get much, much harder. The algebra in this course is extremely dense, and it can be very frustrating to struggle with algebra rather than economic concepts. I would suggest going to section, starting the problem sets early, and going to office hours, too. Samuelson is actually a really nice guy. When studying for tests, review your notes, the lecture slides, go to the review sessions, do the problem sets over, and most important, study and know how to do the practice tests. If you do all of that, you should dofine. Practice tests were extremely helpful for me. Upon reflecting on the course, I realize that I learned a lot and that I appreciate the experience. It was, however, one of those courses that I struggled through and asked myself why I decided to take it every single Sunday, the night before the long problem set was due.",
    "Only if you need to take it to fulfill the Economics major requirement.",
    "Good class. Prof. Samuelson is a great lecturer; the class was very math-based (which makes understanding econ concepts easier) and the workload wasn't too terrible.",
    "Take it only if you are considering econ as a major.",
    "Not as difficult as advertised. Though it will require significant effort to do well, Samuelson makes this as reasonable a class as you will find. My only hesitation is that I found the exams to be a tad on the unreasonable side, considering they went beyond any of the material we had seen elsewhere.",
    "Econ 121 is a course that you have to do for you major, but it is actually very interesting. It's fun to work on the problem sets, and you can do well in the course if you spend time reviewing the lectures.",
    "I took it for a CR because I needed it for my major. Wasn't as bad as the previous reviews have made it out to be. The curve is fairly generous - the class is half B's and half A's. Psets can be tough and time-consuming, but they're also graded fairly generously.",
    "I would recommend the class, but be prepared to think hard.",
    "ECON 121 is basically an applied multivariable calculus course. You learn no new concepts compared to intro micro, but you analyze them very differently and come to all conclusions through math. Samuelson says that multivariable isn't required, but I would find the class a lot harder if I had nottaken math 120 previously. Lecture attendance is important as Samuelson will often expand on his notes quite a bit.",
    "This class is a more theoretical, more math-intensive version of intro micro. It helps to be good at math. I'm not sure \"recommending\" this course is really worth anything, since pretty much everyone in it is taking it because they have to...and beware, it can get tedious. The TAs were terrible, but the workload was manageable: weekly problem sets, 2 midterms, and a final. Professor Samuelson is enthusiastic and energetic.",
    "It's a good class overall. However, I wouldn't take it unless you're strongly considering being an econ major because it's basically an applied math class. There's no new concepts that you won't get from intro micro and it is a significantly harder class.",
    "It's difficult but worth it.",
    "Intermediate Microeconomics applies calculus to the concepts undertaken in Introductory Microeconomics. The treatment of economic intuition is much weaker in this class than in the former (indeed, such intuition is largely assumed). The calculus methods are modest in difficulty and repetitive in application. Thus, for a student just beginning economics, the course may seem too difficult, given the lack of explanation on economic concepts. But for a student already into his or her third economics course, the course may seem too easy, a simple rote application of calculus to existing knowledge. This is not to understate the difficulty of the class, however. While a good grade seems readily attainable, the class requires persistent preparation over the course of the semester. Cramming just won't suffice. Some of the problem sets take as many as 10 hours even for the well-prepared. In this regard, the strength of your teaching fellow will do much for the strength of the class on the whole. Be sure to shop as many sections as possible before electing to enroll in one. Take this class if you are an economics major. It will not radically improve your understanding of economics otherwise, and a pure math course would probably be more challenging and productive for improving technical skills if this is your chief concern. Samuelson is a fabulous teacher who is approachable in and outside of class. If you have concerns about the class, speak with him prior to its beginning and he will give you straightforward advice.",
    "Algebraically wearying (\"mathematically rigorous\"), yet offers only a handful of conceptual insights that extend beyond those available in Berry\u0092s Intro lecture. For the dedicated student of economics only. If you\u0092re going to take it, make sure you have a group to slog through the problem sets with; you\u0092ll be miserable if you try to do them yourself the night before they\u0092re due.",
    "Surprisingly fulfilling course (in that I felt that I did learn a lot), and the right amount of work, in my opinion. It wasn't simple, but you didn't spend hours poring over the work.",
    "Economics 121 was a great class to learn how the economic principles learned about in previous microeconomics classes could be quantified and represented in models using calculus. I would definitely recommend this class to a fellow student because it taught an incredible wealth of information and techniques.",
    "it's a requirement.. prof. samuelson is probably the best to take the course with! be aware that psets are long and it's at 9 am"
