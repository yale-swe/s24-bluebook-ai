   "comments": [
    "Good class! I found the workload light and pleasing: read 3-4 papers per week, then do the group quiz on Wednesdays.Quite a few of the lecturers could have been better, but I enjoyed Steitz and Hosstracher exceedingly!",
    "take it!!!",
    "I really enjoyed this course and felt that my ability to read papers was drastically improved. Overall, this course reinforces previously learned material. However, students are expected to think about the material in more scientific way. For instance, identifying experiment rationales and analyzing data was very routine and expected. The class can be very stressful on the days before the class discussions, but overall the workload was very reasonable. There are too many professors to make the course cohesive, but none of them are bad. Each week's topic (a new disease) was interesting. The final paper was incredibly fun to write though requires quite a bit of thinking and planning.",
    "Quite worth taking. It's a cross between lecture and directed reading. Each week there's a lecture by one of a handful of professors about the molecular basis of a disease. Then you are asked to read a number of papers about it, including reviews and research articles. The difficulty level varies a fair bit among the lecturers. At the end you get to write a research proposal to study a disease of your choice. On the whole, it's a fun class that makes you realize just how little we know about biology.",
    "It is a very straightforward class, with a new topic each week. Nothing is cumulative, allowing you to start fresh after each week. Reading the papers can be troublesome some weeks, but overall it was a good experience.",
    "This is a great course that contextualized the concepts we learned in MB&B 300 and introduced us to reading and conceptualizing scientific articles.",
    "MB&B 449 is a great course to take after some extensive lab experience and after having completed all of the basic science requirements required to move onto upper level seminars. You will encounter brilliant students in your class which will enrich the learning environment immensely. This is only made all the more amazing by the fact that you will be receiving lectures from professors that are world-class researchers in their respective fields.",
    "I would heartily recommend this course.",
    "An absolutely outstanding class. It's very much a \"basic science\" course in that the molecular biology and biochemistry are the focus of papers and questions, but their relevance to human disease makes the class so much more interesting than comparable classes. The professors are a strength in the class, and if the same TA's do the class again, the class is a real joy.",
    "MB&B449a is a (fairly) small science paper-reading class with a number of rotating faculty speakers. On Mondays, we received a lecture on a particular disease or medical topic, and on Wednesday, we answered questions in groups for a grade on content and understanding of 4-6 science papers that are actively investigating the topic on a molecular level. Although I was a bit disappointed by the number of people in the course, I learned a great deal about reading science papers and current experimental techniques. This course is certainly accessible to anyone with a decent biology background, but certain students in the class were absolutely stellar in their knowledge of biology and various techniques, so those with less experience should plan on working particularly hard. The faculty are excellent, and the teaching assistants for the class were some of the best that I have ever had. Although the class was not particularly easy for me, the amount of work is certainly manageable, and the absence of content based midterms or finals certainly helps to emphasize critical, scientifically based thinking. This course is highly recommended to anyone interested in the application of modern molecular biology to the current medical and research problems.",
    "MB&B 449 is a great course and completely different from any other science class I've taken. The workload is pretty light until the final paper, learn about a disease one day, read a couple papers, and then have small group discussions on the other class day. The people in the class really smart and it's actually pretty fun to do \"scientific problem-solving\" together each week. The final paper is quite difficult and requires you learn a ton about a current disease but it's a great exercise in coming up with a scientific question and figuring out how to answer it. Overall a great senior class and a great way to apply everything you've learned in science lecture classes the past 3 years.",
    "Yes, take it.This is a great course all around. Joan does an incredible job with her lectures and organizing the course. Some lecturers are a little less engaging than others, but all of them are speaking about their expertise, are clearly really knowledgeable, and are receptive to questions. Your critical reading skills will improve immensely, and the small-group discussions are great for bouncing ideas off one another. There is a final paper where you pick a disease and cover it in depth, proposing future research to be pursued, and it is a great way to cap off the course. This course would be difficult without a basic familiarity with experimental methods, so be warned. That said, this is an awesome course for any science major with interest in medicine. I'm sad it isn't two semesters (and so is most of the class), because it is one of my favorite courses at Yale.",
    "I would recommend this class. Its not too much reading and it is very informative.",
    "Weekly lectures by a number of different professors delve into the biochemical nature of a disease that has been studied on a basic science level, as well as the physiological manifestations and therapeutic interventions available\/being explored. Papers are provided to supplement the lecture, and to be used as a basis for discussion questions to be completed in the next class by groups of 3-4 students. The main project is a final research proposal paper due near the end of the semester, based on a disease of the student's choosing. This final paper is a wonderful learning experience, as a review of many papers about the disease's molecular nature is used to construct a number of experiments to answer some of the most fundamental questions in the field.I would absolutely offer the course to students who have a biochemical background of some sort, as many of the topics delve into the biochemical mechanisms of the diseases. I found my investment in the course very fulfilling; as such, it was slightly bittersweet to propose experiments I couldn't actually get to do, though they were exciting to think about.",
    "Definitely one of the more interesting MBB courses. Take it to study with Joan Steitz, if nothing else.",
    "This is the class that makes all of the prerequisites worthwhile. You get to learn how to apply all the basic biochemistry knowledge you've accrued over your time at Yale. Wonderful professors, wonderful TAs, an incredibly reasonable workload - nothing negative to say here. This class teaches you how to think like a scientist.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. It is very well taught and extremely interesting.",
    "You read papers every week about a disease. Some of them can be hard to grasp, but you'll get the hang of it. The discussion sections can be a little brutal, but make sure you do the reading. And while it says the class is 1 hr, 15 min,you'll probably spend more time on discussion days, so be aware of that. The class and the reading material is pretty interesting. I would recommend it but it's not an easy grade."
