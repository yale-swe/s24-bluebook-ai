   "comments": [
    "This is a great class. Lots of reading that is required every week for the class but the workload other than that is fairly light. Just two reading responses and a final paper. The material is very interesting and the class discussions are great. I would recommend this course.",
    "Take it. Awesome instructor.",
    "Overall, a very solid seminar, not the best I have taken at Yale, but very good. The workload is fairly light-- interesting reading that can be skimmed if necessary, manageable papers, and a final paper.I feel like I came out of this seminar with a strong grasp of how to critically examine social science studies (research methods is a surprisingly interesting theme of the course) and an overview of the critical texts in security studies.I think that you will get out of this course what you put in. The assignments are really open and broad, for better or for worse. I feel like I got way more out of the course because I put a ton of effort into my final paper and got really excited about the subject.",
    "I would highly recommend this class",
    "Topics: International Security is a great introduction to the key literature in the field of International Studies on both inter- and intrastate war. Every week is a different topic, such as the causes of civilian victimization or theories of counterinsurgency. Professor Lyall is a great seminar leader and every session was very engaging. The workload is rather reasonable and with a good topic the final paper can be fun. It is a great class for anyone interested in an overview of the field of International Security.",
    "Good survey of everything falling within security studies. Dynamic professor that is incredibly helpful. You will feel like you've accomplished something when you're done with the class.",
    "INTS260 provides a great overview of contemporary topics in international security (basically what it's title says). This means you learn about interstate and intrastate warfare, how wars start and how they are conducted, and a range of specific topics (air power, terrorism, etc.) that are at the forefront of the study of war in political science. A great class for poli sci majors or people who don't have much experience in the field but are interested in learning what it's about.",
    "This is a small seminar that goes into great depth on several different topics in international security. It is based mainly on political science research on the different topics and really tries to engage you in thinking about the study of security-- its benefits and pitfalls. The final paper puts everything together by allowing you to think about research you might do in the field and how you might go about it. It is a great way to learn about how we study war and what those studies mean.",
    "Topics in International Security is a great introduction seminar to a lot of issues prevalent in the current times regarding warfare. The course will probably not be taught in the same manner in the future, since it'll probably be an introductory lecture for Global Affairs. Jason Lyall is a great professor, not only because he is so well informed on absolutely everything to do with the material, but also because he is extremely approachable and clearly passionate about his teaching and his work. It's great to be in a class with a professor that has extensive field work as well.",
    "Take it.",
    "Rigorous, be prepared to do the work or you will pay the consequences.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course and this instructor. The material was very fascinating and the professor helped us see the strengths and weaknesses in every piece while bringing plenty of enthusiasm and knowledge to the table. A great class.",
    "yes, if you're interested in research on these issues. don't go in there as a policy wonk, go in with an eye towards research design and learning about the issues as well as how social science research works."
