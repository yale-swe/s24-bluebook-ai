    "An overview of grammatical structures, case endings, and basic vocabulary. I would not recommend the class to fellow students, unless they are completely committed to learning the language.",
    "I would recommend it if you have a reason to learn Arabic. If you wish to learn conversational arabic relatively quick, then this is not the class for you.",
    "Absolutely not. The classroom environment was sterile, detached from the joys of learning a language. There's no life, only cold cold grammar. Routine, little imagination. No soul in the Arabic Department at Yale. A very claustrophobic classroom. Not a single one of us enjoyed the experience. Little creativity. Pure stress, no imagination. Nope, not this one! Not for me, at least.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course if a fellow student were interested in learning Arabic. The teaching techniques and course structure are very effective for language acquisition.",
    "This course requires extensive, daily effort. It cannot be taken casually and necessitates commitment. Students should be careful never to fall behind. I would recommend this course to students very interested in Arabic language and culture, but not to students with a passing interest.",
    "I would recommend Arabic 110 but only if they are committed to learning the arabic language because the work load is heavy.",
    "Great intensive language program! Only for those who are motivated and ready to work a lot for it."
