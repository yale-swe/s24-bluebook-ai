    "This is NOT a language course. This is a literature course on primarily old German plays, taught in German. If you enjoy these, or if your German is in such a level that you can effectively read, write, and speak about abstract ideas, metaphors, symbolisms, then take it. If you are taking this course to improve your german communication skills, but dislike literature written more than 50 years ago, then by all means avoid it.",
    "This course focuses on improving reading and writing skills primarily, but it doesn't move too quickly although you learn to read more efficiently. The tests were challenging because they were very long, but there were many of them and they seemed to be graded fairly.",
    "The tests are focused mainly on the readings, so you don't have to worry a lot about grammar exercises. If your German is on a fairly good level, then this course will be a fun and easy one."
