    "I highly recommend Painting Basics!! I had some painting experience in high school, and I felt that most of the students had a little bit of experience, but don't be deterred from the class even if you've painted before because it's a great class for easing back into painting if you haven't painted in a while. You have one painting due each week, and you can go into the studio over the weekend to complete it. It's a very well-paced class, not stressful and definitely relaxing. Take the class with Professor Faruqee!",
    "ART 130 is an incredible class if you have ever had any interest in learning to paint, even if you have doubts about your art abilities or have been afraid to take a college art class before. Anoka is an incredible art teacher and with her instruction, and if you put effort into the work of the class, you will grow as a painter more than you could have expected. While it is not required, I would recommend taking Basic Drawing before taking this class as it is good to have a drawing foundation before going into painting.",
    "Take it.",
    "Make me start to love painting and I will continue the journey."
