    "Take this class if you're actually interested in autism.",
    "A fantastic course for anyone interested in autism. This course is really what all seminars should be-- a series of interesting lectures from authorities in respective areas of the field combined with a useful professional experience working with autistic individuals in an educational or group-home setting. The only work is a 10-15 page paper at the end of the course with minimal guidelines aside from being on the topic of autism. If you have an inkling of interest in ASD, check out the class. I can't recommend it enough. (Disclaimer: I am a psych major interested in autism already)",
    "If you're willing to put the time in for the practicum, it's hugely rewarding.",
    "Exactly what the syllabus and course description says.",
    "Interesting overview of the current autism research. Sometimes difficult to grasp the lectures.",
    "Good if you are interested in Autism. However, not much emphasis on memorization of material, more about just listening to experts in the field.",
    "A very unique class, the focus is definitely on the practicum volunteering over standard coursework. You will definitely learn about autism and come out with a deeper perspective on the disorder, education, and psych treatment.",
    "I'm REALLY glad I took this class Credit\/D - otherwise, it would have been a ton of independent study just to understand enough to write the paper at the end of the class. Also, your entire grade is based on attendance and the final paper (and a tiny bit on \"participation,\" which was nonexistent because it was all lecture time, and the practicum reflection), so that was totally stressful during finals period. The practicum was AWESOME though, best part of the class. The rest was lectures by a different expert each week, which was completely disconnected and ineffective in terms of actually teaching the material. Would've preferred tests and concrete structure to the class."
