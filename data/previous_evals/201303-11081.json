    "Standard Yale Spanish class. Work is pretty hard and there is a lot of it, but you do learn a significant amount.",
    "Oscar was by far the best spanish teacher I had at Yale. Really fun.",
    "Advanced Spanish class that involves grammar, reading stories, watching movies, and learning about the culture. I would recommend it! It helped me improve my communication skills.",
    "Mix of advanced grammar and diverse culture\/political studies. Mix of projects, presentations, and homework. Tests a bit long, but fair. Fun class with Oscar.",
    "If you have to take it, try to get a good professor. Otherwise, I wouldn't.",
    "I would recommend taking it with Oscar if you have to take the course. As for just taking it for fun, no, don't do that to yourself.",
    "It's good for the language requirement.",
    "I feel that Spanish 140 improved both by grammar and my ability to converse. You have to be prepared to have some kind of assessment (a quiz, a test, a debate, or a presentation) nearly every week, but because there are so many assessments, each one counts for a smaller percentage of one's grade and is less stressful than assessments for other classes."
