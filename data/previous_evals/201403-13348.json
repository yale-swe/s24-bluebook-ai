    "yes, Yes, YES. Please take this course--you will not be disappointed.",
    "I'd recommend this, in large part bc of Prof. Eller. As an introduction, this worked well in stirring up interest in other courses and topics of Latin American or historical study.",
    "Good survey of all Latin American history. Moves fast and covers large array of topics, places, and times. Do the readings or you'll miss out on important info. Take a class with Prof Eller please!",
    "A good introduction to an interesting, often overlooked, region.",
    "This is a very good first look at Latin American history, politics, and culture. It moves by zooming in on major events and trends -- you won't have a timeline of everything that happened in Latin America by the end, but you'll know a lot about specific time periods in specific countries. The syllabus and lectures emphasize race, class, and gender, which I really appreciated. Professor Eller is so extremely knowledgeable about this region and so attentive to students' questions and comments - she's a very good lecturer. My criticism about this class is that it can be disorganized at times because it tries to cover so much material in such a short time. It can feel like you're zooming in on one aspect of a historical event without knowing the basic timeline of that event, or, conversely, that you're zoomed out to the point where it makes no sense - for example, we covered all the independence movements in a week. That said, I learned so much from this class and got really interested in the region, and I'd definitely recommend it.",
    "A nice overview of Dominican, Cuban, and Haitian history. While it's called \"Intro LA History,\" those are the countries that professor Eller actually focuses on (with reason, it's her specialty). Professor Eller is super enthusiastic, very knowledgeable, and very helpful (go to her office hours). The class needs more focus: often, we would be overwhelmed by how much data she was throwing at us and as a result, it was hard to get a real cohesive sense of what was happening. The class goes back and forth between being a course of Carribean history and a course of macroscopic trends in LA history. Both sides of the class, however, are interesting and professor Eller is really quite cool. The class is pretty low-key too. If you are looking to take this class to \"know everything about LA,\" then be a LA Studies major. If you are looking to learn a few things about the Carribean and a few basic trends in the region, then maybe this is a good choice. Definitely take a course with Eller; maybe take one that's more specific though.",
    "At the beginning of the course, the information may seem too specific and completely irrelevant to the topic at hand. BUT if you stick with the course it will be a great basis for an important field of study. A lot of focus on Caribbean studies (Haitian revolution), because of professor Eller's expertise in that area. The readings are really interesting. The lectures are mixed, but it gets better as you get more modern (the class moves chronologically from colonial periods to present day financial crises)."
