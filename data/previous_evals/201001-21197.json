    "I would tell someone that ARBC120 takes up about 60% of my study time on weeknights and about 20% of my weekend study time. This is not proportionate when compared to the rest of my coursework. Some students will have an easier time of it, but some may find it more difficult. With that being recognized, I would caution against students taking ARBC at this time. I would say that if you are confident in your ability to rapidly absorb information, then go for it. At the same time, if you anticipate having trouble picking up the language then it may not be wise to take. It is simply too intense.",
    "A difficult and demanding class, but, if you are prepared to work extremely hard, you will learn a ton of Arabic. Make sure you have sufficient time to devote to the course, and try to find ways to supplement all the grammar you will learn with activities that will give you extra practice listening and speaking. But, if you can devote the time and energy necessary, it is well worth it.",
    "I would recommend Arabic if they want to learn arabic, but not until the course is better organized.",
    "I would recommend this course to a fellow student interested in learning how to read and write Arabic."
