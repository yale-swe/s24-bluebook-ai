   "comments": [
    "Its a brief introduction to conservation equations, and touches on important baseline concepts to the three main fields of transport, mass, momentum, and energy. The content was interesting at times, but the weekly frustration from the problem sets took away from any 'enjoyment' of the course.",
    "This class was a continuation of fluid mechanics and mass and heat transport from undergraduate studies. It was a good, intellectual continuation of these topics, but I would not recommend the class to anyone without a specific interest in the topics.",
    "I would tell another student that this course is extremely challenging and difficult to keep pace with. I feel as though I have improved my understanding of the problems we studied, but I felt overwhelmed by the material throughout the entirety of the course.",
    "No. Its very hard.",
    "It is a good but tough course. The course is theoretical and helps in understanding solution to some of the real life problems. But as it is tough it will require lot of input from the student side."

   "comments": [
    "While this was only a minor component of the course, the analysis of various non-dimensional parameters is important to see which scales are dominating over others. The understanding of comparing two relevant time\/length\/process scales is useful for all disciplines.",
    "The course should be very useful for almost any research in chemical engineering",
    "I anticipate having an experimental-focused research experience during graduate school rather than a theoretical study. I believe this course helped me become more well versed in theoretical problem solving; however, I am not sure it will have a great significance to my future work.",
    "Gave me great tools to use to analyze problems.",
    "It really helped in understanding some of the basics which my undergrad transport phenomena could not."
