    "This class is only for WGSS majors, so I don't think this is much of a \"should or shouldn't you take it\" -- if you're a major, you have to take it. If you're not a major, you can't. However, for those majors reading this, it is actually a great course. It's a lot of fun to work so closely with your fellow WGSS majors and get to know their work, and the focus on presentations and public speaking is actually really helpful and relatively painless. It was definitely a good use of my time and kept me at least semi-focused on (thinking about) my senior essay.",
    "You'll learn how to do academic speaking, which is surprisingly rewarding at the end of the semester when you present to the WGSS department, and it'll motivate you to do some work on your senior essay first semester.It's a light workload, but I took that to mean I should be working on my senior essay outside of the context of the course.",
    "It's a seminar that meets twice a week where you practice academic presentations. It's pretty fun, relaxed, and interesting to see what other majors are researching.",
    "You have to take it if you're a WGSS major, but it's not like any other \"required\" course. Working with Maria will actually help you feel LESS stressed about your senior project, I promise.",
    "Definitely recommend (it's also required for the major, obviously, but you know - look forward to it!). Even though there's a slight possibility you will spend the entire semester whining to your friends about having to write speeches (they will tell you to shut up, and that they wished their major made them learn how to give academic talks), you will probably come out of the semester feeling incredibly grateful for this course. In addition to providing an opportunity to improve your presentation skills, it gives you another place to keep working on your senior essay in a low-key way. Often, the process of composing and presenting talks helped me think about the work I was doing with my advisor in new ways, and visa versa."
