    "Enjoyable class. You will not necessarily learn lot, but it is completely up to you. Flexibility on papers is a a bonus.",
    "Take it for Stern, and for the wonderful books the class gives you a chance to sink your teeth into. Be prepared for a bit of lecturing (though, to be quite honest, the professor's insights were wonderful--at times I wished the course had been a lecture instead of a seminar). Take it also if you enjoy pursuing long-term, self-directed projects; the professor and the structure of the course give you a lot of flexibility to explore and pursue a wide array of interests aside from what is taught. For the non-literature major who still enjoys reading Benjamin, Calvino and Cort\u00e1zar, this class was a godsend.",
    "This class was a highlight of my semester. The syllabus is delightful, and Professor Stern's discourse on it is wacky and brilliant. He does an excellent job connecting all the works to each other and to everything from math to music to graphic design. You may well assemble a list of hilarious Stern quotes. The workload is light and thoroughly enjoyable. The only drawback is that Professor Stern talks an awful lot for a seminar. I enjoyed listening to him, but I wish he'd done more to facilitate discussion. You basically need to shop it and see if you're into Professor Stern's weird perspective on life: if you think he's smart and hilarious in the first two classes, definitely take it.",
    "It's a literature course; expect to think against the grain and traditions of literature and to be analytically engaged with the text on many levels.",
    "Professor Stern is the most wonderful man I have ever met. It was a pleasure to spend time with him. He has wonderful insights about the world, and truly reinvigorates your love for literature. This is a class on appreciating the beauty of prose. I know you think you know how to do that already, but you are wrong. Especially if you've been studying prose\/lit for a long time. Go Professor Stern!! The best! Also of course probably the most wonderful reading list I've ever been subjected to.",
    "I would recommend this class to students who want to read the books on the syllabus and are otherwise not looking to put much into or get much out of a class.",
    "It's an applied lit theory class.",
    "Take it for the incredible reading list, and go to office hours. Sections can be slow, especially as the semester goes on, so decide during shopping if you'd be happy listening to Stern talk for most of class."
