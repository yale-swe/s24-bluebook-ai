   "comments": [
    "This class is a good french class. The readings are a good level and the movies are entertaining to watch. That said, it is a lot of work, about an hour each night. If you've got to do a language class and you know some french, it works.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. I took the class after placing into L3 on the placement test, but after the first few days I felt like I should have been in L4. On the whole, it was a lot of review for me, and it was a pretty easy class. However, you learn a lot, and it's a great way to solidify grammar.",
    "It's a very interesting french course because you do more than just study grammar or learn how to conjugate irregular verbs. The bulk of the course is taught through French films\/texts, which makes lessons easier to learn since they are attached to a story, and also makes it much more interesting than a typical foreign language class.",
    "I would recommend this class highly if you are ready to move beyond the typical French course and lame textbooks with uninteresting stories. This took my French to a new level and I loved the books we read and the films we watched!"
