   "comments": [
    "I would summarize it as a class on metazoan development that addresses in detail select aspects such as morphogenesis or left-right asymmetry from the single-cell state to organ development. I would highly recommend it to a fellow student, especially if they are working in a lab using a metazoan model organism.",
    "I will recommend the course to other students. Most of the instructors take a classic development approach with a bias towards genetics. It will be great if there is more of developmental cell biology in the course too.",
    "Overall the course provides a good snapshot of different fields in developmental genetics. The course certainly doesn't provide a comprehensive approach to the subject, but does a good job of representing current questions and research foci. I would recommend this class to other students since it is interesting, fun, and has a minimal time requirement.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to a fellow student. The course serves great for building some foundation to basic mechanism of development.",
    "MCDB presents current insight into some of the major topics and questions that interest developmental biologists and geneticist such as stem cells, neural development, hematopoietic development, limb development and the generation of asymmetry in an early embryo. Each week students read a recent paper of the professor's choice and submit a paper summary to the teaching fellow. The classes begin with an hour lecture by the presenting faculty and end with an hour discussion of the assigned paper led by the teaching fellow. Biweekly thought questions are assigned that delve into one's understanding of the material presented while asking the student to come up with future experimental plans. I would highly recommend this course to any student who is interested in studying any form of development.",
    "I felt that Gene 777 was really a very disconnected survey of many parts of development. I would recommend the course to students who want some background in many aspects of development, but not to those with experience or those who want to focus in a specific direction."

   "comments": [
    "This course gave me a tremendously expanded understanding of metazoan development from a cellular and molecular standpoint, building on the morphological understanding I had gained in undergraduate anatomy and physiology. Though I am not working with a metazoan model organism, in my research, the concepts discussed in terms of the paper discussions, such as appropriate experiments and controls to understand molecular processes, will still prove useful to me.",
    "I think the course gave me an overall perspective about developmental approaches but a little more flavor of developmental cell biology would have helped.",
    "This course helped further my thinking as a scientist. It presented interesting questions and topics and also introduced me to techniques commonly used in the fields of development and genetics. This course was also incredibly current and relevant to my research. I have left with many new ideas for experiments and data analysis.",
    "I think that it gave me an idea about what is studied in development, but did not offer very much relevant to my research, which was somewhat disappointing."
