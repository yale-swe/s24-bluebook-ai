    "It is a really exciting opportunity to get to know your camera, learn about yourself and what you're interested in photographing, see the incredible work that other people are doing, and have the opportunity to take a photograph all the way from conception, through photoshop, and then get to print it and have the final work. I would absolutely recommend taking this class. Although it takes up a lot of your time to make the photographs, I found that it gave me an excuse to go places that I wanted to be in anyway, but couldn'thave justified taking time off work to attend otherwise. It also gave me an excuse to look at people and find pictures in unlikely places that I wouldn't have been challenged to find in another context. It is an amazing class that everyone at Yale should take if possible.",
    "Digital Photography is the sort of class where you get out as much as you put in. Dru is very open to working with students one-on-one both inside and outside the classroom and offering her suggestions for areas for improvement. If you are looking forward to putting in the time to learn how to shoot manually with a DSLR with a professor who cares about your progress throughout the semester, then this class is for you.",
    "A fun beginner art class where you take and print pictures.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course. The course is demanding, but definitely worth it.",
    "Yes, it was really fun, great break from other work.",
    "It requires lots of time but it is definitely a class worth taking!!",
    "Lots of work but fun.",
    "I recommend this class",
    "I highly recommend this class to anyone interested in photography."
