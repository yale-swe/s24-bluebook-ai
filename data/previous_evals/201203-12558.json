    "Yes. It's an integral part of Calculus.",
    "Hard. Lots of work. Only take it if you have to. If you take BC Calc in high school, take 120\/ENAS 151.",
    "I would recommend it, but only if you need to take a calculus class, or have a desire to pursue higher mathematics. Otherwise, you'll be bored. Workload isn't bad, but tests are pretty killer, though the curve is nice",
    "A good math course with a workload and difficulty you would expect in a typical calculus class. Homework isn't too bad. Exams are harder, definitely should study.",
    "The math is what it is. I would recommend this class.",
    "Math 115 is a lot of work, so be prepared to do some learning on your own. However, the class is rewarding in the end, and is manageable.",
    "I would recommend the class because for many the class is required and Professor Rolf is an excellent professor. The class can be very challenging but if you read the textbook and seek help if you need it then it ahould be fine.",
    "It covers material very quickly, but overall is a worthwhile basic math course",
    "Not a bad class. Pretty similar to Calc BC",
    "Math 115 is a very challenging course. It is a continuation of elemental calculus, and I would recommend the course. However: I did not take an upper level calculus class in high school, such as calc BC, and I can say that I believe this negatively influenced my participation in math 115. I felt that I was at a disadvantage compared to many of the other students, who had already taken calc BC in high school. So I would offer this advice: beware of the curve! It can be very brutal.",
    "Hard.",
    "Math 115 with Professor Rolf was great. The material is, in fact, quite difficult and a lot of effort is required, but if you are at all interested in math this is a good course to take.",
    "Very difficult. Couldn't do any of my homework on my own.",
    "math 115 is for those who want to have a solid mathematical foundation and those who want to advance to higher mathematics and science courses",
    "This is a good class to take, as it challenges how you think about math and prepares you for other math\/quantitative reasoning classes."
