    "Definitely take this class if you can!! Going to Nicaragua with 5 other students, 2 TAs, and Prof Kim was an AMAZING experience - we struggled through obstacles together, learned a lot, accomplished so much, and had a blast throughout the entire course. It was an amazing learning experience because each student is in charge of his\/her own technical and non-technical task, so it's kind of like working in a small company. You get a lot of responsibility and have to take ownership over your own jobs, which can be stressful at times, but is totally worth it in the end when everything comes together. I learned so much about thinking on my feet and working together in a team, and by the end of the trip, we all got really close. Prof Kim and the TAs are all amazing human beings who really care about you personally and will do everything in their power to help you succeed. Being able to apply my engineering skills hands-on in a developing country has definitely been one of the highlights of Yale so far!",
    "Definitely take this class!",
    "This class was amazing. It was not only an opportunity to apply my engineering \"training\" but it really humanized the generally impersonal field of engineering. Prof. Kim is the most amazing and caring (and hilarious) prof you will have. HIGHLY HIGLY RECOMMEND.",
    "Don't be a fool. Don't miss your chance to take the actual BEST (it was actually ranked 4.0 on coursetable as of spring 2016) class with the BEST professor that Yale has to offer. This course is structured differently than any other course you've taken, and you will be challenged in new ways and will learn so much about so much more than just engineering (and as an added bonus, it is the only engineering course I've taken that teaches you practical skills). You'll spend the first half of the semester preparing for the spring break trip to Nicaragua, which is some of the most fun you will ever have in a single week of your life. After the trip, you'll prepare a final report and travel to a conference (we went to Atlanta) to present. Professor Kim is a true gem among all Yale faculty. He cares so much about his students and this course and its mission. He is constantly looking for ways to improve the course and to make his students have an even better experience. You'll eat with him so many times throughout the semester and he will always give you a bite of whatever he orders. He will teach you so much and provide you with so much life guidance, and sometimes he will decide that he'd rather have class at Go Greenly than in the CEID so he'll take you to Go Greenly and buy you smoothies. Take this class if you can. Take it even if you don't really want to. Take it even if it means you can't take some other class that you've been trying to get in to for three semesters because that other class is NOTHING compared to this one. Trust us.",
    "Please take this course. Traveling to another country and learning how to develop technology for communities requires a human touch and a lot of optimism. Some of the best inventions that will actually help people can be very intuitive if you actually get a chance to observe the space yourself and speak with people who are already working in their own communities. If you have ever felt like \"why am in this class? why am I in this major? what do I want to do with my life?\" I promise you that you will not feel this way in this class. This class will inspire you to continue your major and find work in something meaningful and impactful. This class will shape your yale career more than you realize.",
    "YES YES YES. This is the best class I have taken so far at Yale. It's truly one of a kind and I wish that more engineering majors at Yale would be able to have this opportunity. It's had a big impact on how I see my future as an engineer and what I hope to accomplish."
