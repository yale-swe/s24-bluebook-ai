    "Read literature relating to the undead, many are short stories from Slavic culture. I would absolutely recommend this to everyone.",
    "Take it if you want an interesting reading list. I'm not usually one for eastern literature but I found the class to be thought provoking and generally intriguing. It's a seminar, so discussion was mandatory in one's participation grade but Brunson made it easy to participate and accepted all ideas.",
    "Definitely recommend! Professor Brunson is awesome she is very skilled at leading seminar discussion and is just generally a cool and interesting person. The works you read for Living Dead are fantastic, and you get to complete a creative project at the end of the semester, which is really fun. I took this class Credit D because I was taking so many other humanities classes at the same time, but if you are able to actually do all of the reading, I'm sure you can get even more out of the class. In general, a must-take!",
    "Yes! So fun! Take it! If you've ever wanted to read about vampires and undead women and ghosts for class, take this.",
    "Absolutely take this class. Professor Brunson is absolutely amazing, the syllabus is wonderful, and the class discussions are thought-provoking and engaging.",
    "YES! Best class I've taken at Yale. Such fascinating and rich texts and Professor Brunson is amazing. If you have any interest in the Gothic at all, it's a fun and informative course.",
    "A one-of-a-kind survey primarily investigating 19th century horror and science fiction, based around the concept of the \"living dead\" in literature. I'd absolutely recommend the course, to Slavic Languages and Literatures majors looking for something out of the ordinary, to horror film buffs interested in the precursors to their favorite slasher\/gore flicks, to aspiring writers searching for that great new short story topic. It's really excellent.",
    "Really great class with an amazing reading list. Professor Brunson is engaged and knowledgable the subject, the grading is a bit rough though."
