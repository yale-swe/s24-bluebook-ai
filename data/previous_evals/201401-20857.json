   "comments": [
    "Stat 242 is a solid class, definitely not as good\/interesting as 241 was but it's useful for those who want to learn more about actually analyzing data.",
    "not a good class at all. lisha's accent is hard to understand. she doesn't make points clear in lecture. she just rambles on and on and writes too small and too much on board. the homework was also pretty obscure--not too big a surprise since the book is quite terrible too. don't take this unless you have to.",
    "It's a useful class, and not too challenging, so I'd recommend it. Lectures are dull, but the material isn't too difficult, and the problem sets and tests are fair.",
    "Solid course covering parameter estimation, hypothesis testing with one or more samples, and a bit of linear regression. The weakness of the course was that we spent too much time on the first topic, and then covered the remaining topics much more briskly. We could have covered more material if the timing had been better, but on the flip side there was less to study for the final.",
    "If you want to study higher level statistics, this class is basically necessary to get you off the ground. By itself it's not particularly inspiring, but you can certainly do go over some important topics and useful results, such as maximum likelihood estimation or the Neyman-Pearson testing paradigm. Be sure to go to lecture and take good notes, as that will be almost all you need for homework and doing well on tests. Professor Chen has a very nice policy of letting you bring in note pages into exams, which saves you from memorizing a lot of statistical facts and rather lets you focus on understanding how to apply concepts. Lecture is a bit dry, but worth it.",
    "Proofs about Statistics.",
    "Good class overall. Not a ton of work if you go to the TA sessions (although if you only go to the homework sessions it is difficult to learn the material well. Beware that it is a core course for lots of Stats grad students who generhave already taken it.",
    "This course moves slowly at first but devolves rather quickly and more abstractly after chapter 8. Be sure you can devote enough time to understand everything down pat solid conceptually by reading the textbook yourself. The instructor is also rather hard to understand and writes small so sit up front if you can.",
    "Introduction to parameter estimation, bayesian inference, hypothesis testing, multiple sample comparisons, and linear regression.",
    "Solid theoretical introduction to statistics, closely follows textbook but still challenging.",
    "I wish I could recommend stat 242 to another student because it should be a good course, but I can't because I really did not gain a greater understanding of the material -- instead I just have a fragmentary knowledge on how to solve different types of problems in stat. Take it if you really like this material and already have a good understanding of stat and need it for your major... otherwise not worth it."
