    "Small and intimate class. If you like the Korean language and culture, I recommend you to take the class.",
    "With Seungja Choi, this class is pretty easy, which was good but frustrating. We didn't really learn that many new grammar structures, and it felt sometimes like I was only going to class so that I wouldn't get 0's on all the vocab tests. That being said, I learned some new vocabulary, and the people in the class are usually pretty great. And having a lower workload class was definitely alleviating at times.",
    "For any interested in learning the language, it is a good platform to do so as the daily lessons ensure that you continuously practice the language, and there is quite a large emphasis on the speaking component.",
    "It seems a little daunting when you realize how many words you need to learn every day aside from learning the gramma, but learning both is absolutely doable."
