    "if you are already interested in britain then take this class. if you really have no prior knowledge of britain or the World War histories (or have a family connection to it) a lot of this class may seem dry and remote for large swathes of the discussion.Jay winter is a good lecturer but don't expect to be blown away--things can get a bit dry with him and you can feel somewhat coerced into a particular thesis by himthere is a lot of reading if you do all of it (i did most). you probably don't need to do as much reading as i did but if you do you will LEARN A TON (probably more than you want to). 30% of the reading is incredibly dull, 30% ok, 30% really interesting. definitely make sure you read the Paul Fussel book--really excellent!midterm assignment is good: read 2british novels and talk about them in a historic contextgrading is not super easy but if you put in some effort you should do wellmanageable amount of work for the class: 6 reading responses, midterm paper, final and class participation counts for quite a lot",
    "I would recommend it, but I would advise them to be careful when picking a TA.",
    "Take this class. Winter is a great lecturer and the subject is awfully interesting, particularly those interested in political history. Be prepared for a lot of reading though.",
    "explains the 20th century from another perspective. very interesting. highly recommended.",
    "If you love contemporary history, maybe. Otherwise, probably not. That said, the assignments weren't too bad, and it's a very good class to Cr\/D.",
    "Definitely, the TAs and the professor are great. Do all the readings though.",
    "Britain in the 20th Century is exactly what it sounds like, so if you'd like to read about the two world wars, decolonization, socialism, and British politics, you'll have a good time. It's a pretty good course from a very excellent lecturer (though I hear that his fall semester course is better). There is a lot of reading, and it can often be dense. Some readings are more rewarding than others, as in any course -- you'll get a lot more out of the course if you do the readings, and if you visit Prof. Winter during office hours, which he encourages. The workload generally isn't difficult to manage.",
    "I loved Professor Winter and the lectures, but the amount of reading and the two page homework reading responses make for a very heavy workload. The midterm, which is based on more outside reading of two novels and then writing a 10 book review, was very interesting, but itmade the final a little more daunting as it covered the entire semester. Overall, I would definitely recommend this class if you don't mind a fairly heavy workload.",
    "I would recommend it, but only if they have taken a course on British history before.",
    "Great class, 'easy' syllabus - a midterm essay, section, and final. Professor Winter's a dynamic and wonderful lecturer.",
    "If you like political, \"great man\" history, take this class. If you're looking for social or cultural history, you're not going to get it here!",
    "I would recommend History 253 if you're interested in British history (obviously) but if you're looking for a great Jay Winter course take Europe in the Age of Total War.",
    "If interested int he subject matter, take it, although I think Professor Winter's Total War class was much better.",
    "If you're looking for a quality analysis of 20th century British history, go for it.",
    "YES! tons of reading, you have to be interested in Britain, don't expect to get too many of the specifics from lecture, those are in the reading. Sit back and enjoy lecture.",
    "I loved this course, and would absolutely recommend it to other students who are willing to read a lot every week. Professor Winter is an amazing lecturer and I always looked forward to hearing his argument, but I will say that it is difficult to take notes. As my first history course here, it was inspirational, but untraditional. Take it!",
    "Don't take it. It has a ton of reading that you have to do, a really annoying paper, and you don't learn that much. Jay Winter gives a heavily politicized version of British History that can get very tedious and annoying to listen to.",
    "This is a great survey of 20th Century British history. Prof. Winter is a brilliant lecturer and really put thought into creating this course, and he gets great TA's. The midterm paper (a 10 page literature comparison paper) is a bit strange, but can be pretty interesting. Overall, a decent amount of work (6 2 page reading responses, 10 page midterm paper, final), but absolutely worth it.",
    "WInter is great. Take it.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to a fellow student- even if you think you're not interested in British History, definitely take this course. The lectures are great and the material is always interesting.",
    "Take this class if you are at all interested in modern British culture or history. It's the best.",
    "Be prepared for a huge amount of unnecessary work. Professor Winter is a great lecturer but it may not be worth the mountains of reading required for the class.",
    "Probably not. I am admittedly biased because I was hoping for more of a social or economic history. The politics of twentieth century britain, more specifically its charismatic leaders and the decline of the british empire, are interesting subjects. However, after the first 5 lectures, the course becomes a bit tedious; Winter repeats himself a lot, and some of his lectures ramble quite a bit.",
    "HIST 253 provides an overview of British history from 1900 to present. It includes political, economic, social and cultural history components, with perhaps a very slight emphasis on political history. I would strongly recommend the class to history majors or students interested in Britain. Professor Winter is fantastic and the class is incredibly interesting.",
    "Its reading can be overwhelming sometimes.",
    "History 253 is a great survey course of 20th Century Britain. Jay Winter is a fantastic lecturer. The reading load is pretty heavy but you only have to do reading responses about every other week so you can pick and choose what you really have time for. I would definitely recommend it.",
    "Jay Winter is an outstanding lecturer--I HIGHLY recommend any class with him.",
    "I would describe it using my answer in the first box, and advise others to take it... with their eyes open to the likely flaws."
