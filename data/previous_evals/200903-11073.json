   "comments": [
    "Yes, I would recommend this to another student. The weekly work is not particularly difficult and the opportunity to write a microhistory on a topic of my choice was very enjoyable.",
    "Absolutely -- it's a great way to experiment with a different mode of writing history.",
    "I would definitely recommend it, if just for the opportunity to work with Professor Wrightson (who is amazing) and to complete the final paper, which is a very rewarding experience.",
    "I would recommend history 602 01 to any student who was very interested in microhistory. I would also recommend it to anyone who had a document or document-base that he or she wanted an opportunity to work with in great depth. I would especially recommend it to anyone who worked in the pre-modern period.",
    "A very useful overview of an important historical subgenre, taught by a master. The first half of the seminar is a historiographical overview of the genre and a meditation on historical style; the second is a hands-on expedition into doing microhistory. Highly recommended.",
    "I would recommend this course to any student of history. This is a methodology that is useful in many fields and I learned a lot. I appreciated the time spent discussing the craft of writing history.",
    "I would definitely recommend it to another student, especially since it's useful for all disciplines.",
    "I would recommend this course. Learning to write microhistories is an important skill for historians and can provide students with new insights into certain historical periods and topics that more traditional monographs could not. It's also a fun course, with entertaining readings and the opportunity for very entertaining topics.",
    "This class is a great introduction to microhistorical research and the techniques involved in microhistorical writing. The readings are very interesting and the professor is very knowledgeable and helpful."

   "comments": [
    "I am used to working from broad topics and then having to choose a specific focus. Working from a very specific instant and using that to describe the broader picture was a fascinating exercise and frankly, one that I enjoyed much more than the traditional method of research and writing.",
    "I found the opportunity that it gave me to work on my topic almost uninterruptedly for several weeks to be extremely useful. We as graduate students don't generally have time to think about our writing style or what we want to do with any given paper. This was the first time that I had the opportunity to do both of these things, and I think it gave me some insight into what it would be like to work on my dissertation. In terms of the time that we spent presenting our work, I found it useful in some ways and less useful in others. I did get some useful insights, but the fact that we were not from the same (or even similar) historical fields limited our ability to engage with each other's arguments.",
    "Very, very helpful as an overview of the pluses and minuses of a historical style.",
    "I think that this course helped me a lot, because I picked a topic in the general area of what my dissertation will be. It also forced me to focus on my prose and narrative construction, which I too often neglect in other courses. I think I will look back on this course as having been extremely helpful for me.",
    "I feel that this course helped me acquire atremendously useful skill that will be invaluable in conducting future research."
