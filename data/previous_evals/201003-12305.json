   "comments": [
    "If a student doesn't have any background in programming, I wouldn't recommend the course. Otherwise, taking the class was a great experience and I'd do it over again if I had the chance.",
    "Don't take this class unless you do have some prior experience with computer programming and\/or probability. I really cannot stress this enough. Also, even if you do have experience, the problem sets will be extremely time-consuming. I would honestly only recommend this class if you were only taking 4 credits. Also, you should only take it if the TF is helpful, because otherwise the class will be very difficult. Python isn't that difficult, but the programs and algorithms are hard to understand.",
    "I'd definitely recommend it. You learn a lot. It's a fun and interesting class at the intersection of linguistics and CS, and it'll be a blast for someone interested in both of those subjects. As someone with prior programming experience, I had a lot of fun. WARNING: If you are unprepared for the programming segment, Gaja's teaching will not help you catch up. You'll need to put in a LOT of time on your own. (That said, even a little prior programming experience is enough to get you by. You just need the basics.)",
    "Do not take this class unless you have a lot of time on your hands, or you are a CS major. The problem sets are all programming, so if you don't have a background in python they take forever. The concepts are also very math-y and hard to grasp. I took this thinking it would be an interesting QR... Worst decision I've made since coming to Yale. If you do take it, become friends with Antonios ASAP. He is much more helpful than Gaja at explaining concepts and at helping with programs. On the bright side, the grading system is very fair. You have to really slack off to get below an A-.",
    "It's interesting, but it's tons of work -- especially if you haven't taken any prior programming or linguistics classes. Take it if you're interested *and* if you have plenty of time to delegate to this class alone.",
    "This is an intense introduction to the application of high-level information theory and computer science to basic (read BASIC) linguistic tasks. If you already have a strong background in CS then this course should be fascinating and provide a glimpse into what linguistics is all about. If you are anyone else, AVOID AVOID AVOID.",
    "Be aware that this is a very difficult course if you've never programmed before and a fairly stress-free one if you have. If you fall in the first camp, this can be frustrating. The linguistics component of the course is fun and interesting, however. Gaja is nice and her lectures are good--clear, thorough, and posted online.",
    "If you have a very quantitative mind or have a good grasp of computer science, this class would probably be very enjoyable for you. The concepts are cool and interesting and it's very cool to see all the practical and real applications of the material in the world around us. However, problem sets are EXTREMELY time-consuming (especially if you have no programming experience)--definitely work on them with a group of friends in the class. The concepts also can be kind of abstract and really difficult to comprehend, which makes the midterm and final a bit intimidating. Professor Jarosz is really kind and understanding, though, so she will try her best to tailor the class and help you as much as possible. I would strongly discourage you from taking this class without some prior programming experience.",
    "If you have an interest in linguistics and programming I would recommend this course. If you have no background in linguistics, I think you don't get as much out of the course. Some people who didn't have any programming background had a hard time at first.",
    "I would recommend this to any student interested in linguistics! Its a great course and gives you a more hands on approach to some of the issues we struggle with in Phonology and Syntax classes.If you are purely a computer science major - you will be bored. I do however suggest a course in either linguistics, computer science, or stats beforehand - otherwise, you may be a tad overwhelmed :)At the same time - if you are not a linguistics major, plenty of people in the class weren't and still said that the class was worth it :)It is a bit of an easy A too, for those who are in need of one.",
    "This is a really hard class. Honestly, you can get through it without programming experience, but be warned that it will be extremely difficult; programming should probably be a prerequisite. The lectures are sometimes hard to pay attention to, but the material is all in the slides and in the book. Worth it if you're really interested, but be prepared to spend a lot of hours on problem sets and a lot of time trying to understand very difficult concepts.",
    "This is a fun class with both linguistics and programming. The work isn't too hard (it's mostly programming in Python), and the material is interesting. I would definitely recommend it.",
    "If you're intrigued by the title or the class description, STOP NOW. This class is much different from what it sounds. Computational Linguistics is cool and all, but if you want a survey course of the concepts and aren't really super-good at coding, or if you have some linguistics background and want to look at it from another perspective, don't take this class. It is very interesting, and the concepts we talk about are sometimes rather intriguing, but it's discussed in a context that requires much more training than the prerequisites imply, and most of the people I knew in the course had to slave through hours and hours in order to just get the homework assignments done. It wasn't fun, and it wasn't a good idea. Seriously, watch out if you don't know how to code.",
    "A good social science credit if you need one. I am not a linguist and cannot speak for its value as a linguistics course, but I liked the course very much and felt I learned a good deal about modern linguistics.",
    "I would not take this exam without prior programming experience. The amount of time spent learning python before diving into programming was not sufficient for me.",
    "Yes, as long as you're interested. Programming experience is helpful, but not a formal prerequisite (at least not this year). You'll learn a lot, but definitely DO THE READINGS!"
