   "comments": [
    "This was my hardest class for the semester. The lab write-ups take FOREVER and they're graded arbitrarily. Points (lots of them) are lost on tiny technicalities in structure, not at all on content. Dr. Dimeglio is very fair and helpful, and the labs almost always work perfectly, but to improve this class some change in the grading must be made. The course is over and I have no idea what I have in the class.",
    "Yes, I would recommend it. It's a good introduction to organic chem lab, and the TAs are generally very knowledgeable and helpful. The course is essentially a survey of basic organic chemistry lab techniques and a couple of relatively simple organic syntheses.",
    "Chemistry 126L is mandatory, so you really have little choice. It is not a particularly bad lab. Make sure you follow the instructions in the lab manual exactly. If not you will quite possibly get killed by your TF, although you never know as they vary greatly. It is also a good opportunity to see if you enjoy lab, as it is probably more advanced than what you did in high school.",
    "126L serves as a good course in introducing fundamental laboratory techniques and concepts for a student learning organic chemistry.",
    "In the first semester of organic chem lab, we learned a lot of the basic techniques that we will be using in higher level organic labs. I really got the feeling that we were learning how to do things that are legitimately done in the real world of research.I LOVED this class. I really enjoyed synthesizing things, distilling things, reacting things, etc. The pre-labs were a lot of work, but they made me feel very well prepared during the lab itself. It's sort of a pain how much work you do for a 1\/2 credit, but totally worth it.",
    "This is a good lab course that introduces you to techniques common in organic chemistry. It does not correspond very well to Freshman Orgo, as first semester there is not much actual organic chemistry in lecture, but it is still a good course. However, be prepared for it to take a lot of time.Although it's worth only a half credit, it took me just as long if not longer than any of my other courses. Start lab reports well ahead of their due dates. The final exam is difficult. Read the materials to make lab less painful.",
    "Do the work and show up on time. You'll be golden .",
    "I would recommend Chem 126 to another student because it teaches essentiallab technique and knowledge and is a good complement to the extremely unique course.",
    "You have to take it, and it's not bad. Take it with Freddy if he's still here, cause he's awesome",
    "Meh, honestly you need to take the class, and the labs are interesting, but not my favorite class of all time.",
    "It's alot of work, but the lab experience is the best kind.",
    "Although the lab doesn't really correspond to Freshman Orgo, it's the only time that you are going to be exposed to lab techniques so take it if you can!",
    "This lab class takes a lot of time outside of class. How much you enjoy it depends on how much you like doing lab.",
    "It's required for Freshmen Orgo students. Work is time consuming but never that difficult. Definitely do not leave it until the last minute or you'll be up later than you think. All grading is done by your TF. Although four hours are budgeted for the lab once per week, the experiments rarely come close to taking that long. Most took between an hour and a half to two and a half hours and you're free to leave once you're done. Sometimes it's a little tough to understand what is happening (and why) in the reaction mechanisms because you don't cover them until second semester in freshmen orgo.Most importantly, don't let this course keep you from taking freshmen orgo. Lab offers a different perspective on material and is generally very helpful.",
    "It is necessary if you are taking oranic chemistry, so take it if you take orgo.",
    "You gotta take it...why would you take Freshman Orgo without the lab? It's better than other labs, as far as I understand, anyway.",
    "We all know that for science or pre-med majors this is a required class, so let me just say to just get the class over with. It is boring, takes 4 hours of your day every week, and numerous more hours with pre-labs labnotes and post-labs (and one lab report too). take it with ricardo as your TA, hes great.",
    "This lab is required if you take Freshman organic chemistry, so it's not like you really have a choice. It's an interesting contrast to the freshman orgo class, because in class we learn physics while in lab we do classic organic chemistry. This presents the problem that we don't fully understand the reactions going on, while the other normal organic chemistry class has already learned about the reactions that they are doing. It is sometimes hard to make sense out of what is going on, but it's an ok course.",
    "Lots of lab time. Be prepared to stay in lab for a while - if you think it might rain after lab, bring an umbrella. Also, it might be really depressing that you might go into lab and it is sunny and bright outside and when you come out it is already dark. At least it was for me.",
    "Chemistry 126L is required with Chem124, but it is great nonetheless. The TA's are very great and humourous, and it is a great experience to go through lab with some of your classmates. It does take a significant time commitment, but the undestanding that it builds will be useful in the future as you continue in chemistry or biology.",
    "Well it's required for most.",
    "You have to take lab with this course. It's a good introduction to the organic chemistry lab and if you work fast, you can leave early. Be efficient. Lab does take up time in your week but you have to do it.",
    "This course is pretty good. If you're taking freshman orgo, you're probably premed, and you're probably gonna take it, so even if I said lab sucked, you'd still take it. But really, orgo lab is pretty good with a manageable workload (don't wait to the last minute to do your work though!) and fair pace.",
    "Facebook-esque response:*DISlike*",
    "A lot of boring, tedious work--but it's bearable if you have a good section TA and enjoy doing experiments.",
    "seems like a standard organic chemistry lab, much more traditional than the corresponding chem 124 lecture. i recommend it, but it doesn't mean much because it's required with chem 124",
    "Chemistry 126L is your standard chemistry lab - but more intense than experienced in high school. There is definitely an emphasis on doing and understanding things yourself (few partner labs). While this is initially intimidating, it quickly allows you to be comfortable in the lab room.The first few labs are technique labs, where you learn various techniques important to organic chemistry experimentation. Later on, the labs get more complex and use these techniques to synthesize various compounds. It is really exciting to make something and be able to test its purity yourself.I would definitely recommend taking the lab with freshman organic chemistry (I'm not sure that not doing this is even an option) because it is another way to connect with your classmates - very useful for studying for tests together later on.However, be prepared to do a lot of work to prepare for each lab. And do do the work because it makes doing the lab much easier and a more enjoyable and less confusing experience.Finally, do not be intimidated by the four hour time block for this class: most labs are not this long, and the time passes extremely quickly because you are always busy doing something.",
    "The course is a lot of work and takes a lot of time, but it can be fun learning how to do organic chemistry. How the course is also depends on whether or not you get a good TA.",
    "The pre-lab and post-lab assignments for orgo lab are pretty time-intensive and the lab definitely takes up as much time and has as much work as a full-credit class. The quality of instruction really depends on the TA, who is the only one who will teach you. Mostly, though, you have to teach yourself the material by reading the lab textbook and the course packet.",
    "This is a very useful class that connects the ideas in lecture to practical applications. The work is very time-consuming. But overall, a good class.",
    "As long as you keep up in the class, and finish your pre-labs and post-labs on time, you're pretty much guaranteed an A or A-.",
    "If you are taking Freshman Organic Chemistry, you are required to take it, although you might want to use your time to take a better class.",
    "Show up early if you can to get a head start.",
    "Chem 126 is a pretty standard organic chem lab. Pre-lab work includes writing out Experimental Plans (EPs) and reading from the lab textbook, and post-lab work entails lab notes, assignments, and one big lab report. Overall, the work level isn't too bad, but EPs take a while, and the lab report is a ton of work (don't put it off until the night before!). The labs themselves aren't too difficult and are pretty interesting. I would recommend this lab if you're taking Orgo, because the material is closely related. Also, if you take Freshmen Orgo as I am, this lab is required.",
    "It's required for students taking Freshman Organic Chemistry, but I found that the techniques were interesting. It provides a good setting for the slightly more extensive risk-taking which comes with more independent lab work, but also maintains enough structure that safety and efficiency are still present.",
    "The lab is mandatory if you're taking Freshman Orgo, so there isn't really any choice.",
    "Not particularly interesting, but you learn useful techniques for future lab work. Labs are a bit arbitrary but easy to perform. Grading policies are inconsistent and detail-specific--learn your individual TA!",
    "This is just your standard lab course. The professor is very nice, and the labs help you to learn a lot of important lab technique. However, the format of lab write-ups is not always as explicit as it could be, and grading varies from TA to TA.",
    "It doesn't follow along with CHEM 124 very well, but that's not a big deal. The only thing you have to worry about is studying the E1, E2, SN1, SN2, etc. reactions because those aren't covered and reinforced in CHEM 124.Other than that, the workload isn't too bad since you build up to a full lab report, and most days, you can get out a bit early. The grading can seem strict at times, but be sure to pay close attention to detail as you're doing your experimental plans and lab notes. Also, just be aware that the final is multiple choice where there can be more than one answer to a question."
