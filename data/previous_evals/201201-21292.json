    "Definitely take it!",
    "This is a brilliant course outlining the social, economic, political, TGD and religious connotations associated with the Mahabharata. This course does not make you read the entire 100,000 verse poem (only important pieces) instead you focus on the effects that this document has had on the world. If you are passionate about the effects of eastern religions on society or are very interested in India this is a great course to take.",
    "It's a pretty good class if you're interested in Hinduism\/the Mahabharata. The articles can get a little dense, but they're interesting.",
    "I would recommend this course, or anything else taught by Dean Flick, to another student without hesitation. It would help to have some general background in Hinduism or the like, but the material is accessible to anyone. You will get out of this course what you put into it; while it is possible to skate by with minimal reading and effort, you'll find pursuing the material in depth to be enjoyable and rewarding. Take it!",
    "Good course with interesting discussions",
    "Dean Flick is great. It's a chill humanities class for the poor science majors.",
    "Yes, would recommend it! Allows for a study of the Mahabharata outside of the very dry academic scene, i.e. allows for student participation and conversation over the Mahbharata as something real and not just some historical document.",
    "If you have any interest whatsoever in South Asian philosophical, religious, or cultural traditions, I would highly recommend this class. Dr. Flick is an enthusiastic professor with immense subject matter knowledge. Although you can get by this entire class without doing a single reading, for your own benefit, I would definitely recommend immersing yourself in the material. It's very accessible and intellectually satisfying.",
    "I would highly recommend this class to anyone remotely interested in the Mahabharata or even South Asia in general. The coursework is light and Dean Flick is easily the most relaxed instructor I have had.",
    "I would recommend this class, especially if you want to learn more about Hinduism and Sanskrit Literature."
