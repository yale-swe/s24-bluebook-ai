    "In short: I strongly recommend against taking this course, even if you enjoy the GUI as a subject.I'm personally fascinated by UI\/UX, and this course seemed like a great opportunity to learn some interesting history and engage in group discussions on design. Unfortunately, I was frustrated on both accounts. Material is covered at a glacial pace -- we spent literally (literally) an entire month going through the first reading, a 20-page reading on Doug Engelbart -- and to add to the irritation, most class periods involve little-to-no group discussion. Prof. Gelernter is an intelligent speaker, but rarely asks the class for input except when seeking a specific answer to a specific question. I'd gladly listen to him to talk for an hour, but sitting in his class for a full semester was difficult.For what it's worth, grading is also pretty strict. Prof. Gelernter stresses brevity in writing, and not much else -- a valuable lesson, but a frustrating one given his inability to express his own opinions concisely in lecture.To his credit, Prof. Gelernter will expose you to some history that is otherwise ignored in CS at Yale (Engelbart, Kay\/Xerox PARC, '80s IBM and Apple), and he will teach you to write as concisely as possible. Then again, I've pretty much summarized the course right there. Spend an afternoon watching Engelbart's Mother of All Demos and reading Strunk& White, and you've covered pretty much everything this course has to offer, and saved yourself a headache.",
    "I would recommend this course to students interested in computer science, art, design, architecture, sociology, and history.",
    "This course doesn't really teach a student about writing or computer science. Take it if you want to sit through an interesting seminar twice a week and get a low grade (the instructor grades very harshly). If you've become accustomed to writing academic papers, this course will help you to write more succinctly; however, you will probably get a low grade and become frustrated by the professor's writing conventions. If you think of yourself as a good writer, enjoy writing, or really improve your writing skills, then do not take this course. If you want to learn about an interesting topic with a pretty good professor, get a fairly easy WR credit, and don't care about getting an A, then take this course.",
    "This isn't a class about UI, but the original 1984 Macintosh desktop GUI. The first question Professor Gelernter poses is whether it is a classic or if the industry is just lazy (having money and no incentive). The answer is both, of course, but you won't discuss it anyway. You can save yourself one credit hour by reading his \"Machine Beauty\" book instead. It covers his interest in design and art history, which is what he prefers to discuss. Topics like innovation on mobile user interfaces or Internet web design are not even side notes. The syllabus was a mess. (It has the coherency of the 1984 Mac's \"San Francisco\" typeface.) A red flag. Everyone skipped class or otherwise just checked email. You don't need to know anything about computers. Every class is exactly like the very first day. He speaks to the far wall and repeats himself for an hour after stressing the importance of terse writing. There are four writing assignments at 300 words each and a 1500-word final assignment. You won't learn much about writing, but you'll learn from editing yourself. He is a harsh grader with strict definitions on \"good writing.\" You will have no artistic license. The irony? This class is by an artist, about artists (and designers), for artists.",
    "Nope.",
    "Interesting, thought provoking. No reason not to have fun. A great compliment to many of our other courses.",
    "Great overview of the history of the Graphical User Interface and also excellent way to trim the fat from your writing. I would recommend it to any student who wants to know more about the interface they interact with every day and also any student who's been allowed to go through college writing phrases like \"innovative\" and",
    "Yes if you are interested in GUI's and how laptops came to be. 4 small papers + 1 final paper"
