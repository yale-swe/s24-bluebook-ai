    "French 151 is great. It feels about the same amount of work as 140 even though you have class only three times a week--although admittedly there is a lot more writing. There's also more expected of you, but it's very manageable. And Mme. Koizim is great. She's flexible about dates, SUPER helpful and really nice. She really puts you at ease in her class, and it just becomes really fun. LOVE, and would absolutely recommend!",
    "I'd definitely recommend this class to another student! We watched a lot of movies and read a few books, but everything was organized really well and it is manageable as long as you come to class. You also learn a lot of grammar and speak in class so your writing and speaking skills will improve greatly!",
    "YES! This is one of the best French classes I've taken at Yale.",
    "A fantastic course. My French improved an incredible amount as a result of this class and Madame Koizim, who is honestly one of the best professors I've had at Yale. The texts and films are very interesting. I highly recommend it.",
    "Yes, absolutely!",
    "Take this class if you're looking to get better at speaking French or if you're preparing to go abroad. Mme. Koizim is the absolute best and made the class really fun and interesting."
