   "comments": [
    "Feminist Theory and Feminist Art is a spectacular introduction to art history, feminism, or even both. Dean Cahan was an inspiring professor who helped provoke thoughtful discussion where all students felt comfortable participating. The reading load was fairly dense, and sometimes we ran out of time during a class before getting to discuss all of it, but Dean Cahan was aware of this and would adjust the workload. The midterm paper is essentially about any artist or any piece of artwork you want, so if you don't enjoy writing it, it's your fault for choosing a shitty topic. The final paper\/presentation is similarly fun, though longer. You get to \"curate\" a theoretical exhibit filled with literally any artwork from anywhere and anytime. Don't be discouraged by the fact that this is listed as an art class, I took this as a first semester freshman with absolutely NO background in art or art history and I never felt in over my head. Dean Cahan is very supportive of people who go out of their comfort zone to take this class or choose risky paper topics. I recommend this course without reservation; it played a large role in loving my first semester here!",
    "This is a great course. Dean Cahan is SO smart and knowledgeable, and the syllabus is fascinating. Sometimes the other students share personal experiences a bit too much, but Dean Cahan is quite rigorous and the course is well-planned and well-executed.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS. It is the coolest fusion of feminist literature and really good art. I always looked forward to this class and found myself reading the materials more for pleasure than duty. The assignments were fun and a bit out of the box. If you like art andidentify in any way as a feminist, it would make no sense for you to not take this course.",
    "If you are at all interested in feminist theory, or modern art, I would definitely recommend this course!"
