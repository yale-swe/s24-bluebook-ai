    "Take this class! Great extension of the egyptian language. You are probably using this for a language requirement so you have to anyway. There is a decent amount of translating and it has a final, but other than that great class. Once a week.",
    "Yes, I would recommend it.",
    "This class is a great, interesting alternative to conventional language classes at Yale. The workload is certainly greater than the first two semesters of hieroglyphics, but it's not unreasonable and the class is very interesting.",
    "This class is quite a bit harder than the previous Egyptian classes but it's definitely manageable. If you want to read one of the world's oldest works of fiction, then take this class."
