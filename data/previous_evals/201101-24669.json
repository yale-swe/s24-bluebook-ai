    "TAKE THIS CLASS!! Great way to connect what we've been learning in engineering classes to real world applications.",
    "MENG 385 is an excellent course for any ME major and even for people who are just interested in learning about a cutting edge application of engineering techniques. The workload is quite manageable and Professor Ramirez's instruction is excellent. If you can take this course, do it. You will learn a lot from this course and it will not feel like a burden.",
    "Definitely take this course if you can if you are even remotely interested in the subject matter. It is not a hard course and is definitely manageable. Great professor, really well taught.",
    "This is a great elective for the ME degree. It will give you a nice overview of MEMS if you're at all interested in the field. There is not a whole lot of work involved, and the class is pretty fun.",
    "Yes. This is the missing Mech Engr class on your transcript."
