   "comments": [
    "Yes, as a course with an interesting lecturer and a timeless reading list--but don't expect a traditional, totally text-focused english class.",
    "A survey of modernist texts in roughly chronological progression, looking at modernism's influences and literary outcomes.",
    "If you're interested in the material, TAKE THIS CLASS. Prof. Lewis is a fantastic lecturer-- he really brings the material to life, getting at the core of each book and examining all the influences surrounding it. By the end of the course, he's painted a very holistic picture of the rise and evolution of Modernism in England. However, be prepared to do a LOT of reading-- you won't get much out of the course if you've not read the books.",
    "Yes, Professor Lewis is one of the best. He's a great lecturer who provides historical background in each of his lectures, it's obvious that he lives and breathes this period, and he's very approachable if you want to go into his office hours to talk about the works.",
    "A great class if you like reading great literature. You will learn a lot about novels that you would probably pleasure for fun anyway.",
    "Maybe... def. weight the pros and consPros: Teaching Assistant, reading list, short papersCons: Professor Lewis, Professor Lewis, Professor Lewis",
    "A great class that covers a wide range of novels that need to be read at some point in your life. The reading is sometimes hard to keep up with, you have to make sure to do some catching up over spring break. Definitely take this class for an enjoyable experience by an enthusiastic professor who knows what he's talking about.",
    "Take it. Take it. The syllabus is great. Also, personal story: when I first staring taking the class, I had a habit of making fun of Professor Lewis's lectures for being overly dry. BUT THAT MAN'S LECTURE WON ME OVER AND QUICKLY!!! Perhaps it was all me, but soon I was made aware of the fact that he was not only intensely knowledgeable and insightful, but had a lovely sense of humor and lively nature that made lecture very enjoyable. He's also eager to meet with students, so that's cool, too.THE MORAL: If you don't like to opening lectures you should still stick around. It's a pretty rad class.",
    "It's a good class. Great syllabus.",
    "Modern British Novel looks at a broad range of novels ranging from Conrad's The Heart of Darkness and David Lodge's The British Museum is Falling Down in order to come up with some sense of what it means for a novel to be modern, how that has changed, evolved, developed over the years, and what the future of literature might hold in store. It's an amazing class. Everyone should read these novels just for the purposes of becoming a better, more knowledgeable person. I would definitely recommend this class to another student.",
    "I would highly recommend this class because of the wonderful novels and discussions. It was hard many times to get all the reading done in time for class and section though.",
    "Yes I recommend it, but if you are the type of person who can get tired to a very academic approach to literature then it might not be for you. I loved the reading list but lost some of my interest in the lectures as the semester progressed.",
    "I would reccomend it especially for freshmen and sophomores",
    "Excellent class. The reading list is incredible, Professor Lewis is fantastic and you will learn so much. Take it!!",
    "Modern British Novel is a great lecture class. The reading list was wonderful -- I really love modernism, so I guess I'm biased, but I always felt like the class was just giving me an excuse to read a good book each week. I left with a solid understanding of modernism and the experience of reading and thinking about some incredible books. Professor Lewis's lectures were solid and he was willing to discuss questions after class. My section was really great, too -- Tony Domestico was one of the best TAs I've had at Yale.",
    "English 301 is a survey of Modernist British fiction. If you're prepared to read a novel a week, this is definitely a worthwhile course.",
    "Take it! Professor Lewis lectures well, but more importantly the syllabus is fantastic.",
    "Recommended for all English students; fills a niche vitally necessary to the understanding of fiction in modern times.",
    "English 301 is a look at British Modernism through several very, very good novels. I would recommend it as a way to read those books you've been meaning to read for years--A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man, Mrs. Dalloway--with a guide, Professor Lewis, who is incredibly knowledgeable about them. A good class! He's a little soft-spoken, and his lecture style isn't the strength of this course--its strength is the books you read. (though it is a lot of reading!)",
    "You read one novel a week, write two papers, and have a midterm and final. If you are interested in modernism, I would highly recommend this class - fun lecture, a reasonable amount of work, and a great reading list.",
    "Some really awesome books. Some lame ones. MODERNISM. Vague lectures.",
    "In The Modern British Novel, students read novels by Conrad, Ford Madox Ford, Forster, Joyce, Woolf, D.H. Lawrence, Waugh, and David Lodge as well as short stories by Joyce and Katherine Mansfield. The lectures focus mainlyon historical perspectives on the novels and critical response. The class often felt as though Prof. Lewis was preparing us to study the novels in graduate seminars and write long research papers about them. If you are a Joyce geek, you will probably enjoy the class very much, but if you do not have a well-defined interest in Modernism scholarship and criticism, you might do better to read the novels over the summer.",
    "Definitely! The material is amazing and the professor\/my teaching assistant were really special and really wonderful!",
    "I would definitely recommend the Modern British Novel to another student. The course is a course on \"modern\" intellectual and cultural history in addition to the modern British novel. It provides a broad understanding of the era that produced such great literature. Whether you an English major or not, you should definitely take this interesting and vibrant course.",
    "ABSOLUTELY TAKE THIS CLASS! The material is wonderful and Professor Lewis is really dedicated and enthusiastic. One of my favorite classes that I have taken at Yale.",
    "I've found that it's difficult to read for pleasure during the term, and I miss reading. So I decided to take the English class with the best reading list Credit\/D to get around that. The books Pericles requires are wonderful (only one I couldn't finish, and that was made up for with four or so amazing reads), and the coursework isn't too heavy. Pericles is a very good lecturer, and does a good job of picking up major themes to follow.I would recommend this course to anyone with an interest in Modernist Literature. It's my favorite historical period, so I had a ball."
