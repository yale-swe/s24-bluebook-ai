    "The course stands out as one of the more practical courses offered at YSPH. However, the material is dense and sometimes confusing. I am happy I took this course but still have more to learn in this field. It would have been beneficial to have the homework assignments more clearly lead to the final project.",
    "Very useful and pertinent skills taught Great illustrative cases used",
    "This course is great! It introduces me some useful theories and frameworks in implementation science and encourages me to apply the knowledge to real-life cases.",
    "This was a great course and was very much catered to the needs and interests of each student. The professor clearly cares about the subject matter and the interest of students. My one suggestion would be to run through a majority of the course content within the first half of the term to allow more time to focus on the study design aspect of the grant proposals and how implementation science applies to the actual design. Feedback on the midterm proposal was extremely helpful for writing the final grant proposal, and I would suggest adjusting homework assignments in the latter half of the term to be used in a sense as first drafts of the latter half of grant proposal components in order to produce the best grant proposal possible by the end of the term.",
    "I enjoyed this class immensely. I thought the topics were interesting and engaging and I liked the structure of each class section (divided between lecture and group week). This gave me ample opportunities to ask questions of the instructor and engage with my group on the final project. I have two suggestions on how to improve the class. First, I think it would be important to include a section on ethics and how to conceptualize ethical questions within implementation science. And second, it would have helped to have the professor present a case study in the beginning of the class and follow the same case study over time, relating different concepts from the case study to the individual lectures each week. Some of the topics were more abstract than others, so it would have helped to have a continuous example of how the concepts discussed actually get used in implementation projects.",
    "Overall great course. Felt like I learned to think in new ways about (the determinants and antecedents of) behavioral change, planning\/implementation of a community intervention, and strategies to close the \"evidence-practice gap.\" These are all skills that I feel like I will be able to use in my future clinical and public health work, as many of the poor outcomes that clinicians encounter can be traced to poor implementation strategy. Luke was an engaging lecturer and very responsive to students. The split between lecture time vs. project time\/group work was about right. The textbook was OK but not great; I felt like it presented a laundry list of (oftentimes overlapping) implementation science concepts\/theories\/frameworks\/models\/etc. and it was hard to keep track of them all. I thought the group project was a great way to actually practice using some the concepts and ideas we learned in class. I would have appreciated a deeper dive into current\/ongoing examples of Impl Sci projects across a wide variety of fields. A lecture in class deconstructing all the components of one particular real-world example of an Impl Sci project from start to finish (i.e. mimicking what we did ourselves for our own Final Project presentations) would have been great. I would definitely recommend this course to anyone interested in how to \"move the needle\" on outcome gaps.",
    "It's a good course.",
    "I really enjoyed the subject of this class. My biggest concern coming out of the concern was tying in what we were talking about every directly into the term project. Everything made sense as it was built on top of each other but we needed more guidance along the way as to how they should fit together, or where they should appropriately be placed, in a proposal or article.",
    "The course is not organized well, it is difficult to follow what is actually required. The course was meant to help write the final assessment, the proposal, but it wasn't as helpful as it could have been. I think it would be helpful to go over the funding proposal near the beginning so students know what is expected"

    "Instructor: John Lucian Davis \u00a0Professor Davis is phenomenal. He is personable, approachable and clearly knowledgeable in his field. I benefitted greatly from the feedback on weekly assignments and from the many opportunities for in class feedback on presentations.",
    "Instructor: John Lucian Davis \u00a0Responsive to students",
    "Instructor: John Lucian Davis \u00a0Dr. Davis is a great teacher. He gives timely and detailed responses\/feedbacks and encourages us to think a lot.",
    "Instructor: John Lucian Davis \u00a0Luke was very invested in this subject matter and it really showed. He was extremely open to feedback and actively incorporated the goals of students into the course throughout the term. Grading was much more stringent than in other YSPH courses, but this can be viewed ass motivating to really grasp the material.",
    "Instructor: John Lucian Davis \u00a0The professor was very good at listening to and answering questions. He was also especially receptive to feedback (more so than some other professors). For example, it was really helpful when he changed the curriculum such that we completed homework assignments after the topics had been discussed in class. I felt like this change led me to feel more confident in my submitted work and was also more useful for me to see which concepts I understood and which ones I needed to work on more. I always felt like my questions and participation were welcome and encouraged, and this made the learning experience so much better.",
    "Instructor: John Lucian Davis \u00a0See overall assessment",
    "Instructor: John Lucian Davis \u00a0He is a good instructor.",
    "Instructor: John Lucian Davis \u00a0My concern was about expectations from the instructor. They weren't always clear but I did appreciate his willingness to adjust as we went and take into account student feedback as the semester went on. Many times our confusion or miscommunication was a matter of not knowing what we didn't know or not knowing how to ask for it.",
    "Instructor: John Lucian Davis \u00a0The feedback was really helpful, great professor."

   "comments": [
    "Would highly recommend",
    "The course is great in understanding implementation theories and frameworks, but sometimes it's a little bit hard to understand the theories without sufficient examples\/cases.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to any students interest in issues surrounding the middle ground of translating research into practice. Students who have an identified implementation project\/subject they are interested in will get the most out of this course as it is very applied, which is exactly what one would expect at the Master's level. This was a refreshing course given its applied nature after some of the core courses offered at YSPH in that there is an option to produce a real project out of this.",
    "I have already recommended this class to several students. I think as the field of medicine (and public health) shift to more evidence-based practices, it is essential for public health workers to consider what evidence based practices are, and how they can be successfully translated and implemented in public health programs. This class really has something to offer everyone, and the fact that we had great liberties in choosing our final projects meant that we as students could develop real, practical skills on topics we care about.",
    "See overall assessment",
    "It's a good course.",
    "Take this class if you get the chance and if you are interested in how to use evidence-based research. Love the principles taught here and Luke is a very approachable and helpful instructor."
