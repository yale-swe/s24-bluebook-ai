    "My writing in Spanish definitely improved, as did my vocabulary in legal Spanish. I learned a lot about different systems of law in other countries - and in particular Spain. The review of amendments, laws, and acts from other countries was also incredibly interesting. It provided a more worldly view and thus allowed me to think about the different ways in which law can work.",
    "Legal Spanish taught me how to think about the law in a global context. I learned about international legal principles, specific political issues in Latin American countries and the United States, and key vocabulary that will be useful in any Spanish-speaking setting.",
    "As a result of taking this course, I gained a better understanding of how the legal system operates in Latin America and Spain.",
    "This course helped me more with comprehension than it did with my speaking, but along the way, I learned a lot about legal-related topics in hispanic countries.",
    "I gained some cursory knowledge of various topics related to law and practiced my Spanish reading, comprehension, and writing skills.",
    "I became a slightly better writer in Spanish through taking this course, because I got grammatical on my essays from the professor. I learned that its important to use articles (el, la, los, etc, even when you think its not necessary, because in English we dont preface every noun with the. I also learned more about the immigration detention centers throughout the US that detain undocumented families for no apparent reason while other undocumented immigrants get to lead relatively normal lives outside of the confines of a detention center. One such detention center is in Berks, PA, and families have been detained there for years without reason or knowing when they will be released. I learned about a hunger strike that occurred at the Berks Detention Center, and about a safe-house that exists in the desert of Mexico to provide shelter, food, and water to people trying to cross the border into the US. I learned a lot of slang terms for marijuana in this course, as well as a little bit about the movement to legalize weed in certain Latin American countries. I learned the difference between two ways countries grant citizenship: jus soli (born in the country) and jus sanguinis (parents are citizens of the country). I learned a little bit about the conflict between Haiti and the Dominican Republic in this course. I also learned about the existence of secret passageways in Spanish airports that allow undocumented immigrants to skirt customs. Through my final paper, I learned a LOT about abortion laws in Latin America, but that was 100% self-taught and self-driventhe professor didnt teach me anything about this topic, and I could have instead written about a topic I already knew a lot about.",
    "I was introduced to legal concepts in Spanish and studied through Spanish speaking countries.",
    "Knowledge of Spanish legal vocabulary",
    "I heard a lot of well spoken Spanish and learned valuable topics on the legal system.",
    "Great class! Focus on legal jargon and vocabulary but within a conversational and debate setting.",
    "Good course to be more knowledgable on an interesting topic. The class is really what you make of it. If you talk more then you get more out of it in terms of being more conversational in the language."

   "comments": [
    "I think the course is strong through its weekly assignments. There's always something to be done to improve your writing while also learning about law in different areas of the world. I also thought the presentations were good for having to figure out how to speak about a legal topic in Spanish without the help of the professor. It was a good exercise in itself, before even getting to the presentation.",
    "Strengths: Enjoyable, exercises writing\/reading\/conversational skills, welcoming and warm class environment, interesting topics of discussion and composition. Weaknesses: Could be more interactive on some days, especially when I have been tired. Some of the instructions to assignments are also unclear, specifically the writing assignments.",
    "Strengths- Incredible professor, engaging lectures, feedback on my written Spanish, and manageable workload Weaknesses- It was at 9 am on Tuesdays and Thursdays",
    "Prof. Carreras is wonderful, and it was a pleasure to learn from her! She know a lot about legal concepts, and I looked forward to going to class to learn something new. She cares about her students a lot. I do wish that we focused a bit more on our speaking abilities. I feel I could have become more comfortable speaking, if we had been forced to a bit more.",
    "It's a great course if you have moderate interest in the subject. The classes are varied, with a good amount of fun TV watching.",
    "The strengths of the course are that it is an easy L5 course for anyone who is proficient in Spanish. Fluency is not necessary to do well in the course. Of course, if you are fluent in Spanish, then the course is extremely easy. Prof Carreras does a good job at introducing students to legal concepts and latin terminology in a slow and understandable way. The course is very much a gut. If you dont come to class, you wont miss out on much, because the same students participate in discussions every class, and a lot of classes consist of watching tangentially related youtube videos or tv shows. This course could be improved by requiring students do readings in Spanish that correspond to course material. This would improve students reading capabilities in Spanish and expand their vocabulary. The course could also be improved by making it more challenging so that students put more effort into each assignment. Unfortunately, students are motivated by grades, and when you can submit corrections to essays for full points, there is little incentive to do well on the first draft. I think the class would have been better had we covered more material and focused on legal systems in different countries in Latin America. I would have liked to engage in debates related to controversial topics, such as abortion, the death penalty, drug legalization, immigration, indigenous peoples rights, etc. Even after taking this course, I dont think I have a much better understanding of legal systems in Latin America. The final projects were all based on the US system of government, which was disappointing, since most students already know so much out this topic. Instead, I would have enjoyed focusing on legal systems or controversies in Latina American countries.",
    "I thought this was a great course to be introduced to legal concepts in Spanish. Very well organized, and engaging.",
    "Professor Carreras is a wonderful teacher. More discussion\/debate would have been nice, and more focus on some of the law in the syllabus (international law etc.).",
    "Strength is the level of Spanish spoken. Weakness is organhzation in the sense that I didn't know what countries legal system we were talking about half the time.",
    "It is an amazing class with the perfect balance of lecture and class participation!",
    "Sra. Carreras is great, super sweet, and it's obvious she is a professional in the field. There could be more opportunities for us to talk in groups on a given class day."

    "I absolutely would. Professor Carreras is an amazing professor with a broad knowledge base, making the class very interesting and full of a variety of topics. There are discussions of real-world implications of all the stuffy-sounding laws that one studies throughout the course. Furthermore, the writings are not particularly long, but will definitely help improve one's writing skill. It is a great way to both learn legal concepts and improve one's Spanish.",
    "Yes, it is a great class to learn about Latin America and various legal systems. My final paper led me to be extremely knowledgable about the subject I wrote about, the death penalty. Mercedes Carreras is kind and helpful, and you will certainly enjoy your semester in her class. It's well worth the early morning walk to LC 317.",
    "Yes!! This class is a gem. Professor Carreras is one of the kindest, understanding, and funniest professors I've had at Yale. The workload is very low, and the grading is very lenient. Professor Carreras is more concerned with your personal growth than actual grades. Highly recommend.",
    "I do feel that at times we wondered from the cuaderno, but generally I appreciated that. Overall, I recommend this class if you're interested in Spanish culture or if you need an L5 language credit. The workload is pretty low; we had to submit short essay responses once a week. Other than that, the only other assignments were a 10-minute presentation (you work in groups, each has to speak for 10 minutes) and the 10-page final paper.",
    "If you have any interest in law and need or want to take a Spanish class, this is a great course. Most classes consist of slides and\/or videos followed by comprehension exercises, and there are brief weekly writing assignments.",
    "I would recommend this course to a student who needs an easy L5 Spanish credit or to a fluent Spanish speaker who wants an easy fifth class. The workload is very light (there arent any readingsjust short essays every week, a group project, and a final essay. I would recommend this course to someone who likes to participate in class discussions and who will put a lot of effort into their essays. Otherwise, the class does not easily facilitate improvement in Spanish. If you want to improve your conversational or writing skills, you need to put the effort yourself, but you will get an A almost regardless of how much effort you put in. The professor lets you correct your essays for full points back. There is no organization to the classI didnt know what to expect from each class because there was no structure.",
    "If you are interested in law, and would like to keep up practicing your Spanish I would recommend this course.",
    "Yes, if you have a fairly good base knowledge of Spanish and want to learn about an interesting subject from an engaging professor",
    "For an easier class, yes. If you want to be challenged in Spanish, no.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to anyone looking to take an advanced spanish class! Amazing professor!!!",
    "Would recommend this class. There are writing assignments every week but they are manageable and helpful for the language and grammar. Carreras is a great teacher and great person. Get started on the final paper early though, it can sneak up on you if you wait too late.",
    "I would highly recommend this course"
