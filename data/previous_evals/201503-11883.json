   "comments": [
    "I wouldn't necessarily recommend this course unless it was for the specific professor. Overall English 125 is an okay class but nothing super groundbreaking or profound that isn't offered elsewhere. Most of the poets\/poems were studied in high school because they are the \"major\" poets and while I think this class offers a lot of some students, I don't think it does for all and making it a requirement of the major seems a little out of date.",
    "To be honest, I wouldn't have taken this course if it weren't required for my major because of its \"Dead White Dudes\" problem. I was pleasantly surprised that I quite enjoyed it. If you like the classics of English poetry, definitely take it. If you're troubled by the Dead White Dudes thing but really like studying literature, I still think you should give it a shot. This is literature that's survived in people's hearts for centuries. It can mean something to everyone.",
    "You have to take it if you're an English major... and it's really not that bad. Joe is definitely the guy to take it with, though-- he's enthusiastic, energetic, and devoted to helping you write better. Each essay we got back was covered in handwritten notes, tips, suggestions, and comments. The class itself is a little lackluster-- I really only liked the Chaucer and found Spenser to be a definite drag-- but again, it's required for the major and it's not too terrible.",
    "I would recommend the course unequivocally, even to students who aren't contemplating the English major. Understanding and being familiar with these poets is an important part of cultural literacy, but it's also an excellent exposure to the humanities as a whole because it involves great lyrical beauty as well as demonstrating the potential for literature to address both traditional questions (What is my relationship to God?) and current ones (What does gender have to do with how we see the world?). The course is also a good writing credit because it forces us to evaluate our own writing thoroughly.",
    "I've heard a number of students complain about having to take this course for the English major... it's a lot of work, the poetry is really old, the poets are all men, and so on. All those things are true, but that says nothing about the quality of the poems, which is great. Not only is the poetry rich and layered, but because the poets are so old, the poetry gives insight into the attitudes and thoughts of people from a time very different their our own. Professor North is a great teacher of poetry, and he did a great job of trying to make the poems relevant to students today. I highly enjoyed the class, and if you're interested in English poetry, it's a great class to take.",
    "Yes I would!"
