   "comments": [
    "This course provided a strong foundation of knowledge and a vast set of questions for approaching the history of (U.S.) black sound, music, literature and culture. The course was anchored in history but offered a theoretical, literary, and imaginative approach to the relationship between blackness, post-slavery black life, sound, culture, and power. The course developed a basis for inquiring into the aesthetics, material properties, technologies, and histories of black music and sound, and engaged with a genealogy of scholarship of black aesthetics, captivity, fugitivity, and freedom. The literary and musical texts of the course enhanced each other and challenged students in the course to ask different questions than reading or listening would allow for alone. The course was driven by a level of urgency, concern, and excitement that was sustaining and powerful for students of black life and culture in the past and present.",
    "I learned theories surrounding the formation of black sound. I learned about the connection between literature and music and developing a black canonical consciousness.",
    "This was undoubtedly one of the most challenging and enriching courses I have taken to date. I grew intellectually and gained a notable new fluency in the topics of the course. It shaped the way I think and gave me a new perspective on all my work.",
    "course included interesting reading material. I am not sure that I got much out of it though.",
    "This was an incredibly valuable class-- it served as an introduction to black studies, sound studies, and nineteenth century American literature, none of which I was familiar with before the course."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths: - class was always interesting and pushed students to think about the material in complex ways - provided s good survey of material Weaknesses: - too many texts were assigned for each class period (did not feel as though students were about to adequately engage with the materials because there was so much to read) (suggestion: assign half of the week's readings to half of the class and the other half to the rest of the students)",
    "This course was a powerhouse of energy, theory, history, and culture, and it left me with more questions and tools than it did with answers. The course challenged students to think critically and imaginatively, and pushed us beyond simplistic and flattening understandings of black cultural production. Nearly all assumptions that one could hold about black life, thought, culture, and action in history were overturned or complicated in ways that made our cultural analysis much more difficult but much more rewarding and true. Despite the many strengths of the course, our discussions were sometimes frustrating because not everyone's voice was present. The room was full of brilliant people with different disciplinary backgrounds and experiences, but sometimes our discussions were dominated by people with greater knowledge and investments in the theory and aesthetics angle of the course. By the end of the semester our discussions were more open and varied, but I wished to hear more from everyone throughout the course.",
    "There is a lot of material presented and the correlation between assigned materials, time periods, and classroom discussions is consistent. Sometimes the amount of reading impedes textual understanding. It is difficult to digest the amount of material assigned efficiently.",
    "I don't quite know how this could be remedied, but I did sometimes feel the class time did not allow for a chance to get to all the readings - or to the readings that felt most urgent or most central to the course themes. On the other hand, the syllabus now functions for me as an extensive and generative archive and jumping-off point for future reading.",
    "The class was organized very well, and I enjoyed almost all the readings. The only thing that was tough was there was a lot of reading--primary source texts, secondary texts, and music. It was sometimes hard to keep up."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "Yes! I learned a lot and had a lot of fun. I'm sure other students would too.",
    "I would strongly recommend this course to another student interested in black cultural history, literature, theory, and aesthetics. The course provided an indispensable basis for understanding black culture through history and theory, and advanced a set of questions that were critical, urgent, and challenging. The course reading load was very heavy and the theoretical material was often challenging and frustrating, but as the course progressed, we were able to further sharpen and\/or open up the theoretical questions that anchored our discussion. The material was life-affirming and spirit-lifting even though it was often also deeply challenging and unresolved. The space that Professor Brooks and all of the students created was full of energy and deep investments in the material that elevated everyone's engagement.",
    "This course, though challenging, presented opportunities to grow in my conception of blackness and black cultural identity.",
    "Yes, very strongly, though it would come as a recommendation of Professor Brooks more generally and any courses and programming she offered.",
    "Yes, great class!"
