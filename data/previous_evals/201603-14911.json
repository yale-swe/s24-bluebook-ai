   "comments": [
    "I gained a much more comprehensive understanding of UN structure, challenges faced by international institutions and goal-setting, and international stakeholders in the global development space. In choosing and designing a project, I learned about how to best utilize international instruments and agreements to bolster and catalyze local action, and how implementation plans can work at multiple levels to utilize these global agreements to advance global goals.",
    "I am unsure that I achieved my objectives in this course. I suppose I was hoping for more guidance in drafting our proposals, but rather it recalled previous experiences. Those with experience at the USAID or other organizations had a lot to draw from and just wrote their proposals in that style; those without didn't have much to work from.",
    "Through this course I was able to better understand the mechanisms for evaluation, monitoring, implementation and financing for development. The course allowed me to gain a complete understanding of the Sustainable Development Goals and methods for implementing them in various contexts (Ex. both high-income and low-income countries)."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths: I really enjoyed our speakers and felt like they imparted some very useful and candid insights about the formation and future of the SDGs. I think the class brought together diverse insights from a number of different schools, and I learned a lot from the plans that others were implementing. Weaknesses: I think that the program evaluation component of the course could have been strengthened, and I felt most wanting in my own plan design. I also wish we had discussed the readings more in class (rather than doing the online questions, which I didn't find very useful). I also would have liked to see more examples of SDG implementation plans (or plans implemented using SDG language) to have better gauged the scope of my own.",
    "The class was very environment focused; leaving it up to those students who were interested in other areas (for example, Global Health) to do the heavy lifting of bringing relevant insights. That usually functioned well as the students had a lot of interesting information\/opinions to contribute. However, the guest speakers almost all spoke to singular interests in the environment. After a while, it got uninteresting. The course should be renamed or then it should expand the areas discussed. The ever changing guest speaker roster and schedule also got annoying at times (although I understand that this particular issue is beyond the control of the class and instructors).",
    "This course was very engaging and provided the opportunity for students to create a project that could lead to a future job, internship, or connection with an organization The guest speakers were always interesting. One of the highlights of the course was the opportunity to attend the UN General Assembly. Further, the diverse backgrounds of the students allowed us to engage in many of the SDGs, not just those directly related to FES. One way that the course could be improved would be to have each section of the final implementation plan be made a deliverable each week depending on the topic covered. For example, the week that we learned about evaluation, the evaluation section of the final paper could be due for feedback."

   "comments": [
    "I would recommend the course for anyone explicitly interested in international development and who already knows something about the UN system and the SDGs. I found the most constructive conversations where those had between individuals with previous experience in the sector, and I think that those intending to work for (or who have worked for) the UN should take this course to better understand how and where they can be most effective.",
    "The class is an FES class that looks at the environment aspects of the SDG goals; if that is the interest of the student, they should take the class. The speakers added a cool element to the course; there was great value in hearing from professionals employed in the work we were reading literature about. However, in terms of concrete deliverables, it was rather unclear what was learned.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to another student. The flexibility and content of the course would make it interesting for students from all areas of the University."
