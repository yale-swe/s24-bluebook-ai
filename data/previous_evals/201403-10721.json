   "comments": [
    "The only \"warning\" I would have for a fellow student is that there there is a large amount of fairly difficult Latin to be done with little emphasis given to translation itself. This is made clear in the syllabus and in the first class so one should know what they are getting, and should indeed take the class if they are looking for a discussion-based course.",
    "This has the potential to be a great course. I was initially very excited to learn about Livy from one of the most prominent Livy scholars in the country, however, the structure of the course should be significantly revamped. I think it might be better to present the course in the style of a seminar next time, in hopes that it attracts less people (and people more interested in the subject). I got the sense that this course was full of people trying to fulfill their language requirement, and I think that their lack of preparation\/engagement with the material brought down the overall level of the course.",
    "Definitely I will. This is the best course you wish to take if you want to read some serious Livy with guidance."

    "Not only did I gain a much stronger understanding of Livy and his work, but also of historiography as it pertains to antiquity in general.",
    "This course helped to improve both my latin prose reading ability and my understanding of latin historiography."
