    "FREN 121 is L2 with L1 review. Since there is more material to cover, it goes at a faster pace than L2. The daily workbook assignments are time consuming and tedious. Overall, it's your standard language course at Yale. I took it as my first language course at Yale and enjoyed it.",
    "LOT OF HOMEWORK. holymoly. If you're gunna take this class, practice your guilty face in the mirror for when the prof asks if you have done the homework. like try and look like a sad puppy. The pity card worked for me with moderate levels of success.",
    "Covers the basics of grammar very well. A lot of material but effective.",
    "It is a lot of material but I think I will be nicely prepared for French 3. The French department is one of the best in the world and I can see why. As long as you do the work, it will be fine.",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone interested in learning French."
