    "I gained hands-on experience with data preparation and software for building and interpreting phylogenetic trees.",
    "What I learned was very helpful, because I'll probably keep using at least some of these tools. However, I am not sure that I needed a lab in which to learn them.I do think that having a final paper and a final exam (even if the exam for the lab got canceled a few days before it was supposed to take place) for both the class and the lab was a bit overwhelming, especially when we didn't get any feedback on our topics (which is basically just a recipe for procrastinating as long as possible). It would have been nice to have, say, homeworks for the lab section and a final paper for the class, but not two final papers and two exams.",
    "Extremely applicable for my dissertation as well as everyone else in the class."
