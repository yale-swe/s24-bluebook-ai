   "comments": [
    "You're probably taking it as a requirement, or because you really like film. In either case, it won't be a drag.",
    "Professor Casetti is a wonderful lecturer who is clearly passionate about is subject, for this reason alone you should take the class.",
    "great class, not that demanding, and definitely interesting enough.",
    "It's a little hard to follow Casetti at times, but definitely take your theory requirement with him.",
    "Take if you want an overview of early film theory. It makes you think about film in ways you've never thought before, but don't look for any answers or it will drive you mad",
    "A good introduction to theory overall, and definitely applicable to many other theories across many other disciplines. Unfortunately, if you're not a theory person, much of the material may be difficult to work with. Also, be warned\u0097your experience in lecture and discussion section are very dependent on your classmates. If theyaren't engaged\/don't want to speak up, you're in for a very long day.",
    "I highly recommend this course, not just as a way of meeting the theory requirement for the film studies major, but also as an excellent class in its own right, and fascinating for anyone interested in the history of film and film theory as an academic discipline. Professor Casetti is fantastic, clearly a brilliant thinker (he's one of the most prominent academics in the field of early film theory, and the class is built around one of his published books) and also just a character -- it's fun just to listen to him talk. The workload is not bad at all: weekly readings and a few enjoyable written assignments."
