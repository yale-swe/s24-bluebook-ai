    "Yes! Hebrew is very well taught and a fun language.",
    "A fantastic class in which you will not just learn a tremendous amount, but take pleasure in doing so. I would definitely recommend this class.",
    "A good class - be prepared for a lot of work (maybe more reasonable than L1), but really great to progress in the study of Hebrew",
    "I highly recommend this course. I have come out of it with good speaking and reading skills. I am amazed by the incredible progress our class has made in such a short time. Furthermore, the class is very close knit."
