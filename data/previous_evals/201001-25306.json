   "comments": [
    "Yes-- take this class! You will learn a lot of information without being stressed.",
    "Its an \"easy\" class, but that being said I still learned a lot. Definitely take it if you are at all interested in going into the health field because you will interact with patients that may not speak any english at all!",
    "Take it. It's straight-forward and simple. You'll learn words that you need to know.",
    "I definitely recommend this class for anyone interested, especially premeds. Carreras is great and I found the class itself to be less demanding than my L3 and L4 Spanish courses. In the class you will learn about the different body systems and diseases in Spanish, so it is more than just a vocabulary building course. The class work consists of turning in a paragraph response everyday, one midterm, a group oral presentation at the end of the year, and the final. For the final, we had the option of taking an exam (similar to the midterm) or writing a 5-8 page paper on a health topic of our choice. In all, I was never stressed about the work and Prof. Carreras is so nice and understanding about everything.",
    "I would definitely recommend the course to anyone interested in learning medical Spanish, whether or not they intend to be a doctor (although almost everyone in the class is pre-med). There are writing assignments for each class, but they are very manageable.",
    "A fun easy way to learn some very useful medical vocabulary. Each day we'd discuss a different medical topic (cancer, incontinence, breaks v. dislocations, for example) and learn the accompanying vocabulary. While this is very much a vocab course and your speaking won't really improve, my comprehension definitely did due to the professor's fast speaking style and the many videos we watched. It's also really easy and pretty enjoyable. Recommend!",
    "Solid class. I learned a lot about medicine and spanish. Many things I learned, I didn't know in English. The class is very structured which can be constricting, but provides a clear sense of what you should know and makes it so you learn the material well.The class is early in the morning and you have to write a page essay basically twice a week which can be annoying, but ultimately it is probably helpful. Carreras is really nice and cool and super interesting. Also, she's a fair grader.I recommend this class for those interested in medicine with an appropriate spanish background.",
    "This course is a surprising and challenging plunge into the Spanish medical world--all of it. Diagnosis, symptoms, treatments, cultural preferences of patients, histories of recent diseases, and biological pathways occurring in every system of the body all appear in the course. And considering that these are concepts difficult to master in English, the satisfaction you get from mastering--writing and speaking--about them in Spanish is amazing. And you will master in a low key and fun to attend (even at 9AM) class.",
    "Take it!",
    "This is a good course to take if you have reached the L5 level and do not particularly enjoy conversational spanish, especially speaking in front of your classmates for extended periods of time. Overall, it's an easy way to take an L5 course and learn about medical terms in Spanish.",
    "You learn interesting vocab if you are interested in health\/medicine. However, it is definitely the easiest L5 spanish class I have taken here and you will not improve your speaking and writing skills. Our class was also the largest Spanish class I have been in here, with about 25 students in it. I think if the class were smaller there would have been more opportunity for better conversation. It felt like a high school Spanish class.",
    "I would definitely recommend taking this course, particularly if you are premed and would like to be able to speak to your future patients in Spanish. It is not difficult if you just do the work - overall a great course.",
    "Very good and interesting class, not too difficult either (note, I took it for Cr\/D\/F).",
    "I would recommend this class to someone who wants exposure to the vocabulary and the familiarity. I would try to see if you could ask the professor what topics are going to be included or see if you can get the topics from someone who took the class already. Other than that, its pretty simple-you write a summary for each reading you do, one midterm, a group presentation, and a final or paper. The professor is a really sweet woman, so that makes the class less intense than other Spanish classes I've taken...",
    "Loved this class-so fun and learned a lot!",
    "This is an AMAZING class that truly comes in handy when working in a hospital in a Latin American country. You not only learn how to say certain things in Spanish but also how to talk to patients of different cultures, what new customs one must adopt.",
    "I would definitely recommend to a friend. Take if you need Spanish medical vocabulary in the future.",
    "I would recommend this class for someone who has a decent grasp of the language and is interested in basic health and anatomy. It probably won't improve your Spanish, but you'll learn some new vocab and it requires minimal work.",
    "You read about a health issue, answer comprehension questions and type up a simple paragraph for every class. Take this class! It's great! L5, low stress, nice teacher.",
    "I definitely recommend this class. Interesting material (learn some medical terms in Spanish; learn about some concepts you didn't even know in English), nice professor, and very manageable workload. A good class whether you're pre-med or not."
