   "comments": [
    "Great professor, great books, great class. That said, the grading is harder than in other class, so be aware of that coming in. The expectations are higher here.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. It looks at literary works through the lens of exile--but this is in broad terms. Exiles can include immigrants, refugees, social exiles, etc. It presents a wide range of perspectives, interesting texts, and thoughtful discussions. It will improve writing and literary analysis skills, and gives a lot of freedom when choosing essay topics. ENGL 115 03 is one of my favorite courses I have taken so far because it was enjoyable and taught me a lot.",
    "Absolutely. It's worth getting up early (I took it as a 9am) great way to start the day.",
    "Excellent course. I am currently doing journalism in Bosnia thanks to the exposure I got in this course."
