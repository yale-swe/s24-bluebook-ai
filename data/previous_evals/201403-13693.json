    "The overall expectations and marking structure were clear. However there were sometimes things that weren't marked incorrect on homework that were subsequently marked incorrect on an exam. I feel like the homework markings should accurately identify expectations for exams, so as to allow students to best prepare.",
    "The syllabus clearly stated the expectations for homework and tests.",
    "Which homework is assigned and when it is due is very clearly laid out, but exactly what's expected on the homework is not. It's not always clear how much is required."

    "The lectures really cleared up any questions I had based on reading the textbook. It was always very easy to ask questions.",
    "It is often too tempting to just read along with the text instead of listening to what Ben is saying since they are so similar. I think it would be very helpful to read in advance, maybe even do part or all of the assignments ahead of time so that class can be used for discussion of the material. Right now, class periods feel like little more than an assigned time to have Ben read us the textbook. While this is still somewhat useful, I think the time can be put to better use if we read and attempt a problem or 2 before the start of class, since that is when we have processed and begin to understand the material. Only then do we come up with good questions to ask. Maybe it could be helpful to have a brief review\/Q&A session covering the previous class' material at the start of each class?"

    "While it was hard to keep up with the homework during heavy work times in production assignments, the homework is where i learned the most. Having a two week grace period for all homework is a really great thing that takes the pressure off and the volume not feel too horrible.",
    "Never too much; never too little. It was easy to do the homework in the time allotted.",
    "I felt as though the workload took up a regular and large part of our time outside of class, and that it was a challenge to manage at times. However I also felt as though there was not enough homework. More practice would have led to better results on my part, but I'm not sure how more time could be found to dedicate to that.",

    "They provided a fair and in-depth questioning to test our ability to apply the concepts in a realistic manner (with the text available).",
    "The test questions were mostly fair questions as I would expect from a test on those chapters. However, it seemed like there were a few low-point questions that were there to test if we could find some random tidbit hidden in the text (for instance, something about a rule of thumb for estimating the weight of plywood) more than it tested our understanding of the material. It's a minor note, but worth mentioning."

   "comments": [
    "The classes is excellent overall. I particularly enjoyed the moments in class where production examples were used to highlight principles in the book. My only suggestion would be to inject more production-related examples that carried the class and carry various calculations on the white board rather than look at examples in the book. I find that I will always look at the examples while working on homework anyway, so I don't find it as necessary to go through some of the examples during class.",
    "The most important lesson in the computation was to always use the units, and to use the same format in running the equations: write the equation with the variables, then write the equation with the numbers substituted for the variables (with absolutely no calculation done, even simple. subtraction or addition), then run the calculation. This made problem solving where an answer went wrong much simpler. It also made it easier to understand what was going on in a more general sense. Clarity in doing the math is essential. Adding notes about what is happening (e.g. \"CF not used b\/c beam is Southern Pine\") was also useful. This is a simple lesson, but it made a real difference in engaging with the material. Some of the material may benefit from physical demonstration. The tension and compression faces of a beam, for example, could easily be demonstrated by writing \"tension\" on one face and \"compression\" on the other of an elastic material, such as a foam cushion. Again, a simplistic example, but it may help some pupils to better grasp the basic concepts. Some actual beams and columns could make a course on structural design a little more accessible to people that haven't really been exposed to the material before. If nothing else, the suggested summer reading of \"Why Buildings Fall Down\" should be encouraged more strongly. Hitting the ground running makes a big difference for First Year students in their First Semester.",
    "I think this is a great course and although it was a struggle for me I learned a lot. I owe this not only to my professor but also to a wonderful TA who always went out oh his way to meet with us day nights or weekends. Having the 2 week grace period for turning in homework was fantastic. Although I always strove to get it in on time, there were some weeks where having a few extra days penalty free made all the difference. My one complaint was not getting out first test back before having to take the second one. Knowing how I did on problems on the first test would have help on the second. However I understand the circumstances and reasons why it was not possible.",
    "I enjoyed the course, and would only recommend a tighter feedback loop for tests, and possibly a chance to review homework upon its return to catch why mistakes were made early on so they don't track through multiple homeworks.",
    "This was a great class. I really loved it.",
    "I found it most helpful when I was able to review homework with the TA and talk through my errors. If there was an opportunity to re-do homework following that kind of a meeting for increased points it would insentivise further practice when the opportunity presented itself. Probably not the best idea for people who are missing a point here or there, but perhaps when there is a failing grade on a homework assignment it would be helpful both for the students learning and for their grade.",
    "The single biggest improvement I can suggest for this class is to reduce the turnaround time on homework and tests. Since the lectures progress so steadily and the homework follows each class, it would be immensely beneficial to have each homework assignment back the next day, so as to review it and correct any misunderstandings before completing the next homework assignment, which often builds directly upon the previous assignment. I'm aware that what I'm suggesting is a fairly large workload for someone, but in a subject where each concept tends to be stacked pretty squarely upon the previous, catching misunderstandings quickly and correcting them promptly would help keep people from floundering."
