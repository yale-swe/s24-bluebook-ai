   "comments": [
    "A solid survey of a very unique aspect of Japanese Culture. I wish more courses like this were offered at Yale. This was well taught with lots of different media used. I really liked that all of the readings were available online and that screenings played a role in every class. Professor Fleming was accessible and friendly (and very knowledgeable about the material). This is a great course and I'm surprised more students didn't take it.Take this if you are interested in world theater or Japanese culture -- it really covers lots of material. Kabuki is fascinating.",
    "A good class. Professor Fleming is a nice guy, but his voice is extremely monotonous. The subject matter is quite interesting, but it's hard to stay awake during all the long clips of actors moving and speaking in slow motion. The work load is totally reasonable: two short response papers and a final 15-pager.",
    "This course is a broad overview of kabuki, traditional Japanese theater. It's a fascinating subject, and the course gives you a ton of information about it (although not always in the most structured way). The readings sometimes felt repetitive, but usually contained useful information. Take it if you're interested in theater or Japanese culture--you'll learn a lot about both.",
    "I would recommend the course to students hoping to learn more about Eastern theater or take an interesting course. Be prepared to read 150-250 pages per week. That said, the professor provides them through CV2."
