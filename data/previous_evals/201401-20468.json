   "comments": [
    "This is a class that you get out as much as you put in -- there is the opportunity to learn a lot and look at what could be boring material in a new and exciting way. At the same time, there is not a lot of work outside of class so it would also be pretty easy to slide by. I highly recommend it.",
    "I would certainly recommend this course to a student interested in architecture, art history, or italian history but especially to a student not necessarily interested in any of those topics because the course really is accessible to anyone who can think critically without the intimidation of an intense small-scale seminar.",
    "DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS OR ANY CLASS WITH DEAN G. The only case in which you should take a class with her is if you are in Berkeley and she knows you, otherwise you will not be treated favorably. Also, very little was actually taught in this class and although there is little to no work, grading is unpredictable. Don't put yourself through this pain.",
    "Buildings and Power is an awesome class. You learn a lot about the way power was expressed through Italian architecture, and what an important role art played in the politics of medieval and renaissance Italy. I would highly recommend this class to another student, under the condition that he is genuinely interested in engaging with the material. It is easy to look at the workload (a review question before the midterm and final, and two exams) and think that this will be an easy class. Professor Genoni has high expectations for the work students produce, and is not afraid to grade you harshly. The way to be successful in this class is to come without your laptop, to leave your phone put away, and to jot notes down on the notes handout she provides every class (and which has all the information you need anyway). Professor Genoni is an extremely nice lady, but she commands respect. Students who skip classes or like to be on their computer during class will not do well in Buildings and Power. But students who are genuinely interested in the material will excel and get a lot out of the course.",
    "hell.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. I think some people made the mistake of thinking that because Dean Genoni is such an engaging lecturer and nice person that she would allow them to slack off in class and in preparing for exams, and were annoyed that she was not an easy grader. (She was a perfectly fair grader.) I would only tell the student to whom I would recommend the course to follow along closely in lecture and ask questions about topics that seem unclear. The reading assignments were all really fascinating.",
    "I would recommend HSAR 291 01 to another student for its content and professor.",
    "TAKE IT",
    "A course that is probably appealing only to certain kinds of students--specifically the type that wants everything to be explained in terms of some modern, American analogy. Example: the professor says things like \"Florence and Siena are like Harvard and Yale!\" It's frankly quite disturbing whenever I heard such comparisons, as if we couldn't try to understand those time periods on their own terms. One can be staring quite meditatively at the images on screen, the imagination transporting one back to medieval Italy... or to Avignon during the Great Schism... only to be rudely interrupted by the professor loudly exclaiming(and yes, the loud part is very literal here) \"SEE HOW CRAZY AWESOME THIS IS!\" Yes, the course is approachable--but only because so many complex and beautiful things have been stripped from it. If you're the type who loves the elevation of art as described by Vasari or Pater, this is not the art history course for you.",
    "if you're really interested. it's super gutty so that tells you a lot about the other people in the class. maybe cred\/d if you really care",
    "It depends on what you are looking for. If you are taking this class just to get a credit then go for it. If you are looking to take it to be a class that will blow your mind and make you think about things differently, then this is not the class to take. For many what is a positive about this course is the structure. light reading...Dean G doesn't giving your reading that is useless, which is nice. two short assignments. Two midterms. No papers\/no finals. This is something to legitimately consider. Downsides: if you are never on time don't bother. Dean G is super strict about tardiness. I had to hustle to get to class on time, which meant walking into lecture panting twice a week. not ideal. I think the power over\/power to concept was inorganic, forced. It made it difficult to buy into the lectures.",
    "It was a very simplistic synthesis of really complicated material. Dean G. approached the material, usually from the Renaissance but sometimes even antiquity, from a modern perspective, which I'm not sure is as clear cut as she made it out to be. Nevertheless, she has a lot of valuable insight about the relationship between architecture and power structures.",
    "An amazing course, one you should definitely take if you want an easy but interesting fifth class or want to try something new. The vast majority of the class are not art history majors and it sometimes shows when the professor has to re-explain things. The tests are very reasonable and you only need a few days to prepare for them. It was possible to get over 100% on the midterm so this definitely qualifies as a gut.",
    "Buildings and Power in Italy is an in-depth view of how the politics of Renaissance Italy affected the architecture created and vice versa. It is an extremely interesting and accessible topic. I would definitely recommend the class!",
    "I would recommend this course to students interested in either architecture or poly sci and want to have it presented through a different medium. The combination is an interesting one, and the presentation is enjoyable.",
    "An introduction to Italian architecture (mostly from the 14th - 17th centuries), and an exploration of how rulers used art and architecture to serve political aims. A fascinating course with a fairly light workload - maybe not for you if you like examining art in super-high detail. Dean G's enthusiasm is contagious.",
    "Pretty broad coverage of a really neat topic, and you get to learn not just about the buildings, which are cool, but more importantly about philosophy, people, and politics. Definitely a class worth taking, and the lessons learned here apply to a ton of different other classes and discussions.",
    "After taking eight semesters of Yale classes, I would rank this class as the worst by a wide margin. Prof. Genoni is simply not prepared to teach a lecture class at Yale. In a seminar, I can imagine that her outgoing personality and desire to build relationships with her students would serve her very well. However, her communication skills are not strong enough for a lecture class. Her written instructions often conflicted with her oral instructions from class, and she penalized students for failing to follow what she believed to be the correct instructions. Her refusal to acknowledge this discrepancy as a problem was frustrating and certainly resulted in many students being stunned upon learning their grades. Despite her claims that \"she was trying to make it easy,\" Prof. Genoni's actions spoke to the opposite. Her exams were needlessly long and confusing, but she did try to correct this on the final. It may appear like a light workload, but the overly harsh grading and subsequent (also harshly graded) \"bonus\" assignments made it more work than I had imagined. Unless you're a history of art major, simply avoid the trouble this class brings.",
    "Fantastic course! The class is really accessible and interesting even if you have no background in art history. It looks at a small number of incredible buildings, and discusses them as pieces of political propaganda, putting them in really interesting context. There's not a lot of work, just a straightforward midterm and final and a short review assignment before each of them. All you have to do is come to class and put a little work in before the exams, and you'll learn a lot about the artwork. Probably the best art history classes I've taken!",
    "You must take this class. It's Like entering a parallel universe - dean g is an incredible teacher and the lectures will never let you down. I left each day learning something new and how to apply it. I really had fun in this class.",
    "More work than the movies to start the semester suggest.",
    "Take it!",
    "This course is an interesting and exciting way to learn about renaissance italian history through architecture and the use of power. Taught by a great professor, the class is extremely engaging.",
    "Sometimes moves a bit slow, but a good intro to art history.",
    "Definitely recommend to other students.",
    "I would recommend this course to students of all majors looking to broaden their horizons. the course does not specifically feel like an art history course. A fun look at Italian architecure.",
    "Do not take this class.",
    "Absolutely take this class! As a senior looking for a fun, but very interesting and worthwhile fourth credit, I found this to be perfect. It's also astounding how much art\/social history knowledge you get under your belt by the end of the semester.",
    "I recommend this class to everyone at Yale. I was not sure what I would think of learning about buildings in Italy at first, but that was changed after the first lecture. The professor is incredible and the material is fascinating. You learn so much about architecture and the thoughts behind it in such a little time. You are a fool if you don't enroll in this class!",
    "Everything will be great if you go to class. Just go to class and take good notes and you will do exceptionally well.",
    "I would not recommend this course to any Yale college student. The material was not difficult but grading was overly harsh on the assessments. The professor significantly reduced the effectiveness of lectures by attempting to make the course about her rather than the material.",
    "It isn't so much of a study of architecture as it is a study of power. This class is a great introduction into what Art History is all about. I highly recommend this class!",
    "This is an awesome class! Take it!!!! Professor Genoni is super energetic and enthusiastic about the material, and she makes everything really easy and clear to understand. If you have interest in Italy, you should absolutely take this class. Even if you don't have any interest, at least shop the class, and you'll probably find that Professor Genoni is reason enough to take it. All of the information you need to know is taught in lecture, so if you just go to class, you will do well. This course gives a broad overview of the history major Italian architecture and art movements as the relate to the cities\/regions in which they were popular and used. You will learn a lot if you take this class.",
    "Love it. Amazing course completely out of my comfort zone as a science major, but so accessible via Dean G's teaching style. If you think Italian architectural history might bore you, this professor will make it exciting and lovable. The material is so cool (my friends and I throw around references to powerful monuments all the time now) and I would absolutely recommend the class. Its only weakness I would say is having a bit of arbitrariness in terms of grading, but the material itself and the teaching is awesome. Take it!",
    "I would not recommend this class. While the material is interesting the teacher is aggressive and unapproachable.",
    "RUN. This was not just me, others share my opinion. She had 3 teaching fellows for 100+ students and graded EVERYTHING herself. She taught material she wrote her dissertation on and then got personally offended if you didn't understand it. Don't even THINK about disagreeing with something she teaches you even though they are all completely arbitrary opinions that we don't know are true. It will seem easy and like a good\/interesting course, but it will RUIN your gpa and you will regret it for the rest of your life. RUN FAR AWAY.",
    "Take this class if you want to learn a little bit about Italian architecture in the context of the many struggles for power during the 14th and 15th centuries. This class was perfect for a non-art history major since Dean G explains the material well. She is a very energetic professor and approachable professor who can make something as boring as a buttress seem pretty interesting.",
    "This is a GREAT course. Although a little off the beaten path, I found that I could apply what I was learning to many other areas (like my history classes and modern politics). Its title (Buildings and Power in Italy) is fairly self-explanatory: you look at buildings in Italy from 1200-1600ish and how they convey the terms and expression of power at the time. Also discussed is how famous works of art, particularly statues (like Michelangelo's David), were incorporated into power struggles. Lectures consist of a lot of pictures, which are crucial to understanding the material - don't think you can get away with skipping many classes. The readings were interesting, but many of them were not necessary to doing well in the course. Dean G is engaging and enthusiastic; she makes every effort to ensure her students fully grasp the concepts. I would recommend this course to everyone!"
