   "comments": [
    "Take the class if you want to read the books. They're excellent, and aside from that there is very little work.",
    "Do you write for the YDN? Nope? That's okay, this class is for you. Do you know nothing about the political scene for the past 50 years? That this class! The reading is pretty easy, the papers are fun to write, and the conversations are a lot of fun, especially during an election cycle.",
    "This class was a good combination of American history and politics. I felt like I learned a lot, though probably more about the former. I didn't know that much about election history in the second half of the 20th century going in, but I felt much more comfortable with at least some of them at the end. I enjoyed the discussion as well, and I think that's in large part due to Professor Stoehr's role in leading it. He's very willing to have students disagree with him (and encourages them to do so), and it works well for a class like this. I recommend it!",
    "Definitely! The readings are fascinating. And class discussions are always incredible",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone interested in the history of presidential politics in the U.S. and especially to any aspiring journalists. The workload for this course was definitely manageable and the readings are great.",
    "Not a journalism class. You read a bunch of classics in the journalists-write-about-elections world. Some readings are pretty dry, but you can get by without doing the entire reading, which is a relief. If you're normally not into politics, the news, trivia, or the YDN, you might get annoyed with the name dropping that happens quite frequently, but I'd consider the class just for the professor. A doable fifth class, even though it's a seminar."
