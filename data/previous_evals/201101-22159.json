    "This is a class that is definitely worth taking. Susan is a great professor; she invests a lot in her students, is very helpful and energetic during the Friday lab sessions. We went on field trips to some interesting places, like the Tony Smith house and a granite quarry. You can be very creative with the assignments and the final research project was pretty painless. As an architecture student, it's nice to spend more time in the shop, learn a few new techniques and gain familiarity with equipment\/ tools. Non-architecture students enjoy the class as well. Materials is pretty relaxed overall, but can make for really long Fridays if you don't have much to work on in lab (of course you should always be working on something, but it can be hard at the start of each design project when you're still not settled on a design). Lectures are usually very interesting (slides included some impressive images detailing a variety of innovative usages for both common and obscure materials). I opted for Materials over Energy and Environment, but both are goodclasses to take.",
    "materials is great for architecture majors to understand how to use materials in conventional and potential ways. it was very fun and fundamental."
