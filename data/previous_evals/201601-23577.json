    "Great topic that needs to be discussed more in public health. Necessary transition to global NCDs as opposed to solely focusing on communicable diseases and the Big Three. The only thing I didn't like about it was the group assignment - I don't feel I learned much from it, and it was more of a hassle than anything.",
    "This was my favorite course at YSPH; I absolutely loved it. Noncommunicable disease is a timely topic that doesn't get much attention (in public health in general and at YSPH), so it was great to have a course focused solely on this. Experienced guest lecturers rounded out an excellent course.",
    "Great course overall!",
    "Great introductory course to NCDs and global health, for those with no previous background. Perhaps less time spent on introductory lectures and more on specific topics.",
    "Strengths: great introduction to the intersection of global health and NCDs generally; lots of topics covered; the interventions part of the course was particularly interesting Weaknesses: for those who have taken an introductory global health course beforehand, the first part of the course is repetitive",
    "The dialogue in class was great and the weekly readings were always relevant and helpful in understanding the material.",
    "Excellent! I'm so glad this course is being offered at YSPH",
    "a fresh new perspective about a critical public health issue. the issue of our generation. fantastically compelling problem to tackle",
    "Amazing course design and execution. It was a comprehensive mix of relevant weekly readings, experts in the field of global NCDs, thought-provoking lectures and group\/individual work on topics of students' interests."

    "Instructor: Nicola Hawley \u00a0Truly cares about each student and knows her material",
    "Instructor: Nicola Hawley \u00a0Nicky provided excellent feedback that pushed us to consider many different aspect of NCD research (including the validity of data and the potential for interventions). Her lectures were engaging, and she always asked thought-provoking questions.",
    "Instructor: Nicola Hawley \u00a0FAntastic person inside and out. She is a greater listener and phenomenal professor.",
    "Instructor: Nicola Hawley \u00a0Dr. Hawley is a joy to listen to and very receptive to students' feedback.",
    "Instructor: Nicola Hawley \u00a0Extremely sweet professor, clearly very knowledgeable and humble at the same time. Very engaging, passionate, and understanding. I cannot think of any \"weaknesses\".",
    "Instructor: Nicola Hawley \u00a0Her teaching style was excellent. She made conversation easy and comfortable in the classroom. She was also clearly extremely knowledgeable about everything she taught and she made sure to ask for students' feedback often. Prof. Hawley is a fantastic instructor.",
    "Instructor: Nicola Hawley \u00a0Dr Hawley is amazing!! So glad that she is with us at YSPH.",
    "Instructor: Nicola Hawley \u00a0Well-read, informative, accessible, approachable, committed to doing well.",
    "Instructor: Nicola Hawley \u00a0Amazing teacher! Her enthusiasm for the issues of global NCDs was infectious! It doesn't get any better when students move from indifference or discouragement on the outlook of NCDs burden to enthusiasm to take the challenge of tackling NCDs burden head on, despite the complexities of the issue."

   "comments": [
    "Great intro to a topic not often talked about at YSPH (although it should be)",
    "I would highly recommend this course to any student who wants to learn more about NCDs. So often, the focus is on the \"big three\" (HIV, TB, and malaria), and we don't consider how much of a burden NCDs are, especially to low- and middle-income countries. A really valuable course that highlights a major issue in global health.",
    "This is a very comprehensive course about Global NCDs. Anyone who aspires to be leader and advocate for NCDs should take this course. For those of you are not interested in \"global health' or have no 'global experience' or don't like NCDs, I highly recommend that you take this course. NCDs are not only an treat to human health in the United States, but also around the world. It is important to learn, understand, about be aware of global NCDs because this burden of disease affects the existng agenda for communicable diseases, all aspects of society and huamn development. You will not regret taking this course, trust me.",
    "I do recommend this course because it provides a great overview for why we should focus on NCDs, especially in a global context.",
    "Great course overall, for those who have taken global health at an introductory level, the first part of the course is not going to be very new information. The second part of the course, however, is great.",
    "I would absolutely recommend it to all students, with or without a foundational knowledge of NCDs or global health. I would describe it as an NCD crash course.",
    "Intellectually stimulating and unique learning experience.",
    "a must take course. don't miss the opportunity to take it with Hawley.",
    "Yes take it! The knowledge is not wasted, whatever your degree of interest might be on global NCDs. You only broaden your exposure to the issues of NCDs burden."
