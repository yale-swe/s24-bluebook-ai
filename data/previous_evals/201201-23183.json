    "Take 115 with Heisel. He was SO AWESOME!! (Actually, you can't, because he's not going to be teaching that class.)",
    "If Andy is here next year, take this class with him. The readings are incredible and he is an amazing teacher. There is a lot of reading, but it's all interesting and very rewarding. Lolita and Vanishing Point are now two of my favorite books. In general, though, take English 115. The class usually will have a good vibe. There are generally no English majors, but everyone in the class loves to read and write, and that is the difference I found between 115 and 114 (which was a nightmare in the two weeks I was there). Put simply: take English 115, and take class with Andy.",
    "YES! Unfortunately Andy is leaving, so I'm not sure how the class will be next semester...but the books we covered and the overall theme of the class were interesting standing alone.",
    "I would definitely recommend English 115. The readings were interesting and manageable and the assignments were well spaced. This is a really great class if you want to focus on improving your writing style.",
    "It's a great class. It really helps you to develop your writing skills in respect to literary analysis and close\/analytical reading.",
    "If you need to take English for a requirement, take this. Pick lit 115 over 114 if you enjoy responding to reading instead of pure writing. The text in this section is really interesting and diverse.",
    "Andrew said \" they're not literature majors but they're less hostile towards literature\" an that made me and the rest of the class laugh. If you want to experience a literature class at Yale but nr be swamped by lit majors, consider 115 an option to immerse yourself in literature",
    "The course material in this section of English 115 is especially engaging\/interesting, and Andy leads a superb section. He is always willing to meet students one-on-one and is very helpful in guiding students through the process of crafting your essays (if needed). I would highly recommend any course taught by Professor Heisel!",
    "English 115 is a very interesting course. You read various works of literature pertaining to a specific theme, and have discussions on the readings. You also write essays on these works, and the topics are very open and allow you to choose subjects within the literature that you find interesting. Very good course, teaches you how to write and think analytically. I would definitely recommend it; Judge, Jury, and Executioner with Andy Heisel is a particularly good course, since Andy is a witty and interesting teacher and the books within the course itself are very good.",
    "Take it! My writing definitely improved."
