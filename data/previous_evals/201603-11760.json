    "This was good overview into the director's relationship with the text, discussions of how to work with actors and tell a specific story.",

    "This was a great collaborative room with a lot of discussion amongst the small class and with Toni. I wish that certain assignments had been more specific in instruction. I particularly enjoyed bringing in the two scenes for both first-workings and revisions.",
    "The exercises in this class can be somewhat general when it comes to purpose. If you're someone who, like me, needs to know why we're doing something, be prepared to be frustrated. Toni believes in learning by doing. Trust in her process: you will see results."

    "Yes! Take this course! Toni is wonderful and readily tailors the work to fit your learning needs. Be warned, though: she's a stickler for deadlines. There's no flexibility when it comes to getting work done, unless you have a dean's excuse on hand."
