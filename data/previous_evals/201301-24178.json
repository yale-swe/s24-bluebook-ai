    "TAKE IT",
    "It's one of the best classes I've taken at Yale, if not the best class. If you're into songwriting, then this is course you absolutely have to take (assuming it gets offered again! I hope it does!) You write ~6 songs throughout the semester (each with a specific prompt,) and do daily journaling that gets your head in a songwriting mindset. You also write a few short papers and do some useful readings. It's rare to approach songwriting in a somewhat-academic context, and this class allows you to do so. It's the best!",
    "This is a class about songwriting! Learn to write songs, or improve your pre-existing craft.",
    "Essentially a creative writing class with interesting (sometimes famous) guest speakers. You'll get the chance to write and share six songs, but don't expect to get incisive feedback or experience an intellectually stimulating examination of what good songwriting is. You'll write some songs and share them and get congratulated on them.",
    "See Question 1.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class to another student. If you are at all interested in writing more contemporary music, this class is exactly what you want. The class pushes you as a songwriter and gives you an opportunity to really familiarize yourself with the craft of songwriting. Mike Errico is a great teacher, and his guidance makes all the difference.",
    "Take it, its a great way to improve your songwriting and your creative side, in general.",
    "This class is a whirlwind of songwriting amazingness that can take a song dabbler and put them on track to becoming a songwriting powerhouse. We covered and created a TON of material and it was definitely a lot of work, but it was so incredibly worth the time. It was probably my favorite class I've taken at Yale. I definitely recommend it!",
    "In this class, you'll have to write a lot of songs using methods and perspectives that are new to you. Class time will be split between workshopping your classmates' work and having open conversations with invited guests from all areas of the music world: songwriters, lawyers, journalists, etc. You'll also have to keep a daily journal. I would definitely recommend this class to anyone serious about songwriting or the music business. You'll be artistically challenged and will come out of the class with several new tools and methods to approach creating and distributing your art. It's an experience worth having!",
    "Yes, especially if you are musically inclined. This class is different from composition classes at Yale because it lets you write popular\/rock\/country styles. I had never written a song before and wanted to try it out and it was a great forum for help\/support and a place to become friends with other musicians and songwriters on campus. It is a decent amount of work, but it's not super challenging (you set the level of difficulty), just time-consuming.",
    "I would recommend it to any songwriter because it will challenge them. It also forces them to write, and expand their previous thinking about the music business.",
    "Kinda but not really. It was pretty unorganized. But it was cool to meet Amanda Palmer.",
    "My favorite class I've taken at Yale by far.1. This course dramatically improved my songwriting. Both the lessons and the exposure to other songwriters caused me to think in new ways.2. For the final paper, we were basically asked to sum up the main lessons from our class so that we never have to forget them. I thought this was fantastic.3. By joining this class, you join a community. I went to my classmates' concerts (which were great and made my semester a lot more fun). I'd play music with them outside of class etc.5. Mr. Errico's feedback on songs was excellent and provocative. That is, even if you don't end up taking a certain suggestion of his, you will still become a better songwriter by considering it.6. Mr. Errico brought wonderful guests who shared diverse experiences, which were relevant and valuable to us.7. Mr. Errico is as dedicated a teacher as you will ever have. He often stayed hours late to help us, and would offer to be with us \"until the lights go out in the building.\" He even sent us notifications about internship opportunities, which I've never heard of a teacher doing. Basically. Mr. Errico is someone who will go above and beyond for his students.Take this course.",
    "If you are a songwriter\/producer\/artist\/music maker at Yale, you should take this course. It was the best course I have ever taken here, and I learned so much about song structure, form, and the music business. The guest speakers were all interesting and established in their respective fields and give you a lot of different perspectives from within the fluid music business. Take this course now."
