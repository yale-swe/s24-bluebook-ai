    "This class is an obscene amount of work for a credit. You have webwork (which can be very tricky), a pset, and are basically teaching yourself most of the material week to week. I think its incredibly unfair how much is assigned for this class. The actual instruction time is limited, which adds an extra burden to how much time this class requires. Also, you receive little to no feedback with work that has been turned in. Math is all about feedback, and when I receive my graded p-set back I have no idea why the grader has taken off points. I also did not appreciate the snarky comments left on my tests after they had been graded. I am trying my best, and you writing rude remarks on my answers doesn't make me more excited about math. This class is probably one of the worst STEM classes I have ever taken at Yale because of the heavy workload coupled with minimal feedback. I don't pay 60,000 + a year for a horrible learning experience, and that is exactly what math 112 was. I suggest people creating this course think long and hard about ways to make it a less painful experience for those taking it. This is also a horrible introduction to the math department at Yale because most students leave with a taste of frustration in their mouths.",
    "This is a teach yourself type course and I think that is a big weakness. Not much teaching done by the teacher it is more reviewing the info that you are supposed to learn by yourself the night before. Big weakness of this course.",
    "The strength is in the organized teaching plan. I appreciate the in-class handouts that are excellent in guiding us through the entire content of a lecture. The weakness is the innate lack of attraction towards students. Many are taking this course simply to fulfill some requirements, having mastered the contents of the course even before taking it."

   "comments": [
    "I would absolutely not recommend math 112 to another student unless they were required to take it. The workload is unreasonable, and its poorly taught. This class has nothing going for it. If you have to take it, best of luck.",
    "Definitely not, the course is not fair when it comes to grades since there is absolutely no curve. Also, the reward you get back for all the work you have to put in is not worth it.",
    "I do not recommend this class for anyone who is proficient in Calculus B\/C but nonetheless wants an easy course to fulfill academic requirements. It will be extremely boring for you. If you have a genuine interest in Calculus B\/C, and have not yet learned it, this is the best course available."
