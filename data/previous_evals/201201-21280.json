    "Fun class that takes you to posh places to see art.",
    "This was an overview of the history of the Royal Academy in England. The gallery visits alone are worthwhile, but keep in mind the narrow focus of the course.",
    "The Art Academy in England was a Yale-in-London study abroad course that looked at the role of painting, sculpture, and drawing in England, focusing on the time surrounding the establishment of a royal institution in 1768. The syllabus consisted of a lecture followed by a field trip, either to a museum or institute associated with the Academy's beginnings. We were not only able to appreciate the great works of British art but Professor Postle was very knowledgeable in its history and various other tidbits. Not being at all interest in art history initially, it did change my mind and help me appreciate the dedication these artists had in creating a last institution on London and the country.",
    "Probably wouldn't appeal to most, but it's worth exploring.",
    "You learn this history of the Royal Academy in England, basically. It was very much more about the history than about specifics about the art. The final is a slide test, but it asks questions about the paintings in the context of the Royal Academy, not questions about the media and forms in the painting, or whatever.The reading load was moderate, and all the readings were very relevant and interesting.The class included many trips to galleries to see paintings in person, which were great.Overall, I would recommend this class.",
    "The Art Academy in England was, as its title suggests, pretty much an overview of the foundation of the Academy through to the early 1900s. If you've never learned about British Art, it's a great introduction because you cover most of the big names. It was more focused on the history than looking closely at the art itself, so if you're really committed to just talking about art, this class isn't for you. Overall, I really enjoyed it. We did field trips every other week, so class time was minimal--never abad thing. Professor Postle is really nice and always willing to meet with students."
