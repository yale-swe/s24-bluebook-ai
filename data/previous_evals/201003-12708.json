    "This is your chance to develop an idea and make it happen with some degree of accountability. It can be lax or intense depending on how you treat it, but definitely worth it.",

    "Stressful, but you learn a lot about yourself and about storytelling.",
    "I would definitely recommend it. It's not very much work and is really interesting. Take it if you're interested in scene-writing or filmmaking."
