    "A great class!!!!! It is very well organized and I learned a lot about how we think. The exams are spaced out into four non-cumulative exams (rather than the usual one or two cumulative ones, and no final), making for a relatively stress-free semester. The everyday quizzes are not hard if you pay attention for most of the lecture or have some psych background. Its only weakness is that some of it is review from material I learned in PSYC171 and Intro Cogsci, but this just meant I could space out some days and still get a good grade. TAKE THIS CLASS!",
    "This is a great lecture course and the material is really interesting. The homework assignments are pretty annoying, but I don't think they're so bad that they should prevent someone from taking this class. If you have any interest in cognition, this is definitely a great intermediate course to take.",
    "A very interesting psychology class. No reading involved but you have to be devoted to go to every lecture.",
    "I would recommend taking it if you are willing to go to the classes in the morning. Attending class is the most important part!",
    "I was a 2nd semester senior and took this class. The 9am time is a bit tough, but not impossible. The in-class final was crucial; I ended up having 0 final exams, so I'm done way early. I would highly recommend this class (in spite of the 9am time) because of the material and the teacher. If you're a Psych major, you'll have a decent time.",
    "The perfect CR\/D class. Fascinating material, and the daily quizzes force you to retain the info and attend lecture. No reading, non-cumulative tests, and a few small homework assignments. I highly highly recommend this on CR\/D. Tough curve for a grade, though.",
    "This course is very interesting, challenging but not frustrating, and essential for those studying Psychology or Cognitive Science. I highly recommend it to all, even those not majoring in the field. The professor is excellent. The course itself does not follow a linear progression, but that is because knowledge in this field is clustered into distinct, sometimes unrelated groups.",
    "Don't be turned off by having a quiz every day. They are strictly based on the lecture, so don't fall asleep and you'll do well. There are four exams, which should be considered a positive because you have multiple chances to repair your grade. The four homework assignments are easy.",
    "Take it if you have a background in psychology, especially if you are a psychology major. be careful on the tests, they are hard and mean",
    "Yes. Test questions were tricky, though.",
    "Great! There's some overlap with other psych courses but its still super interesting and not very difficult to do well in! Professor Ahn is a fantastic lecturer.",
    "DONT TAKE IT. It's just not worth it.The class is structured in a terrible way that will frustrate and oppress your desires for learning. With quizzes every lecture that only make scores salient and an overall emphasis on grades throughout the class, it seems like the class becomes obsessed with all these scores. It does not help that the grading is strict and inflexible. They will deduct points for any insignificant detail.Yes, you'll laugh at Prof. Ahn's jokes, but that won't make up for the structure of the class that oppresses your learning.It feels like a high school class in which the teacher is obsessed with grades, grades, grades - and this is not a good thing to say about a Yale class.",
    "It's fine.",
    "A great class that covers a broad range of topics. Though the material isn't super in depth for any topic, a lot of the material is very practical. Also, the class isn't particularly work intensive, which is nice. I would definitely recommend this class to another student.",
    "A really good survey of human reasoning. Great class.",
    "I highly recommend this course to all students - psych and non-psych majors alike. Although some of the material will have been covered by more basic psych classes and will be repetitive for psych majors, there is enough new content that the class will remain engaging. Also, it's worth taking because Professor Ahn presents everything in such an interesting manner - so even if it's repetition, it still tends to be much more memorable than the average lecture. The only drawback of the course is the harsh grading policies. Professor Ahn allows you to petition in case of disagreements, but she is not always as flexible as one would hope (especially since a lot of the course material is based on theories and opinions, not indisputable facts). Still, definitely worth a try.",
    "An okay class. Pretty easy, but you have to show up to class (because there are quizzes and because the tests are based solely on the lectures).",
    "Thinking is about, well, thinking! I was a big fan of this course--it was all the material that interested me from Intro Psych\/Intro CogSci but in more depth and more focus on actual published studies. I wasn't thrilled with the idea of daily quizzes, but a) you don't have to study for them ahead of time and b) it seems that they were in lieu of section, which I greatly appreciated. I thought the homework was interesting, though having it graded on a curve was a little stressful. The tests, too, were rather challenging, but fair. Overall, I have no major complaints: The material is interesting, the class well-taught, and the grade itself nicely spread out over several items. We learned a lot of things that can really improve your thinking in everyday life and the course is definitely worth taking.",
    "Good class, interesting material, unfair tests. Be prepared for true\/false and ambiguous multiple choice.",
    "It requires a lot of attention to this class and waking up early twice a week, taking a quiz every class, 4 tests, and 4 assignments. I would recommend the class to anyone willing to put in the effort, because you get a lot out of it.",
    "An interesting overview of cognitive psychology that I would recommend to any psychology major.",
    "DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS. IF YOU CARE ABOUT HAVING ANYTHING HIGHER THAN A \"C.\"",
    "yes! take this class--i LOVED it.professor ahn is totally awesome: spunky, dynamic, interestedshe structures the class in a way that is extremely conducive to learning. she is a model professor. there are easy(ish) quizzes at the end of each lecture that ensure that you were paying attention to the material. the work in general is really nicely spread out. there are 4 tests, so each test has a manageable amount of material on it (you can really learn the material well before each test). there are 4 fun homework assignments. going to class was enjoyable. the lectures cover concepts from problem solving to deductive reasoning to creativity- all of which is very interesting and applicable to daily undergrad life.this class is a gem. TAKE IT!",
    "Thinking is good but a lot of work. There are four exams and four homeworks. Yikes. You learn a lot though.",
    "Yes. Take the class! It's an interesting course that will challenge you, especially with its homeworks.",
    "Psyc 301 was decent. I think a lot of the studies presented were kind of intuitive and not particularly enlightening. If I could I would probably have taken a different Psyc class, but I didn't dislike 301. Professor Ahn was an entertaining lecturer, and I always knew what to expect from the class.Also, if you take this class, I wouldn't bother buying the books. The reading is a minimum, and Professor Ahn teaches you everything you need to learn in lecturers. I opened the book maybe twice all year.",
    "A decent class. I came in with very little psychology background and found it mostly interesting and enjoyable. The format of the class is actually really nice and I think effective for learning the material. The material itself is pretty interesting and lacks the \"dead white guy theories\" that are so boring from Intro Psych.",
    "Recommend! You actually learn a surprising amount despite the course being very laid-back and fun.",
    "'Thinking' was an excellent and challenging survey of the nuances of human thought processes. The material is challenging, but not too difficult, and is always interesting. The workload is not too heavy. The most challenging part of the course was its being at 9am.",
    "I would not necessarily recommend the course just because of the extremely large course-load and difficult grading. However, the syllabus is great, and the lectures were generally good and in-depth. Still, many lectures could have been improved, and it was difficult to know what to expect, as classes were highly variable in quality."
