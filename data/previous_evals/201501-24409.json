   "comments": [
    "In this course you will move from grammar topic to grammar topic and practice them in brief homework assignments as well as in class together. The content is not terribly difficult and the textbook is excellent and easy to use. I highly recommend this course to anyone wanting to improve and maintain their Spanish, especially non-native speakers!",
    "If you want to improve your spanish grammar and just in general improve if you are at a higher level, I highly recommend this course. It was a great combination of reviewing the more complex grammar I learned years ago and learning some things I had never learned in the past. Pilar is amazing and the class was legitimately fun.",
    "I would definitely recommend. I took it because it was required but it reminded me how much I love Spanish. It's a really straightforward class and it is a lot of work, but if you need to take an L5 that's not as daunting, definitely take this one.",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone needing an L5 language.",
    "I would recommend students to credit D this class if they want to learn more about how to speak Spanish properly. I would not recommend taking the class as a letter grade if at all possible.",
    "Not an easy class by any means. Hard, lots of work, and just a really tough subject. But if you really want to learn Spanish grammar better, this is the class.",
    "This class is a lot of work, but you learn a decent amount as well. It is not a course to take when you are just looking to improve your speaking abilities.",
    "Span 243 is a great course for someone who placed into L5 or who took L4 but does not feel quite ready to take a literature course. You will still get to read some short stories in this class, but will spend the majority of your time learning complicated grammar. Prof. Asensio is amazing and really makes the grammar more exciting than I thought it could be. That being said, the focus is grammar, so if you are not interested in that, the course will be a drag.",
    "This course is best for students who want to perfect their composition skills.",
    "This is an Advance Spanish Grammar class, so that is exactly what you will be studying! You will be reading about particular grammar concepts from the textbook, doing homework on it, and then coming to class to do more practice exercises. Yes, it will improve your grammar. No, it probably won't really improve your speech that much. Take a conversational speaking class instead (if available that semester). However, this class really will vary a lot depending on which instructor you get in your section! Try your best to shop around for whichever teacher best fits your learning style.",
    "Altogether a great course. A very rigorous and thorough examination of higher level Spanish. The class explores the nuances of Spanish grammar in a highly structures, well-planned method. I found the organization, topics, and scope of this class extremely effective. At the same time, a lot of the (very extensive) homework was busy work, and it added little to the general learning of the course.",
    "Take this course if you are unsure of the idea of jumping right into the other L5 Spanish courses. Learning the grammar is immensely important for all the other courses. I had a 1.5 year gap in Spanish education and I did well in this course where I might not have done so well in the other L5 courses because my grammar wasn't up to snuff."
