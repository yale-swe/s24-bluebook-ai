    "HAHAHA you wouldn't be taking this if it was't a requirement. Good luck!",
    "If you are a senior you are taking this whether or not you read this eval. Its like an easier version of pchem lab in the sense that the lab reports are not as rigorous (but still require some work). Do the work, get a good group, and just get ready to graduate.",
    "The first half consists of labs that are somewhat familiar conceptually but are not terribly exciting to perform. The second half consists of labs that are neither familiar nor exciting to perform. Specifically, they are extremely biological in nature and will be completely new unless you have taken biology. On the other hand, both professors are smart, kind, and easygoing. I would recommend you not take this class too seriously, for your own peace of mind.",
    "Disappointing. But like all of our classes, you have to take it, so just get through it. Don't sweat the nitty gritty details of your lab reports, it seems like they're just skimmed anyway. Any prep you can do on bio topics will be useful. I personally watched a lot of youtube videos to help with the protein engineering lab report, and I suggest you do this if you find Wilson's teaching style incomprehensible. A lot of the due dates coincide with the due dates for CENG 416, but since the professors overlap, don't be afraid to ask them to be flexible with the due dates of the lab reports. The professors often moved dates around for us so that we weren't pulling all nighters.",
    "It's required but to be fair after Pchem lab this is a lot less painful than I expected.",
    "A required class that will constantly frustrate you with technological failings and lab reports only slightly worse than those for Pchem Lab. Good luck, you are almost done.",
    "After PChem Lab, this class feels a bit like a joke. It's interesting, though, just disorganized and very little is expected of you (since the results you get are so few and so bad).",
    "This course is an interesting addition to the chemical engineering curriculum. Some of the lab modules (there are 5 total) are more enjoyable than others. The lab reports themselves are pretty straightforward."
