    "YES! If this course is offered again, do not even hesitate to take it. You get to study two expansive eras of art history in one course AND GO TO NAPLES. This class is literally a once in a lifetime experience!",
    "Best class I have taken at Yale! The subject was fascinating, and working from both an exhibition and REAL LIFE in Italy was just an amazing experience. It really has changed the way I look at art and teaching about art.",
    "If this class is taught again, don't be an idiot - try to get into it! Barringer and Gaifman are both wonderful, and though I hope they hone the focus of this class, it is an incredible opportunity to really engage with scholarship, scholars, and primary materials dealing with the interaction between the classical world and the modern, particularly in terms of the Grand Tour. Another highlight of the class can really be the people - since it's a small class, you get to know some really interesting people well!",
    "Yes. Easily one of the most memorable experiences that I will have at Yale.",
    "Take it! I am not sure if it will be offered again but it was great.",
    "The course uses the lens of eighteenth-century British Grand Tourists to look back at ancient sculpture, pottery, and architecture. I would HIGHLY recommend, not just because you get to go to Italy, but because the subject matter is really interesting, and seeing all the layers of appropriation and interpretation of the classical world was amazing."
