   "comments": [
    "ART 120 is a great class, but you have to motivate yourself - pick a project that you really want to see completed, and stick to a schedule. It is important to make something manageable that is just beyond your skills set.",
    "Art 120 is really what you make it. There isn't much structure to the class and so it's really up to you to decide whether to find time in your life to devote to working in the shop after hours or to scrape by on the minimum possible effort. If you're looking for a class where you can do whatever the hell you want (in the context of sculpture\/woodworking) this is the class for you. I put in a lot of effort this semester and am really happen with the products I walked away with, but if it's going to be hard for you to find studio time in your schedule this class might be a problem for you. There simply is not enough time to complete the projects during the classes. That being said, there isn't any real work apart from working on your projects, so if you budget your time wisely anything is possible.",
    "Put effort in if you take it, or else you'll only end up with one finished piece. Scott is hard to get a hold of, you have to fight for his time. Choose pieces that let you work on your own, so you don't have to go to him every few minutes with a new question about your next step.That being said, working with wood is a blast, and Scott gives a lot of freedom in choosing projects, so take it if that sounds good.",
    "Take a classwith Scott if you want to work with wood. Think of it more as a tutorial in woodworking than an introduction to sculpture. You set your own projects and can learn about basically any process involving wood from bending to hand carving to using the machines in the shop. It would be good for students of many levels, since most of the class is one-on-one instruction.",
    "I would recommend it to anyone who is interested in making simple things out of wood. It is really a good introduction to using the woodshop. It is best if you don't have high expectations of what you want to produce in the class. This course is much more useful if you look at it as a shop class. It is much more enjoyable if you have patience and time to meet with the professor frequently outside of class.",
    "Great introduction. Both mind-opening and technologically informative. However, take this course only if you really want to put in the time. Basically, you can make whatever you want - but that sounds more glamorous than the reality, I promise.",
    "Intro sculpture is a great class - the focus is on the craft of woodworking, so this isn't a conceptual or more abstract, wide-scope sculpture class, but if you're interested in the satisfaction of learning how to make things, I highly recommend it. Scott is great, and is really willing to put a lot of one-on-one time in outside of class to help everyone learn the techniques needed for individual projects."
