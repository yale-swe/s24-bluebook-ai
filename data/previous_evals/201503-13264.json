   "comments": [
    "I'm not sure I would recommend this course (in its current form) to freshmen who don't already know that they are interested in linguistics. I took this class to try something out that I had never done before, and ended up really not liking it. Professor Piango's teaching style is kind of all over the place (she spent a lot of time in our class getting side-tracked on discussions of one very specific thing). And her explanations often don't really answer the question or are very vague. Although she is really nice and well-intentioned, her style really didn't work for me. If disorganization and vagueness bothers you, don't take it.",
    "If you're looking for a solid introduction to linguistics, this may not be the right course for that. However, if you're interested in bilingualism, or want a relatively easy SO requirement, this course is perfect. Overall, the class isn't too much work (weekly assignments and two essays), but be prepared for some dense readings and general confusion about concepts.",
    "Can be somewhat boring, wouldn't recommend unless you already have somewhat of an established interest in language or linguistics.",
    "Recommended to students who want to work very hard and stretch themselves in totally unfamiliar territory.",
    "Linguistics and the Mental Lexicon gives you a glimpse into into the structure of language in the mind, informed by the latest cognitive research. It requires a lot of work to understand the concepts involved, but it's well worth the effort."
