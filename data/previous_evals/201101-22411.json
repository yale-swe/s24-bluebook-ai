    "Definitely take this is you are a) interested in music theory b) a singer who wants to expand their knowledge of available songs b) love Dan Egan",
    "Excellent. Take it if you're even remotely interested. Dan Egan is an amazing professor (and person) in and out of the classroom and he really cares. It's not a difficult class, but it also manages to teach you how to think about musical theater in a critical way. I feel like I learned a lot even though I wasn't fully committed to the course.Don't miss a class! You'll miss something great.",
    "If you like musical theater, this is a must-take! The workload is very doable. The readings are usually fairly short and quite interesting. There is a lot of music to listen to, but that never feels like work!",
    "American Musical Theater History is my favorite class at Yale, and I would definitely recommend it to anyone interested in musical theater in any capacity. You can also really cater the class to your own interests. The paper topics are really vague to emphasize your strengths and passions, and the material that you study (while overwhelming at times) is always fascinating. I was excited to do my homework each week! This class is a great survey course of musical theater history from Showboat to In The heights, focusing specifically on Rodgers and Hammerstein and Sondheim. It also includes amazing trips to see Broadway and on-campus shows, and discussions with big names in the industry.",
    "I am utterly amazed that I ended up looking forward to two hours in a classroom every Friday afternoon, but this class had that effect. One of the best classes I've taken at Yale. Be prepared for Egan's quirky lecturing style, which I loved but might not work for everyone. It's a lecture\/seminar hybrid, a good balance between hearing Egan talk and hearing your classmates. Weekly readings and you have to listen to about 3 soundtracks\/week. Take it!!!",
    "By far one of the best, most fun classes I've taken at Yale. Professor Egan is a great teacher and a great person! I loved the material. It was such a treat to have an excuse to listen to great scores and have a ton of fun. Take the class if you get in!!!",
    "If you're interested in the American Musical theater, take this course. Don't be afraid if you have relatively little background in it. I love seeing musicals, but I'm not involved in theater at Yale nor have I seen many of the great classic shows, but I took this course anyways. I developed a great appreciation for the art form and I hope to get more involved and attend more theater at Yale.The class itself is not too much work. You listen to a few shows every week and do some reading and then you have a 5 page paper, a 2 page paper, and a 10 page final paper. Professor Egan is a great instructor and will help you develop your paper topics. He really know his stuff, so take advantage of it!",
    "Anyone who loves musical theatre should take this course!!! Anyone curious about musical theatre should also take this course!!!",
    "This class was awesome. You will learn so much about musicals, even if you think you know a lot already. Professor Egan is wonderful and incredibly helpful, and you get to see a Broadway show. In short, take it!!",
    "I loved this class. It is very much for people who want to pursue theater over music, however. That doesn't make it any less wonderful",
    "If you're a fan of musical theater, TAKE IT! (It's a no-brainer.) This is the only class that could have held my attention on a Friday afternoon. The papers are fun, and the subject material is fun and insightful. I have no complaints.Dan Egan is hands down one of the best professors I've had at Yale. Rarely does one find a professor as equally committed to his subject material as he is the students whom he teaches; but Dan Egan masters this commitment with unparalleled passion and enthusiasm. He cares about musical theater as much as he cares about his students--A LOT. This care is visible in every lecture, as he delicately maneuvers through the often-tricky history of musical theater, providing a healthy balance of personal insight and text\/music-based analysis.",
    "This is an incredible class. It presumes some familiarity with musical theater, but there were a bunch of shows we studied that most people didn't know. It is a really nice balance of history of musical theater in America and the players who shaped it, musical analysis, and dramaturgical\/theatrical analysis of musicals. The class starts with Show Boat, works its way through Rodgers& Hammerstein, touches on Cole Porter and Jerome Robbins, examines Sondheim in depth, and finishes with a look at musical theater today. Throughout, tensions such as high\/low art and commercial\/artistic are explored. The readings are not too long and very interesting, and homework includes listening to broadway musicals for class. Dan Egan is an incredible professor who is great at leading an engaging, funny class, while also forcing everyone to think critically and come up with an opinion. The class strikes a nice balance between looking at musicals academically and intuitively, and gut feelings about musicals have a place in the class, which is cool. The assignments (3 papers) require a lot of work, and Prof. Egan has high standards. But he goes out of his way to provide support for students. He schedules meetings with each student to discuss paper topics, and will look at outlines, drafts, notes, or questions and provide tons of feedback. This class was so great that I took it on Friday aftk did not want the class to end. If you can, take this class!"
