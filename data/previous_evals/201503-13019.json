    "A movement and discussion-based class mostly about the history of American dance. If a student wants something off of the traditional Yale path, I would highly recommend this class.",
    "I have heard this class has in the past been very vigorous, but the way Prof. Berson teaches it, it's an excellent way to learn about dance if you are new to it or unsure about taking a dance studies class. You learn a little bit about a lot of dance styles, situate dance within a variety of historical contexts, and engage with your peers and their ideas about movement extensively. Highly recommend for people who are curious about dance and don't know much about it or are only familiar with one or two styles! If you already have a solid dance theory or history background, you may want to check out a different class, because this one operates more like an intro survey course. I was disappointed because I had expected both academic and physical rigor, but my sense was that others in the class highly benefited from the relaxed, accessible nature of things. And that isn't to say that I didn't get anything out of the course, it just wasn't what I expected.",
    "Absolutely if you have any interest in learning about dance this is a fun way to do so. I was not a dancer and still was able to enjoy and learn from the material. Jessica also allows you to delve further into topics that interest you.",
    "Highly recommend!!",
    "Yes I would",
    "This class is a very fun, interactive, and rewarding survey of the dance history. The information is presented and explored through a variety of media (readings, videos, movement) which keeps it fun and engaging. Studying dance in this way brings up many important societal and psychological questions that are relevant for anyone to discuss even outside of the context of dance. I would definitely recommend this course to anyone-even id you have no knowledge of dance whatsoever.",
    "Yes, would absolutely recommend this class to another student!",
    "I would describe this course to be a creative and thought provoking. I feel as though it is the type of course where there are no definitive answers. It is truly an exploration of dance across the course of time. It covers diverse styles of dance and really focuses on its influencers, audiences and relationship and place in society. I would definitely reccomend AMST 370 01 for a fellow student."
