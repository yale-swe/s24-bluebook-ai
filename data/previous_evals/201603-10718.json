    "How to critically analyze a film as literature. Always questioning the truthfulness and reliability of a narrator.",
    "I developed stronger close reading and analytical skills, and I gained a lot of literary knowledge from reading many short stories, poems, and novels from a wide variety of genres, time periods, and ethnic origins.",
    "I learned how to better read and understand literature.",
    "I learned how to write in a cohesive and coherent manner.",
    "I have learned to organize my thoughts into a more effective argument.",
    "This course was the ideal transition from high school to college writing. I learned not only how to close read more effectively and analyze complex pieces of literature, but also how to write papers of varying lengths and engage in productive discussion. The course theme of perspectives is also very interesting and completely changed the way I look at literature.",

   "comments": [
    "Discussion was not very well moderated, but the peer review sessions for our essays were incredibly helpful. I loved the texts and movies we had to read\/watch for this class!",
    "One strength of the course was the wonderful texts we read. They were from many different genres and cultures and all had very interesting plots and points-of-view. One weakness was the lack of instruction we received on how to write a strong paper. The third essay we wrote was a lengthy research paper, and I did not feel that we really covered at all in class how to write one effectively, which made it seem like an insurmountable task. This was especially upsetting and made me anxious since it was the most heavily weighted assignment of the semester.",
    "The strength of this course definitely lies in its array of required reads that have ALL contributed to the epitome of the course in its attempt to expand our understanding of perspective. Professor Hindley was an amazing mentor and guide in the course as well! A weakness, and the only one I can think of, is the lack of direction that was provided when we were assigned the research paper. It was thrust onto us and while research methods were given, the process of researching wasn't thoroughly taught in my opinion. More time and emphasis on research planning would be very helpful for next time.",
    "Strengths: Freedom to express whatever you're thinking Weaknesses: Targeting certain individuals for their beliefs about literature. It is also hard to get an A because it is entirely dependent on how the Professor feels about your work (there were often no rubrics).",
    "This course did a great job exposing us to different styles of literature and writing skills. It is built on feedback, too; Prof. Hindley is willing to discuss your paper at any point in the process and we do peer reviews for all assignments. I would probably spend a little more time on how to write a good research paper, because I feel like it was the first time writing one for many students.",
    "Immersive, useful and informative. Discussions can go onto tangents sometimes but I guess that's fun in a way. Some people might get intimidated by unmoderated discussions."

    "Yes, great literature and interesting writing options.",
    "I would recommend this class to any student who has a strong background in writing college level papers and who wants to read a variety of extraordinary texts. However, those who have not have prior experience with this level of writing may feel lost in the class.",
    "I would recommend this course since it really opens up the world of literature and analysis of texts. It is very interesting, and the texts are incredible.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to others. It was intellectually stimulating as well as a great opportunity to improve my writing skills. It changed my whole perspective on the role of perspective in not only literature but the media as well as other aspects of our daily lives.",
    "No, was not that interesting",
    "Yes, this was an engaging class, and I like the topic about \"Looking through whose eyes\".",
    "Absolutely! If you want a course that will walk you through basic college writing skills while featuring some really interesting literature outside the Western canon, this is the one for you."
