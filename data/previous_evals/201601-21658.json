   "comments": [
    "This class was absolutely phenomenal. We read only four plays, so we really got to dig deep. Professor Kastan is brilliant, witty, and always open to talk outside of class. He will push you to write and read better than you could have expected. Take it if you've never read Shakespeare, or if all you do is read Shakespeare. Just take it! It was life changing.",
    "Definitely take this class. David Kastan is a tough grader but it's worth it. You will learn things in this class that you never expected to learn, and your appreciation for Shakespeare and literary criticism as a whole will skyrocket.",
    "A great course for anyone who is interested in Shakespeare and wants to study it in greater detail\/to challenge previous assumptions about it, or just to learn how to be a better writer.",
    "read four of shakespeare's major tragedies, learn a lot in class, think hard about blog posts and essays, and enjoy learning from a professor who knows so much about the subject and really wants you to learn and enjoy the class. highly recommend for an intro class to literature analysis, where everyone else is a freshman, too, and you can learn a lot and take risks and feel confident in your work.",
    "Take it if you have any curiosity as to why Shakespeare is considered the pinnacle of English literature.",
    "If you are all interested in Shakespeare, take this class, or anything by Professor Kastan! You won't regret it.",
    "A wonderful course, probably the best that I've taken at Yale so far. Kastan is an absolute genius. If you have even a vague interest in Shakespeare, try this course out. The class isn't as \"seminar-y\" as other freshman seminars in that Kastan will speak for a significant portion, but you get to speak and share (and argue for) your ideas as well. Even though you read only four plays, the class never gets boring or slow, as there is enough (too much, really) to talk about in the chosen plays to talk about for weeks and weeks. Homework (at least this year) consisted of weekly prompts (short response, around a paragraph to a page) and three papers. Kastan will challenge your writing and reading abilities, and by the end of the course, you'll probably look at your writing from the beginning with shame--your skills will develop a lot. If you like writing, reading, Shakespeare, or wonderful, charismatic professors, take this class.",
    "This was an amazing freshman seminar. I learned a lot about Shakespeare, and enjoyed myself during that. The professor, Kastan, is awesome. It didn't rigorously improve my writing, but it definitely helped. Kastan is very approachable and helpful. It was amazing to get to spend so much time on just four plays, and the class really bonded as well. I would take this class over and over again.",
    "Take this class. Take it! You will never get another chance to spend so much time with such a brilliant professor on such worthwhile texts. There's nothing more to say. Take it.",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend this class to other students, even if they aren't interested in English or Literature. These texts are great to read regardless of major, and I think the engaging nature of the class leaves students more articulate and thoughtful than they began.",
    "An incredible class. Take it. Not too much work (four plays and three relatively short papers, plus weekly posts) and such thought provoking conversation. Prof Kastan talked a lot, but that was fine with me because he knows so much and has so many insights into the world of Shakespeare and the interpretation of his language. This class went beyond anything I'd taken before in analyzing words and language at a very detailed level, and Prof Kastan could not be more knowledgeable about the specific ways in which the plays were printed, viewed at the time, etc. A lot of what we talked about was relating to characters, psychology, and how people function in the world. Plenty of very helpful feedback on papers, which really made me think about my writing. A fascinating, fun, friendly, thought-provoking class."
