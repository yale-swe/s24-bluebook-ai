   "comments": [
    "There can be more opportunities for structured speaking exercises (as opposed to the 5 min of conversation at the beginning of each class, which often feels repetitive and not really the best forum to practice new grammatical phrases and vocabulary).",
    "The course demands a high level of engagement, and this generally pays off. Occasionally the online homeworks are a bit overwhelming in volume, while providing less help than those given out in class.",
    "Strength's include its organization. It's weaknesses include some of the course content in the course packet.",
    "GET OFF OF CLASSES V2! This course needs to be more organized. There are 2 course folders one for all classes and one for the section. It is really confusing and nearly impossible to find anything. Also on essay corrections STOP using the code no one knows what it means its a hassle for the teachers and the students just tell me what i did wrong and then i can fix it.",
    "This class requires a lot of practice outside of the work assigned, try not to consider it busy work, because you can fall behind quite quickly."

   "comments": [
    "Yes, for those who want to solidify their Spanish.",
    "This is a great class to take if you need a language credit, and I would definitely recommend taking it with Sebastian because he is an amazing and very motivated professor.",
    "Yes because it builds really nicely off other levels, but also maintains the importance of the basics of the languages and all together is very helpful for improvement.",
    "no. I would say do the summer program for L3 and L4 in spain."
