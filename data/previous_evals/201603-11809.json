   "comments": [
    "I learned a ton of information about the nuances and development of the essay as a genre. I mainly learned how to read\/retain a lot of information in a short period of time, how to discuss academic work clearly and eloquently. I love how this class was rooted in history a lot of our class discussions involved contextualizing the pieces we read to understand their political undertones. We rarely read old\/dead\/white guys which was awesome!",
    "I don't think I really had a sense of what essaying was until I took this course. My writing definitely improved, and Professor LaFleur helped to give me the skills to think more deeply about pieces of personal writing.",
    "I learned new ways of approaching and discussing literature and essays. The American Essay Tradition is, in many ways, an eye opening experience.",
    "Through taking this course I was able to better analyze both historical and modern American texts looking at the themes and literary devices used. I also developed my literary analysis essay writing skills and personal essay skills. Through in class discussion I gained insight into modern social issues and American culture."

   "question_id": "YC403",
   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The weakness of the course is that there is often too much material such that it doesn't get discussed in the section which is frustrating as a student (because if you do all the work you feel like you didn't need to). The strength is that you get the opportunity to read some really great texts and sometimes the analysis is very compelling.",
    "I love the syllabus of this course. However, I think it could be modified a bit so that students realistically read all of the content it can be overwhelming at times, especially for a freshman seminar. I think having a more structured set of discussion points on a narrow, class-wide level, and a more structured set of goals on a broader, course-wide level would help, because it would allow us to see which pieces we wanted to discuss in depth.",
    "I think that there should be more incentive to do the reading. I understand not grading on participation but there was no repercussion for not doing the reading.",
    "I loved the style of the class we'd read a bunch of different works under one broad theme and discuss the ones we found most interesting. Professor LaFleur's teaching style worked for me, too: she interacts with her students in a way that facilitates deep and personal conversation. I wish I'd had the opportunity to get more feedback on my writing, either through a few more short assignments or a more formal drafting process.",
    "The variety and breath of essays that Greta selected is wonderful. We covered many topics, many writing eras, and a lot of history (including contemporary history). The one weakness was that there was so much reading that a lot of interesting essays were skipped over during discussion.",
    "The diversity of text and insight of the professor was definitely a strength of this course. The only weakness of the course is that I believe it would have been stronger as a writing credit, with more focus on writing essays and emulating the work we read."

   "comments": [
    "Yes! It was a great freshman seminar that was rather low-key, but stimulating and thought-provoking. Ultimately, this class is what you make of it. If you do the readings, the class is infinitely more interesting. Because there are no quizzes and Greta doesnt require students to speak unless they want to, you can get by without doing every reading. But DO THEM! They are super cool and you are better for it.",
    "I would certainly recommend this course to another student. It was very interesting and I learned a lot about topics that I would not otherwise have pursued.",
    "Yes, definitely! I learned a lot and had a lot of fun doing it. Many of the works are unconventional, but they're well worth reading, and I think they're made more valuable by the contexts and themes addressed in the course.",
    "I would strongly recommend this course to other students. It is such an eye opening experience to many topics that you might not of had much exposure to in the past. It is suited perfectly for freshman entering a new intellectual environment, where there is so much more diversity.",
    "Yes I would highly recommend this course and other courses by this professor to other students. Professor LaFleur was engaging and informative making her class a pleasure to be in."
