   "comments": [
    "Grammar is not inherently the most fascinating subject ever, but the way Terry Seymour taught it, incorporating lots of group work, a number of songs, various stories, and even a movie, it was a lot more fun than I thought it would be. Any grammar class will have you doing tons of workbook exercises to drill the information into your head, and there was some of that, but it wasn't too bad, and I actually really enjoyed the way I learned. I think it helped my Spanish for sure. There's more speaking than I anticipate, which was great.",
    "This is a great follow-up to L4 Spanish and I believe better to take than conversation. Especially if you get a small class, you often end up talking more than you would in conversation (where the classes are often pretty big). There is not too much work and Professor Seymour is great.",
    "This class if fantastic! Especially if you want to continue learning Spanish at Yale, I highly recommend this class as a way to provide yourself with a solid understanding of spanish grammar. The workload is really not too intense, just a lot of exercises in a grammar book which, while they take time, are not hard (and almost impossible not to get an A on because she gives you the answers). I found that I had fun in the class, but also really improved both my written and speaking spanish.",
    "It's a well-designed course that covers some of the more difficult Spanish grammatical concepts, but the material can be a bit dry. Profesora Seymour is determined to help students understand the material, but grading on compositions and exams can be pretty rigid.",
    "Great class that really improves your written and oral spanish. Take it. Terry Seymour is great."
