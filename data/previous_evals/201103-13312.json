    "My favorite course this term.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. You cover a lot of important American authors\/eras, and though you don't get to spend quite as much time on them as you would like, it gives you a magnificent taste of what American literature has to offer. You end up reading a lot of books you'll be happy you read! I think everyone, from English major potentials to people who live on science hill, has something to gain from this class, because the books you read + deming = what,this is amazing!!!",
    "I was looking forward to this class and prof. deming, but was a little disappointed. The reading list was a little too poetry-based for me, and the one modern choice by deming (oscar wao) was a weird choice given the entire field of american lit. Class discussions were interesting, but i felt like deming steered the conversation too aggressively, and sometimes reading responses were not even considered. That said, he was helpful on essays.",
    "I really enjoyed this class. Deming is definitely a character and does a good job balancing his own interesting ideas with encouraging development of your own in class discussions. I really enjoyed his reading list, and that makes a big difference between the different sections of 127, so be sure to read the syllabi before making a decision. He also takes you on field trips to the Yale art gallery and to Beinecke, which were really interesting and fun; I never would've seen what Yale has on offer there otherwise.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to students interested in American literature! Professor Deming is great!",
    "Awesome class. One of my favorite at Yale so far. Deming is a great teacher, but I have no idea if he is \"the best\" like everyone says he is because I obviously didn't take the course with anybody else. But if you have even a passing interest in English, take this course, and take it with Deming if you can.",
    "You can't go wrong with a reading list like this, but be prepared to move through the material a little faster than you 'd like. The scope of this course was pretty huge\u0097we read Moby-Dick followed by the Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao\u0097but everything tied together nicely in the end. Professor Deming was exceptional\u0097skilled at leading discussion, committed to giving valuable feedback on essays, and appropriately obsessed with Moby-Dick.",
    "The class was wonderfully interesting and informative, I believe I got to be a better English student (in terms of understanding American literature and how to analyze literature in general), and the papers and written reposes to readings continually were learning experiences. I really liked how each student wrote, over the course of the semester, a response to the reading for the day and a set of discussion questions for class. Writing these and reading everyone else's added significantly to how much I felt I got out of the class.",
    "Generally, yes, I would recommend it, eye-opening in many ways. We read more poetry than prose, so if that sounds like you, great. Also, discussion is more guided, less left up to the student, so again that's just a matter of what you like. A good survey of American lit (not really startling works, more like the must-knows). I'd take it with Deming. He makes the class very enjoyable and provides a lot of insight.",
    "I highly recommend it if you're looking for a thoughtful, interesting survey of some select works in American Literature. It's a pretty standard humanities\/writing course, 3-4 papers (depending on section leader), discussion for books you're expected to have read for each day of section, with minor disparities between syllabi (so be sure to check those out before you commit to a section in case you've read some of the overlap.) There are no surprises and section is always a good experience, especially if you get the opportunity to take it with Prof. Deming. At that point, there's no questions asked \u0097 take it. Your future self will thank you enormously for taking anything with the man.",
    "YES, especially with Professor Deming. Even if american literature doesn't immediately capture your interest (it didn't mine) you will greatly appreciate the discussions you will engage in and the perspectives you will discover. Books are transformed in each class as you uncover their meanings and hear your peers take on them.",
    "If you're going to take an english course at Yale...this is the one. Deming is absolutely incredible, brilliant, and hilarious. We had so much fun every class and everyone bonded really well because it's such a relaxed atmosphere. All the books we read were amazing and you learn so much about American literature\/history\/authors. It's better the great!!!",
    "Engl127 was a great discussion-based lit course. I wouldn't recommend it as your first English class at Yale unless you're super confident in your writing and analysis skills. The workload was substantial but manageable- roughly a book a week, four 5-6 page essays, and twice in the semester you're responsible for writing a reading response and leading a class discussion. Take it with Deming if you can!",
    "Yes, definitely! I'm not an English major, but this class introduced me to some great works of literature that I enjoyed reading, and my writing in all subjects improved from this experience. Class discussions were thought-provoking and fun. This is a class you look forward to every day. Deming is really wonderful, so if you want to take 127, definitely try to take it with Deming. For the full experience take advantage of his office hours, whether to discuss the literature, brainstorm essay topics,talk about improving your writing, or go over essay drafts. Also, I took it as an upperclassman, and I'm really glad I waited till junior year rather than taking it as a freshman (or even sophomore)--got a lot more out of the class."
