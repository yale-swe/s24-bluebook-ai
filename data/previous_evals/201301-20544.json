   "comments": [
    "Although this course was not directly applicable to my research, the exposure to anthropological methods, approach, and recent research was very inspirational in getting me to think about my research questions in new ways. In addition, each week's wide-ranging discussion encouraged -- often demanded -- extended critical thinking, from definition and reappraisal of my own attitudes toward anthropology to Japanese society to the study of culture in general. As I prepare to begin a PhD program next year, everything I gained from this course feels extremely valuable."
