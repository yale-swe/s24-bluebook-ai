   "comments": [
    "I gained a good working knowledge of the variety of positions early Christians held about the body, expanded my skills in reading texts well, and am understanding of the ways material, liturgical, theological, philosophical, medical, and scientific texts\/objects interacted in early Christian thought & practice. The seminar also explored a variety of methodological approaches to the study of late antiquity, which I greatly appreciated. Abstracts and book reviews were helpful assignments for professionalization and sharpening my skills in those areas.",
    "I had very little exposure to critical theory before this course, and so it has drastically helped me get up to speed on this method for studying early christianity. Also, the primary sources were from a wide selection of subjects, which I found really helpful for improving my knowledge base. I also sharpened my skills in being a mindful reader due to Dr. Doerfler's excellent moderation of class discussion.",
    "I developed a much deeper appreciation and knowledge of the body in early Christian thought and late antiquity. The course also familiarized me with some of the more theoretical secondary literature as applied to this topic. Weekly coursework included writing abstracts on ideas from the readings and a book review which helped me develop these specific skills.",
    "I have acquired much background on late antique, early christian and patristic writings; my purpose for taking this course.",
    "I gained new skills in navigating texts from early Christianity, second-sixth centuries. I learned about major Christian thinkers with particular reference to their thoughts on bodies, ordinary human bodies and special bodies. My writing and ability to approach these texts critically was improved through the weekly abstract assignment. I acquired the beginnings of a grasp on the historic context of early Christian texts."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The course was organized well, all of the readings for a given class session worked together, and the discussions were helpful. I did often feel that we did not have enough time in course sections to discuss all of the relevant material; it would have been nice to have more time together or to read less each week in order to get to everything.",
    "THis was a really helpful course, and this was primarily due to Maria Doerfler's skill as a teacher. I'm not sure how it could be improved, but overall, I really liked it a lot and would highly recommend it to others.",
    "The course structure allowed for much more frequent feedback than most, which was a real strength. The syllabus was structured appropriately to the varied backgrounds of the students in the class. Instruction and discussion leadership may have tended to be more directive, but also suited this reality. The seminar featured active discussion and well balanced participation.",
    "Overall, I have no serious recommendations for course improvement. I appreciated the student book review, but I found that the presentation of the book review often took away too much time from our class discussion of the primary sources. My suggestion is to cut the presentation of the book review and only have students provide written copies for their peers. The reviews are needed because they provide helpful information about secondary sources for further study\/research, but ultimately our discussion of primary sources was more valuable."

   "comments": [
    "I would wholeheartedly recommend this course. It covered a lot of interesting material, examined different ways of doing scholarship within the field of late antiquity, and we had great discussions every week. Also, the assignments were well thought out and were relevant to my own research and professionalization.",
    "Most definitely. Great course because of a great instructor.",
    "Yes. I found the course to be extremely informative, thoughtfully designed and suitably oriented around primary source material. Theory was neither ignored nor permitted to overshadow more traditional modes of scholarly inquiry.",
    "I definitely would recommend the course to anyone interested in the perceptions of the body as they appear in late antique, early christian and patristic writings. Also a helpful course to understand the context of material culture in late antique, early christian and byzantine periods.",
    "Yes. This course was both a good introduction for me to early Christian texts, but also challenging for those students whom consider this their field. The topics explored were engaging and stretched me to ask questions beyond the roots of doctrine and dogma."
