    "depends on your writing tutor. If you jive well, then take it. Lecture is silly for the most part. Don't go.",
    "It is very useful to work with a tutor, they are very helpful in identifying your weak spots and in learning how to be a stronger writer and thinker. Because of this, the class is well worth your time. Don't go to lecture, though.",
    "Take Daily Themes if you want to do the writing (which you should, if you like writing). The best part of the course for me was definitely writing each day. Lectures without guest speakers (and even some with) were a little dull, but attendance is pretty unenforceable. The other thing to note is that your experience will depend entirely on your tutor, which sucks because you have no control over it. If you get a shitty tutor (and I think odds are about 50\/50) you will likely get less out of it, but there's a lot to be said for writing every day. I didn't like my tutor but still feel like I got a lot out of the class. Overall, recommend. Also: may seem like a lot to write every day, but it's really not (maybe 15 min at the most) and when the time comes for finals, you will be so happy to have a class without one.",
    "Daily Themes is a great class. I don't consider myself a writer, but I really got a lot out of this class. If you can get in, do it.",
    "A very good course. Lectures weren't very exciting (at least for me; others seemed to enjoy them), but writing something 5 days per week is a valuable experience no matter how much experience you have, and you'll get good feedback on just about everything you write. You'll be surprised at how many different thoughts, opinions, and memories you have when the need to write appears.",
    "I don't buy into Daily Themes that much the lectures can be overwrought, your tutor might be a little sexist but I think it's a worthwhile endeavor, in that it forced me to write. Daily. And that's kind of a nice thing. And it will push you; you'll be more nimble in April than you were in January. I didn't like it, but I don't regret it. Go!",
    "Definitely take it. Writing everyday will revolutionize your process and working one on one with your tutor is incredibly valuable.",
    "Daily themes is awesome. Take if you're a writer, take it if you like creative writing at Yale but don't think you're a writer. The format is hard, but when you're done, you'll see yourself differently. This is the only course I've ever taken that was designed to impact my entire lifestyle for a semester, and I've learned as much about myself as about the craft of writing.",
    "Absolutely!",
    "Absolutely. Changed the way I think about writing and myself as a writer.",
    "It's a good class to improve writing skills and is an opportunity to write regularly. The guest lectures are a particular perk.",
    "Not a gut by any means. Stay with your work. Try not to cut lecture. Engage in tutorial. You'll be pushed to be a better writer than you've ever been, and it's wonderful.",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone who loves writing, regardless of how much formal experience you've had with creative writing. You will develop your voice as a writer very rapidly. This class is one of the most fulfilling experiences I've had at Yale.",
    "I would recommend this class to someone who enjoys being productively and righteously miserable. The work is engaging, but getting feedback on things that rest so close to your identity is crushing. The lectures are interesting, but Professor Deming is as hate-able to a certain type of person as he is lovable to another. The class is incredibly rewarding, but you don't realize that until it's over and feel a deep sense of loss that no one is forcing you to write every day and you won't get focused, personalized feedback from a hand-selected expert once a week anymore.",
    "Best class at Yale. If you want to be a writer, it is a must. Will get you into a great habit of writing every day. Made me love reading for the first time since middle school. It's a magical experience, I can't describe it otherwise. TAKE TAKE TAKE",
    "I already have recommended it. To most of my poetry group who haven't taken it, namely because I want them to be the best writers that they can be and I think writing every day in this sort of context is one of the most efficient ways one can do so.",
    "Take it as a 5th class if you like creative writing and want a neat portfolio of themes!",
    "If you like to write, it's a good class, usually. The lectures are sometimes interesting and sometimes not. I never really left a lecture feeling that it was really necessary for my ability to write on that week's topics. Whether or not you get something substantial out of the class also depends on your relationship with your writing tutor, with whom you'll have much more contact than the professor. I signed up for it because I read in comments from previous years that it was amazing and life changing and that you learned so much about yourself as a writer, and maybe that's true in some cases, but I definitely wouldn't make sweeping statements like that about this class. You get out of it what you put in, so if you're willing to put in the time and effort to really do all the assignments well and form a good relationship with your writing tutor, it's a pretty good class.",
    "A classic Yale course. As a science major, I was a little skeptical, but I really loved it and felt I got a lot out of understanding my writing style. I'm heavily considering practicing writing every day because the class opened my eyes to the way writing can influence the way you perceive and communicate with the world, even when you're not writing. The professor and the writing tutor were excellent, and I benefited immensely from taking this class. I wouldn't expect any terrific insights to come from the professor, but I will say this--the best way to master writing is through practice, and this class truly forces you to practice every day.",
    "I would recommend Daily Themes for someone who is willing to dedicate the time and effort to producing writing every day. If you're going to BS it and just try to get every theme out of the way, you won't get much out of the class; the gem of this class is in the daily practice and tutoring, not in lecture.",
    "A great class. People always talk about some classes being \"you get out what you put in\" type classes - but this class truly was that. The class is the assignments. But that being said, the assignments are awesome! Additionally, the chance to work individually with your own tutor is a unique and enriching experience. There truly wasn't much downside. A great professor, a great group of tutors, great assignments, great lecture, great group of peers - and no final exam! And I really enjoyed learning how to write in a loose and very non-academic style.",
    "Daily Themes is a writing-intensive class with a short essay\/story of 250-300 words due 5 days a week. For me, the writing never felt much like homework, because all of the prompts were so interesting to tackle and work with. If you are even remotely interested in writing and literature, take this class. It improves your writing and makes you learn so much about yourself in the process.",
    "Taking this course was one of the best decisions I've made at Yale. On Day 1, Professor Deming told us that taking Daily Themes would be an almost journalistic experience - capturing our semester day-by-day through each theme, whether it's fiction, nonfiction, poetry, or something else altogether. Looking back on your body of work through the term, you can see the ways you changed as a writer. You can laugh at the surprising jokes you made, cringe at the horribly ornate sentences you wrote, and smile at the instances where you somehow got it exactly right. While the class sounds like an overwhelming amount of work at first glance, it ended up being much more manageable than I imagined because the work is daily. And the more you flex that writing muscle, the faster and stronger you'll get. As a chronic procrastinator, I appreciated being forced to write a little bit each day, rather than a larger amount over a longer period of time. I found the weekly tutorials with a TA to be wonderfully helpful and genuine times to talk about the pieces written over the course of the week. The lectures, however, did not always feel helpful or relevant. Sometimes, I think that good writing is best felt, rather than broken down and analyzed to pieces. I really enjoyed reading the collection of \"Exceptional Themes\" that Professor Deming picked out each week - it's amazing to see what a rich collection of voices Yale has.",
    "Take it if you get in.",
    "You write every day. It gets stressful and some of the prompts are bunk. My friends who had good teachers really loved the class, so the tutors must make all the difference. Lectures are boring. If you want to get in the habit of writing, then I suggest starting on your own, to be honest.",
    "This class is incredible. It's one of those classic Yale classes that have been a running tradition for decades. If you get in, you should definitely take it. When you don't feel like writing daily, this class forces you to, but there is something extremely cathartic about scraping at the depths of your mind to find something to write about. The guest lecturers are always very intriguing; it's so cool to be able to question famed writers about their works in person. The one-on-one tutor time is so valuable. They really help you to get to know yourself through your writing. And the x-theme system is a really nice way to get to see the works of your classmates every week. The anthology at the end is also a wonderful finishing touch to allow each year of Daily Themes to maintain a legacy in the archives.",
    "Great if you don't already write everyday. My writing tutor was fantastic, and the class really hinges upon that experience. Thus, if you're writing tutor isn't that great, the class may not be worth taking.",
    "Awesome awesome awesome. Wonderful class, inspiring to go to lecture every week and you'll really learn about writing and about yourself.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS!",
    "Daily Themes runs differently from most (maybe all) other courses. The actual class is once a week, an hour and fifteen minutes. You get paired with a tutor, who is a writer affiliated with Yale\/Daily Themes, and meet with them once a week for about half an hour. Meanwhile, you have to write a 250-300 word piece five times a week. You go over them in your weekly tutor meetings. I really liked Daily Themes. Professor Demingwho wont be teaching the class next year was hilarious. We also had a lot of guest lectures from different writers (not the tutors), which were interesting even though some of them varied in quality. I think I would have liked to hear Professor Deming lecture more. The course really teaches you about the writers life, because most of the time youre alone writing those pieces. Sometimes it can be a bit frustrating having to write something every day when you have other, more pressing homework to do, but at least for me it was really nice to have that pressure so I would actually write and not put it off indefinitely.",
    "Take this if you're ready for a substantial investigation of your own writing methods. It's a great chance to plumb your mind for the stories and sentences that are living there, and will be the lash at your back to actually turn all these things into words other people can read. It is a lot of work; plan your time accordingly. Take it in a semester when you are only taking four classes.",
    "Daily Themes: write five days a week for 13 weeks, plus a light assignment over spring break. You literally get out of it what you put into it. Take this if you want to challenge yourself. This can be an \"easy fifth class\" if you Cr\/D but you can turn it into so much more. Daily Themes has legitimately changed my writing style for the better; I wrote in my journal today and felt a sense of liberation in self-expression. I guess if you want something like that, at least think about applying.",
    "A finnicky course. Not all its cracked up to be. Take it if you really want to write everyday and like writing short 300 word refelctions. The lectures can be really English-y and dwell on concepts that are hyperspecific and feel useless. The guest speakers are pretty good usually. How much you like the course will depend on your tutor and how helpful their advice is. I would recommend other creative writing classes over this. However, you do come out with a large body of work: interesting descriptions and possible worlds.",
    "An absolute must-take. Writing the theme becomes a relaxing and invigorating part of your daily routine, and learning about who you are as a writer -- your areas of interest, your quirks, your habits (good and bad) -- and then seeing how that changes throughout the semester, is an amazing experience.",
    "TAKE IT I wish I had taken it freshman year it would have changed my entire yale career, but taking it senior year I was able to reflect on four years of learning in a unique and profound way",
    "This class is what you make it (and it also depends somewhat on your relationship with your tutor). Lecture isn't the most informative\/useful thing, but it's nice to all gather once a week and think about writing. Writing 5x a week did get tedious, especially when I had a deadline every Saturday night. I probably spent 45 minutes to an hour every day writing, but it didn't seem like that much of a time commitment because I knew I was always going to produce something with that time. I came out of the class with a pile of writing, and lots of ideas, and lots of ideas to turn into larger future projects. If you want to spend a semester building up your skill as a writer, I'd suggest the class. It's hard work, but it's worth it.",
    "Amazing class. I had an incredible tutor, and my writing improved hugely over the course of the class. Lectures were fine, Deming is a little pompous and uses near-religious language about writing and that gets old, but he's kind and a good teacher. Writing every day is good for you.",
    "Take it. You learn a lot about your writing. And you get better, too. There's a lot of different alleyways to wander down in your writing, this course points them all out. Also, cool guest lecturers!",
    "It's wonderful, but you need three things in order to have a good experience: a good tutor, the ability to learn from criticism, and humility.",
    "EVERYONE at Yale should take Daily Themes. Honestly. I grew so much this past semester as a writer simply because of the daily practice of writing. Take advantage of your tutor as a resource and really try to establish a relationship to him or her in order to get the most you can out of the course. Take this for the writing prompts and tutor work, not for the lecture which is not great.",
    "The best way to get better at writing is to do it every day, and Daily Themes is a great way to do this. Your experience is pretty dependent on whether you like your tutor; I had a wonderful relationship with mine. As with any creative writing course, I would advise going into weekly tutorials welcoming criticism. As someone who has done a lot of private journalling, this was a wonderful chance to gain access to a second consciousness with regard to my writing. Reactions to lectures seem to be mixed, but I enjoyed them",
    "First off, definitely apply. Spend time on your application theme and really work to make it stand out in some way so that you get into the course. Once you're in, really milk this course for all that it has to offer. Always work toward betterment and don't be content, because in this class (and beyond) there is always room for growth in your writing. Write themes on stuff you care about or really want to write about. And writing on a daily basis is difficult and I submitted late at least once a week, but it's important and necessary to what this course seeks to achieve. Long story short: Daily Themes is an amazing course, you'll have a lot of growth during the semester, and you shouldn't shy away from taking risks in your writing during and after taking this course.",
    "Would recommend, for the experience, to anyone who's interested in writing or just likes words.",
    "Yes - take Daily Themes even if you aren't literary, even if you aren't a writer, even if you think you're a bad writer. It will help you with your writing, which will help you articulate your thoughts. This is an essential course in the Yale curriculum - it's been around for decades for a reason.",
    "Yes. Writing every day is something that everyone should do. It will improve your ability to express yourself, your self-confidence, and it will help you grow personally. I feel like it made me more sensitive and more honest, more introspective and thoughtful. The prompts are thought provoking and will help guide you throughout the semester. My tutor was not great and I cannot say I learned much from lecture but just because it imposes on you the discipline of writing daily I think this course is very much worth it.",
    "Stay if you like your tutor and are willing to stick to the schedule. Bail if you don't or you're not.",
    "YES! This was the best class I took at Yale. I took it second semester senior year because I wanted to try creative writing, and it was so rewarding. The assignments were fun and my writing improved a lot."
