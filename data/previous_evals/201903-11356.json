    "I learned a lot about action potentials and the drugs that affect them. I learned about a lot of pathways in the brain as well.",
    "Details of neurobiology",
    "Wow. This is the worst class ive ever taken. Ive never hated a course so much. I like neuroscience. I like learning about this stuff. These two old men dont want to teach. They want to talk about the 60s and how much fun they had discovering the neuron at the Cape. You dont learn anything bc thats not what this class is designed to do. Its to stroke these two mens ego and make you feel like neuroscience is so complex that it is practically unobtainable. Its not a hard subject. It doesnt have to be. Im so disappointed with Yale.",
    "By taking this class, I learned a lot about how the nervous system itself works. I learned such an intricate network of neurons can work together to create such a complex mind by merely dissecting how the neuron itself works.",
    "I learned about the molecular mechanisms that are inherent to some aspects of neuroscience.",
    "The course material was definitely interesting but challenging. As a neuroscience major, it will absolutely use some of this knowledge in later classes, just which it was presented better.",
    "This course provided a comprehensive overview of the nervous system and the biological processes underlying its function. Even after taking The Human Brain and several other neuroscience courses, as well as preparing for the MCAT, there was much I learned in this course. In particular, the course goes into much greater detail regarding the ionic basis of neuronal excitability than I have encountered in the past.",
    "the basic principles of neurobiology: synaptic transmission, synapse structure, neuronal networks, etc.",
    "The first part of the course focused on the biophysics\/biochemistry of CNS cells. The latter half of the course was oriented towards anatomy and pathways in the brain (visual, somatosensory, motor, etc.).",
    "Course is pretty much as advertised. You learn a lot of stuff about the biology of the brain, building up from basic ion channel properties to the large-scale organization of various systems in the brain.",
    "I learned a lot of the biological fundamentals of neuroscience. Some of the human brain concepts were covered but at greater detail.",
    "From Professor Forscher's portion of the class, we learned how to reason out which part of the system was being affected if we observed some outcome from an unknown drug. We also learned how to predict what would happen if some drug was used. We also learned a lot about the experiments that lead to these scientific findings. From Professor Keshishian's portion of the class, we learned mostly about different experiments and pathways.",
    "I learned about neurobiology: ion channels, IV plots, visual system, models of motion detection, signaling cascades, memory, diseases, etc",
    "I loved the lectures and Haig's detailled handouts -- the course really helped me develop a foundation in neurobiology that built on itself, from electrophysiology and the mechanism of the action potential up to signaling pathways, neural circuitry, and eventually correlations with behavior -- even though the amount of content felt overwhelming. Paul and Haig's storytelling were also engaging and enriching. Although I initially felt skeptical of the amount of memorization required\/ how intellectually valuable and transformative that work really was, over the course of the semester I developed an appreciation for learning\/internalizing the basic language of neurobiology (including those pesky but important and widely repeated signal transduction pathways\/network motifs) in order to do more advanced work in the field; I really appreciate this course's foundational place in the neuroscience major. By the course's end, I felt the satisfaction of having developed a rich foundation in neurobiology (including elements of its human history) and real excitement for the discipline.",
    "I learned how simple biology can create complex neural systems and behavior. Most importantly I learned how fundamental experiments to neuroscience have taught us the most important things about neurons. I learned how to prioritize information from mere detail to more important overarching ideas and how they came to be."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The course covers a lot of material which is cool but it also makes it really hard to keep up with the topics. Sometimes lectures were a bit repetitive and some were a bit boring.",
    "It's just very organized, Haig and Paul could've definitely been more on the same page.",
    "The lack of problem sets in this class is a serious problem. Other than exams, there are no opportunities for students to gauge how well they understand the material. Personally, I tend to retain information better when I have a chance to apply the concepts to answer questions not already posed in lecture. Even ungraded problem sets would have helped with this. Students could complete the problem sets and check the answers on their own without burdening professors and TAs.",
    "Haigs lecture notes were incredibly detailed and helpful, it wouldve been more put together if haig taught the whole course",
    "Its a terrible course there are no strengths. Dont take this. Dont major in neuro.",
    "The course was a little hard to follow at times because the sections seemed to not as interconnected. Sometimes the topics would just jump and this made it hard to keep things apart since a lot of the terms can be applied to other sections, such as mossy fibers. If there was a more clear designation of sections being studied, it would really help shape the course.",
    "Material is interesting but the structure is off. Doesnt really facilitate learning.",
    "This course entails a lot of information. The sections for it were helpful, but sometimes, the lectures were dry. This course could use more student participation and more clarity regarding the topics that are central to the course versus those that aren't.",
    "Strengths: The content is super interesting. The 3 TFs for this course were amazing. Section isn't required, but I definitely recommend going. Weaknesses: Lectures can be a bit dry. It can feel like a bit of a repeat of Human Brain at times. I wish there was an assignment outside of the 3 exams (maybe weekly reading responses or a short paper)",
    "I really wish there was homework in this class because its impossible to learn and understand the concepts without practice.",
    "The major strength of the course is the wide breadth of material that we cover, which is all very interesting and sets up a strong foundation for what we learn about neuroscience in other classes and in our lab experiences. The major weakness of the class is the exams. The exams do not test what learn overall and instead zero in on very very specific parts of 1 or 2 topics. Also, the wording of the questions can be confusing, which would be fine if we had more examples of exam-like questions to prepare for the exam, but we did not receive that beyond the first midterm.",
    "Listen, this class used to be a graduate course and is still taught like one even though its now an undergraduate course. The only grades in this course are two midterms and the final aka you have no idea if you actually know the material until you're tested on it. In the first module of the course, there were posted problem sets which were helpful, but good luck with the rest of the class.",
    "The course organization could be greatly improved. Though I did learn a lot, the classes themselves were often confusing and I would have to rely on looking over the online (Canvas) resources or attending the TA-ran sections to really learn the information. This was especially true of Professor Forscher's classes - the lectures could feel quite disorganized and rambling at times. Additionally, the structure of the class, in which the only grades are the two hour-length exams and the final, did not allow many opportunities for grading or feedback. In particular, I don't know that the final did a good job of testing students' overall understanding. For example, while we had been told that the focus would be more on the material since the second exam, there was a lot of material from the time before that. Including questions on only 7 topics means that students don't have a chance to show off the range of knowledge they have learned. Rather, it requires a certain amount of luck that the few topics that are tested are ones that the student knows very well. Meanwhile, there were topics such as the visual system or cerebellum which were greatly emphasized in lecture but not tested at all. Finally, with both professors it would be wonderful if the lectures were made more interactive to confirm student comprehension rather than a format in which the professor talks and students simply sit and listen.",
    "strengths: course content, review sessions, weaknesses: sometimes test questions did not represent the information that we were taught (professors would sometimes choose some obscure concept - like synapsin- that we hadn't discussed and test us on it)",
    "Lectures always take longer than scheduled, which I didn't mind all that much, but for others with tighter schedules this was clearly an issue.",
    "Strengths: The material is generally pretty interesting if you're into any sort of biology, and I think the structure of the class lecture-wise is good. The micro to macro approach they use makes sense and helps to you get a lot out of the later material. Weaknesses: At times, the lectures can get stale and difficult to follow, and after a while it feels pointless to go to them since the material is explained with more clarity on Canvas. There's no work besides studying for two midterms and a final, which some might consider a strength, but what it ends up meaning is a lot of crammingsome sort of optional type assignment to keep the class more engaged might be good.",
    "I think this course tried to cover too much ground, and I also was personally not a fan of the switches between professors and TAs.",
    "Strengths: Dealt with many different topics in neurobiology, all of which were very interesting. The professors provided handouts for each lecture which for the most part covered everything that was taught. Weaknesses: The class flew by a lot of material in a very short amount of time. I was even told by another professor that they were basically cramming three grad school semesters worth of information into a semester-long course.",
    "Strength: The lecture notes are very helpful in understanding the material in class. Weakness: I appreciate that the professors have tried to make this more of an undergrad class than a graduate class as compared to previous years, but there is still a lot of content to cover, so without a good background in physics and cell bio, it may be difficult to follow the class content.",
    "Despite how enriching I eventually found the very detailed lecture content and readings of the course (the weekly TF sessions were also essential to helping me better understand and integrate material), the exams were really frustrating because it didn't feel like they reflected our work across the entire course. This was particularly true for the final -- so much of what we learned and were told to prepare\/ I studied deeply didn't even appear on the exam, which seemed to somewhat arbitrarily reflect the professors' interest. I left the course feeling that I had worked hard to develop a rich understanding of foundational neurobiology but that I would get a terrible grade regardless, which makes me hesitant to take more courses in the discipline. Introducing other, lower-stakes graded assignments to the course -- for example, a couple of reading responses\/short essays about a particular topic or regular quizzes -- could help take some pressure off of the high-stakes exams and better reflect students' holistic work in the course.",
    "strengths: covers several topics, appreciate how they go over only the important aspects of the topics, I enjoyed how the professors talked a little bit about the history of neuroscience discoveries because it consolidated different knowledge we learned, the professors excitement on certain topics was inspiring to see weaknesses: the exams could be written better to test us on the broader important information of the class, as opposed to the detail of one specific topic, some topics that are very important are fair game, but still i think its a bit unfair to the students to make the exams extremely specific to only some details learned in the entirety of the course improvements: meet with students to talk about their progress in the course\/ how they did on the exam instead of asking the class questions as a whole"

    "Only if you are super interested in neurology or need the course for a major. This class is hard. And if it isn't required, I would credit\/d\/fail it. You'll robably get more out of it that way.",
    "Yes. This course provides an extremely thorough neuroscience education. It starts from the fundamentals of ion channels and membrane potentials, then neurons, then synapses and neurotransmission, and then integrates these ideas to explain the mechanisms underlying cognitive functions. It brings in ideas from cell biology, chemistry, and physics which is a nice way to apply the disparate concepts learned in introductory courses. Having taken this course, I feel confident discussing neuroscience at the systems, cellular, and molecular levels.",
    "Yes its reauired for neuro",
    "ABSOLUTELY NOT. Change your major. If you are premed it doesnt matter what you major in. Dont feed into their ego.",
    "I would recommend this course because it's really interesting to see how neurons fundamentally work. But, to take this class you must have a passion to learn this information otherwise everything can seem to blend together and it won't be as meaningful.",
    "Only if they are required. Otherwise, no.",
    "The material taught in this course is super interesting, although in the second half of the course, it can feel like a repeat of Human Brain. However, the exams are HARD. It often felt like the exams tested us on content we hadn't learned. There's no work outside of 2 midterms and a final, so make sure you study for the exams. If you haven't taken physics, the first part of the course on electrophysiology will probably be difficult.",
    "No. If you dont have to take this course, dont. The instruction is confusing and hard to follow. The test questions are extremely unfair and not representative of what we learn.",
    "Only take this course if it is necessary for your major. If not, the level of detail we go to may not benefit you, and could be overwhelming.",
    "Well. It's a very interesting class and most of the material is actually pretty cool, just be prepared to be very confused until you attend every Thursday review session with the TAs.",
    "I would recommend the class to students with a strong interest in neuroscience, because I did learn a lot. However I would warn them that the class isn't well-organized and that it will take some dedication to understand the material and do well in the class.",
    "Yes. If you are interested in neuroscience, this course is really great. The content is so informative and interesting.",
    "Yes, if you are interested in learning how the cells and regions of your brain use electricity and small molecules to generate your reality, take this course.",
    "You're only taking this class if you're MCDB or Neuroscience, and you probably don't have much of a choice, so my recommendation probably doesn't matter that much. If you're not one of these and are considering taking it for fun, I would say probably not just because it is a LOT of specifics and honestly there are better bio classes to take. I'd recommend human brain or a psych course instead.",
    "If you are truly interested in neuroscience, then yes! I really enjoyed the information that I learned in the course. However, be prepared for a lot of self-teaching. The professors, though nice, are not good at teaching the information. Professor Forscher zips through his material and has accused the class of wanting to purposely slow down the material when we asked clarification questions, while Professor Keshishian mostly just talks through his material without writing much on the blackboard (and when he does, it's small writing) and occasionally pulls up information via an Elmo device instead of a PowerPoint.",
    "The professors have tried to make the course more accessible to undergraduate students as compared to previous years. The course still covers a lot of content, so background in physics, cell bio, and human brain would be very helpful.",
    "Great class! I really enjoyed the lectures and learned so much about the brain. Should probably be taken after human brain.",
    "Yes -- if you put in the work to memorize the foundational material (and get sufficient sleep to pay attention for each lecture) and understand each handout, this course is enriching, exciting, and essential for any student of neuroscience. Even if you prefer to study e.g. social or developmental neuroscience, this foundation in reductionist neurobiology and basic mechanisms and circuits is essential for supporting that work. If you're not in the neuroscience major, I recommend taking the course credit\/D. In any case, be wary of the exams (study even the first section well for the final, and be prepared to answer tricky electrophysiology questions).",
    "Yes, the information is very interesting and exciting, but it is also very difficult unless you have prior background in biology. Since it is very specific to the brain, only take it if you are interested in neuroscience\/the brain."
