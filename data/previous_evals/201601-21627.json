    "You should definitely take this course!!! It is totally amazing, and I wish there were more like it.",
    "Lots of reading. Three very doable papers. If they make this a WR, take it for sure. Professor Kamens is very knowledgeable and you'll learn a lot about Heian Period art, poetry, and culture.",
    "This is a class that reads the Tale of Genji, an 11th century Japanese literary masterpiece, from beginning to end as well as commentary and interpretations of it. I would recommend this course to anyone interested in expanding his\/her view of literature or interested in East Asian views of the world or society. It is well taught, interesting, and totally worth your time.",
    "More people should take this class! It is a hidden gem. The Tale of Genji is a somewhat of a 1300 page soap opera but it has beautiful passages, deep ideas, and a gripping plot that may move you to tears. There are only three papers and none of them were particularly difficult to write. Professor Kamens is very kind and understanding and at the same time extremely knowledgeable. I enjoyed the small class size as well."
