    "Definitely take it if you're at all interesting in morality and the structure of society.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. It is not the most challenging. There is a great amount of reading that is asked of you. However the in class quizzes are not very difficult as long as you study your lecture notes.",
    "Really great overview of some of the most prominent social theorists. If you think you would be interested in reading some of the greats in a survey fashion, give this course a try. Not too much work, a steady amount of reading, a few short in class quizzes, and two papers. Really enjoyable course.",
    "Great course if you want to understand some major thinkers in philosophy. Whatever you don't catch in the reading (which isn't entirely necessary) you can learn in lecture. Five in-class quizzes and two papers (with many prompts to choose from). I honestly did most of my learning in a group review session the day before each quiz, so make sure you find a study group and do the same. Overall, a good first philosophy class.",
    "Good intro\/survey for sociological\/socio-philosophical thought. Not particularly riveting, but decent if you're just looking for an overview. Readings can be a lot - but if you pay attention in lecture and do, say, 1\/3 of them, you'll be okay. Definitely will be a lot more rewarding if you do the majority, though (duh).",
    "This class deals with many of the premier thinkers that everyone should engage with at some point, such as Kant, Marx, and Nietzsche. You'll examine these thinkers and their writing from more of a theoretical standpoint, which was an interesting change after having read a few of these texts in philosophy classes. Professor Erikson is wonderful and made me look forward to going to class.",
    "Foundations of Modern Social Theory is a great way to understand the basics of sociological thought without taking DS. Students read Kant, Hobbes, Rousseau, Weber, and may others, and are introduced to some very thought-provoking sections of sociology and philosophy. This is a great class to take Credit\/D as a survey of sociological writings.",
    "Decent overview course in social theory. I took this course as a non-major and I would shop it before taking it for sure, but it's an interesting survey in the ideas of a lot of social theory.",
    "!A: WONDERFUL COURSE. I was really hesitant to take Foundations of Modern Social Theory, but it ended up being my favorite class of the semester. I did not fill a distributional requirement, and it was not for my major, but it was very worthwhile. First up, Emily Erikson is a fantastic lecturerincredibly engaging, and her voice is very pleasant to listen to. She made it worth the hike up science hill to the Watson center twice a week. For the most part, the readings were excellent, although some were better than others. I particularly liked Durkheim, Hobbes\/Rousseau, Levinas, and Kant. As someone who didnt take Directed Studies, I feel like this was a great class for megreat reading list. What was most rewarding was really understanding the nuances of the social theory, which often meant drawing out diagrams and pictures to really grasp the concepts. The readings toward the end that felt more historical\/narrative (Du Bois) were not my favorite, and by the end I felt like I was taking more of a WGSS or AFAM class as we started to talk about race and gender. WORKLOAD: you MUST take excellent notes in class, and go to every lecture. Erikson says pretty much everything you need to know in class. You still need to do the readings (although I guess you could get away with not doing them, but you really should to succeed in section). The 5 reading quizzes were SO NICE. I cant stress that enough. NO MIDTERM\/NO FINAL. Absolutely amazing class structure. It was also a great way to break up the class into different modules. I could usually review the reading the night before and get a 10\/10 on all of them (which is 50% of my grade already locked in as a near-perfect score). The essays are your typical argumentative essay which requires to you compare\/contrast multiple theories. Straightforward. Have a clear thesis and use the text and you will do well. I got an A+ on my first paper. SECTION: good and bad. Participation was really weak, and often it became a second lecture. If you do the reading section will be a piece of cake and you can easily contribute 2-3 times per section and get a good participation grade. FINAL THOUGHTS: very chill class, section is great with Dicky Yangzom (show effort, come talk to her after sectionshes a very fair grader and she made a study guide for one of the quizzes!). Erikson is amazing. Cons: the level of depth often felt very superficial. Be aware that this is a survey class, so often I felt like doing the reading in depth was a bit useless.",
    "Take the class, but don't do the readings. Take good notes during lectures, don't skip. Sometimes you'll have no idea what's going on, and that's to be expected. Work hard on the papers. They're harder than you think.",
    "This course is a great way to get a comprehensive overview of fundamental thinkers to modern theory.",
    "This is a great class if you want a broad overview of some seminal thinkers and their ideas. I would take this course for the reading list alone, though unfortunately many people don't do any of the readings and it is easy to stop doing them, because everything you're tested on comes directly from what is said in lecture. If you're looking for in-depth analysis or nuanced treatment of the fine points of philosophers\/theorists, you won't find that in this class. It is a survey, and you will mostly get bullet-point type understanding of the theory addressed, but it does provide a good foundation for further study of sociology\/philosophy. It also is helpful to get a sense of how the ideas of these thinkers are related. The assessment schedule for this class is really nice because it spaces out the workload across multiple small tests, which is very helpful during midterms and finals.",
    "A class that everyone should take before leaving Yale.",
    "Professor Erikson is extremely knowledgeable and overall, this is a very interesting and informative course. It is extremely easy and there is almost no accountability, so I would definitely encourage you to actually do the readings and go to lecture (even if it feels like you don't have to) in order to get the most out of it.",
    "Definitely take.",
    "I would recommend this class to a student who is new to social theory. I have never read any of the authors previously and this class was a pretty good overview of the important ideas of each author. The readings are definitely hard most of the time, but it helps a lot to talk over the ideas with classmates\/professor\/TA before writing the papers and taking the quizzes.",
    "In this class you learn about the basics of social theory. Basic philosophers, economists, and sociologists are covered such as Durkheim, Marx, and Kant. At the end of the class you have a good basic knowledge of theories of the organization and development of society. I would recommend this class because it is interesting without being too difficult or overwhelming.",
    "This is probably the most meh class I've ever taken. It's a pretty okay overview of a bunch of theorists. It's not that hard, but you don't learn that much either.",
    "A quick pass through a breadth of modern social theory. Really interesting topics, and Professor Erikson makes them super accessible. Lectures are good, readings are interesting and manageable, and the paper topics are engaging. I'd definitely recommend this class to anyone, regardless of exposure to the topic.",
    "'twas a marvelously taught course. It is a broad survey that covered many of the most important philosophers and sociologists. Professor Erikson was compelling throughout the course, and the quizzes were very fair if you pay attention in lecture and get the general ideas from the reading. You aren't tested on minutia, which allows you to focus on what is important.",
    "I would recommend it to any student with an interest in sociology or philosophy. You learn about lots of different people and its applicable to the real world.",
    "An ideal SO gut course: strong syllabus with very interesting, diverse content for those interested in deeper understanding and an easy lecture format with minimal work required for those interested in a more superficial understanding. This is a useful survey of the works of several important thinkers that everyone should have read.",
    "This is a good course for any college student to take as it covers important works that are relevant in understanding our modern society.",
    "It's a good class if you're looking for an overview of the Western canon of sociological thoughts and social philosophy. However, do not expect to go anything beyond an overview; if you're more interested in specific fields of sociology, or closer reading of texts of certain scholars, this may not be the best class for you.",
    "I would definitely recommend Foundations to another student. This class was exactly what I had been looking for and a perfect introduction to Political Philosophy\/Social Theory. Professor Erikson is engaging and does an excellent job at clarifying and discussing the readings. I also really enjoyed the format of the assignments - 5 quizzes and 2 papers. The quizzes are very reasonable and also force you to keep up with the material periodically throughout the semester, and classes were always fun to attend.",
    "This course is a reading course. you are reading philosophers and putting them into conversation with each other. This course would be great for humanities people who want a social science credit which only involves reading. If you like reading philosophers this is a great course. Also Professor Erickson really tries hard to keep it engaging and I think succeeds",
    "SOCT 151 completely changed my life and the way I view the world\/society! At first, I was nervous about taking it because it was my first philosophy-like class, but Professor Erikson succinctly explains the concepts and makes it accessible to students. If you have a chance, definitely take this course! The workload is not too bad with 5 quizzes, 2 papers, and no final.",
    "Take it: it requires very little to minimal work, and is interesting. With that being said, I am a sociology major so it might not be as interesting and\/or easy to others. There are no exams but instead five in class tests (which are straight from the lectures and require no reading) and two five-page papers. Professor Eriksson is great."
