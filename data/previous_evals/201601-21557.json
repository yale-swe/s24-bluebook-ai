    "Take it for a relaxed senior requirement. For me it was the perfect overlap course with a decent workload, but without the stress of exams and with the freedom of exploration with a half-term project. I would certainly recommend. Plus, Sekhar is always amazing.",
    "AMTH 437 is a good course for students who are strong-ish in linear algebra (or at least good at pretending they are), are vaguely interested in practical problems in optimization, and like doing problem sets. If coming up with a math project or writing a ten page paper about something mathematics-intensive seems like a terrible challenge, I wouldn't recommend this class. If that sounds easier than writing a paper about the French Revolution, though, this is probably for you. It's an interesting topic and the course gives everyone at least a cursory understanding of the basics of the field.",
    "Good chance to get some face time with an extremely intelligent professor outside of class and do an awesome project at end of semester.",
    "Sekhar is great. Take the class for a chance to interact with him if nothing else. Every time I bothered him after class, at office hours, or over email he was attentive, thoughtful, and helpful. That being said, if you, like me, where looking for a course on numerical methods, don't take this. Take this course if you are interested in a fairly high level math course on optimization techniques. I think that, on average, undergrads found the math challenging while grad students found it manageable, if not easy. Prepare for you project early, and make sure you find an objective function that is convex. It became apparent in the last week or so that I was trying to optimize a non-convex function and all hell broke loose.",
    "Take this class if you would like to learn how the optimization algorithms work. You would learn a lot of unnecessary mathematical details as well, but they do not appear on the exams. So, you do not really need to cram yourself for them -- I believe this was the right way to teach this material.",
    "Absolutely fantastic. This is the best course I have ever taken in my life. I don't even know why Yale does not offer this course every year. Prof. Tatikonda moves fast. We basically covered the two-semester material at Stanford in one semester. And convex optimization should be a really important subject, related to a lot of fields like economics and statistics.",
    "Tough, but grading is nice and Sekhar is awesome. Useful and interesting applications.",
    "This is a good introduction to some theory and algorithms for optimization. Sekhar emphasizes at the beginning of the semester that students should have \"a reason for taking the course.\" I would recommend taking this seriously, as you might find the lectures a bit boring if you don't have a motivation for being interested in the the subject.",
    "A pretty solid course, but be warned: It can move fast at times. Also watch out for the prereqs. The linear algebra that you are expected to know goes quite a bit beyond MATH 222 or 225. Just because you've taken one of these courses, do not expect this class to be easy. I would recommend having taken some more advanced linear algebra first. Otherwise, be prepared to struggle a little and study up on your own. The class is also a bit hampered by falling somewhat awkwardly between the theoretical and applied. Sekhar definitely aims for a more theory-based class (keep that in mind if you are looking for something applied), but sometimes the book will try to make extensions and applications. These usually fall flat and can be confusing. The saving grace of the course is that there are no exams. You may struggle through the psets, but they are always doable. And the final project is what you make of it. Overall, a good class, but definitely not for everyone. Think carefully before you commit to it.",
    "This was an interesting class with a very applicable topic. I would only recommend it to people interested in math looking for a project driven higher level class."
