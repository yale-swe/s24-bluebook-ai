    "I may or may not recommend Math 120 to another student. People who don't enjoy math find it tedious and very dense as a subject. I enjoyed it, which made the difficult concepts more bearable.",
    "Hmm... math 120... Its difficulty increases exponentially. it starts innocently enough with simple stuff like vector equations and progresses to cruel 3 dimensional equations etc. the only way to get through this course is to study REGULARLY. Do all ur P.sets and discuss them and u will be fine..And u must be a really stupid person if u r thinking of using it towards distributional requirement or r just taking it when it is not a prerequisite. almost none of this has any practical applications and i doubt even engineers remember it at all",
    "Your standard multivariable course. Be sure to get Michael Frame. Don't skip class too much.",
    "Great course. You have to like math of course. And read the textbook please, because it's very well written.",
    "Prof Raj does a good job explaining all the concepts and won't leave a student behind if they don't understand something. If you want to take 120, Raj would be a good choice. Also, if you're not a math person and don't care to see very in-depth proofs, Raj usually focuses more on understanding the overall concepts and the meaning and application of the theorems, and less on how they were derived."
