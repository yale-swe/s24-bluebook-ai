    "It might be a fun course for undergraduates, but I would not recommend this course to students who already have a good grasp of basic algebra. The course simply does not cover enough material. Graduate students are probably better off taking representation theory or algebraic geometry.",
    "I might recommend it to a student with a very strong algebra background who wants to explore topics in commutative algebra or foundations of mathematics (some of which are subjects of current research) in a free-form way. It is not a straightforward, well-organized course that gives you a general algebra background covering all the main theorems on a broad variety of topics. I expected the latter kind of course (and would have preferred it.)"

   "comments": [
    "This course made me think a lot about the foundations of mathematics, and I have come to the conclusion that a foundation based on set theory simply does not make sense. Such an approach prevents you from constructing larger and larger objects, and it causes you to favor specific constructions of mathematical objects in terms of sets even though what you're really interested in are the properties those objects enjoy. I feel like Professor Zuckerman spent the whole semester fighting his own formalism. He knows that many mathematical constructions are characterized up to isomorphism by their properties, but for some reason he insists on using specific set theoretic constructions, and this just makes his proofs more complicated and less intuitive.",
    "I did develop a deeper appreciation for algebra and \"functorial thinking\" from this course."
