    "Spanish 120 is a great class to continue your Spanish education. It's a continuation of an introduction to Spanish vocabulary and grammar. The homework can be tedious and overwhelming since you usually have some everyday. But, if you take this class with Professor Asensio, you will really have a lot of fun and improve greatly. She is a great professor that wants her students to understand Spanish and succeed in grasping it.",
    "If you have the desire to learn a really cool language, or else take Indonisian.",
    "If you need a language credit, then you'll be taking this class regardless. Still, its a decent course and you'l likely learn a fair amount. Still, don't expect to make any huge strides in your spanish and be prepared for some busy work. The grading is fair, as are the quizzes and exams.",
    "I highly recommend the class and especially the teacher. Even though the class is every day, it was always pretty enjoyable and never it felt like you were overwhelmed.",
    "Yes I would recommend it. The spanish department is a strong department and you end up learning a lot, even as someone who doesn't particularly like learning languages."
