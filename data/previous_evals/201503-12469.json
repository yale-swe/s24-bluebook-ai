   "comments": [
    "You cover a ton of material quickly, so you don't really get an in-depth understanding of why each of the statistical methods functions. However, it is a good introduction to statistics for someone who has no experience in the field and provides a good context for interpreting the statistical methods used in studies you might encounter in other coursework.",
    "yes! Statistics is essential no matter what your field of study is. And professor Reuning-Scherer is an amazing lecturer.",
    "Stat103 is a great intro statistics course perfect for anyone looking to get a basic understanding of statistics. An upper level statistics couse would have to be taken to dig really deep into the material, but this was my favorite course of the semester. I would definitely recommend it!",
    "I would recommend STAT 103 to a student who is interested in majoring in statistics, in taking relatively simple QR credit, or somebody who is just interested in math. It is not a very mathematically-centered course, as in there are no complicated math problems on exams, more of just a basic understanding of the concepts. I would definitely recommend that students be interested in statistics before taking the course.",
    "Yes! Take this class. You'll learn a ton of really practical information, and have a good time doing it.",
    "I definitely recommend this class if you want to learn the basics of Stats. If you took AP Stats in high school, there will be some overlap, but this class definitely goes beyond the AP Stats curriculum. I especially recommend taking the flipped version of the class if you can because it is definitely beneficial to get to work with data on the class's stats program every class.",
    "About as intro as you can get. I took the class Flipped, which I would recommend if you don't love math and have never taken statistics before. JDRS is the absolute bomb and he makes the class worthwhile.",
    "JRS is incredibly knowledgable and a good lecturer (although he should definitely slow down in the future), making a relatively hum-drum subject actually pretty engaging. The class structure itself is pretty weird however, as you spend all of your lectures working in an online program, which you don't actually use for exams. Take it because it's useful, even if it's a little painful.",
    "JDRS is the man! He's incredibly friendly and approachable. I have not come across a professor as dedicated to teaching as he is. The review sessions he holds before exams are extremely helpful, go to them and ask any questions you'd like! He's the best teacher I've had at Yale.",
    "Definitely take Flipped Stats. The midterms are take-home, and so you aren't forced to cram information last minute. Also, the final is a project instead of a final. It's a no-brainer.",
    "I would recommend Intro Stats to anyone wanting a well-taught and appropriately paced overview of basic statistics. While the course material is rather dry, it is quite applicable to many other academic fields. Also, splitting up into concentrated sessions during the second half of the semester makes things more interesting. Definitely take it with Professor Reuining-Scherer, his humor is fantastic.",
    "It was a good introductory class even for a person with no STAT background at all. You do have to keep up with the material though, or else you'll be very lost with psets. For success, make sure you go to the lectures and pay attention to Jonathan; or, you can cram really hard for a couple of days leading up to the exams. The exams are not as hard as psets.",
    "Stat 103 was a good intro stat class, especially for beginners. We started from the very beginning, and JDRS was good about keeping it simple for underlings. The topics we covered were really useful. I was able to use the skills we learned immediately. I would definitely reccomend it!",
    "Dope!",
    "Great professor, good course, focus and study and get help on homework and you'll be fine",
    "STAT 103 was a great introductory course. It was well-organized, engaging, and informative. The homework was clear and educational and the tests were fair. In addition, Professor Reunion-Scherer is a terrific professor--clear, charismatic, funny, and engaging. He made a potentially dry subject like statistics super interesting. Highly recommended!",
    "Stats is never going to be the most interesting subject at Yale, and if you aren't fascinated by the material or need to take it for your major you probably should just skip it in general. However, if you need to take it, this is probably the way to do it. JDRS makes stats about as painless as it can possibly be. There isn't too much work - just short weekly problem sets and the two midterms and final are very manageable. You manage to learn a lot and JDRS keeps it entertaining with good humor and fun stories, even in the face of such boring material and generally unengaged classes. He is very approachable, very helpful, and teaches stats in a way where you really learn it. Definitely recommend if you need to take a stats class.",
    "good class. take if you need to get a distributional requirement",
    "STAT 103 is a very important class to take because it gives a good foundation for critical thinking and data analysis. The work load is not very large, but the exams were difficult because we covered so much material without much insight to what we really needed to know.",
    "Thoroughly good Stats class, but don't expect it to feel super relevant to social sciences- the relevance is simply in where the data came from. That being said, I've heard from a Sociology major in the class relevant and useful preparation. I'd suggest it for students if they intend for this preparation.",
    "This class was a fast-paced overview of the basic concepts of statistics. It did not involve too many complex mathematical concepts, it was more theory-based. I would recommend this class to those who want a basic overview of how the subject, especially to those who want a better understanding of how to interpret statistical data in articles or studies.",
    "A recommended stats class!",
    "Flipped stat was amazing, such a great way to learn.",
    "The flipped version of the class was a great experience! I was hesitant about joining because I wasn't sure if it was for me, but everyone who took the class ended up loving it! The take-home midterms require some time, but you can do very well on them if you go to the office hours he provides. And the class environment is great because you can ask questions and work hands-on with minitab. Overall I was really happy in the flipped class!",
    "I would recommend it simply because statistics are so important in our current world. However, I really did not enjoy it as the material is very dry. I would recommend the FLIPPED version with professor Ruening-Scherer. He was the only redeeming aspect of the course. In the FLIPPED version he was excellent at answering our questions and making himself extremely accessible both during office hours\/after class and via email. BUT BE WARNED. It's not an easy intro class. There is an exorbitant amount of material given to you and some units can be pretty tricky (probability).",
    "THE FLIPPED VERSION of this class is awesome. I cannot speak about the lecture, but I know that JDRS is one of the greatest professors you'll have at Yale. He is so devoted, diligent, and helpful. Take this course!",
    "Great introduction to stats. Would definitely recommend! Take it with Professor Reuning-Scherer, who is very enthusiastic about the material and passionate about teaching.",
    "TAKE THE FLIPPED VERSION! It suited my learning style the best, and was the closest to the small-class feel of high school. It may have taken slightly more time every day, but it saved me a lot of time in frustration trying to re-learn everything outside of lecture. The videos were always high-quality and JRS was the greatest; I really got to ask every question that popped into my head and therefore I learned so much more. The practice that we had during class was crucial, and being around the forestry students was a plus.",
    "This is intro statistics at its finest; there are a lot of concepts to cover, but Professor Reuning-Scherer makes his lectures very enjoyable and entertaining. The work itself is a bit challenging, but doable. The social sciences section can also be used in lieu of Psych Stat, which is a plus.",
    "This is a very fair class as long as you keep up with the work and lectures. JDRS can talk quickly during lectures, so that may take some getting used to."
