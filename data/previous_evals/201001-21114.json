    "I would definitely recommend it. I believe the format will be changing significantly, but I imagine that the basic approach will remain the same. You get a wonderful introduction to the clinical manifestation of each disease, the basic biological mechanisms and how researchers areapproaching the major remaining questions, and the possible clinical applications of that research. Each lecturer was a foremost expert in his field. As it was structured this year, there was also virtually no work, which meant that you could just enjoy the experience, with no added stresses at all.",
    "NBIO 507 involves a series of lectures from experts on various neurological diseases, such as AD, FTD, ALS, Prion diseases, and others, from a cellular and molecular viewpoint. The lectures are not all coordinated with each other, but the class offers a good survey of the research that is going on now. Since the material falls within in or near the lecturers' fields of interest, the material is as current as imaginable.Most students had taken cell biology or something similar, and such a background was probably necessary to get anything significant from the course. Background in neurobiology was very helpful, but it was possible to learn without one.However, it should be noted that the class is expected to have a major overhaul and reworking for future years, so a discussion of certain details is not necessarily helpful.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. Very interesting concepts were covered in a concise yet stimulating matter."

    "I am an undergraduate, but this course sparked or deepened my interest in a number of the diseases addressed. I want to continue studies in neurobiology and potentially to focus on neurobiology in pursuing an MD\/PhD degree.",
    "It further increased my interestin neurological diseases."
