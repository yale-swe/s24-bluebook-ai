    "This was my first introduction to urban planning so I learned a lot from the course. Understanding the history and foundations of urban planning and then various trends and topics of focus in the field was enlightening. I also really enjoyed how David allowed us to focus on our own interests through the assignments so we could apply these lessons to areas that we were interested in.",
    "Urban Planning, Zoning, Architecture, Climate change.",
    "Trends in 20th and 21st century planning, planning for climate mitigation\/adaptation and resilience, regional planning, transportation alternatives, zoning.",
    "A broad sense of contemporary planning issues and the role of an urban planner in America.",
    "Basic understanding of urban planning practices, often at a much more nitty-gritty level than expected. Major takeaways were transit oriented development and density as a key to sustainable urbanization.",
    "This course was a great overview into urban planning! It allowed students to learn a wide range of critical planning components form the differences in regional and subregional planning to zoning and finance. I found Mr. Kooris to be a really effective teach and also found the course to be designed very well.",
    "Great background in salient issues, and where to go for more information.",
    "This course was a very practical perspective into the methods and history of urban planning in the United States, especially east coast. I felt that I came out with a robust vocabulary in the topic and working understanding of the planning practice in the us",
    "This course was more valuable to me than any of the other courses I have taken at the Architecture School. It exposed me to readings, theories and ideas I haven't encountered before and I thoroughly enjoyed this course. It should be a part of the Architecture school.",
    "I gained a broad overview of urban planning"

    "Great, I did not have a lot of expectations coming into the class and left feeling like I learned so much.",
    "They aligned fairly well. More of the content was presented anecdotally, which made it interested, but wasn't as 'structured' or universal as I would have expected.",
    "Very well.",
    "More in-depth and real-life, down-to-earth than I expected.",
    "This course aligned very well with my expectations. I was engaging and challenged me to think like a planner.",
    "Pretty well. I was expecting a good survey. Got that and good insight into practice.",
    "They aligned very well with my expectations. The syllabus is well described",
    "Very Very well.",
    "Met my expectations, which were high",

   "comments": [
    "Strengths are David's knowledge and skillset. He is so knowledgeable and I am very thankful that I had the chance to learn from him. No suggestions for improvement.",
    "Interesting topics - well organized by week. Many readings assigned each week, I typically could not get to all of them. Some of the readings felt a little out-dated, and might benefit by being replaced by a more contemporary equivalent. I liked the group assignment where we researched a community for the semester. For this assignment (and the others), I think there could be slightly better guidance about expectations. Really enjoyed both field trips - great way to gain real-world insights into how urban planning decision-making is done, and when there are good\/bad outcomes from it.",
    "The major strength and weakness is Professor Kooris focus on his own experience. He has a lot to offer and generally began class with a discussion on planning situations from the past week. While this is valuable, at times he spent too much of the class (roughly an hour) on this type of lecture. It would be helpful if he aligned his lectures more closely with the readings.",
    "Lectures were super interesting, assignments were rewarding. There were a lot of readings - too many to reasonably do all of them every week. Also could have used more guidance on the projects, as expectations were often vague.",
    "One of the courses greatest strengths was the lectures and paired readings. I really enjoyed the material and found Mr. Kooris' lecture style to be very engaging. I also enjoyed the two field trips that our class took. I didn't really think that the course had too many weaknesses though it would have been nice to get more feedback on our assigned. In particular, our group planning assignments.",
    "Having someone so active and knowledgeable in the field was important to the success of the class. Field trips, especially the zoning meeting, brought home the nuances behind working in planning.",
    "Th",
    "Weakness is that it's a 3 hour lecture at 4:30 pm. Strengths include an engaging professor and interesting content."

   "comments": [
    "I would recommend anyone interested in the subject to take this course. I was unable to do all of the readings due to a heavy semester, however I would recommend students do all of the readings because they are fascinating (I downloaded them all so I could finish reading in my free time).",
    "The content was interesting, and its great to get a practitioner perspective. I would not take this course if you are looking to develop hard skills or dive really deep in a specific topic area related to urban planning.",
    "This is a great class if you want a comprehensive introduction to contemporary urban planning issues. Great field trips!",
    "Do it if you're really interested in the realities of urban planning.",
    "This class offers a great overview of planning from a practitioners point of view. It is a tremendous course and is very engaging. Not only do you cover a lot of material during the course but you also have the ability to go more in depth into one particular concept with the term paper. Mr. Kooris is a wonderful teacher and is a great lecturer!",
    "Great course. Make the most out of it. Read all of the materials. Take time on your paper so you can really delve into your interests.",
    "The in class lectures were widely interesting. The homework assignments and readings could have been more engaging",
    "take it if you have any interest in urban planning.",
    "If you're interested in urban planning, this course provides a more tangible approach than other courses at Yale"
