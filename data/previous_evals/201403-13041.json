   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend this course - you see a lot of amazing work through completion, and though initially, it is daunting to write a manuscript, the end product is truly rewarding. It does get intensive at times, but my semester would not have been the same without the course and the valuable skills it has given me.",
    "This class is the perfect framework to write up a global health research manuscript with the support of two of the best professors working in global health at Yale. Having followed the course of taking the global health research methods class, and then done global health research over the summer for the GH Fellowship, this was the perfect culmination of that work. This class meets as a whole sometimes, and other times splits into groups as a type of peer-review, and has ample time for one-on-one sessions with the professors, to go over our questions on an individual basis. I couldn't have asked for a better support in producing what will hopefully be a successfully written manuscript.",
    "HLTH490 needs a lot of improvement if it hopes to be the research publication course for Global Health - it needs so much work. It would almost be better to just work with your advisor over the course of the semester.",
    "Think thrice before taking this course. You should have a solid data set, previous stat courses, and a previous methodology course. You also need a lot of independent dedication and planning (which a lot of Yale students have but do not utilize). Also, I might not take this course for qualitative paper writing, you really do not get the support you need. However, despite these limitations, this course provides you with an intellectually rewarding experience. Even at an institution like Yale one rarely gets an opportunity to follow one's intellectual creation for the period of more than a year. This course will be what you make of it and you will be fascinated at your final product. At points it is more stressful than necessary but I enjoyed writing for this course more than I have writing for other courses.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone interested in health sciences who has any data or field experience to work with. Whether you want to pursue research or not, you will gain unique skills and insights that you will not gain anywhere else.",
    "If you have qualitative data then not really. I took the class thinking it would help me keep on track with my analysis and get extra guidance for my manuscript (because it's really hard to know where to begin)- but that was really missing. I felt like I was trying to please the professor ultimately rather than allowing my own data and research to guide my manuscript. If you have an outside adviser this class doesn't really add much. Instead it leaves you more puzzled about your work, as you try to find a balance between the feedback you're getting from other co-authors or advisers and trying to fit that with the class requirements and expectations of the professors. There is still some imbalance in trying to figure out how this class can be adjusted for the different backgrounds of the students, the different datasets, and the different expertise levels. I wouldn't take it if I had qualitative data, but maybe for quantitative. Make sure to talk to the professors about the scope of your data and type of data and try to gauge if it will be feasible in one semester. If that doesn't seem possible, it's not worth the stress honestly.",
    "You work with your data to write a manuscript fit for publication in a target journal that you choose.",
    "In this class, you will write a publishable health research paper. In many ways, this assignment is more daunting than a senior thesis: quite explicitly, the bar for your paper (and the metric for your final grade, basically) is whether or not it is publishable. In its current form, the class structures grading such that your final paper pretty much determines your final grade. The class is also currently structured such that most of the work is, with limited exception, unevenly spaced. It is easy for your final paper to progress much like Hemingway described how one goes into poverty: \"Gradually, then suddenly.\" Future iterations of the class might restructure assignments such that the work is accomplished in more reasonable chunks at more equitable distances. Until then, the syllabus will likely mean much work done in great haste, just when the same is being called for in every other class with a final paper or a final exam. This is probably the worst time for anyone to write a publishable paper. However, the class also gives you what no other class at Yale currently does: a paper you can print. It couples the desire to publish your work with the pressure of an actual Yale class with an actual Yale grade. The fire lit, this class will drive you to write: if you have a paper that you worry might not get written without motivation, this is the best source of drive, not to mention academic guidance and professional mentorship, that you could hope for. Profs. Bradley and Talbert-Slagle are some of the best mentors you could wish, and your fellow students will likely be some amazing budding researchers. The class will teach you essentials that both underpin most health research and yet go untaught to a shocking number of young research students. If you want to publish a paper, take this course. Worried about the grade? Perhaps that's a good thing - you may take the paper more seriously. Or, you could take the class Credit\/D\/Fail, but then some of that drive, that fire, dampens."
