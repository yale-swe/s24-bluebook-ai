   "comments": [
    "This is an amazing lecture with insanely comprehensive things that are said in class by Prof. Warner. Warner is amazing. It's almost too bad that it's a lecture because people don't seem to do enough reading.",
    "This was a great class! I wasn't able to do all the reading, which I regret, but it was still very interesting!Professor Warner is great. He is very passionate about the material and presented very interesting perspectives.",
    "This class is very interesting but is VERY heavy on reading. It is difficult to keep up with the readings and they are not particularly interesting unless you are interested in wartime literature, but Professor Warner brings fascinating insight to every lecture that he taught in which case, I would recommend it.",
    "Absolutely. It is the one English lecture that actually engages you in lecture.",
    "I would recommend it to English majors looking to fulfill both the pre- 1900 and American literature requirement.",
    "yes, take it, some snobby hoity-toity english major kids (blah) but overall totally fun and engaging and i came out of it feeling like i learned something (and wanting to continue learning more on the subject).",
    "Particularly for a pre-1900 or American Lit credit for the English major, this is a good lecture class. I didn't find the material particularly riveting but Professor Warner is an engaging lecturer and he chose smart and awesome TAs. It's not too much work and you can miss a couple of lectures and still do well.",
    "I really really liked this class. It's a great way to knock out a few English requirements, but it's also good for its own sake. One tip is that the reading expectation picks WAY up after shopping period, so don't take it expecting a small amount of reading. Try to stay up with it because the final is cumulative, and obviously you'll have a better experience in lecture if you do. Michael Warner is really good and I found the texts important and memorable.",
    "Yeah, totally! Straight-forward, jam-packed with cool information, very clear narratives and fun ideas. Prof. Warner is a great lecturer and a lucid, compassionate thinker.",
    "This class is more American Studies than English...it has a good reading list but if you're looking to engage with American classics you might do better to take the introductory American lit seminars, even as an upper classman. Lectures were interesting but not thrilling, and the syllabus has some gems on it but also some cultural artifacts\/documents that were less interesting to me as an English student"
