    "It's a really great introduction to both classical chinese and some really enjoyable texts. It's a great class",
    "We read pretty good stuff this term-- Mencius and Zhuangzi-- so I'd say go for it if you've looked at them in translation and want a get a sense of what the original feels like. Pretty painless if your Chinese is decent.",
    "Yes, take it!!!! The stuff you read is so cool!",
    "Chinese 171 is an introduction to Classical Chinese that is interesting but does not require too much work. I would recommend Chinese 171 to anyone with an interest in Chinese history and literature because it can help to provide a better understanding of old Chinese writings."
