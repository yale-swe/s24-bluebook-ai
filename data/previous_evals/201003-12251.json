    "The strength of the course is Professor Chang. She is an amazing person-- so creative, open-minded and passionate about Chinese poetry. It's contagious. The class really makes you think about Chinese literature deeply.",
    "CHNS 200 is an excellent introduction to Chinese poetry. The readings are very manageable and the classes are relaxing but you still learn a lot. Professor Chang is very enthusiastic and it is impossible not to enjoy her style of teaching.If you have taken a Chinese history class, CHNS 200 is great because you study poetry from different dynasties and you put the poetry in context.",
    "Professor Chang is really one of the best in the field. I can't say I would have taken the course if my major weren't related to the subject matter, but I think there were a smattering of people in the section who were just interested in sampling non-Western literature, and they seemed to enjoy it.There is a LOT of reading that you'll have to do if you want to participate in a meaningful way in section, but it's mostly light to get through - short poems, short stories, and the like.",
    "great (and manageable! so you'll actually be able to think about them) readings, nice TA, funny professor - what more could you want?",
    "A delightful class. A lot of reading sometimes, but otherwise painless. People in the class had varied levels of preparation\/knowledge regarding Chinese literature, philosophy, etc. I knew exactly nothing and learned a whole bunch. Prof. Chang is a lovely woman and very receptive to students' ideas.",
    "CHNS 200 provides a survey of classical Chinese texts and poetry. Professor Kang I-Sun Chang is wonderful, humorous, and engaging, and provides a broad range of fascinating readings. The workload is not intense at all (reading every class, 1 2-page paper, and 2 7-page papers). The quality of discussion can vary, but are led quite well.",
    "Great introduction to imperial Chinese literature, especially poems. Good for students who have no experience with poetry; no pressure to learn how to analyze the meter and lyrics of poems. Can write papers and make comments at a content level. A relaxed course.",
    "I would most definitely recommend Chinese Lit Man and Nature to any student who is reading thsi review. I never intended to take the class and shopped it on a whim. Like most people in the class, I had no previous encounters with Chinese Classical literature, so lack of experience should East Asian literature should not deter anyone from atking the class. However, some knowledge of Chinese is helpful, although not necessary. Overall, I found our readings to be philosophical at times and also very revealing of ancient China, in terms fo values, homosexuality, and drama. Poetry was one of the most powerful tools in ancient China, and the greatest poets ranged from rebels who were eventually executed\/exiled, Emperors who indulged too much in women, and government officials who were Daoist (and you'll learn what Daoism finally is in this class) scholar-rulers. Out of context, some of the poems that we read might have seemed uninteresting, but in the context of the class and the poet's life histories, the subtle meaning reveal themselves. I definitely would not have enjoyed reading old Chinese poems without taking this class because a lot of references are easily missed in translation.",
    "Man and Nature in Chinese Literature was the perfect introductory course to Chinese literature. We were introduced to the major poets of early Chinese literature and to some fiction\/essays.The only weaknesses was that I was slightly confused what happened when and where, and the extent to which history\/religion influenced the literature we studied - though without this class my interest in these topics would not have been piqued.Prof. Chang is great - I was never bored during lecture, and although there were some tangents I was always engaged. She also took time out of her busy schedule to meet with me and help develop my ideas for the essays. It also helps that she is really one of the premier critics in Chinese literature so her knowledge is extensive, and I really enjoyed learning from her.I do wish this class had been capped at 15 or 20 students. The discussions were usually good, but I felt at times half the class wasn't contributing much.",
    "Yes! Take this course if you are interested in how poets thought about life, love, nature, and man's place in society. The course was designed to make you wonder about nature and how you could express yourself in writing.",
    "Take it for Kang-i Sun Chang. She is the best.",
    "This course is a lot of fun. It was an incredible introduction to Chinese literature and thought, and I learned so much. It was a relatively relaxing atmosphere and I didn't feel intimidated during discussion at all. Most of the readings were interesting and some were quite beautiful. Professor Chang was amazing. She had an incredible wealth of knowledge, and that really made the course what it was. She was also funny,",
    "Recommend. If you have an intimate knowledge of Chinese literature already, then a more specific classmight prove more rewarding, although the quality of this class was very dependent on discussion and student make-up. With a more specialized group of students taking it, it could well turn out to be a very different class (especially considering how open the subject matter, Man and Nature, is in general).",
    "Take it if you don't know anything about Chinese dynastic poetry. It's a great survey course with a wonderful professor.",
    "Man and Nature in Chinese Literature was a masterfully designed overview of Chinese literature with an emphasis on poetry and nature topics. I would recommend this class to anyone interested either in Chinese literature or nature or even to anyone interested in a relaxing, fun literature class.",
    "Great, great class. Very easy, very interesting. Take it.",
    "This is such a fun literature class! The readings are great, you read everything from Lao Zi to Journey to the West. Professor Chang is a lot of fun, and I learned a lot about Chinese literature."
