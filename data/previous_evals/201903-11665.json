   "comments": [
    "I learned so much in this class. Specifically, I learned a lot about how the neuroanatomy underlying development and maturation impacts the behavior of adolescents, and the implications this has in today's society and judicial system.",
    "SO SO much about the adolescent brain and how these findings are relevant to modern-day society! It was cool having a class that was applicable to current legal studies.",
    "Learned all about the development trajectory of the adolescent brain and how this development influences adolescent behaviors. It felt like the first half of the course focused on more \"classic\" neuroscience with brain regions\/etc and then the second half of the course included social and legal implications.",
    "Thinking and forming arguments about scientific papers.",
    "We learned so much about the teenage brain and what makes it distinct and different from childhood and adulthood brain. Not only did we learn what is different about the adolescent brain, but we also learned how we can interact with the adolescent brain to make it perceivably less different.",
    "An in-depth understanding of how developmental differences affect behavior. I also learned about how lab research can inform law and policy.",
    "I learned about the basic neural circuitry and development of the adolescent brain. I learned about the results of major studies regarding adolescents.",
    "I gained more insight into why certain changes happen in the adolescent mind. This course was very helpful in giving me insight into the social applications of cognitive science to help better legislation and informing the public, which I am very interested in. Also, I learned more about the nuances of neuroanatomy and specifics about certain brain regions that are sometimes oversimplified in other courses.",
    "This course merges neuroscience with juvenile justice reform. I learned a lot about BJ Casey's amazing research and the evolving nature of the juvenile justice system.",
    "This course is a good introductory neuroscience\/psychology course that teaches you how to interpret neurological findings and incorporates legal\/policy implications.",
    "I learned about several key studies having to do with the adolescent brain, and why legislation should protect teens due to the sensitivities of this unique developmental period.",
    "I learned a lot about neuroscience through studying the developing brain, focusing on adolescent specific changes. I also learned about how these changes in the brain have an impact on societal issues such as drug use and mental illness",
    "Learned a ton about the adolescent brain and the neuroscience behind their behaviors",
    "I learned about the specialities of different regions in the brain and the intricacies of differences between teen, child, and adult behavior. I also learned methods and studies for testing various things like cognitive control.",
    "I learned about the social influences and biological changes that occur across development, with specific focus on how these phenomena explain adolescent behavior. There was some neuroscience involved, but nothing as extensive as the Human Brain. We often went over select studies in detail.",
    "This class was amazing. I learned so much over the course of the semester about brain development and differences between adolescents and adults. We read a lot of scientific papers, wrote responses, participated in a debate, and more.",
    "I learned so much about the adolescent brain and the brain in general, especially about developmental trajectories and how this relates to social and legal policies.",
    "We learned so much about theories of adolescent development and how they compare to current research.",
    "We learned about the maladaptive and adaptive behaviors of the adolescent brain and their legal implications.",
    "I learned essential current models and findings from developmental neuroscience, including human and translational research. In this way, I also practiced and developed my skill reading, responding to, and using evidence from scientific papers",
    "I was able to develop an understanding of several neural changes in adolescence as well as their implications on behavior."

   "comments": [
    "This course was amazing. I literally cannot think of a single weakness. It was taught amazingly, the workload was very manageable, and the work we did have was incredibly constructive in helping us put together the knowledge from class.",
    "I loved the set-up of this course. It never went over an hour in the morning but it was easy to follow along because the class didn't drag on forever. The main ideas were always well-organized and easy to pick out which made studying for the midterm and final easier. The debate was fun for me, even as someone who doesn't like presenting, and it was a great way to learn at least part of the material really well. The workload for this course wasn't overwhelming but there was enough where it didn't feel like a gut. The only downside to this class is that it was at 9 am on tuesdays and thursdays.",
    "Strengths: High relevance to adolescence (the story of the brain goes through age 25 or so).",
    "There weren't many weaknesses of this course! The course load was great, the information was engaging, and BJ was such a great lecturer!",
    "I had fun doing the debate but I feel that we missed out on spending more time talking about law and policy which seemed to be very rushed. Maybe spending less time on the debate and more time on lectures would be helpful. I don't like how the exams are designed to trip us up in terms of the multiple choice and true and false but the review sessions are very helpful, because she tells you exactly what to study. Giving the tests were also annoying because she kept stopping to 'clarify' points that just tended to confuse everyone.",
    "This course is well-organized for learning. Its strengths are its teaching style and its accessibility to a wide range of students, and its weakness is its size. I think this class ideally would be smaller.",
    "The strengths of this course include its engagement with open opportunities for questions during class, which helps make it feel more casual and easier to engage with the material. Also, the weekly readings and responses felt like they were at the right pace for the course content and helped with reviewing and consolidating information.",
    "This course is incredibly strong! I learned a lot, it is well facilitated for learning, and it encourages students to think about neuroscience outside of the classroom.",
    "The strengths of this course are the interesting content, the enthusiastic instruction, and the reasonable workload and expectations. At times the course feels a bit repetitive (in the second half of the semester, particularly). Although that isn't always bad because it really makes sure that you are solid with the concepts.",
    "BJ really cares about what she does and is a good lecturer. She does a really nice job of keeping the workload quite manageable as well. The class could have benefitted from being a bit less repetitive, and tying the knowledge we learn to important policy throughout the course instead of saving it for a couple classes at the end. The way the debate is structured isnt extremely useful.",
    "This was my favorite course this semester, but I wish we spent more time talking about mental illness in adolescents.",
    "The course was very well structured and extremely fair as long as you stay on top of the information",
    "The course gave me a strong understanding about the material. Everything we learned was well reinforced with the creative debate at the end of the year and clear exams that truly tested how well we knew the material.",
    "The lecture slides clearly demonstrated what information to retain from class. Information was presented in a very clear way, although some topics felt rushed at time. I appreciated the low workload and the clearly communicated expectations for homework assignments and exams; these assessments were incredibly fair. However, class did not feel particularly engaging, particularly because it was taught in a lecture style. The lectures were interesting but not particularly demanding or engaging.",
    "Strength: Dr. Casey. Her enthusiasm makes it so worth getting up for her 9 am class. I thought the review sessions were helpful as well. Weaknesses: I really didn't enjoy the debate and I think there at least needs to be a rubric to help guide us so we all are more cohesive. While some skits were fun, it definitely felt uncohesive.",
    "I think this course does not have a weakness as far as I am concerned. It facilitates learning perfectly. I would have liked more comments on my written responses but aside from that I think the course is amazing.",
    "I thought this was an overall really strong course, and it was well formatted. It was great to have a TA (May) to help out with certain things and answer questions when Prof. Casey was not available. That being said, Prof. Casey was sure to make herself very available and encouraged us to meet one-on-one with her to talk about the course or things we had questions about.",
    "I thought the material was very interesting, and the reading responses were a useful way to keep up with what we were learning in class. Also, the review sessions were incredibly helpful and an appropriate refresher on things that were relevant. I loved the spontaneous donuts and coffee and I cannot tell you how much that kept me going. I would restructure the class \"debate\". Splitting the course into two large groups was rather daunting and it was pretty disorganized. It also didn't feel a whole lot like a debate. It really could be made so that we pair off in groups of 2-4 and then come up with a short skit from one of the two arguments (which is what we did anyways).",
    "BJ Casey is phenomenal--one of the best professors at Yale!",
    "The course organization was excellent -- the trajectory felt coherent and like it built on itself. It was exciting to explore social and legal policy questions informed by (or that should be better informed by) developmental neuroscience at the end of the semester and feel equipped\/confident doing so -- like I had a basic knowledge base that could guide future research and readings -- because of our foundational work at the beginning of the semester. I also really appreciate Prof. Casey's warmth and teaching style; she was committed to teaching core content well and at a pace such that everyone could succeed. The three reading responses -- particularly, the synthetic work and simple time spent with the primary literature they required -- were essential to increasing my engagement with and excitement about the course toward the end of the semester. One weakness is perhaps the lack of much individualized feedback (eg the reading responses only got numerical grades with no comments), although I understand that the class was large.",
    "The course covers very interesting material that draws upon fields of both neuroscience and policy."

   "comments": [
    "Yes! This is my favorite class that I have ever taken at Yale. The lectures are all engaging and so interesting, the workload is very manageable, and the professor is at the top of her field yet loves to engage with students. It is an incredible opportunity to get to know a professor and researcher like BJ Casey.",
    "YES! I loved going to class (even though it was a 9am). Professor Casey just makes class so much fun.",
    "Yes! If you're a neuro major definitely take this class as one of your requirements. If you're not a neuro major but you've taken the human brain, also take it. If you haven't taken the human brain this class will be really hard for you.",
    "Yes. As someone whose last psych\/cog sci class was AP Psych, I felt prepared enough (with a little bit of extra studying) to handle the material. The debate is super fun and Professor Casey cares a lot about her students and making sure they understand the material holistically.",
    "Absolutely. It is a relatively easy work load and it is very engaging information-- a great tradeoff.",
    "Yes, BJ Casey is a good professor who is very passionate, an very good, at what she does. Make an effort to do the readings cause you will enjoy the lectures more but even if you can't, she goes over them anyway. The workload is pretty light",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course. If you want to learn about the adolescent brain, or if you would like to dip your toes in psych\/neuro but are a bit hesitant, this is a great place to start. BJ is fantastic and very willing to help all of her students. The workload is completely manageable, and just requires a bit of writing. You will feel very well-prepared for the exams if you go to class and use the resources that BJ gives you. Overall a very straightforward course! You will get out exactly what you put in!",
    "I have to admit, this course was not my first choice... or my second... or third... I had a rough shopping period and basically couldn't get into any of the capped courses I applied to. Now at the end of the semester - yeah, I still wish I'd taken a different course. BJ Casey is a sweetheart for sure, and there's nothing wrong with this class, but I never felt excited about it. Like yeah. This was a class. It was a medium-large lecture. I zoned out to quite a few of them (probably my fault).",
    "I would highly recommend this course because of the wonderful instructor. She makes class very engaging and teaching in a way that is clearly meant to facilitate learning. The class is very relevant to the age group of undergraduates, so I think regardless of academic background, it's a must-take class.",
    "Yes! BJ Casey is amazing and the material is interesting. No downsides to this class!",
    "Yes! Fun course with interesting content and no tedious\/unnecessary assignments.",
    "yes. Professor Casey is very passionate about the subject and it really comes across. You learn a lot without really realizing how much you are absorbing from her lectures. Tests are not bad at all. If you study the slides and go the the in class reviews you should do fine. Also the debate is very manageable as well as the 3 reaction papers. Overall great class.",
    "I would probably recommend this course to a student looking for a fairly easy overview of key neuroscience findings having to do with the adolescent brain.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course! BJ is the best and she really cares about all her students and teaching.",
    "Yes this course is so interesting and Professor Casey is one of the coolest professors Ive ever had.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. If you have any interest in neuroscience and especially its intersection with law, this course is a great way to learn from someone impassioned who makes the class fun.",
    "Yes, I appreciated the clear lecture style and more than reasonable assessments. The studies and neuroscience topics we covered were also interesting. I do not believe you need an extensive neuroscience background or the Human Brain even to do well in this course.",
    "YES! 100 times yes! If you're interested at all, take it! You learn a lot and have fun doing it and BJ Casey is absolutely amazing.",
    "Yes, I definitely would. It's not an easy course, but if you are interested in the topic and you put in some effort, you can get a good grade. More than anything, I would recommend it because Prof. Casey is so knowledgeable and passionate about the topic, which definitely deepened my understanding of the science relative to actual policies, and she made clear to us why this information is so important.",
    "Absolutely!! BJ is an amazing professor and so passionate about what she does.",
    "Absolutely! It's a difficult grade but it's so informative.",
    "Yes! The course had a much more manageable workload than many other courses in the neuroscience major and was incredibly interesting and well-taught. I felt like I developed a truly applicable knowledge base \/ orientation to developmental neuroscience as well as honing the required skills to keep critically developing and expanding that knowledge base myself.",
    "Yes, I recommend this course to other students because it addresses a very specific topic in development but from a range of perspectives.",
    "Yes, this class is very interesting and fun. BJ Casey is an amazing lecturer and extremely knowledgeable and humble as a person. She extends her personality into her teaching style which makes learning complex systems about the brain all the more creative and fun."
