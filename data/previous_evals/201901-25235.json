    "How to follow a user-centered design process, how to iteratively design a system, how to test and evaluate given systems, how to think about the design and usability of items in the world.",
    "The project taught me about the design process: how to run usability tests, how to make a prototype, etc. The class also taught me about things like univerdal design.",
    "I think the most important skill I learned was how to make a group project come to life.",
    "I learned about the design process and the fascinating field of HCI.",
    "I was able to get a great introduction to the topics offered in the syllabus - it was a great way to get practical and hands-on experience on a topic I wanted to learn more about.",
    "Designing an app.",
    "I learned a little bit about HCI",
    "I learned what HCI stands for (or close enough.)",
    "I learned how to come up with a new products that would be actually helpful to my end users, test them with users through multiple methods (contextual inquiry, paper prototypes, etc), and produce an end product that accomplish my design goals in an innovative way. It was a nice class!",
    "Learned the design process and user-centered design principles",
    "Many of the CS courses I've taken taught me to write functioning software and pass test cases. But this course taught me how to create technology that works for other people. This course teaches important skills like design thinking, prototyping, interviews, usability testing and communication that a lot of CS professionals could benefit from. This saves a lot of work in the long run.",
    "how to work with other people",
    "You learn the critical aspects of user-centered design. It is very different from any other CS class in a very good way.",
    "Not much",
    "introduction to design thinking, usability tests, how to determine if a product is needed. some software design skills",
    "The design process for generating software that users directly interact with.",

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths: Incredibly well-organized, quick feedback, clear expectations. Weaknesses: Little class time devoted to hands-on learning requires groups to meet very frequently outside of class. Still a very manageable workload.",
    "The project was fun and useful to my learning. The class itself needs a lot of improvement though. It seems like the professor didn't have a good grasp on what college students would know and what they wouldn't. As a result, we spent way too much time on useless topics like what a hypothesis is, what a scientific experiment is, and what the difference between a metaphor and an idiom is. The exam was also way too easy (an average above 100% is kind of ridiculous) and the professor too easily manipulated by the students.",
    "The project was overall very good. The frequency of the assignments was a little challenging. The in-class quizzes weren't helpful.",
    "Strengths: Collaboration helped me develop new ideas, feedback was prompt and thorough, and the material was interesting. Weaknesses: I felt like the pop-quizzes didnt add much to the course. Truthfully if there were scheduled weekly quizzes, I feel that more students would focus more on the readings.",
    "Hands-on designing of app with group is useful practice.",
    "Strength is cool subject matter, weakness is too many assignments",
    "The biggest weakness of the course was the project. It felt like a toy and you were always aware that it was a pedagogical project that was unimportant, which made it difficult to care. The strengths of the course were the references to research papers on the field.",
    "It's a great class if you like working with people. It is not if you don't. In fairness, Professor Vasquez was incredibly efficient in all aspects of her work - presentations and lectures were immaculate and emails were answered within minutes. However, the class as a whole felt very high school with deadlines every other day and little room for self organisation.",
    "I think that some of the material was a bit obvious (sketching, paper prototyping) and we could have spent less time on it.",
    "A strength of the course was being able to work on original projects in groups. Some weaknesses were the quizzes and the lectures were almost always very theoretical",
    "The strengths of this course: The frequent assignments helped me put all the readings and lectures into practice. The semester-long project format encouraged me to work with others in a team. The lectures were engaging and was driven by many examples that made concepts clear.",
    "strengths -structured very well weaknesses -was an exact copy of a similar course from washington university",
    "The strenght lies in the semester-long project. I had a great time working on a project from start to finish. However, I think the project timeline could have been scoped better; we had the same number of days for assignments even though some required much more time and effort and others were a simple writeup. Also, I'm not sure if design is conducted like this out in practice.",
    "The course could be improved by removing half the number of assignments (many felt tedious).",
    "Very hands-on, you learn by actually developing a product. Some of thee topics we study in class feel a bit self-explanatory\/intuitive, though. I guess that's the nature of UI\/UX.",
    "I really enjoyed working with my team, and the lectures were relevant to what we were doing.",
    "Assignments were small, many, and consistently spaced, such that you end up having done a lot of work withiut ever having had to work too hard. Subject matter is dead boring.",
    "Ideally there can be less memorization and more doing. Ideally we can implement our ideas. Sometimes the team is split very arbitrarily; the teams can be divided in a better way.",
    "The course was very backloaded, such that in the last two weeks there was something huge due almost every other day. That was a bit stressful. Also because there was no final exam, many people stopped coming to class halfway through the year, which was kind of disheartening. Also wish that there had been more practical aspects to the course and less theoretical components. That being said however, there were a lot of interesting descriptions of practical applications in the lectures, and the project was an extremely rewarding process to go through (regardless of the state of your final product)"

   "comments": [
    "ABSOLUTELY. Easily the most human CS course at Yale. You learn how to think about people instead of code. A refreshing take on what CS can look like in the real world. The class teaches you how to design in the real world and gives you a great portfolio of work to show off.",
    "It's a good gut and you do get to work on a project and learn some useful ideas. Otherwise, it's not a challenging class at all and learning is limited. It was often frustrating to sit through lectures, sometimes mind-numbing. Don't expect to learn much and getting a good project group is almost entirely necessary to enjoy this class at all. If you're at all interested in the least CS related aspects of CS though, this is your class.",
    "It depends what they want; they should know that it doesn't have any coding, despite being a 400 level CS class.",
    "I would recommend this course! Professor Vazquez was fantastic. There was many assignments every week, but they were not too much work.",
    "Yes, because it is low-stress and fun work.",
    "I would not recommend this course unless you want to tell people youve taken a course on HCI without actually learning.",
    "I would, if human-human interactions are your thing.",
    "Yes! This was the first iteration of the class, so of course it had some flaws. However, Prof. Vzquez is very receptive to feedback and I'm sure the class will be even better next year. It is also one of the few classes in which you get to work on a project and test it with real users.",
    "TAKE IT",
    "Yes, but if you are particularly interested in design. There is no coding in this class",
    "I would definitely recommend this course, not just to CS majors but other students as well. The skills learned help with product design, software development and testing. It also lets you apply these skills to a project. The projects this year were excellent and could definitely become real products.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to students interested in product development, product design, or HCI\/HRI-related research.",
    "Yes it's a good cs class without any coding whatsoever",
    "Definitely recommend, especially for CS majors who have little experience with user-centered design. This class really helps you step out of the solution space and explore the problem space.",
    "The prerequisite for this class is passing first grade. This class is a joke. I used an Elmer's glue stick for the first time since lower school. You have many small assignments of busy-work that are constantly being due, like it's lower school. The assignments are supposed to teach you useful skills for the \"design process\" but they're really just dumb wastes of time. Then you get some comments on your assignment, like \"this font should be clearer,\" or \"a back button here would be useful,\" and the next assignment is just to fix those things. The class itself is an even bigger waste of time. We literally spent a class learning how to make a poster. Then the assignment was to make the poster. The next assignment was to edit the poster based on her comments. The class after that was to present the poster. The median or mean on the midterm was a 108%. What you're tested on is things like \"what is user-centered design?\" with the answer being essentially \"design that is focused on the user and the user's needs.\" There's no final. There are a bunch of pop-quizzes with vague questions scattered throughout the semester - because there's no other way anybody would ever go to class unless you forced them there with the threat of a pop-quiz...much like middle school.",
    "If they are very interested in software design (not implementation)",
    "Yes if you're interested in UX.",
    "If you are interested in app design, then yes."
