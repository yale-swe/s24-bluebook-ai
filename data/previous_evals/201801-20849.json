I now have better insight into (i) which substantial questions are interesting, and in which direction the field is moving (ii) the most important recent methodological advances, and which challenge still lie ahead. I found the combination of methods and applications balanced.",

   "comments": [
    "The format of much of this course - daily summaries of papers and detailed discussion in class - was the most conducive to learning of any I have taken. As far as I can tell the class has no weaknesses.",
    "Strengths: 1. Balance between methods & applications, first part always stressed the applications together with the methods. 2. Really motivated and enthusiastic teachers, I really enjoyed the lectures! Weaknesses: 1. One or two problem sets would contribute to learning the methods. 2. The paper selection (by the students) on the second part was sometimes a bit unfortunate. There were some Marketing Science and RAND papers from 20 years ago that don't belong in a graduate IO reading list. Recent promising IO working papers would be much more interesting.",
    "This course is very well-designed.",
    "Wish the class were more active. A problem set in the first part would be more helpful than trying to passively absorb the material in the slides. Required summaries do make me read in a more engaged way, so was good that those were required."

    "The two semester IO sequence was the highlight of my undergraduate career, and presumably it was good for the graduates as well.",
    "Yes.",
    "Yes.",
    "Helpful to get familiarity with IO field, but learned much less than in first half."
