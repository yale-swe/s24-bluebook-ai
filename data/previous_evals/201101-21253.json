   "comments": [
    "RELST 801 is a survey of apocalyptic religious literature from several different cultures and time periods; for me, the course helped me understand my own tradition (Christianity) and its relationship to apocalyptic narrative by experiencing materials from other cultures. I would definitely recommend the course.",
    "I would describe it as a well-intentioned, well-designed, poorly-executed seminar on apocalyptic movements from various religions all over the world. A study of anthropological theory leads into Jewish\/Christian apocalyptic literature from the first century CE, which provides background knowledge for several case studies about apocalyptic groups from various times and places. The course ends with a look at what happens when the prophecy fails.I would not recommend a student to take this class. I was so excited to take the class, and have been very disappointed with the style of discussion in class (so professor-dominated) and the lack of feedback. I worry that the professor is resting on his tenured laurels and does not care about his students.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course because every person in the religious profession must understand how religious knowledge and faith could be used in a negative manner.",
    "I would say that the course readings are interesting, but the class sessions are extremely dull and fall short of expectation. I would not recommend this course to another student.",
    "The class reviews various apocalyptic groups and does primary and secondary readings on them. I'd recommend it if you're interested in the \"weird\" side of religion, need to get a non-Christian class in, or are interested in religion and violence.",
    "No. The class discussions were simply not that good.",
    "In my understanding, the only segment of Christianity that is experiencing explosive growth in the world is the group that centers its theology on millennialism, a concept that is not really considered in main line denominations. For this reason, this course is a must. And yes, I would highly recommend this course to another student.",
    "It is a course studying the apocalyptic impulse in religion, both definitionally and through case studies ranging from pre-Christian Mayan culture to some modern day new religious movements. As a \"non-Christian\" Area 5 course for the Divinity School, it was a welcome alternative to most of the courses posted in that field. With a caveat that one needs to be sufficiently interested in the material for it to be valuable, I would suggest it to another student.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. It provides a solid background in apocalypticism and equips students to do their own analysis of various groups. I appreciate the freedom to choose a group that interests us for the final paper.",
    "Yes, I would. It's a good way to expand how one thinks about religious groups.",
    "It is a class which engages, reflects on and study apocalyptic thought utilizing various cultures as case studies. Yes, I would recommnd this class.",
    "Highly recommend.",
    "A survey of significant apocalyptic movements around the world. I would recommend to another student for whose course of further study this material is relevant."

   "comments": [
    "By reading and reflecting critically on the apocalyptic traditions of other cultures and religious movements, I was able to more fully understand my own tradition's relationship to apocalyptic. This was very helpful.",
    "This class helped me understand apocalyptic literature, canonical and non-canonical, ancient and modern, much better than I did before. I believe this knowledge will help me understand current apocalyptic groups and deepens my understanding of the apocalyptic nature of my own tradition. However, it honestly is fairly periphery to my primary work and simply meets my non-Christian religions requirement.",
    "The course deepened my understanding of apocalyptic religions and the events and circumstances that provoke them.",
    "It was mildly helpful in terms of learning about apocalyptic movements, but did not connect to the Master of Divinity coursework.",
    "This course was personally very helpful to me. I gain a greater understanding of the underlying notions behind millennial apocalyptic groups. It has also helped me in breaking with my own tradition's concrete positions of pre-trib-millennialsim.",
    "Due to the introductory nature of most of the material, I was already familiar with most of the cases provided from previous academic work in other contexts. Because it is a scholarly rather than 'professionally' oriented course in religion, it was only tangentially valuable to my education for ministry. That was what was expected, and so perfectly fine.The material was interesting on its own merit.",
    "This course was instructive and informative in how I will engage my congregation in end times conversation and thought.",
    "This course deepened my appreciation of the tension between competing apocalyptic visions in contemporary society."
