    "Covers a lot of interesting issues about gender and politics. Prof. Malvesti is a great seminar leader, and you'll also get perspectives from other career professionals who come in as guests.",
    "Take it. Whether you're a feminist or the exact opposite (like me), this class will broaden your understanding and knowledge about how gender plays a role in everyday life and in the global sphere. This applies to both men and women, not just women. Malvesti is a great professor and helps you grow as a writer, brings in great speakers, and provides awesome points of discussion that will leave you questioning the way you think about things. Take it, man or woman, you won't be sorry.",
    "Take this class! It was mostly filled with girls in this semester, but I think it's a great course for men also. Though I don't identify as feminist, I found this course to be extremely informing and it challenged my own ideals on gender and its affect on the world. The discussion was great and Professor Malvesti is fantastic. There were also some great speakers over the course of the semester. I would highly recommend it. One of the best, if not the best, class I've taken at Yale so far.",
    "YES. HUGE RECOMMENDATION. ONE OF THE BEST CLASSES I HAVE TAKEN AT YALE. And note that this is especially amazing because this was the first time this class was being taught. It was an experiment but an extremely successful one. Here are some reasons why. One, Professor Malvesti is an incredible seminar leader. She knows how to keep great discussions rolling, steering it in the right directions and inserting stimuli in the right moments. The reading materials were so interesting that for the first time during my time at Yale I actually did every single one of the readings. The video clips that she prepared and the guest speakers were phenomenal and provided a fresh perspective onto the materials we had only been conceptualizing theoretically. Two, the people in my class were an incredible bunch. I don't know if this was because Professor Malvesti chose an amazing group or because the subject matter attracted a specific pool of people that just turned out to be awesome and fun, but the class composition was so cool and everyone had something special to contribute. It's really hard to find a class like this and I have been recommending this class to every person remotely interested in gender issues. I hope this class continues to be taught and I hope Professor Malvesti continues to teach because she has a gift. I thoroughly LOVED this class. A huge recommendation to you all.",
    "This is a great class for anyone interested in gender and sexuality in global affairs. Three units--gender and violence, gender and peace, and gender and leadership. Small group discussions are excellent, and Professor Malvesti is a great professor. Not too heavy on the work load, and all of the readings are interesting.",
    "This class changed my perspective on gender and will be crucial to my life going forward.",
    "I highly recommend this course to anyone interested in Global Affairs, Women's and Gender Studies, or some combination of the two. It's a great look at intersectionality of gender issues and international relations and is a great chance to look at life in a different way (especially if you've never taken a WGSS course before). HIGHLY, HIGHLY RECOMMEND.",
    "A thing to note: this was my first WGSS class (crosslisted, in any case), so I can't speak to how it compares with others, but I thought the class was great. It should probably be called \"Gender in Global Affairs\" rather than \"Women,\" but that's a minor point. The best part of this class is definitely the professor. I really love Professor Malvesti, she is truly a fantastic professor and person \u2013 so supportive and helpful in every way, brilliant, fascinating; all the good things. The course itself is very interesting and changed the way I look at conflict, peace, and security, but take this class for her more than anything else.",
    "YES. gender is vitally important in a security context, and none of us think about that enough. definitely exposes you to fascinating papers & expands your understanding of conflict, decision-making, and smart governance",
    "YES DEFINITELY TAKE IT!",
    "YES YES YES! Definitely take this class - Malvesti is amazing, and the material is something that everyone should discuss before they leave college.",
    "Definitely take this course! Even if you do not have any background in gender studies or international relations, this is a great course to take for anyone because all of the material that we learn about in this course is applicable to any career and to anyone! The topics that we focused on this semester were extremely interesting -- women and conflict, women and peace building, women in governance."
