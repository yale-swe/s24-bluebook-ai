    "I would definitely recommend it as one of those sort of niche seminars, in which most of the material is stuff that you would never come across in other classes or later in life. I don't feel like the title accurately represents most of our discussions or the themes of the class. Most of the comparisons between works just happened from one week to the next, and there were very few overarching conclusions about the time period and location.",
    "This class has an excellent syllabus that is mind-opening and thought-provoking, both culturally and intellectually. It introduced me to great literature of Northern Europe and beyond that I would not otherwise know. Both professors are incredibly knowledgeable and insightful, and the class discussions are very inspiring. I learned a great deal, and this is easily my favorite class this semester.",
    "This is a pretty laid-back seminar with a spectacular reading list. The first half of the course was mostly drama, and then we migrated more towards fiction. We also attended several performances together as a class, which were a lot of fun! Professor Trumpener is super nice and passionate about the material. However, sometimes she tended to talk so much that it could be a bit difficult for everyone else to get a word in. My main complaint was that the course lacked generally in structure and didn't really talk at all about what Modernism actually is or why North Europe specifically was its birthplace. I felt that we needed a bit more history\/background, but as I said the reading list is PHENOMENAL and you get exposed to some more obscure works that you wouldn't cover in other classes (such as Pan and Miss Julie)."
