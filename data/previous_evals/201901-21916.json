    "Greater speaking fluency and LOTS of vocabulary",
    "My chinese writing, reading, listening, and speaking skills all vastly improved.",
    "- Increased attention to detail (tone shifts, sentence structure, double meanings) - Public speaking (weekly oral presentations + final oral presentation were extremely helpful)",
    "I felt my Chinese improved significantly through taking Professor Zhangs course. The structure was always easy to follow and the teachers were all very consistent in their evaluations and class content. I enjoyed class every day & felt my proficiency in tones, grammar, and vocabulary greatly improved.",
    "I learned a great deal of Chinese grammar and vocabulary.",
    "Beyond anything else, the skill I greatly improved was my proficiency in speaking Chinese."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Having class every day can be really helpful for developing and maintaining much of the class material, as well as helping to improve listening\/speaking skills. My only gripe would be that the workload can fluctuate a lot day by day. Some daily assignments (not including studying and reviewing material) might take only 15-30min, while others (like the translation exercises) can take upwards of an hour.",
    "The course was very thought out and every activity or assignment had a purpose which always helped improve our skills. The main weakness is that I don't think there should be much of an emphasis on writing. Since most communication I would be doing would be speaking or via electronics, pinyin and character recognition are more important than being able to write by hand.",
    "Strengths: - Students speak more than teachers (large part of learning a foreign language is the speaking practice, so am grateful Professor Zhang emphasized this) - Daily homework assignments meant constant exposure to Chinese characters\/dialogue - Teacher connected language to culture (made learning characters\/radicals more interesting and easier to remember)",
    "I felt this course was strong in its feedback and evaluations to us as students, providing us ample time to speak in class. I also felt as though expectations were always very clear over what was needed from us as students to succeed. Sometimes, however, I struggled with the sheer amount of oral tests consecutively and the assigned homework. I felt these could be slightly lessened.",
    "The strengths are the equal focus to speaking, reading, writing, and listening. This course truly aims to advance skills across the board so there aren't those weird gaps that can happen sometimes if class is all speaking\/listening or all reading\/writing. For me, the weakness is the emphasis on memorizing dialogues. In the end of the course, we created our own text and memorized that which I found more enjoyable and effective than memorizing from the textbook.",
    "The coursework serves very well to ensure that students are engaged with the large bulk of information that they encounter in class. The everyday quizzes really hold you accountable by forcing you to interact with the material on a daily basis, which is really the best way to improve your proficiency in Chinese. However, I think that there is not enough focus on students reviewing material or concepts that they may not full grasp; it felt as though the course was just moving so fast that students didn't really fully grasp the grammatical concepts."

   "comments": [
    "Yes! You'll receive good feedback and by the end of L2, you'll be able to understand and speak a surprising amount of Chinese. Apparently, the textbook for L2 focuses on \"survival vocabulary,\" meaning that after you're done with the semester you could technically \"survive\" and get by in a Chinese-speaking country. While your Chinese will probably still be far from fluent, you'll come out knowing a lot of useful vocabulary and grammar structures.",
    "Yes, this course improved my language skills beyond any other course I have ever taken.",
    "I would recommend Chinese at Yale. The department is extremely strong & every teacher is knowledgeable & accommodating to students, as they know most require variable styles of teaching. I have always looked forward to this class.",
    "Yes, it can be difficult, but it is also rewarding and learning languages is always fun.",
    "I would recommend this course because, besides the challenging characteristic of learning the Chinese, the interactive aspect of this course was very fun and engaging. This course does a lot to not only improve your proficiency in the Chinese language but also your confidence in engaging with the Chinese language in every format. I found it easier to engage with native Chinese students and people throughout New Haven because this course helped me to bridge the communication gap between me and them. As a result, I was able to establish good connections with them and help facilitate cultural exchanges."
