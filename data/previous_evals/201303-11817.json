    "This is trial by fire, and several times in the semester I considered dropping the class, but at the end, seeing your progress is so gratifying and totally worth it. Take it, but in a semester where your other classes are fairly light.Be prepared to spend a lot of time in the studio. The most valuable lessons here are not about painting. Your painting will improve drastically due to the lessons you learn about the attitude with which to approach your work. It's all about learning doing it for its own sake, and for personal artistic exploration, rather than for the sake of completing assignments.",
    "yes, you really improve, learn a lot about how to live your life as well as how to paint.",
    "Only take the class if you'll commit. You'll also benefit if you're good at budgeting your time."
