    "Spanish 130 was a fantastic course, and surprisingly less work than Spanish 120. This class gave me the chance to solidify my grammar skills and refine my pronunciation\/speech. Although I didn't learn much new material from Spanish 120 in terms of grammar, we went into much greater depth about things like the subjunctive. In general, I also greatly expanded my vocabulary and improved my writing skills.",
    "I learned more conjugations and uses of certain words. I improved my reading in spanish.",
    "I was able to develop writing, reading and oral skills through this class. I also was introduced to different cultures.",
    "I was able to improve my writing ability, vocabulary, grammar, and speaking ability during the course. We practiced all of these throughout the semester every day, and it has been very helpful in my learning of the language.",
    "Spanish writing and speaking",
    "Sebastian Diaz's course made me grow so much as a Spanish student. I feel like I walked out of his classroom at the end of the semester and was a different student. He taught me how to study smarter for my exams, to push myself in a way where I will actually see a result, and to persevere through hard material.",
    "I developed my speaking, comprehension, and grammar skills for Spanish as well as learning to have a greater appreciation for the Spanish culture.",
    "I developed and refined my Spanish skills of writing, speaking and comprehension over the course of this semester. My instructor was wonderful and helped us to vastly improve in all aspects of the language. I would feel comfortable interacting with people in a Spanish-speaking country after this course.",
    "My speaking skills improved. I think I'm more comfortable writing in the past tenses."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I think that this course is very well balanced with exams\/homework\/quizzes etc. Although there is homework every night and class every day, it usually doesn't take more than 30-45 minutes and classes were super fun (something to look forward to).",
    "The strength of this course is its organized format. The weakness of the course was an overwhelming amount of compositions that sometime detracted from focus on mastering the grammar and speech.",
    "Having this class everday was a strength as it kept me accountable.",
    "One of the strengths is this course is that we are allowed a small seminar for students to interact, which allows everyone to speak and contribute. The smaller setting also allows the professor to help each of us personally. As for a weakness, I would say the practice sheets that we are given not being a homework assignment. I don't speak for others, but I would often pass on doing these practice sheets that we are assigned to focus on other courses, as it was not a mandatory assignment. I believe making some of these mandatory would not only improve our Spanish but also help ingrain the language in our minds.",
    "I really think that this is a strong course. I found the short readings we had to do particularly helpful because it made the class more advanced. We had to discuss the readings in class and the additional vocabulary in the CC made our class less based on the Enfoques textbook.",
    "The course was structured very clearly and efficiently, and the pacing of material was not too fast or too slow. Overall it had a manageable course load and was helpful experience for developing Spanish speaking and reading skills.",
    "The strengths are the professor and the explanation of the material that makes it much easier to learn at a fast pace. The only weakness that I can think of is that the online homework are sometimes unrelated to in class content.",
    "The course is very focused on grammar, with some touches on cultural topics as well. I feel comfortable with my reading and writing abilities upon completion of L3 Spanish; however, I am still not completely confident in my speaking ability, so I think this class could focus slightly more on vocal interactions. Other than this, I loved this class!",
    "Class is well organized and dedicated professor. Wish there were more opportunities to speak in class."

   "comments": [
    "Would definitely recommend this class- ESPECIALLY with Sebastian he is the best teacher ever, so engaging and funny, and I learned so much.",
    "Yes, take this course in order to learn Spanish, very useful for using in this country.",
    "Yes, this class is a very good course that allows one to practice and improve their mastery of the language every day. There's homework almost every day, but it's not too much of a hassle. The activities are there to help one improve and learn the language; these can range from written activities to listening ones. Also, since the class is a seminar, one has more opportunities to speak and interact with others, playing a part in class discussion. The professor speaks Spanish the entire course, and that really helps with the immersive aspect of the course.",
    "I had two years between 130 and my last Spanish class, but honestly this wasn't much of a problem. There's a good amount of review (like present and preterite tenses in the beginning of the course) and while it goes by quickly, it's not overwhelming. The biggest challenge for me was getting my listening comprehension up to par, as the class is taught entirely in Spanish. The first couple weeks were pretty tough, but I definitely noticed improvement by the end of the semester. There's a lot of small assignments (daily online homework, sometimes short essays, readings, or presentations), but overall it isn't too bad. Most of the assignments can be completed quickly and it's easy enough to work ahead if you are expecting a busy week. I would 100% recommend taking this class with Sebastian; he is super funny and really makes class something you can look forward to.",
    "If you're going to take Spanish 130, you absolutely must do so with Sebastian Diaz. This class is not meant to be an easy class, and I certainly struggled myself, especially with the exams, but Diaz really wants the best for you. If you're like me with Spanish, it's not the material necessarily that will make you fall in love with the language. The instructor is much more important for me. If you're going to take this class (and it is a commitment), take it with Diaz and be excited about it.",
    "Yes, this class is wonderful for developing in speaking and understanding Spanish.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student looking to better understand the Spanish language and develop skills necessary to get around Spanish-speaking countries. The instructors are all incredible and want to interact with you outside of class to help you develop and improve your language skills in a non-graded environment as well!"
