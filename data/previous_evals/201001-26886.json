    "Best class EVER. Take it",
    "A great course and not too much work even though it's a writing credit. It was kind of a survey on the different issues of sex and gender in history. Leon is the best professor ever, but he won't be back to teach it again (I think).",
    "I had very mixed feelings about this class. I thought that the material was generally interesting, but the readings were difficult to get into because there were so many every week and it took a lot of time to make a real dent in them. I thought that Professor Rocha was an incredibly helpful, incredibly knowledgeable professor whose help I always appreciated. It was clear that he cared very much about teaching and guiding students (which i don't think is necessarily true of all professors at Yale). That being said, I don't think he led discussions particularly effectively.",
    "A wide range of interesting material is covered, with readings available for you to pick and choose from. As it was taught this year, very low work load so you are free to put in and take out whatever you wish from the course. That being said, low requirements were actually more frustrating because I did not find myself taking the course as seriously as I may have otherwise been pushed to.",
    "definitely!",
    "Best class I've taken at Yale. If you do not take it (with Prof. Rocha) you are an idiot.",
    "A fantastic class, with a great professor. Sadly, Leon Rocha is leaving at the end of this semester, but he made the classes a wonderful treat to go to. I recommend it for anyone interested in learning more about the history of women in science.",
    "TAKE IT!If you are a scientists interested in gender issues, a gender theorist interested in the impact of science, or just it just seems cool - take it."
