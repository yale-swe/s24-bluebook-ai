   "comments": [
    "Lots of work and class meets every day.6 mid-terms and classes over reading week make this class a huge pain in the butt, but it is still a good class to take either as a French major (not me) or for your language requirement (me).Expect to take French 140 as well if you take this class, they basically go hand in hand.Many different sections so your experience could also be based on which teacher you get.Maren Baudet-Lackner is a great teacher, and the class meets an hour later on T\/TH. Try to get into that section!",
    "After four years of high school French this course felt like a grammar review, but excellent practice in speaking, reading, and writing. I also developed a better vocabulary. You'll be listening to French every day with going to class and doing audio activities as homework so your French improves a lot.I would recommend this course if your interested in becoming a better French speaker.",
    "Take it if you want to get better at French, but make sure you know how much work you're going to have.",
    "It is the most time-consuming class, but you will improve your previous weaknesses in french if you give it your all. Your grades WILL improve by the end of the course as long as you try and ask questions. So I recommend this course.",
    "Yes, i would. My grammar and confidence in speaking improved dramatically through the term.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class for students who want to improve their French.",
    "For the best summary, look at the Syllabus...you'll see the grammar and content covered. I definitely recommend this class, but ultimately, your placement exam score for the French test determines what French level you can take.",
    "I would recommend it if you actually like french or if you want a more solid foundation of the language. It's a lot of homework, so be prepared to study and devote some time to it. But it's a great class and I'm glad I took it.",
    "French 130 is a class for those who want to brush up on the grammar they might have learned earlier and put their French knowledge to work reading some interesting books. I would highly recommend it as it definitely refreshened my french and has convinced me to keep taking french in the upcoming semester."
