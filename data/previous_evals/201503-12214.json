    "Honestly, one of the best classes I've taken at Yale. Professor Wrightson was such a delight, and this class gave me a greater appreciation for anthropological approaches to history. Also, a very appropriate amount of work: weekly readings, a section, 2 papers, and a final. Could not have been happier with my decision to take this course.",
    "A social history of Early Modern England examining the perspective of all elements of society on the important events of the time. Great class.",
    "If you're considering taking this class, do it. It's truly an enjoyable experience, regardless of whether you're a history major or not. The Tudors and the Stuarts are fascinating, and Professor Wrightson is very sweet and knows so much about the subject. Not a ton of work -- weekly reading\/section, 5 page paper, 10 page paper, and a reasonable final.",
    "Great class, interesting material that pops up all the time, easy final.",
    "This course was not terribly difficult, but I ended up learning a lot. You don't need to do all the readings, but you'll get more out of the class if you do.",
    "I'd recommend the course if you're interested in the subject. The lectures can be a bit dry at times, but Professor Wrightson knows his stuff more than perhaps anyone in the world, and it shows. He also really cares and the subject and is passionate about helping students explore any area of the field in which they are passionate; he offers detailed reading lists for papers, for example, or really just if a student is interested in a topic.",
    "Good class, though very lecture-oriented. Very interesting.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to a fellow student, provided they are interested either in this period of history, or in the general themes of religious, political, and social change. If not, I can see how the class might feel a little limited.",
    "Great survey course of England in the early modern period. Professor Wrightson is a good lecturer and he was delightful as a section leader. Additionally the final paper, due the last week of class, is incredibly helpful in studying for the final.",
    "Definitely recommended as a fun fifth class -- engaging, and not overwhelming at all.",
    "History 251 is a great overview of the early modern period of England! I would highly recommend it to anyone who has the slightest interest in English history.",
    "This is an amazing course but only as good as you make it. You can not attend any lectures and still do okay. But that would be your loss. Professor Wrightson is simply amazing - the authority on Early Modern England, and just the nicest man ever. If you value Yale, take this class - and go to class.",
    "Definitely take this class.",
    "This is a great course to take if you are interested in this very specific time period as well as the development of England as a political nation. I would most definitely recommend this class.",
    "HIST 251 is an interesting course on 16th to mid-18th century England. Students should definitely take this class if they are looking to understand how modern day societal concerns took shape in England at this time.",
    "Easy history lecture. Interesting subject matter. Lectures are informative and well organized but not inspiring. Two papers and a final.",
    "I took this class as a senior non-history major, and I am so glad it was part of my Yale experience. Professor Wrightson is one of the most knowledgeable, kind, and adorably funny professors I have ever had. I was lucky enough to have him as my section leader, and he always had a wealth of historical anecdotes, period knowledge, and keen insights to share while responding intently to each student's contributions to section. The optional visits to the British Art Gallery were also fantastic! With just two papers and a final, the workload was light and interesting to research. This is a wonderful introduction to the social, cultural, religious, and political history of Early Modern England, and it's a great choice whether it's your first history class or one of many.",
    "I would recommend this class! It can get a little dry, but Keith Wrightson absolutely makes up for it-- he is charming and brilliant and knows everything about this time period. Going to the YCBA with him was a treat because his passion and infinite knowledge were highlighted. A short 5 page, a longer 10 page, and a final-- all 3 of which are pretty in your control, topic-wise. Not much reading. Would definitely make for a good 5th class. Also Prof. Wrightson!!",
    "Yes! It's a great introduction to a history that is often misrepresented in pop culture through movies like The Other Boleyn Girl."
