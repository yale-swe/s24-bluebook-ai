However, due to the amount of material that the class needed to get through, the concepts at times were rushed and sometimes were not explained with great clarity. Question 10: I believe the professor has a great talent for teaching statistics in a way that is interesting and applicable to the field."

    "Very practical and filed oriented. The material was given in an extremely easy way to digest; the course notes were very detailed and easy to read.",
    "Learning how to use statistics software during class time.",

I also thought the ability to learn in a computer lab and practice working on problem sets following the lectures was extremely beneficial to my learning.",

However, the Professor points this out at the very first introduction class and offers during the class a review on the sections (for example before\/after october break, etc). This was very helpful.",

I struggled to understand how each lecture was related to the last one and had issues seeing the big picture in order to know when to use which models or analysis. The lecture notes could be simplified heavily and they would be more accessible and easier to understand.",

    "Excellent synergy between theory and practice in the computer lab with the statistical software Minitab.",
    "More time spent learning how to use statistics on data rather than discussing questions in class.",
    "I didn't go to any discussions or lab sections.",
    "For the flipped course, the lecture and discussion was very intertwined and students were prepared to ask questions to clarify concepts learned in the video lectures. If the videos were put up earlier in the week, students would have more time and flexibility to watch the videos before class. The quizzes could be changed in between each trial in order to actually test the students' knowledge. I think the opportunity to ask questions regarding the video lectures in class before beginning problem sets was very helpful."

    "There were many advantages to group work in this course. Working with other students helped me recognize what I understood and what concepts I needed to clarify through extra reading or meeting with the professor. It helped to go over problem sets together because sometimes other students would simply word things differently that can make more sense than when it was explained through the lecture."

    "Keep up with the material! It's a really fast-paced course.",
    "I would buy a supplemental text because I found the notes difficult to follow. I would definitely attend the TA sessions and find a TA that seems to explain concepts in a way that resonates with your learning style. I would intentionally work on placing different concepts within the larger context of statistical analysis in order to understand how things fit together.",
