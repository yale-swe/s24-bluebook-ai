    "This course helped gain exposure to some fundamental math concepts for further study in science. Unfortunately, it was poorly taught and a bit disorganized.",
    "Through this class I learned how to evaluate multivariable functions, but that was about it.",
    "general multivariable calculus concepts",
    "Basically calculus I concepts applied to multiple dimensions",
    "Theory-heavy class. Went over material quickly, with no real understanding of underlying math beyond how to apply various formulas. Class needed only rote memorization skills and did not improve problem solving skills.",
    "General multi concepts.",
    "I developed skills related to vector calculus and its applications, including Stokes' Theorem and Divergence Theorem, as well as surface integrals and triple integrals which are essential to applications in physics and electrical engineering.",
    "I learned how to solve functions of multiple variables and how to deal with calculus and mathematics in three-dimensions",
    "An approach to solve problems was developed.",
    "How to visualize things in 3D",
    "A firm grasp of the principles of multivariable calculus.",
    "I feel that this class forces you to self study. Many of the students (at least in the fall) seem to have a lot of experience with the material coming into the course from high school, which makes it seem that the class caters to them (also making it so there is no curve).",
    "I know how to take many different types of integrals, and I know what the curl of a function is now.",
    "I took this course in high school but was instructed to take it again by the engineering department. Although the content was all familiar to me, I was forced to look at it through a different angle. Doing work without a computer challenged me to understand the material rather than understand the commands I was plugging into Mathematica.",
    "How to use calculus in multivariable settings, and new problem-solving strategies for calculus.",
    "I learned that the courses at Yale are fast-paced, and that it is up to YOU, as the student, to learn the material. You won't always have a teacher that works for you, but you have to keep working and dedicate yourself to succeeding.",
    "Decent understanding of multivariable calculus."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "This course is disorganized, the graduate students do not teach it clearly, and too much content is packed into too short a time.",
    "Please do not associate this response with the instructor specifically, since most of issues with MATH 120 lie within the structure of the course itself. Strengths: - I learned math and got a QR credit. - That's literally it. Weaknesses: - This class asked the sun, the moon, and the stars from you. It was unbalanced. One day the syllabus would have us covering the double integral (easy), but then we'd only spend twenty minutes learning how to evaluate double integrals in spherical\/cylindrical coordinates (much harder). - PSETs in this class were unbalanced... I never knew when to start. Some weeks it'd take one hour, and other weeks it'd take eight hours. There was no middle ground. - There was no personality in this class. This class did not reflect the energetic and exciting environment of Yale as a whole. I am severely disappointed in this class. As tests count as 90% of your grade, the class seemed to only consider how much you can cram for a test, not how well you can conceptualize the material, explain it, or show proficiency in other means. - The weekly PSETs, even when they were sometimes returned a week later, were not returned quick enough to count as feedback... By the time I had received mine, we were five topics beyond.",
    "Weaknesses: -there is much too inconsistency between instructors -my instructor sometimes gave the wrong answers to problems Strengths: -I learned a great deal.",
    "Miki did not do a good job running the course. The graduate student teachers are not the best teachers (which is completely understandable) and Miki made no attempt to open her classroom or provide more study sessions or organize study halls for students stuck with graduate student instructors (which is not so understandable). This dramatically increased the variability of instruction quality. I believe the class average for my section on the last midterm was a 107\/140 and the course average was a 124\/140. This is something that could have been averted by the course organizer if it was run properly.",
    "I felt the course material could have been presented better.",
    "The biggest strength of this course is how organized the teaching was. They had a very clear syllabus and followed it strictly which was good because it was easy to follow along if you missed class, and also made it much easier to study for the midterms and finals. A weakness was the disparity of teaching among all the professors and the lack of answers for graded homeworks which made it difficult to learn from the homeworks instead of just receiving a grade.",
    "There could be a greater emphasis on study halls and collective office hours. I think also a greater emphasis on individual and group problem solving would help cement our understanding of the material",
    "A weakness is that they did not cover applications of what we were learning so it was just doing random questions.",
    "Fima was the best :)",
    "There are some good instructors in this course but the discrepancy in teaching ability across all sections is too great. In order to succeed in this course you either have to be able to teach yourself the material or be in a section that has a good instructor. Some are just more helpful than others. Peer tutor hours are too sporadic and spread out to be convenient, discouraging you from going. There is talk of creating a tutoring center with a set location and set hours, which would be a very useful tool. The assessments of this course do seem fair, although I found them difficult.",
    "I think that the psets for this course work well with the lectures and correspond pretty well to the material. However, I find that the lectures themselves can be very boring and disengaged.",
    "I think the class is very well done, and that's good considering the popularity of the class. Wome of the problems on the homework seemed unnecessarily difficult, forcing us to do busy work for a long time rather than testing our understanding of the new concepts.",
    "I think a big weakness of the course is how underprepared sections not taught by Miki are; the course is very unbalanced in instruction, as is evident by the exam grades per section, and there is nothing to account for it or counteract it. Another weakness is a shortage of problem walk-throughs in solutions to homework\/practice exams, so that students might not find the exact step they missed in the problem. A strength is the organization of material and different problems chosen in homework to practice different skills.",
    "The teachers, graduate students, are not the best teachers for this course. The material moves extremely fast and includes huge concepts that take time and require the articulation and mastery for good explanations. I think the idea of the math center is fantastic! I would have loved to have a more organized, simple way to get help like this.",
    "The the course covers a large amount of material in a short time, but chooses useful topics from the textbook and offers plenty of review and resources. That said, I feel like the order of topics covered could be improved. For example, I feel like chain rule, parameterization in 2d and 3d, and different coordinate systems, i.e spherical, cylindrical; are important concepts that were somewhat glossed over. I also feel like the teaching was sometimes haphazard due to the sheer amount of material to be covered, so that much of the course was formula memorization and pattern recognition for how to solve problems, instead of understanding the underlying concepts."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "Multivariable seems to be a course that is necessary for a lot of majors, so I would recommend it if it is required for a particular study. Otherwise, it is not a particularly fun class and the exams are much harder than the material you learn in class.",
    "Yes, this course teaches you the fundamentals of multidimensional calculus which is necessary to understand more complex math.",
    "If you get stuck with a section with a graduate student (which is most of them), know that the teaching quality will be hit or miss. Some grad students are great teachers and other are not and don't really care about their students. In my section, there was huge deviation from the course median on exam scores. Miki does not do a great job running this course, so she will not provide any substantial course-wide materials, organize weekly PSET study halls or any of the other measures employed to level the playing field amongst instructors of varying quality. In fact, Miki keeps each class tightly sectioned off and does not hold office hours for the class. So, who you get as the instructor really matters.",
    "Certainly if you want a challenging math course and have passed Calculus 1 and 2, take this class. It isn't too hard, but still requires a consistent amount of effort for the midterms and final, though the weekly homework assignments aren't too bad. If you are going into more advanced math, physics, or engineering, you must take this class.",
    "I wouldn't recommend the course unless it was required or you have a specific interest in calculus. The fact that 90% of the grade is from exams leaves little to no wiggle room in terms of if you have one bad exam, which creates a lot more stress than most other courses.",
    "Only take if needed",
    "Yes- it was very effectively organized and taught",
    "I would only recommend this course to those who are required to for a major. Otherwise, I would not. I do not see this course as a particularly interesting or useful one for someone interested in math (and may even be taking it Credit\/D\/F). This is a very poorly run class, and if you have to take it, do your best to get one of sections with Miki, Tryniecki, or Fima.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone who understood AP Calculus BC very well in high school and hasn't yet taken a multivariable calculus course. If you had trouble with BC, then maybe take 115 as a reinforcement.",
    "This class is the best way to further the education learned in a high school AP Calc class.",
    "If you have Miki, take the course. If you do not, drop the course. I did not enjoy this class at all. I requested a tutor weeks before the final exam, and one was never put in contact with me. My instructor was a nice teacher, I just needed some extra support that the course itself didn't provide me with.",
    "This is tricky. ONLY if you are a VERY good math student who has taken a level of math higher than calculus BC. I for one was one of the stronger math students of my school, even my state, and found unexpected difficulty in the course. I think it depends on the teacher and the time you have available to dedicate to extra hours of tutoring and work. I'd say to do well, you must spend time with tutors and in office hours. It is required for most stem majors, so I would recommend it if a student is taking that track.",
    "I would recommend this course to people who enjoy math and either pick up on concepts quickly or are willing to put in a fair amount of time to really understand them; otherwise the homework and tests will quickly make little sense. It's a requirement for a fair number of things, but it's definitely a difficult class."
