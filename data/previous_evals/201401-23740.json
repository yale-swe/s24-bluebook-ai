   "comments": [
    "Great course!!! Interesting topics!",
    "Overall a good course, although the class flies through advanced topics in international trade and environmental economics. Much, much more difficult than other environmental econ classes - a large component of the class (essentially half) is combing through difficult, though usually very interesting, papers. If you have no statistics or econometric background, then you may want to pass - multivariable calculus is a must as well. One of the few classes that really builds on knowledge acquired throughout the semester. Pretty light workload though: 2 problem sets, midterm, final, 2 short presentations, reading responses.",
    "It's hard. But good. Cr\/d if you're unsure",
    "If you want to read a lot of economics papers on things like the effect of environmental regulation on economic activity, I would definitely recommend this course. This is an essential course for anyone interested in environmental policy. Other than the first problem set, this course in not math heavy with the focus more on reading comprehension. The coursework includes a midterm, final, two problem sets, and two presentations. Class participation is important.",
    "Good class, take it",
    "Summary: a brief run-down of environmental econ and then international econ, and then a lot of reading and presenting papers at the intersection of those two subjects. I would recommend it to anyone who has even a vague interest in those two subjects and a large interest in understanding the academic econ research world.",
    "For the student who's really interested in learning about the current research and hard economics behind environmental regulation, as well as how to read economics papers properly. You'll swim in papers and econometrics, but you'll learn a lot.",
    "It's a very thorough overview of international trade and environmental economics. The topics are very relevant o everyday events and the professor is great about quoting real life examples of everything he talks about in class. The problem sets were tough though."
