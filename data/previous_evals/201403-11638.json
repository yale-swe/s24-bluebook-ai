    "I definitely liked that we had group meetings to talk about our progress, although I was jealous that the policy practicum had theirs at restaurants every time! One of the weaknesses might have been that a lot of us did not have established projects. A good way to avoid this may be to have departments propose definite projects that students can work on, then students bid or rank their favorites and that could be a match up.",
    "My practicum project was the most informative, educational experience of the semester. My teammates were so easy to work with, and our preceptor was also very involved and easy to report to. Our bi-weekly check-in meetings with Howie were also great because it helped to keep us on track.",
    "I gained a lot of hands-on experiences and professional skills.",
    "Most helpful course this semester!"

    "Instructor: Susan Heidi Busch \u00a0Professor Busch was extremely nice throughout the semester and instructed us when necessary. Considering the basis of this course, there is not too much for me to say otherwise.",
    "Instructor: Susan Heidi Busch \u00a0I did not really interact with Professor Busch much throughout the semester because we reported to Howie, but she answered all our questions about her requirements for our time log, presentation, and final essay. The presentation was a smooth and easy process.",

    "Instructor: Susan Heidi Busch \u00a0Great; Susan provides honest feedback without being overbearing or sugarcoating it - necessary for students' to develop in their career trajectory"

   "comments": [
    "The course is informative and gives a good sense of work experience (I think) especially for individuals right out of undergrad. However, it does take up a big block of time every week, so I recommend it dependent on prior class commitments",
    "The best way to take advantage of the practicum is to find an interesting project on your own. I heard placements have become more difficult lately. If you can find a great project, like the one I had with the Vascular Surgery department, then it will likely be a great educational experience.",
    "Highly recommend!"
