    "Postwar America was an enjoyable class. It was nice to have a seminar-style class among my other lecture classes. There is a good amount of reading, and it is sometimes hard to complete it all, but that is a skill that takes developing. There were 3 papers, each of which I enjoyed writing. The final paper is 15 pages, which is a good amount of work, but not too hard if you choose a topic that is interesting to you.",
    "It is a fun class to take. If you don't know much about what happened from 1945-1960, you should take this class.",
    "I wouldn't recommend this class. On the surface it looks great: the readings are great, the period is interesting, and Prof. Russett is at once a nice and funny woman. But the classes were based too much in the reading, as opposed to simply supplementing the discussion. This made discussion a little too much like reading comprehension, which I found boring. But it's not particularly hard: two papers, a final research paper and about a book a week. It would be an easy way to get a writing credit if you don't care about interesting discussion.",
    "I would take this course if you are looking for a Freshman Seminar with a reasonable course load and an interesting topic.",
    "I would recommend this course to any student genuinely interested in history.",
    "HIST 010 was a really enjoyable class. I'd definitely recommend it. The readings were very interesting, and there are only two five page papers and a final research paper. If you're looking for a serious history course though, this isn't the class for you. It was a bit disorganized and some of the material felt disjoint. Professor Russett is really knowledgable though, so definitely take this class if you get in!",
    "I would highly recommend it. The professor and topic are both incredibly interesting. The readings were mostly great. For anyone interested in modern American history, this is an excellent class. I hope your classmates are more engaged than mine were.",
    "If you are interested in the culture of America during our \"Golden Age,\" then this class is for you. From veterans, the atomic bomb, McCarthy, to consumerism, sexism, and racism -- this class reveals the hypocrisies and truths of the 1950s."
