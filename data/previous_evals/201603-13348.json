I understand job opportunities won't differentiate whether applicants speak English as a foreign language, so this class was extremely valuable. It help me to begin communicating in a clear, logic, and concise manner. After coming to the U.S. for 5 years, this class was probably the last opportunity for me to systematically boost English language skills for free."
