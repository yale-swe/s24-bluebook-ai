   "comments": [
    "I learnt the ability to think of functions in three dimensions and I believe that the skills gained in calculating partial derivatives and optimizing functions will aid me in data analysis in statistics and economics.",
    "I learned a lot of calculus and a great deal about line integrals, limits and surface integrals",
    "I've gained a greater understanding of calculus as a whole, but more specifically, I've attained what I feel to be a strong foundation in multivariable calculus.",
    "I learned how to do multivariable calculus.",
    "It was an interesting introduction to multivariable calculus",
    "A very strong conceptual understanding of math.",
    "Critical thinking, difficult problem solving",
    "This course opened up the world of mathematics to me. I began to see much more realistic applications of the calculus I had been learning for the years prior.",
    "Calculus in three dimensions - double integrals, triple integrals, Green's theorem, Stokes' Theorem, Divergence Theorem",
    "None, I felt all I did was calculations and then figure out what equation to use for each problem. Visualization and other useful concepts were simplified, no real-world connections",
    "I learnt better how to think in 3-D and understood the concepts behind integration etc.",
    "I learned how to approach problems dealing with calculus application in higher dimensions and applications found beyond single-variable calculus. This included an introduction to working with vectors and found heavy application with problem solving often found in physics courses."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strength: my instructor is fantastic and the review sessions were timely and helpful Weakness: Not enough practice exams are posted.",
    "This course had a really harsh grading scale. I lost points on each midterm for minor math errors that significantly dropped my grade. In one case, improper multiplication in one part of a question made me lose an entire letter grade on a midterm.",
    "Prof. Tryniecki teaches quite well - he's energetic, engaging, and doesn't ever mind taking time to answer questions during lecture. He makes potentially dry material engaging and he explains the concepts well. Weaknesses of this course include the seeming lack of a curve and the strictness in which they grade - so many people take multivariable calculus in high school and retake it here as freshmen and throw the curve completely off for those who haven't, which makes the fairness of this course questionable.",
    "The class was engaging and well taught. No obvious weaknesses.",
    "The tests could be made harder with a curve. In my opinion, the testing doesn't reflect understanding.",
    "Very strong course. Perhaps the grading system on midterms might be a little strict but I don't have enough experience with Yale classes to get a better general idea.",
    "This class was very fast-paced, but I always came out of each class having enjoyed what we did and how it was conducted. I definitely needed help to understand the material, but the peer tutors were very helpful, and there are many resources to help students do well.",
    "The course was incredibly well taught given that such a mass amount of people take it. It is very standardized and therefore allows for the professors to recognize when they are on track or behind. The peer tutors were also an incredible resource without which I would I have heavily struggled in this class. Nevertheless, the amount of material covered in this class made many days feel rushed, as if though we had to run through all of the material to finish it. I recognize certain chapters have been eliminated already, but I think eliminating even a few more would allow for a deeper understanding of the concepts being taught, especially the theorems at the end of the semester.",
    "One of the main weaknesses is the extent to which the instructor you get at preregistration affects your learning of the material. I was very lucky because I had Michal who's a great teacher but some weren't so fortunate and ended up struggling to actually understand the material.",
    "I thought it was a very good course. The material was interesting and taught well. The course was well organized. Perhaps learning about some of the real world applications would have helped.",
    "Often times the lectures went right over my head and I was generally confused in class. Through review of the material I was usually fine by the time of the test, but a better tutoring system would be greatly beneficial (the current peer tutoring system can be very hit or miss).",
    "I think the grading of this course is a huge weakness, and find that the grades of the exams of myself and my classmates are not at all exemplary of mastery of the material",
    "I think that the psets should be more challenging and at the same time more resources should be provided to help students deal with the challenges. I think that the classroom lecture is not enough to absorb the difficult material.",
    "It is a very fast paced course. A lot of topics are covered within a short period of time which could be quite overwhelming especially if one is not somewhat familiar with the topics before hand. The lectures cover most of what gets tested, therefore it does not require one to do independent study of topics. However, since the lectures are very fast paced, it is very easy to get lost and confused. The peer tutors are very helpful in these cases."

   "comments": [
    "No I would not recommend this unless it is a prerequisite because the skills learnt here are not practical for people who are not going into the statistics and mathematics and sciences.",
    "This is a good course if you get Miki, but the grading scale is so screwed up that most people taking this course will not do well.",
    "Yes I would. It's a prerequisite for so many things that you oftentimes have to take it.",
    "Yes, because everybody needs calculus in their life.",
    "Yes I would. It's a good class to take.",
    "I would recommend this course to a student interested in mathematics and willing to put in the extra time\/effort to grasping the material. Problem sets provide good preparation for midterms and the help outside of the class is very good.",
    "It's a very tough class, especially if you don't have an inherent understanding of calculus, but if you stay on top of your work and use the resources available for help, the class is manageable.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone seeking to gain deeper understanding of the mathematical world. However, if you do not need it as a prerequisite and are not passionate about math, the amount of work that needs to be put to succeed into this course might not be worth it for you. I also suggest only taking this course if you have Professor Havlickova or Tryniecki, as the students in their sections struggled much less and understood the material better due to the form of its explanation.",
    "I wouldn't recommend the course to anyone who doesn't plan to major in a math-heavy subject but definitely would to anyone who is genuinely interested in mathematics.",
    "Math 120 is a great course for learning multivariable calculus. If you pay attention in class and do all the homework you will do well. Definitely take it with Tryniecki!",
    "Ultimately, it really depends on your comfortability with math as well as the professor you have. I ended up actually enjoying the course, but I like math overall and also had a great professor, so those are things to keep in mind when considering taking the class.",
    "Only if it is a prereq",
    "I think that every student should take multivariable calculus at some point but this course is not designed for people who have no prior understanding and hence it will be difficult to cope if you come in as a beginner.",
    "I would recommend this course if the student is interested in pursuing studies that require this class or if they are interested in the class itself. I wouldn't recommend students to take this class simply because they were placed into it.",
    "The content of the course is well paced and the problem sets are well constructed to test students for their retention and implementation of content taught in the course. All around solid lecture and resources from practice tests and tutors were helpful as well."
