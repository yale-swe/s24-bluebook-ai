    "The topics are fascinating and the class is well designed and well taught. I just think that the pace of the second half of the semester was much higher than the one of the first half.",
    "Having the option of discussion sections could help.",
    "There were a couple of things that I would have preferred to approach differently in the class. For example, I would rather focus on the story of economics rather than the models. I may be in the minority on this point, but as soon as equations got involved I got confused. Rather than saying that there was an increase in A I would rather you just say that productivity or technology improved and that I increases a countrys output. I know the equations are very important to economics, but I'm never going to use them in my job, and sooner or later I will forget the formula. What I will not forget is the narrative story of why the economy is the way it is. Im sure this is a less accurate and full way of teaching economics, but this is the way that will stick with me throughout my career and will be most useful to me in it. I just want a basic understanding so I don't sound or act like an idiot when I talk about or make policy."
