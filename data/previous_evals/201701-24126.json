    "This taught me so much about how to become a better historian and read\/analyze primary sources!",
    "I learned much more about key economic decisions and policies that shaped Russian society.",
    "HIST 282J taught me more than a series of interesting facts about the Russian economy and its development through serfdom to communism to Putin today. Miller's focus was on teaching a way of looking at the past, an economic framework through which the Russian story takes on a whole new life from the rather simplistic narrative popular in the west, especially our contemporary political commentary. Miller also took strenuous efforts to teach us how to think and write like historians more generally. Our final paper was a 20-page piece, which he aptly recognized was a tad overwhelming for many of the undergrads who had never written such an extensive history essay. He spent twenty minutes or so during each of the last four or five seminars discussing the papers with us and making sure everyone had an idea of what we were doing and how we should be going about doing it.",
    "Review of concepts and foundations in economics, applied to Russian history. Primary source analysis skills. The course added a new perspective to my knowledge of Russian history.",
    "This was a fascinating class that helped me hone critical thinking skills in both history and economics. One of the best I have taken at Yale.",
    "I learned a lot about the economic history of Russia."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "This course became very, very fast much more focused on the economic principles and terms rather than the history. Though Professor Miller said in the first class that this would not be heavily-focused on Economics and that you could do just fine without having a background in economics, that did not turn out to be true. The economics majors in the class dominated class discussion, and Professor Miller went along with it. It was sometimes hard to get any type of comments in in class if you also did not understand exactly all the economic measures being passed at each point.",
    "It's an incredible course! Nothing can be improved.",
    "Seminar discussion was strong because Professor Miller asked incisive questions and led us in the right direction. The syllabus is also well-made, such that each week was a natural next step from the previous one week. One area of improvement would be to shorten the reading requirements. There was simply too much reading on several weeks of very technical economics, and it was clear in those weeks' discussions that students didn't do the reading. A simple fix would be to provide more concise reading assignments.",
    "Miller's commitment to the students and enthusiasm towards the material were the major strengths of the course. Weaknesses are harder to single out, but one may have been the very extensive reading lists required for each week's discussion. Balancing with a full undergraduate schedule, it was sometimes difficult to read through the several-hundred pages of often-dense, jargon-filled reading. I think Miller began to understand this himself by the end of the semester and amended the syllabus to lessen the weekly work-load.",
    "Strengths: Great course on Russian economic history; Professor Miller did a great job distilling many of the complex parts of this topic for students and stimulating discussion. Weaknesses: too much reading that was often difficult for students to fully complete; as a result, discussion at times languished, as not enough students participated.",
    "Great class -- a rare blend of historical and economic subjects.",
    "Great amount of reading (well, too high some weeks, but Professor was very responsive). Beautifully run discussion. I thought the readings were well-selected but primary sources could have been better."

   "comments": [
    "Don't take this unless you have a strong interest in Economics and at least a moderate background in the topic. If you are doing this for the history, as I was, I would recommend taking a different course instead.",
    "If taught by Chris Miller, take this course.",
    "Absolutely! This is possibly the best course I've taken at Yale. I learned so much and Chris Miller is the nicest, most interesting guy!",
    "Absolutely! Given how essential economic history is to Russia's development, any student with an interest in Russian history must take this course. Even if you aren't a Russia buff, many of the great economic experiments of the modern era have been tested first in Russia. Professor Miller is incredibly knowledgeable and provides incisive feedback on papers.",
    "HIST 282J taught me more than a series of interesting facts about the Russian economy and its development through serfdom to communism to Putin today.

Miller's commitment to the students and enthusiasm towards the material were the major strengths of the course. He made sure to make himself available to every student interested in talking about the papers in particular or Russia in general and was always a welcoming presence whenever I saw him. Yale",
    "This is a class that will challenge you and help you learn new ways to critically examine the causal influences that shape macroeconomic outcomes.",
    "If Chris Miller ever comes back to Yale, take whatever class he's teaching, no questions asked. He's the best seminar leader I've had so far."
