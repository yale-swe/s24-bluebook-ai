    "This class is a great overview of Faulkner - he is the perfect author to read in a single-author class because his style is so varied (but be prepared for some heavy discussion topics, he's not a light read)",
    "I am glad I took it because I feel much more culturally literate, but it was also a big challenge.",
    "This was a wonderful course: probably my favorite this semester. Professor Smith is an excellent seminar leader. It's a really intense and unique experience to be immersed in one author's voice and universe for a few months. Faulkner is really suited to a class like this: as you move through the novels you discover Yoknapatawpha County. You also engage with a good amount of critical work, which is rewarding. The workload is manageable but the work feels meaningful. The reading does get overwhelming at times, but overall it's worth it. Most of the non-Faulkner texts get a pretty cursory treatment, but better to have them there than not at all. Don't be scared away by the fact that it's a single author course! Also, the final project presentations at the end are really interesting: it's rare that you get to really talk with your classmates about their essay topics. Take it: it's a great class.",
    "Faulkner is complicated and great. The discussions are simple and not great. I can't put my finger on what made this seminar not work -- it may have just been a one-time thing, bad coincidence, bad chemistry -- but I think it had something to do with how the questions all seemed to be local, or about reading comprehension. It also could've been because we never really got into the rhythm of discussing (really discussing) race, and gender, and class other than sterilely. Still, the way that the class is structured is really helpful and productive, especially the assignments, which built nicely to the culminating paper. And there was always good feedback on writing, both in conference and in comments.",
    "If you are interested in Faulkner's work, I would definitely recommend this class.",
    "Take it to immerse yourself in Faulkner. Everyone should do that, and it's definitely worth that if you have never observed the immense glory that is Faulkner."
