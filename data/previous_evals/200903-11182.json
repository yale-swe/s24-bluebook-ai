    "I strongly recommend to take this class to students even if they already took advanced mechanics as undergrad.",
    "Yes I would, I learned quite a bit from this class.",
    "I would suggest this class to any student that feels the need to learn classical mechanics at the graduate level, or that would like to deepen their understanding of the subject.",
    "Yes - this is a good course to take, especially if one does not have any prior experience in advanced classical mechanics.",
    "good material to know before pursuing further physics",
    "The course was tough, and I spent the most time on this course working through the homeworks and reading the texts. I would recommend the course to students who have the ability to allot a fair amount of time to the course.",
    "You have to take or pass out of this.",
    "Classical Mechanics and lots of applications so it is easy to understand. I would absolutely recommend this course to others.",
    "I would recommend it. It does a good job explaining mechanics from first principles."

    "This course taught classical mechanics and knowledge of this area is really essential to understanding other areas of physics.",
    "It did not contribute much to my research, but it deepened my knowledge of classical mechanics",
    "I did learn some of the material, but I feel I will certainly have to go back through all of it to ensure I know it for the qualifying exam. I learned methods of solving mechanics problems that I hadn't seen before in great depth.",
    "This course was very useful in preparing us for the qualifying exam.",
    "I'm not sure how useful mechanics will turn out to be in the long run, but it will certainly help on the qualifying exam.",
