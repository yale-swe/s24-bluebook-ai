I thought the actual delivery of the lecture, however, could use some refining--though, surely he has big shoes to fill when being compared to Dr. Dove's lectures! I suggest following more of a script or using more notes in order to refine the eloquence of delivery. Too many words on slides. Overall, the lecture was as good as the other guest lecturers. Excellent move to provide feedback to students during the lecture and use quotes from their papers on the slides. Friendly and approachable TA overall."

Unfortunately I don't think I will be able to take more from Prof. Dove given my course of study and the other classes I need to take, but I will try to take Disasters in a future year if at all possible - I certainly want to. And I will be taking Political Ecology with Doolittle next semester as a direct result of this course, so it has already had an effect on my course of study beyond this semester. Thank you!",

I find that I gained a lot of insight from the lectures, and would like to discuss the lecture and lecture topics, rather than the terrible paper I wrote prior to the lecture."
