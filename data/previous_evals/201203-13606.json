    "What a wonderfully refreshing and invaluable course. I only wish it were a full year instead of semester. In a program centered around our responsibility towards the environment and environmental stewardship, how often does one actually sit back and contemplate his or her relationship to the environment? Almost never. And at a program that leverages its presence within the greater institution of Yale, how often does one get the opportunity to explore the rich resources that the university as a whole offers? Almost never, unless a student proactively chooses to take courses outside of FES.This course was an amazing opportunity to reflect on one's own relationship with his or her surroundings, the environment, and realize the constructs within which s\/he exists while visiting the Peabody, Yale Art Gallery, British Art Center, Rare Maps Collection at Sterling Library, and Rare Books Collection at Beinecke. These are all resources that I have heard numerous students have on their \"bucket lists\" as commencement approaches (and sadly are not always able to check-off), so it was wonderful that they were integrated into the framework of the course.",
    "To be at Yale and not to learn anything about Yale is a shame. You fail as a environmental manager if you do not know your surroundings well. I feel this is a must take course to understand why you are here and learn more in the process.",

It is also great to have a course that is very different from the traditional read-memorize-regurgitate-write model that made you think without the traditional stress.",

Sometimes you are almost buried in the facts that you fail to recognize the other aspects of nature. This is a good opportunity to learn about nature in a different genre of learning. I believe there are many treasures hidden around us and only if we look carefully enough with the right guide would you be able to discover it. This course is a good guide.",
