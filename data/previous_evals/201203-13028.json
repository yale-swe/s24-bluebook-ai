   "comments": [
    "Philosophy was the class where I most learned in DS and that most challenged me to think critically. It's a really cool class! Take DS for Philosophy, even if you drop it in the second semester. Take it with MDR!!!!",
    "Absolutely. Definitely the thickest of the DS courses, but at the same time very interesting. I'm probably not going to take another Philosophy class after next semester, but I'm glad I had some exposure to it freshman year. Definitely helps you think.",
    "DS is going to be DS. Still, it's totally worth it. If you get MDR, KEEP HIM. He's very personable and helpful, definitely as good as it gets in terms of section.",
    "Great. Phil is the most coherent and organized of all three sections. Get a good prof and you'll love it.",
    "This is a basic intro to philosophy course that is very text-based. I would highly recommend it to everyone.",
    "DS Philosophy is a chronological survey of the Western Canon of Philosophy. It's an excellent, though rigorous course, and it's definitely not for everyone. If you enjoy reading and are willing to do a lot of it, this is an excellent course to take freshman year.",
    "If you're lucky enough to be in MDR's class, don't switch for your life. Fall philosophy is both very fun and challenging--I looked forward to coming to class every day and we learned so much over the course of the semester that I couldn't imagine not knowing now. It'll stretch your brain in interesting ways--who doesn't want that?",
    "This class changed the way I view the world. At the beginning of the semester, I would walk out of the classroom mildly convinced that I do not actually exist. Towards the end of the semester, I would walk out of class and have wonderful discussions about religion over lunch. Professor Della Roca does not just ensure that we get all the points by lecturing, he asks questions and forces us to think.",
    "Directed Studies: Philosophy is a great survey course on the great works of the Western tradition. It is intense, but it is a great way to have all of your beliefs challenged in a classroom setting. If you take DS you will not be disappointed. If you can take this class with Professor Della Rocca, take it! He is a great professor and by the end of the semester you will be glad of having taken this class with him!",
    "Directed Studies: Philosophy is an excellent introduction to a subject that most people have a rather nebulous conception of coming out of high school. I highly recommend the course to anyone interested in intellectual history, critical thinking, or the nature of existence.",
    "Challenging but interesting",
    "I would recommend DS Philosophy to another student, but I would caution them as to the amount of work and commitment it takes to truly succeed. There needs to be a devotion to the study of the works that I think exceeds what is commonly expected.",
    "TAKE IT. TAKE IT. TAKE IT!!!If you are at all interested in thinking and logic, this class is amazing! It will make you challenge your assumptions and think more deeply than ever before. The readings are dense and sometimes nearly indecipherable (Parmenides, for example), but absolutely worth it. Despite what others may say or do, do all the readings yourself! Some of the lectures will blow your mind and you will walk out of Whitney Humanities Center feeling changed. Section will sometimes make your brain hurt but is always incredbily fun. The papers will force you to streamline your thoughts into a logical chain. Bottom line: this was my favorite class (tied with DS Lit) of the term.If you possibly can, TAKE THIS CLASS WITH MDR!!! He is an amazing professor and an amazing human being. He genuinely loves philosophy and gets adorably excited about the different arguments every class.Professor Della Rocca would guide us in figuring out particularly difficult arguments without giving us the answers directly. He would pose question after question to get us all to think more deeply about the argument and the chain of logic. Sometimes this process made my mind hurt, but I always came out of section feeling challenged, reflective, and eager for new arguments to dissect. He is always super excited and positive in section so you never feel stupid.He makes philosophy fun! He has the best examples in section, from the classic chair to Carly Rae Jepsen (whenever I hear Call Me Maybe I flash back to Philosophy section) to Obama, Oprah, and of course MDR himself. My personal favorite was when Professor Della Rocca danced a little jig to show what it means for MDR to exist in reality. On a more serious note, the articles\/pop song lyrics\/religious pamphlets he would occasionally show us in class really drove home how much philosophy has shaped our thinking without our realization.I could type out an even more extended love letter to this section of DS Philosophy, but need I say more? Take the class! Again, if at all possible, take it with MDR!",
    "Definitely worth it. Challenging in a new discipline.",
    "Great introductory to western philosophy, as mentioned before. If you decide to take DS, get Della Rocca for philosophy. You will not regret it."
