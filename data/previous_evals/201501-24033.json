    "Good class, maybe don't take it unless you've taken econometrics 2",
    "Take it! Ebonya Washington is AMAZING. I love her. The class is centered around a short paper or two you read each week. You'll refine a lot of what you learned in Econometrics classes in applied ways at a slower pace so that you actually have to learn the details and let it sink in. You'll love the class. I guarantee it.",
    "Solid course: I learned a lot about economic research techniques, interpreting current economics papers, and policy-relevant economics topics.",
    "Really solid course. Heavy on the metrics in the best way possible - you really learn a lot about evaluating empirical methods.",
    "This class is perfect for anyone who enjoys metrics or who wants practice with reading and critiquing academic papers! Each week, you read 2 Econ papers on a topic from public Econ and discuss the methods the authors use. Workload is fairly average for an Econ seminar (easy weekly reading worksheets and 2 one page papers that build to a final 10 par paper). Also, professot Washington is an amazing seminar leader! She truly wants all of her students to succeed and is willing to work with you throughout the semester to achieve this goal. This has been the best Econ class I've taken at Yale!",
    "One of my favorites economics classes at Yale. Not a lot of work, you get to read some pretty fascinating papers, and if you're interested in econ research at all, this course really solidifies your econometrics understanding. Professor Washington was great. A bit blunt at times, but always made sure the class was engaged and active and was happy to listen to your feedback or concerns.",
    "This course exceeded my expectations. It wasn't one of my top choices for a senior seminar but I actually enjoyed the paper-based discussion and thought Ebonya was a great seminar leader. She did a really good job of prepping us for discussion with reader response worksheets (not at all time consuming or monotonous but did ensure that you at least read the econometric structure of the papers) and focused on group discussions of the methodology and potential implications of the literature we read. MANY of the papers were interesting topics that were applicable to modern policy debates, and most were easy to read. Ebonya was flexible with workload (asking weekly how much time we were spending) and approachable for questions and concerns. The assessments were very fair and low intensity, and they built toward your final literature review project. Ebonya herself is quirky, but definitely deserves a better reputation than what most of her reviews seem to indicate! She's sweet and super knowledgable and was great at explaining concepts.",
    "Overall, the class was good. The papers were generally interested although the worksheet questions were tough and quite technical. Class discussion was not as dynamic as it could have been and much of it was small group discussion. By the end of the semester, the class felt very repetitive.",
    "Good class if you want to apply advanced econometric concepts to interesting public policy debates. I found the class rewarding and learned a lot of useful skills but there is a fairly heavy amount of work. Extensive reading responses every week that involve dissecting dense academic papers.",
    "A well-taught econ seminar I would gladly take again. For those who have already taken multiple econometrics courses, some parts may be repetitive, but there's enough work to challenge yourself always."
