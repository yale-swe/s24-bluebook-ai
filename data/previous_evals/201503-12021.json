    "AMST 306 is a course on films spanning Martin Scorsese's career, beginning with his earliest work as a film student in New York, culminating in his most recent projects. The class consists of weekly screenings and a two-hour seminar, with a few articles of reading each week. Though the class seems like a time commitment, it is well worth it. The screenings are nothing more than a study break and a great movie, and the discussions are always fun and evocative. Readings are manageably short and fun to read, as they provide insights and entertaining information about the films. The only written assignments are three papers over the course of the semester, which are fun to write. Kerbel is an excellent teacher as well as a genuinely kind person. I would recommend this course to anyone! If you are lucky enough to get into this seminar TAKE IT!",
    "Great class! What could be better than a seminar about interesting movies from the last fifty years? American Studies and Film Studies students (and probably a lot of other people) will love it.",
    "Yes, I would recommend the course. I'll repeat what I said in my overall assessment: If you are interested at all in film, I recommend this course. Film is obviously as vast as any other artistic medium and examining the works of one artist (and the life of that artist, as many of our supplementary readings were interviews with him about his process and craft) gives you a better sense of how both the industry and art function. Plus, it's pretty cool to see what one talented human being can accomplish over 45ish years.",
    "You don't have to love Martin Scorsese to love this class. You get to watch more than a dozen films that range from solid to truly great, and the discussions are unpretentious while still really trying to reveal something new about the movies. If you like movies, try to take the class if you can get in.",
    "Definitely take it. Scorsese is a complicated genius, his movies are amazing, and Professor Kerbel's love for film and this class are infectious.",
    "I would highly recommend this class to another student. I had never taken a film class before this one, but this class was a great introduction to film. The films we watch tend to be very intense, but there was a lot to discuss and the class discussions were always lively and interesting. You will not find a kinder more dedicated professor at Yale. Even if you don't think you like Scorsese, take the class for Professor Kerbel, you won't be disappointed.",
    "You watch one or two incredible movies per week and then sift through them in class. Scorsese is a wonderful director to study because of his stylistic variety.",
    "Fantastic course. Not only does it familiarize you with an important artist, it also provides a comprehensive background of the techniques that Scorsese used and the artistic context that he developed in. Take this class if you can.",
    "Without a doubt, take this class! It's a great way to watch some incredible movies and have some amazing discussions about them. The papers aren't too bad and Professor Kerbel is a really kind guy. I'd recommend it in a heartbeat!",
    "I would call it \"Film Club with Michael Kerbel: the Life and Career of Martin Scorsese\" or something like that. It's an awesome look at Scorsese's life and artistic choices. In terms of workload and grading difficulty, I'd say it makes a good fifth class. But definitely carve time out to see the movies. If you don't you'll be lost in class and not a great contributor to class-time discussion.",
    "Take it take it take it!! There is absolutely no reason not to. One of the few times I've looked forward to every class!",
    "I would absolutely 100% recommend this course to another student. It was not an overwhelming amount of work and the class discussions were really interesting. It was a perfect way to end my week.",
    "An amazing course. TAKE IT. writing the essays is really fun and the films are all really good. To be fair, most of the films are about white men and many of the represents irons do women and minorities are negative. However, the class is concscience of this and there is still much to be gained from the films. Kernel is a wonderful teacher. Don't be scared off my his mumbling. He is very empathetic and engaging."
