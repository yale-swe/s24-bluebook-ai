    "This was a fantastic course. You really learn how to think and view the world of popular culture in a new way. The courseload can be pretty heavy (even though the four essays are short they still take a lot of time to think about and write) but the readings and the work is pretty enjoyable. The grading can be a bit harsh so consider taking the class Cred\/D\/F. Also, Professor Lofton is a fantastic speaker and just a great energy to be around!",
    "PLEASE TAKE THIS CLASS. You will learn so much about how to write well, how to make strong arguments about cultural objects that you encounter every day, and you'll build up a theoretical \"toolbox\" that's useful in analyses in other subjects. Readings are almost always fun to doonly some are really dense and tough to get through e.g. Foucault's \"What Is an Author?\" Lofton is the kind of person you want to be BFFs with because she's super cool and intelligent but also the kind of person you don't want to be BFFs with because she's so articulate with her intelligence that you may feel overwhelmed by all the cool things she's saying and start reevaluating your life choices. She's helpful with essays, gives great feedback, and will help you through drafts, though she can be a tough grader. The final exam seems easy, but takes much longer than might be expected. Take this class for all the new ways of looking at the world you'll learn, if not for Lofton herself.",
    "Will make you the annoying friend who tries to wring information out of everyone about the things they like and why they like them. Can't recommend anything more enthusiastically.",
    "If you're at all interested in American Studies, Religious Studies, or pop culture of any kind, this class will prove fascinating. It's wide-ranging but focused on close-reading, rigorous but comfortable. I think I've learned more from this class than I have from any other.",
    "One of the most challenging, though-provoking, and interesting classes I've ever taken. It really pushed my writing and analysis skills, and the discussions were phenomenal. Might recommend starting it CR\/D, since grading can be tough, especially at the beginning. But it's an amazing class, especially for American Studies majors.",
    "I would absolutely recommend AMST 392 to another student. The course was so strong on its own, and then professor Lofton was also incredible.",
    "Kathryn Lofton is arguably the smartest person at Yale, and getting to take a seminar with her is a literal dream come true. This class will make you smarter just by listening to her. You can't really bullshit in this class: Lofton scrutinizes and synthesizes every comment, and challenges you if something you say doesn't stand up, which is so helpful. She does the same for writing. By the end of the semester, I feel like a much better writer just because I've internalized all her scrutiny and applied it to my own writing. The subject matter of the course is also incredible, but do not let the label of \"popular culture\" signal a lack of rigor. The essay I had to write about Kim Kardashian's butt was the single hardest academic challenge I've ever faced. Take this class if you want a really, really rigorous investigation of the culture everyone in our society consumes. A phenomenal course.",
    "In a world seemingly buffeted by the crushing pressures and forces of American popular culture, this class will give you the tools to approach any cultural artifact, any random internet phenomenon, anything your peers take for granted, and analyze it with powerful academic tools. You learn HOW to be a good cultural critic, WHY people behave the way they do, and not just in a clinical, sociological way, but in a real way:!why am I, why are my peers sucked into this particular internet craze and not another? Let's analyze it.",
    "Religion and Popular Culture is a great seminar! Professor Lofton is ridiculously intelligent and engaging so it's a pleasure to hear her thoughts on all things pop culture each week. You do a wide variety of readings and interact with several elements of pop culture that you're likely not familiar with and it's really interesting material to study in an academic setting. The work consisted of four short papers and a take-home final, none of which was too intensive. While the workload is not heavy, it can be very challenging - would recommend doing this seminar Credit\/D if you're not too familiar w\/ the theories\/works covered.",
    "YES. This class will profoundly challenge your preconceived notions about religion and popular culture as cordioned off sectors, and in doing so, provide an amazing opportunity to reflect on what defines our present culture. Professor Lofton is a goddess. Cr\/D is a fantastic option, however, because the class is not easy, nor is the grading. But definitely do not pass up the opportunity to take it.",
    "This class is amazing. Professor Lofton is a blessing and a gift. Every week I would come out of class with no idea what I learned but each moment was still life-changing. Once she used the phrase \"wandering through difficult thickets\" and I couldn't believe that her mind worked that quickly and that even the words she said to express meaning were so poetic. I think that this is pretty representative of how the class was as a whole. Each moment in class was laden with meaning and interest no matter what we talked about: Kim Kardashian, video games, fandoms, wrestling... If you get the chance, take this class."
