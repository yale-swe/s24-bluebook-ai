   "comments": [
    "MATH 246 was, for me, a bit like a nightmare. I have always loved Math and Ordinary Differential Equations has been my favourite topic since high school. With Dan Kushnir, however, this course is awful enough that you can do without it.Initially, Kushnir's handwriting and accent are extremely hard to follow, but once you get accustomed to them, it's hard to understand Kushnir's method of teaching. Seminars mostly involve him rewriting examples solved in the book, on the blackboard. Any request for further explanation is usually met with a \"Oh, but it's obvious.\"Kushnir also tends to speed through the material like there's no tomorrow and problem sets are LONG.All in all, this class has been my least enjoyable class at Yale so far. Originally there were around 20-25 people in our class, but by the end of the semester, only around 7 were left to brave Kushnir. Unless to really, really have to fulfil some requirement, or by some off chance don't mind Kushnir so much, I would NOT recommend this class to anyone.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. The material covered in this course is useful for many other disceplines, and the course was definitely worth the time. The problem sets are due every other week, so it is excellent for those willing to plan ahead and not so for those who save the work for the last minute.",
    "Take it; it's a good class, the teacher isn't terrible, if also not very helpful. Try not to get too far behind, because although the material seems easy, there's quite a bit of it.",
    "Good computational math course, but can get tedious near the end, numerical methods are a pain, but very useful material in any subject where this kind of math is needed, e.g. physics.",
    "Differential Equations wasa decent class; it was exactly what I expected from a math class on differential equations. We learned exactly what we needed to know; no more, no less. But I definitely enjoyed our discussion on numerical methods, an area that our professor was particularly well acquainted with. The rest of the class could at times be a bit dull. I really wish the class were more rigorous and proof based, targeted towards those with higher levels of mathematical aptitude and interest. I recommend this class to non-math-majors who want a good users' guide to differential equations; tinkerers and lovers of \"why\" should look elsewhere.",
    "Math 246 covers ordinary differential equations and a bit of partial as well. I found the material useful in the sense that it can be applied to a broad range of topics, such as econ, physics, etc. I would recommend this course to another student. The class wasn't too difficult, but make sure to read the book.",
    "If you take this class, you will be best friends with your textbook. It's the only way you're going to learn the material, so thank god it's good. The material and the exams aren't awful. Dan's pretty understanding and wants you to do well, though you're better off learning straight from the book. The psets are long, but you have 2 weeks to do them. DO NOT wait until the last minute to start them. Seriously. LONG. All the answers are in the back of the book, though, so it's a good way to get a 20% boost on your grade.",
    "The subject matter is pretty useful, so if you're studying something somewhat mathematical, this is a good class to take. It's not incredibly exciting or very easy, but the classwork isn't overwhelming, as long as you give yourself enough time to do the lengthy (but usually not too difficult) problem sets. The lectures follow the book pretty closely.",
    "Overall a fine class. The book is really well written, which makes the material manageable to learn. The lectures were fine - he basically just did example problems from the book. Exams were reasonable, psets were long, but not particularly hard and helped teach the material well. So, it was basically like a high school math class - dry, but you learn what you need to learn.I think the main complaint for this class will be that almost everything covered in lecture was covered in the book. But honestly, I find myself wishing more of my classes were like that. Read, review in class, solidify on psets. Its a good method of instruction and you'll learn the material well.",
    "Yes, it is a requirement for applied math."
