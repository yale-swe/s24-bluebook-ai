    "This course is incredible and has completely changed the way I think about cities and the urban environment. I can't recommend it enough. It's not always an easy class--the main projects are three \"Games\" which are a LOT of work--but it's very much worth it if you're interested in cities, urban planning, or just improving city life. The readings for this class are from Professor Garvin's book, and they are really fascinating, as are his lectures (though lectures are sometimes very similar to what the reading for the day was).",
    "if you really enjoy urban planning, do it - if not, dont't",
    "The class is wonderful for those who are interested in the course material. The work comes in waves, but is manageable with appropriate foresight. The professor and TA are excellent-they are both invested in the well-being of the students. If you want to learn about cities-then by all means, take this course! It is absolutely fantastic.",
    "I would not recommend this class at all. This is a study in how private real estate industry impacts the growth of cities, which would have been interesting had that been what I wanted to learn. The class needs to clarify its entry in the Yale Bluebook. As it stands, it's very misleading.",
    "I think overall I've gained a lot of knowledge by taking this course, although some times the weekly meetings felt haphazard. The games themselves were good, and maybe they were designed such that it felt like trial by fire almost every time. Some could argue that forced us to piece things together on our own, but maybe there could be a little bit more guidance prior to the games. It can really go either way. What's clear is tha Garvin has an outstanding wealth of knowledge regarding anything that has to with the city so it was a pleasure to be in the class. I do wish though that the seminar on the whole felt more personal given how small it was. Overall good class, be prepared to have periods of a lot of work, especially prior to games.",
    "The material in the course is very interesting if you would like to learn about the organization of a city, but Garvin is a drawback to the course. I did not gain from him as many students who had taken his class had suggested that I would. The \"games\" Garvin created for class could have been effective learning methods if they had been better organized. The largest pitfall of the class, in my opinion, was Garvin's extremely frequent self-promotion: having us buy his book (with another book he wrote as optional), quoting his book almost every class, and using himself as almost the sole reference of all the material given to us.",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone, actually, despite my critiques of it, because I think its challenging in the right ways and teaches a lot about development and finances that can be helpful to someone of any major.",
    "As a whole, this class was awesome. I learned a lot from a professor who seems to know absolutely everything about cities, met some amazingly passionate students whose interest in the material inspired me to work harder, and deeply explored my newfound interest in urban studies. The readings were engaging, the games were unique, extremely stressful, and fun, and the final paper allowed me to discover the forces and individuals that shaped my hometown. A great class for anyone interested in a more economic-oriented view of how cities work. Be prepared to devote some all-nighters to the assignments, thoughthe occasional PowerPoint presentation or game takes many hours outside of class to truly perfect, but they're usually worth it in the end."
