   "comments": [
    "Take this class if you are interested in how companies compete. The math is not too difficult and while the course is heavy on the theory, there are also some practical applications.",
    "Absolutely take it. This is a hidden gem of the Econ department. The class is small (at least is was this year), the material is interesting yet pretty easy, and the professor is awesome. The workload is also great with only three problem sets, a midterm, and a final. And the problem sets aren't even that much longer than normal weekly ones.",
    "Yes, absolutely!",
    "Good class, if taught by a good teacher. It was quite frustrating to deal with with the current teacher--who didn't care about the class at all.",
    "A good economics class with a lot of useful insight. This is one of the standard classes where 99% of the work is setup an optimization and solve. However, the models are really interesting and give insight into real world business practices. I'd recommend taking after you have taken some form of game theory."
