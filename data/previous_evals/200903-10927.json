   "comments": [
    "I would highly recommend it because it is a class where you definitely learn very much, even if you do not have a strong background in colonial literature.",
    "I would recommend this course to any student majoring in Spanish, as it provides a helpful bridge from the Baroque period to more modern texts. Also, the three-part grading system makes the workload more manageable and leaves students with the satisfaction of knowing all the texts reasonably well, not just the ones focused on in the final paper. The opportunity to see early editions and manuscripts of the books at the Beinecke alone makes the course worthwhile for a student serious about the study of Spanish American literature.",
    "Spanish 815 will expose you to a broad variety of Spanish American texts written between the late sixteenth century and the era of independence. Due to the texts' diverse nature and origins, youcan expect to develop an interesting perspective of the connections between elements characteristic of the baroque and romantic movements. You will also construct an understanding of the different intellectual climates from which the texts emerged. If you are interested in reading a selection of authors leading up to the Spanish American independence movements, you will enjoy this course!"

   "comments": [
    "We covered a large part of the departmental requirements for colonial Spanish American literature on the doctoral exams.",
    "The most important knowledge gained in this course is by far the experience of learning how to take advantage of the Beinecke. Also, the selection of authors corresponds to the reading list required for the Spanish Department's qualifying exams, making this course a worthwhile investment for doctoral students.",
    "As I previously mentioned, the course deepened my understanding of the intellectual movements that form the foundation for a specifically Spanish American literary tradition. Such a background will undoubtedly enrich my perspective when studying more contemporary Latin American literature. The course content will also help prepare me for the upcoming comprehensive exams."
