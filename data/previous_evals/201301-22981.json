    "Amazing course with an amazing professor -- one of the best I've had at Yale!",
    "Excellent class! I had never taken a film class before but this was not a problem. It's more of a workshop class so it was more about developing your editing skills (audio and visual) rather than just working for a grade. The professor is amazing too and I loved taking a class with her.",
    "a lot of work outside the classroom. High expectations.",
    "The class was challenging but you are graded fairly for your effort and the work you produce. Because this class involves some serious fieldwork, I would recommend this class only if you are FOR SURE prepared to deal with all the ups and downs of a real field site and real fieldwork. There is a lot of independent work you have to do.",
    "It is particularly clear I think that I recommend this class to all. You will come back with a lot of new insights, the class structure is very accessible and understands the requirement of this class in light of all the other classes one might be taking, so you are able to actually have the space to fully immerse ourself in the project because deadlines don't just fall upon you, everything is planned well ahead. It is up to you to be organised and committed."
