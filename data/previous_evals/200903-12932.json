   "comments": [
    "Very interesting material for exploration. Assignments built up in a very well thought out way.",
    "The course was presented in the way I expected all graduate level courses to be presented: in a round-table, individual-driven discussion. Addington did not babysit us and used us as collaborators as much as students. She was perfectly fine if some students wanted to really push the limits while others just sat back and served more as observers and reviewers. While the topic was Material and Light, we really touched on a vast array of topics that are very relevant to the current state of the profession.The workload kept us very busy but wasn't unmanageable at all.",
    "materials presented well enough and sequence, assignments were followed up according to the sequence of the course.",
    "It was a relief to finally have a course that encourage a new way of thinking about the material and encourage us to explore our understanding of light and materials. The assignments were actually enjoyable and worthwhile exercises. They got us thinking in different ways and were intended to help us understand first-hand processes and mechanisms of lighting. The reverse precedent assignment was particularly interesting, in which we were challenged not just to document and repeat information but to learn by making and testing.",
    "I appreciated that it was our prerogative to associate or dissociate each exercise and the final project.The invited lecturers and field trip were great.",
    "Overall the course had a decent sequence from class to class and assignment to assignment. The class would have benefited from a better understanding of where we were going to end up with the final project. The previous assignments would have had more of a direct influence on the final project. Furthermore, there was some redundancy in the material presented throughout the semester."

    "To learn how to speak and consider materials in terms of affect and effect. This was met.",
    "For the most part, my expectationswere clearly met. Early on in the course, Addington made a comment that impacted me for the entire semester. She referenced that architects think about materials as objects whereas engineers, programmers and scientists think about materials as a series of processes. In all honesty, if this is the only thing I learned, I would have said the class was worth my time.My only suggestion would be for the students to have a more focused topic from the beginning of the semester allowing them to really develop a scientific study resulting in a thorough examination. While I appreciate the ability to wander and look at a diverse array of topics, it would be more beneficial to get a more substantial understanding of one topic while still listening to peers present thorough reports of other topics. This would also allow students to come up with a fuller set of information and images for their portfolio as opposed to several charette-level studies.",
    "I was pleased with this course and is one of the only classes at yale in which we can truly experiment.",
    "Based on shopping week, I wasn't entirely sure what to expect. However, Michelle's incredible enthusiasm for the subject matter was convincing. She was able to make a fairly open-ended, speculative subject real to us. In the end I was no longer intimidated by the subject matter, and hope to pursue these issues in further practice.",
    "I expected for this course to expand my understanding of materials and the use of light in architectural environments. Michelle Addington did a great job introducing and explaining a lot of these concepts. However, the class could have gone into a deeper analysis of these concepts."

    "see question 5.",
    "I did not have any particular expectations for this class in the beginning of the semester but throughout the course of the semester I did learn a lot.I really appreciate the emphasis on experimentation with the real materials. It was refreshing to see that I was allowed to fail in my attempts to achieve something (i.e. an experiment with the materials) and still got credit because I tried. In this class the process was as valuable as the end result or maybe even more, which unfortunately is never the case in my other classes at Yale.I am really glad that I was a part of this class and I was given the chance to learn through failure as well as success.",
    "The course was very valuable for the reasons listed in the other questions. There is a reason Addington is as successful as she is and architects would be much better off realizing what they can learn from non-standard practitioners.",
    "Again, we learn the most through making and trying things out ourselves and this class allowed us to do this. We took the principles we learned in class and applied them to real-life situations.",
    "I had previously taken a lighting lab and have worked with lighting designers in the past. However, this course pushed us to analyze light and materials from a new and exciting perspective: that of the well-informed and analytical observer (and potential expert).Two potential outcomes:1)I am more likely to integrate \/ tackle problems of lighting and materials in my own work.2)I will be able to discuss applications with specialists in a more intelligent way, and I will be able to push them toward more challenging solutions.",
    "Through this course I looked at the use of materials and light in architectural setting more in depth than any studio class would allow."

    "both excellent",
    "I really appreciated the effort put forth by JD Messick (the TA) as well as the guest lecturers (Linnaea Tillett and Dietrich Neumann). The feedback in the course was always quite positive and served as a nice change from the standard, negative criticism involved in architectural education. In particular, I noticed a huge difference between my final review in Addington's class and the final review of another course the next year. The non-architectural critics for \"Light and Material\" were very critical but in a positive, next-step kind of way. The course final in another course the next day was completely negative and my partner and I were not even able to finish our last 8 (of 18) slides before being repeatedly interrupted by the architects on the panel.",
    "TA was helpful, and he was expertised in the subject.",
    "Michelle's lectures covered many aspects of lighting and materials that were new to us. She exposed us to a lot of material and managed to tie it all together. I learned a lot from this course and am excited about continuing to explore the possibilities of lighting.",
    "In addition to the above, I would just reiterate how important Michelle's enthusiasm was to the success of this course. Throughout her lectures, she made the material accessible and interesting. During student presentations, she provided focus when necessary and suggested many directions for future study.",
    "Michelle Addington was very effective, knowledgeable and personable throughout the course. She did a great job of creating an environment of collaboration and discussion."
