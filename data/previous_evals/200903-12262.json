   "comments": [
    "Definitely!",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. If you have any interest in the syllabus, which if it isnt posted includes Locke, Rousseau, Voltaire, Adam Smith, Jon Stuart Mill, Nietzsche, Marx, Hegel, Carlyle, amongst a few others then what are you waiting for? Professor Turner is a kind and wise man who seems to have read everything that has ever been written and mastered it to the point where he can offer a good explanation of the work in its context. His, and the course's greatest strength however lie in the way that he conducts discussion, which is masterful. So take this course!",
    "I thought E&R was a very interesting class despite the fact that I'd already read most of the syllabus in DS. Professor Turner did a great job of leading class discussion; however, I thought coming into the class that more effort would be made to connect the thinker we read each week to the ones that preceded him, but that wasn't really the case. Regardless, it was a good class.",
    "Yes! Take the course if you get in. Professor Turner makes the Yale history program what it is.",
    "I would definitely recommend the course as an introduction to the writers on the syllabus. If you've already read many of the texts on the syllabus, you might benefit from a less survey-oriented class.",
    "The course is a lot of work, but its worth it.",
    "I would take this course if you are a history major and want exposure to intellectual history.",
    "Incredible class - Turner is absolutely genius and just the nicest professor. The readings are all essential and well-chosen, and the class is just wonderful.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class! Professor Turner is the best ever! I think that the material covered in this class is a necessary part of any education and Professor Turner really emphasizes how the books and authors relate to each other and build off of each other, which I thought was really great. He also emphasized that the students in the class talk to each other and learn from each other's comments, which made the class very engaging and interesting. Definitely take this class! It's one of the best I've taken at Yale."
