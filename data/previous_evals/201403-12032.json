    "I would 100% recommend this course!!",
    "Take it if you want a relatively chill class with great readings.",
    "ERM 362 is a seminar which looks about genocide through international law, theory, and through thee case studies (the Holocaust, Cambodia, Bosnia, and Rwanda). The readings can be quite lengthy some weeks, but the readings are usually very interesting, so I did not mind that much. The class watches a lot of documentaries in class. Dean B is so knowledgable about the subject,very approachable, and nice. Students have to submit six weekly reading responses and write a 15 page final term paper. Our class went to New York to look at the process of memorialization of social traumas (9\/11 and the African Burial Ground) Even though the material is very grim. I would definitely recommend the course.",
    "Definitely!",
    "I would definitely recommend this class for anyone who is curious about genocide and who wants to understand more about themselves and the capacity of the human race to murder others or to save others.The readings can be very emotional but worthwhile.",
    "A very good overview on the topic of genocide and ethnic conflict - issues which are very important and pertinent but that we spend little time thinking about. Dean B was clearly extremely passionate about the course and put in a lot of effort to make sure that we were equally enthused as well, even taking the effort to organize a field trip for us. She was such a wonderful seminar leader, taking the time to listen to our opinions, and bringing candy to class each week to get us through difficult times. I greatly enjoyed this class, the passion of Dean B, and my classmates who were all extremely fun and friendly. I do feel like I became friends with them throughout the course of this class, and not just seminar mates. The readings were long, but interesting and very different from the usual theoretical and often dry readings in other classes. They were enjoyable, and I willingly stayed up late at night just to finish them."
