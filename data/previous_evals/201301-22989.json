    "Take it!",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS. It's not as scary or as hard as you may think it will be. But, you have to really love your project. I put a TON of hours in, but Ron and Larry keep you on track by having weekly updates. There also isn't any homework after the midterm, so all the extra effort can be focused onto the project. There are weekly labs, but no lab reports, so you are done after those 2 hours. And classes are really interesting. Before the midterm, we learn a lot about how remote sensing works. Then, Tuesdays, we learn about some process, such as clouds and atmospheres, and then Thursdays, we learn about how to apply everything we learned to remote sensing. You learn a LOT. But, it's all applicable to daily life. The project is REALLY rewarding. Also. RON IS AMAZING. Best professor!",
    "G&G 362 was one of the most fascinating courses I have taken in my time at Yale. In most earth sciences classes, one learns about atmospheric sciences, geology, geophysics, and other related fields, but rarely does one have the opportunity to acquire skills and practice them in these fields. OEFS offers one this opportunity. One learns atmospheric and related sciences, applies them to satellite imagery and analysis, and finally has the opportunity to create and carry out their own research project on a topic of their choice. By the time the project rolled around, one feels like he is well-equipped, though certainly no expert, to create and conduct an interesting research project. By the end of the project, one feels a true sense of ownership and pride in their work, and what is more, he feels like he has understood satellite remote sensing and its powers.A LOT of work, but VERY rewarding.",
    "Loved the class!! Perhaps my favorite class I have taken at Yale so far. I would recommend this to any student wanting to learn a really useful skill as well as just learning more about their world in general. Wish it was 1.5 credits but the labs don't take too long. The project at the end does take up a lot of outside time so just plan accordingly.",
    "Take it! I learned tons! It's a super cool subject, the teachers are great, and the work is rewarding. That being said there is a ton of work so make sure you have time to treat it as a credit and a half.",
    "great skill and fun to learn, Professors are knowledgeable and patient, don't be intimidated by grad students.",
    "This class was incredibly beneficial in terms of gaining a skill set that I will use in my future career, and was also very interesting material that was well taught. The workload was at times overwhelming in terms of the amount of time you have to put into the final project at the end of the semester, but worth it in the end. I would definitely recommend the course if you are willing to put in the time.",
    "This was an excellent class, my favorite of the semester. I had always liked looking at satellite pictures on Bing and Google Maps, and this introduction to a science I hardly knew existed was wonderful. If you are good with computers, have no fear of the labs, which are good practice for a range of remote sensing \/ image analysis techniques. Although many of the students are in the Forestry school and will do the final project on a topic related to their own research, you certainly don't have to have something already lined up. The course is getting popular, so it might become competitive to get in to (seats are limited by the size of the YCEO computer lab), but if it sounds interesting, you should definitely consider taking it. It's not a gut, but it's not very hard either. A good break (for me) from computer science and more traditional hard science on the one hand, and humanities on the other. What you'll learn is a combination of good general knowledge and specific skills that will be useful if you ever go further in this field; oh, and you get to look at and make lots of pretty pictures. Take it!",
    "A very practical and in-depth exploration of remote sensing technology and techniques. If you have any interest in geology or environmental science, this is a really good class to take. Most of the class is very manageable - the lectures and the midterm are pretty straightforward. Be prepared for the final project, though - it takes a lot of time and effort to do well! It was a very rewarding experience, however.",
    "A thorough and interesting introduction to satellite imagery analysis, from the science to the applications. I developed an appreciation of its relevance in a wide variety of fields, and foresee applying these skills in my future research and work. In addition to the two excellent professors, Larry in the CEO is also a great resource. Although the final project was a ton of work under an intense time crunch, I learned the most through this self-directed experimentation with the methods we covered in class and lab.",
    "Through lectures, homework, labs, and a final project, this course offers insights into the theory behind and the practical skills required for satellite imaging. One lab a week and two problem sets over course of the semester kept me busy. Asa student you are let loose on the labs following a lab sheet, but nothing more. The project is a big opportunity to hone skills and work in depth on something you find interesting. It should be noted, however, that there is very little guidance in this course and the majority of the work must be done individually and without help. There is a big mix of graduate and undergraduate students in this course.",
    "Ok course, but nothing to die for. Lots of work - not necessarily hard = just lots of it. Lab, problem sets, midterm, and a final project. If you're really into this take it.",
    "Yes I would definitely recommend this class to another student. It was incredibly interesting, especially with the lab componentwhere we were able to use our knowledge that we used in the course in the computer lab and really understand the material. I would say it is an introduction to remote sensing. The class covers: satellite imagery and how it is done, purposes and uses for satellites, the EM spectrum and how we can use it to our advantage and to understand the land, the program ENVI which is a very useful tool in analyzing the data that comes from satellites. The workload of the course is very low until the end when you have to do your project and with that, you can put as much time into it as you want to. Students often spend tens of hours in the lab working on their project, but it is doable even if you can't spend that much time on it, you just won't get as detailed of a project out of it.",
    "A really interesting course, which I feel that I learned a lot of theoretical material and practical skills from, in a way that seemed effortless. The final project balanced this out, and was a lot of work. However, I liked the concept, and it was a nice way to demonstrate to myself what I'd learned. Wasn't really sure how to approach deciding on a project though, and more guidance about the expectations would have been useful. The guest lectures were really interesting, and it restores your faith in students that they're willing to show up (almost) every week for 9am lectures on which there will be no final exam.",
    "I would recommend this class for all you Environmental Studies major students who need to learn a marketable skill and a powerful tool to analyze environmental issues (senior thesis, anyone?). Also, this is a very useful skill to have -- the one that pays in the outside world. Prior working knowledge of ArcGIS will enhance the learning experience.Professors Smith and Lee are organized, excited, and knowledgeable about the course material, and Larry who runs the center is extremely generous with his time and knowledge. A student will not lack in support in this course.Lastly, this is a great course to take with grad students (50 grad\/ 50 undergrad). Not only did I learn how to play around on ENVI, but I also found friends who can give me perspective on opportunities in the environmental field for people who are several years out of undergrad."
