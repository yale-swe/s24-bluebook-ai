    "This course is very much a history class -- you learn all about the women's movement from various lenses throughout the 20th century. However, discussion in section allows students to take a more critical view at various women's positions and approaches to achieving equality between the genders. I would definitely recommend the class to another student -- you learn a lot, it's easy to take notes, and the workload is completely reasonable.",
    "Solid course. Interesting lectures. Readings were a bit heavy for a history lecture, but nothing horribly out of the ordinary.",
    "Women in Modern America is a fantastic class that I highly recommend to ANYONE in any major at all. I am a computer science major that has always been afraid of\/bored by history, but I took this class on recommendation and loved it!! There is a decent amount of reading, but Joanne is the best lecturer I have ever had and she even talks about the readings in a way that make them relevant and interesting (also, reading load is light and definitely not all necessary). I was always excited to go to lecture and even section! Also, for me at least, the information was not overwhelmingly new (until the end of the course), just presented in a new light. I took AP US History in high school and was pretty familiar with all the main ideas throughout the course, she just fleshed out a lot of the gender\/sex related (aka INTERESTING) topics that we had kind of breezed over in high school. You learn a lot more about some really important and overall fascinating parts of US history without ANY sort of memorization whatsoever! I cannot recommend this course highly enough to men and women alike. This class is not full of men-hating people and will definitely hold the interest of anyone. I would call it more a \"gender\/sex in modern america\" than just women, because it talked a lot about gay\/trans issues throughout history, as well as women. I haven't taken US les\/gay yet, but fellow students said the two are fairly similar but complementary in a way that makes them both better!! So if you've taken that, this will probably be a fairly easy 5th class, and if not it's not too strenuous but you'll probably want to do the readings more. It's easy to pay attention in lecture because joanne is so dynamic!! Again, cannot recommend this class highly enough.",
    "Yes, I would recommend it. Interesting, easy, predictable, fairly standard history class.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class if you are interested in 20th century history or women's movements. It broadened my understanding of many of the movements I already knew about and opened my eyes to other movements that I hadn't really heard of. I always found the lectures very interesting; Professor Meyerowitz is (besides being an incredibly nice person) a very good lecturer, and explained everything well. This was my favorite class of the semester.",
    "This class would be good if you knew exactly what you were getting into and knew that this kind of subject (essentially the history of feminist movements) interested you. The TA you get is also critical in determining whether you enjoy this class or not. Make sure you pick a good TA. I would recommend this class if you know for sure that feminist history interests you or resonates with you. If not, this class might not be for you.",
    "Yes! Its an interesting class and worth it if you've never taken a WGSS or American History class.",
    "YES! This class was fantastic!",
    "This is a great class!! Professor Meyerowitz's lectures are fascinating and always very organized, and the workload is pretty light (midterm, final, 10 page research paper). The paper is a great opportunity to explore some area of the women's movement that you find particularly interesting. You can write about pretty much anything that has to do with women or gender in modern America, so there must be something that fascinates you!",
    "Yes. Great course, great professor, great lectures. Women, take this to learn about how far we have come in this country and the background that has led to what we have now, but also what is to come. Men, please take this too because this stuff is so important and I bet you will find it interesting and engaging as well.",
    "Wholly recommend this class for anyone--good information to know.",
    "This course is very interesting. I knew some of the material already, but still worth taking.",
    "Women in Modern America was very informative -- I am a non-major and I learned a lot about women's history. Each lecture was extremely rewarding and easy to understand. I would recommend this course. You will learn a lot and there is not much work.",
    "Take this class! It's excellent. I learned so much and this is definitely my favorite class so far at Yale.",
    "Definitely take it if you're interested. I took it Cr\/D\/F, which was nice but probably not necessary.",
    "It's a great class. I would absolutely recommend it to another student because it was engaging and interesting.",
    "Fun class. Your learn a lot of stuff. Prof. Meyerowitz's lecture was always fantastic, essentially.",
    "Good, interesting lecture course, typical lecture course format at Yale - midterm, paper, final, and a few small assignments here and there. The grading breakdown is 25% for everything - paper, final, midterm and section, so that is a plus.",
    "Yes, certainly take it if you're looking for a high-quality survey history lecture. It's pretty impersonal, and the final paper + final exam was a little much in my opinion, but you'll learn plenty and Prof Meyerowitz is a great lecturer.",
    "Really interesting and eye opening class for anyone who has never taken anything close to a women's history class before and from what I have heard its interesting for those who know all about it already too!",
    "Yes. It's a great foundational course in understanding women's place in present-day America based on the history of the previous century.",
    "100%. Not too hard, interesting primary documents and books, and overall fascinating material. Freedom to write your paper on whatever you want and lots of aid in planning it. Meyerowitz is a wonderful instructor. She is thorough and compelling. Her lectures always have a clear vision and outline and wrap up nicely. A real treat. I do wish more boys took this class. There were a handful of boys in the course and very few heterosexual boys. That doesn't make sense. There is a lot of value in this course and hearing more explicitly how women fit into the national narrative. There are things that you actually don't learn in other courses that you learn here. So please, fellas, get on yo game. It's a great, straightforward, interesting class.",
    "Great course, not too much work an a wonderful overview of women in America. Especially recommend taking it freshmen or sophomore year.",
    "PLEASE PLEASE take this class. I think it should be part of the required curriculum honestly, so relevant to life.....",
    "Everyone should think about taking this class, especially men!!!! And I say this as a man. However, there is a surprising amount of work and reading for this class (novels that appear on the final, section assignments, and a 10 page paper), so I wouldn't take it as an easy 5th credit.",
    "As a woman and someone with very little previous exposure to women's history, I found this course very interesting from a personal perspective, as well as a historical one. You trace the last 100 years or so of women's history in the U.S., covering trends in women's work, women's participation in political and social movements, and changing beliefs about sexuality and gender, among other topics. The course also ends up covering the major events of US history from the 1890s to the present, but through the lens of how those events affected women, or what role women played in them. I would recommend it as a first women's studies course if you are interested in a history-based course; if you are more in the mood for a theoretical class about the construction of gender you should probably look elsewhere (though this class does touch on it). The readings are also quite good, and the workload is reasonable (midterm, section, 10-page paper, and non-cumulative final).",
    "I would definitely recommend this class as a great intro-level history class either for freshmen or other students who don't have much exposure to history classes. It offers succinct yet nuanced snapshots of the history of the American women's movement of the 19th and 20th centuries in easily digestible pieces. It's workload, expectation level and pace are reasonable. With the exception of the assigned books, the readings really aren't necessary either for the midterm or final exam, so don't worry about finishing all of them. Also, the essay prompts for both exams are given to students beforehand, which allows students to plan the essays ahead of time!",
    "The history of women in America! Not modern feminism like I thought- very much a history class. The homework assignments were easy but the midterm and final are kind of difficult.",
    "This class is mainly a history class, but you learn a lot not only about women's history, but on a lot of things that are useful now regarding gender and current issues. Also there are a lot of misconceptions about historical events regarding women and this class really clears everything up and reveals the truth about women who have been obscured by history.I would absolutely recommend it because it's not hard, you learn a lot, and Meyerowitz is the best.",
    "The class was a very broad and entry level study of women in the 20th\/21st centuries in the U.S. The readings were generally really interesting (especially the assigned books)!",
    "I would recommend Women in Modern America to another student, but it's not a particularly thrilling course. (It's also not particularly light in terms of coursework, so I wouldn't recommend taking the class if you're looking for an easy A.) You'll come away with a greater understanding of what women have faced in this country in the past 100 years, and you'll also get a taste of the civil rights movement, the transgender rights movement, etc.",
    "AMAZING course. I went into the class thinking I knew a lot about women's history, but I came out learning so much!! Professor Meyerowitz is fantastic.",
    "Take it!",
    "This was the best class I have taken at Yale. I took it to fulfill my humanities requirement and learned and enjoyed every minute of it. Everyone should take this class because wonderfully taught and is so fundamentally important to our understanding of this country. If you don't take this class you're wrong.",
    "A thorough introduction to 20th century herstory.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course! I would summarize it as a course of the evolution of women's role in society throughout Twentieth Century America. I would recommend this course because it is well taught and the materials presented are thoughtful and interesting.",
    "Women in Modern America is a class about women and women's movements from the late nineteenth century up until today. The course moves chronologically through American women's history, tracing issues, challenges, themes and movements and how they tie into the greater context of American history. The assessments are fair and relatively fun, and the reading always very interesting and engaging. I looked forward to doing the work for and attending this class. I would absolutely recommend this class. It is as important for people to know about women's history in America as it is to know about any other aspect of American history that is taught as male-centric. I have personally found it incredibly interesting and enlightening and I think anybody who is history-minded (or not!) would and should.",
    "Every lady at Yale (and every man as well) should take this class. It is so interesting, and really fun. Professor Meyerowitz makes the class super interesting, and the reading doesn't even feel like work.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to any student looking for an engaging lecture. I had never taken a women's history class and found the material fascinating and extremely important. Professor Meyerowitz is a great lecturer, so intelligent and witty.",
    "Absolutely take this. It's a very well-done look at the history of women 1900-present. What I loved about this class is that it has a very down-to-earth perspective on women's history -- there is no overdone victimization or BS poetic interpretations of history. Professor Meyerowitz is experienced, funny, and charming. This is one of those lectures that you get excited for every single time. It's almost a luxury to learn about and be inspired by badass women who did so much. You will meet many other badass women in class as well. :)",
    "It was an alright course. Not very informative if you took Chauncey's class. But otherwise, good info to know.",
    "It is a very introductory women's history class. I would recommend it if they were coming in with little to no knowledge of women's history.",
    "It's interesting - the people in the class are more annoying than the class itself",
    "Whether you're a woman or not, you must take this course! It's a brilliant survey course of the history of women's movements and how they related to race, sexuality, gender identity, and more, from about 1880 to the present. You read a ton of primary sources. Professor Meyerowitz's lectures are so well organized and fascinating to listen to. She is not afraid to challenge the traditional narrative. You will learn a huge amount during this class and will be able to talk about everything from campaigns to raise the age of consent in the 19th century, to the first famous transsexual, to the difference between anti-pornography feminists and pro-sex feminists. It's definitely a class worth taking.",
    "It's a course on the 20th Century women, not modern as in women right now so not quite what the description said. That being said, it is very interesting and you learn about a lot of nuances of various women's movements. Generally focused on white feminism so while intersectionality is mentioned and she does believe in it, it's definitely not taught from that perspective. But I still definitely recommend it as good stepping stone into American Studies or WGSS or even just to learn a little more history. And yes guys can take it too - there were a good number of boys in the class.",
    "Great class! Wonderful professor, extremely clear lectures, a great introduction to women's studies\/issues, speaking as someone who took this Cr\/D.... really fascinating material.... Some of the best lectures I've been to at Yale....",
    "Feminism 101",
    "Yes I enjoyed it",
    "Yes, I would recommend this class to another student. Typically, women's political activism is a side note in other history class, but here it is the focus. It is an overview of how and why women sought change in the United States in the past 150 years.",
    "This was a phenomenal course. As someone who had never taken a class that dealt with the history surrounding women and their gender and sexuality, I learned so much. The readings are quite interesting, and the lectures are always organized and well-delivered. I would highly recommend it.",
    "WGSS 201 is a fantastic course! No matter what field you are interested in, you should take this course. Professor Meyerowitz is an amazing lecturerer. She makes everything interesting, emphasizing the larger themes and connections but still making sure the names and dates are clear. There is a lot of reading, but most of it was very interesting. There are few grades for this class, which means they all count for a lot more.",
    "A really good survey course with entertaining lectures and reasonable readings. Recommended.",
    "I liked the class but it was more like a \"white, middle-class women in modern America.\" We did not touch other races\/ethnicity that much so it got a bit boring mid-semester. The readings are a bit long but really interesting!",
    "If you want a general introduction to what women in America were doing from 1900-2000 take this course. It is exactly what it sounds like. The professor is kind, and the TAs are nice.",
    "Definitely take this course if you're interested at all in women's history. Joanne Meyerowitz is a fantastic lecturer, and male\/female students alike will find themselves truly caring about the course material. BUT, know in advance that this course isn't really a gut. To get a lot out of this class, you should actually do the readings and participate in section as much as possible. You also have the opportunity to really take ownership of the final paper, since it's on a subject of your choice.",
    "Women in Modern America is a class that deals with all issues of Women's Rights and feminism from about 1900 on. It is the quintessential Women's Studies class. If you're looking for a way to really get started with Women's Studies, then absolutely take this class. If you're not looking to get started with Women's Studies, then you should still take this class. It's very general and fun and interesting. It's one of those classes that every college student should take if only to become a more well-rounded person. Also, if you are interested in Women's Studies, then I can't imagine a class you'll enjoy more.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student. Lectures are great, but make sure to get a TA that you like. He or she will largely determine your overall experience in the class.",
    "Interesting, WELL ORGANIZED, relatable (NOT JUST to women), informative about the general history and different movements of the times (esp 20s-50s, 60s, 70s), great professor. One midterm, one final, one paper. Two short magazine assignments (analyze a magazine article from the 30s and 50s)-- great way to work with primary sources in SML or online. Take it.",
    "Good class, but lots of work.",
    "This course provides an overview of women's social movements from the 20th century. There is a considerable amount of information, but it is very rewarding in the end. I recommend the course!",
    "a pretty broad survey course of the women's movement (and related social justice movements, such as the civil rights movement) from the 1890s to today section participation, one midterm, one 10 pp final paper, and one final exam - so if you're looking for a \"gut,\" this is probably not the class all in all, I would definitely recommend this course to another student. I learned so much not only about the women's rights movement but also about U.S. history. Professor Meyerowitz is wonderful and changed the way I looked at race\/gender\/class and social justice movements in general.",
    "I definitely recommend this class. Professor Meyerowitz is a great lecturer (she cares about this stuff--heck, she lived through some of it--and she knows how to teach it). If you're already familiar with American history, you'll have a leg up on some of the other students. But the class won't be repetitive at all, since you'll be learning about history from the perspective of advances in women's history. There's a bit of reading (ranging from 60 pages to whole books) each week, but the readings are almost uniformly interesting.",
    "A great introductory class to WGSS, interesting, and the workload is very reasonable. Definitely recommend.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to anyone wanting to go through this century with an eye on women's experiences. The lectures were really well structured and Professor Meyerowitz is really easy to take notes from. I almost always found class incredibly interesting.",
    "Super interesting class and great intro to modern american history! Probably my favorite class that I've taken at Yale. The class includes a lot of different types of women's history (African American, Latino, LGBTQ, etc) which I absolutely loved. Everyone should take this class! A good cr\/d if you're looking for a class to audit and enjoy. Otherwise the reading is what you make it, but if you choose to do it all, it can be killer.",
    "Take it, it is an interesting history of women's history in america, focuses a lot on the labor industry in post WWII america, but overall very eye-opening.",
    "This class provides a great overview of 20th century American women's history. The topics that are covered are really interesting. The workload is manageable (midterm, final, varied small assignments in section, weekly reading) and lectures are always interesting. Professor Meyerowitz is a really dynamic lecturer and is clearly an expert on the topic. At times the reading can get to be a little heavy -- especially for a lower-level history lecture. Take this course! It's so interesting!",
    "WGSS 201 is a class that I would recommend to anyone looking for a social studies credit or interested in the topic. The lectures and readings were amazing, and it was--by far--my favorite class of the semester.",
    "The class is a good survey of the past ~100 years of women's history in the U.S. The material is really engaging and Professor Meyerowitz is great. However, I thought it was a fair amount more work than it's worth, so only take it if you've got the time to focus on it.",
    "Great class. Prof. Meyerowitz always delivers interesting and clear lectures. I learned a lot, but the final paper\/exam combo was annoying. Study guides for the midterm and final were helpful though so exams weren't too unexpected.",
    "I absolutely recommend taking this class. Professor Meyerowitz was an excellent lecturer and all of the lectures were amazing. The required readings were less amazing - most were not very interesting, although there were a few good ones hidden in the syllabus. Each week for section you have to read one or two ~30-page papers, plus about another three documents that vary in length, and sometimes additional readings from books. I didn't care for most of the readings, especially since some of them can be difficult to relate back to what you've learned in class. The lectures make them worth it, though. Overall it was a fantastic review of the women's movement in America and I highly recommend taking it.",
    "Solid course, I would recommend it. Not too much work, but it's important to do at least most of the reading because it's awkward in section if\/when no one is familiar with it (as with any Hu course). The tests are fair.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to any student. This class fills in the gaps of American History with the female perspective and is very well-organized. Professor Meyerowitz is phenomenal and, while there's a lot of work, it's manageable and interesting.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student. It's not particularly work heavy except for the relatively close due dates of the final paper and the final exam and is something that everyone should know more about.",
    "Women in Modern America is a course which cover's women's history in America over the past century. Readings for the course address the intersections of race, gender, sex, and class. I would definitely recommend this course to others (especially male students for this was a heavily female populated course) because it is eye-opening to look a the way our ideas about sexuality and gender have changed over the past century and what movements and societal forces have helped to bring about these changes.",
    "You may think it is a lot of reading, but it is all very interesting and do-able. Lecture twice a week and two magazine assignments spread out in the first part of the term - before Spring break. Then you have that final paper, which is also very do-able. Sometimes, it felt like the midterm and final exams in addition to the final paper were too much, but you realize that history can be approached in various ways, and in the end, I appreciated the work.",
    "A very nice survey course. Professor Meyerowitz is clearly very knowledgeable and is a good lecturer with nice delivery. You can get by with not doing most of the readings each week but there were three books that were needed for the final exam.",
    "Women in Modern America was looking at american history through the lens of women's experience. It is absolutely worth taking!",
    "I would recommend AMST 271 to another student.",
    "Great class, definitely take it as it will reward you with a great background to women's relationship to the events of the 20th century."
