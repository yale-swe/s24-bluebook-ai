   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths: Velozo Weaknesses: None",
    "Set theory is pretty useless",
    "Strengths: lecture material, problem sets, and notes provided are very helpful and will prepare you well for exams. Weaknesses: lectures sometimes hard to understand (in general really good).",
    "Discrete math is a beautiful subject, but make sure you're taking it with a solid professor. Otherwise, it gets old very quick.",
    "The teaching was sometimes hard to follow, making the problem sets quite difficult. With that said, I really enjoyed the material and definitely learned a ton.",
    "After class notes were clear and problem sets were engaging However, lectures were a bit hard to follow especially as a non math person. Also the final. Although most of the questions were fair, a few of them were just not representative of the difficulty of other test questions. Additionally the alternate final's questions were much more straight forward which is unfortunate since they should've been the same difficulty regardless of the date you took it. The midterms were very fair so I don't understand why this decision was made.",
    "This course had interesting concepts but it was taught in a very disorganized way because our professor often didnt come to class with notes. We often left class very confused on what had happened.",
    "The class could have been better structured within class.",
    "The strengths of this course was Professor Velozo. He made the class enjoyable and was a great lecturer. There weren't many weaknesses in the course, but some of the notes that Professor Velozo provided were really brief -- but the fact that he provided his own notes was great.",
    "good good math class",
    "The class is well organized for the most part, and easy to follow. The pacing was a little odd, as we'll spend a significant amount of time on one topic (i.e. countability), while some other topics are barely touched upon, but are still tested the same amount (planar graphs, recurrence relations). If the class were more evenly paced (as in started a little faster, and ended a little slower), I think the class would be much better.",
    "The course covers a lot of material and the pace may seem slightly fast at time. It was hard to first make sense of the flow of each class into the other, or to find structure in the lectures. The textbook was greatly helpful to understand the flow of the course. The course mainly involved formulating lemmas and proving them. How to apply them required quite a bit of personal work and research. It would be helpful to see applications of such theorems, specially in conceptual topics like in graph theory more extensively in class.",
    "Strengths: Solid teacher who wanted to make sure everyone was on the same page, good breadth of material with a decent amount of depth in each topic Weaknesses: Glossed over the last unit on recursive relations, didn't learn much there.",
    "The class presents interesting concepts, and the problem sets are always challenging and engaging to work on. However, some concepts could be explained more in depth, or in more clear ways. For example, near the end of the term, we rushed through recurrence relations, and never discussed in lecture important skills for psets and exams. Explanations of concepts like Ramsay's theorem could have been more clear. TAs were very useful during this class.",
    "Overall the lectures and notes were helpful and the problem sets were good practice. Professor Velozo, Ben, and the ULAs were always extremely approachable and were happy to clarify questions. The weakness of the course was that it was the first time Professor Velozo was teaching it, and so sometimes the lectures or notes could have been a bit more polished, but this is something that should be ironed out for the next time he teaches the course.",
    "Wow this class was pretty bad. The content is really interesting but it was just taught so poorly. Anibal seems really nice but he literally never prepared for lecture and didnt seem to really care at all about doing so. His lectures were a wild ride of confusing explanations.",
    "The instructor notes were very helpful to reign in exactly what we were expected to know which let us also get into learning things we may not have needed to know like all of the complicated proofs for the graph theory",
    "Great, interesting topics. In my opinion, a solidified version of this course with even more topics (however this may warrant splitting the course into a two-sequence) is ideal for computer science majors and beginning math majors.",
    "The course was well organized and problem sets were manageable. Exams were also reasonable.",
    "Lectures were spontaneous.sometimes good most times ok.",
    "Strengths: interesting material, varied lecture Weakness: got a bit disorganized towards the end, felt rushed",
    "The course covered all the basics of Discrete Mathematics, but I felt that the course pace was a bit on the slow side, and that we could've learned a bit more.",
    "It is a great proof-based class that teaches content that is very applicable to a wide variety of subject areas (particularly computer science). I believe the course used to teach concepts such as upper bounds (big O, theta, etc.) but was not taught this semester.",
    "I enjoyed the lecture style of the class. Without a textbook and notes often posted late it is very hard to study these concepts on your own. Especially because the topics are not \"linear\" and most discrete math courses all contain slightly different content. I found the problems sets were not enough to teach you the material and I often found myself googling more practice problems. The textbook chosen for the class was unused except for the occasional \"see the book for the full proof\" and was largely not helpful.",
    "Strengths: the problem sets were pretty interesting and you get to see how all the proofs add up to form a system of discrete mathematics. Weaknesses: often lacks of sense of where the class is going and why. We kind of just prove claim after claim with an occasional motivating problem.",
    "I found the material to be interesting and the workload to be very manageable. I wish there were more consistency in the difficulty of the problems we encountered on the midterms and the final. The first midterm was far easier than the problem sets, practice problems, and problems from class. The second midterm was slightly harder and the final was extremely difficult. In part, it felt like the professor did not know how hard to make things and so he had to adjust when students did better than expected. I also found the peer tutor hours extremely valuable.",
    "Teaching overall not well structured. Sometimes we wouldn't finish a proof and would not pick up on it in the next class, and I never knew what to expect going into class. This style of teaching was only redeemed by professor's entertaining comments during class.",
    "The material was fine, and explanations were fairly clear. I think students would have benefitted from the more frequent posting of notes, as well as brief answers\/explanations for the homework questions. Extra practice problems for the second midterm and final also would have been helpful.",
    "Strengths: The problem sets are pretty well done, although in some cases some casual feedback would be nice (as in, for instance, \"yes, you can do this proof like that, but it's easier if...\"). I felt the same way about the exams; there were parts that required clarification but in general the problem quality was high. Weaknesses: Prof. Velozo is a lovely person but not a strong lecturer, and his lectures didn't feel prepared - for example, there were several times when he'd get halfway through a proof, stare at the board, and then announce, \"well, you can't actually do it that way,\" and start over.",
    "Grading could have been more clear and fair.",
    "I believe the strength of this course lies in the breadth of topics it covers and the amount of preparation it gives for more advanced classes at Yale. Its greatest weakness in my opinion is that the course didn't follow the textbook at all, so it could be hard to find alternative explanations for the topics covered in class.",
    "I thought the course was overall interesting and well-taught. I wish we went more in-depth on certain topics -- for example, we did not really discuss big-O notation, which I was hoping we would."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "Yes, take this over 202 any day. You learn so much and you build up mathematical maturity.",
    "I took this class as a first year, and I'm glad I did. Good introduction to proofs, and we touched on many interesting topics. However, I probably wouldn't recommend this to be your first proof based class unless Velozo is teaching it.",
    "Yes! Total gut",
    "Yes! It pairs excellently with CPSC 223. It's a great course which teaches a lot of fundamental computer science \/ math ish principles.",
    "No, or at least not with Professor Velozo. Lectures seemed very unorganized, with many proofs that were left incomplete and examples that were left to us to finish on our own. For the lack of solid lecturing, there was not enough outside help (lecture notes, readings) to compensate.",
    "You learn a ton. I took it not knowing how to write proofs and left knowing how to do that, and I learned a ton of math along the way. It's probably a major requirement, but if you're choosing between this and CPSC 202, I'd pick this one again over and over again. It's a great challenge and I loved it. With that said - I had a ton of friends taking the course with me. I'm not sure what I would have done without them.",
    "I'm hesitant to say after the inconsistency of the course. You might get a fair professor. You might not. It's up to you to take the risk. The topics taught in discrete itself was helpful and interesting but it could have been taught better",
    "The concepts in discrete math are interesting and probably as applicable to the real world as theoretical math gets. Make sure you take it with a professor who has taught this class before and knows whats up.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this class to another student. The material is pretty interesting, and Professor Velozo was a great instructor.",
    "I would defiinitely recommend this course to another person. It definitely is a decent workload (generally like 5-7 hours on a given weekly pset) for your schedule. The first pset will probably be extremely difficult (as it was for me), but it gets much better over time -- use the ULAs for help as they are a godsend.",
    "Sure, its the only course on the topic - good for a lighter math class",
    "It's a solid math class with very light workload. The material itself is very interesting, if you don't mind learning it with underclassmen and\/or many CS majors who can't do math.",
    "I would recommend this course to any CS majors who are math oriented, or anyone who wants to improve their proof-writing ability. The class does start a little slow at first, and doesn't really pick up until the end of the semester, but you learn a decent amount of useful information. I also get the feeling that this semester's class was easier than previous years.",
    "Definitely useful for anyone interested in CS or Math.",
    "If you're a CS code monkey just take 202 if you're not interested in rigorous proofs and theory, but with the right math background (e.g. doing well in 230\/231 or 225), 244 should be a breeze and definitely supplements mathematical understanding of some important CS-applicable fields.",
    "If you are considering this class versus CPSC 202, definitely take this class. It gives you an actual mathematical background that will be useful later on, and the intense introduction to proof-writing is very useful. This class is definitely more challenging than 202, but you will get far more out of this class.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class for anyone who's ever been remotely excited by math\/its foundations. For the CS majors, it's a more proof-based class than 202 but I found the insight gained to be of much more value.",
    "Yes, if the student is interested in topics in discrete math or needs the course for their major.",
    "If someone else is teaching it. Anibals lack of preparation was really frustrating. I always felt like he was disrespecting my time.",
    "Not quite the best class to get into proof based if you want to get into other proof based math classes, as not a whole lot of time was given to really get into proof writing + once we got the the 2nd part of the class (combinatorics), proofs took a back seat in exchange for just pure numeric problem solving. But I would recommend to someone who hasn't done proofs but would like to get a taste of what proof based math has to offer. Graphs were also a pretty interesting topic, not just for cs majors but from a mathematical aspect as it's very different from the analysis and linear algebra that most people probably think of when they think of math",
    "YES! I loved the subjects and this was my joint first class in formal proofs. The learning curve isn't steep, just spend a little time practicing basic proof techniques before class (MIT mathematics of computer science lectures introduces them well). Take over CPSC 202. If proofs are worrying\/hard for you, it is worth overcoming in this class, because the grading was quite lenient.",
    "I would recommend the course to anyone who is interested in a relatively relaxed introduction to discrete math.",
    "Only if you have a strong math background or you're willing to put in a lot of effort to catch up. The prereqs for this class are extremely misleading, as the vast majority of the class has already taken upper level math classes or has had the privilege of a great high school math program, and the class is directed more at them. It's also relevant that this semester ~80% of the class was male. There's not a lot of guidance for students who have never written a proof before, and I would discourage people who don't have a lot of experience from taking the class without knowing others who are also taking it. The problem sets are difficult to get through alone, and the peer tutors don't just give out the answers. However, it was extremely rewarding to finish the proofs and I feel more confident about taking advanced math classes.",
    "Yeah. the problems are fun. learn a lot more than other discrete math.",
    "Yes! so much fun interesting content lecture teaches it all, you dont even need to read the textbook",
    "Yes, Anibal is a great professor who will make sure students get all the help they need in understanding the material. The homework is challenging, but the exams are fair. I enjoyed this course overall.",
    "Yes; even though one could also take CPSC 202 for their major, I feel that graph theory is an essential part of computer science and math in general.",
    "The course material is very applicable to other subject areas and strengthens proof-based thinking.",
    "I would not recommend this course to CS majors. Take 202 and don't suffer.",
    "I would recommend this class if you feel like you really want to do a proof-based discrete math class. I took this for the CS major and I am glad that I chose it over CS 201 but I wouldnt say its a must-take math course.",
    "It depends on the student. I found the material to be very interesting and intellectually stimulating; however, the professor was a bit unorganized at times and made things unclear. If you can get past the jumbled notes, then I would recommend this class.",
    "If you're considering taking it, you probably need it for some sort of requirement. It's pretty straightforward, although some of the problem sets questions may require attendance at office hours. Definitely take the class seriously, as it is easy to slip up if you don't.",
    "If you learn mostly by lecture, or if you haven't been exposed to much discrete math before, you might consider a different instructor. The course itself is pretty good, though, and from what I've seen it's preferable to the CPSC discrete math (if you're a CS major thinking about that kind of thing).",
    "No, not unless required.",
    "I would recommend this course for all students who have never taken a proof-based math class before or would like a review of writing proofs before taking more advanced math classes at Yale.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to other students."
