    "German vocabulary and grammar",

    "I developed better study habits, which I quickly learned were necessary for success in an intensive language course such as this one. I learned about the German language, but also about the culture in Germany and other German-speaking countries as well.",
    "I think that some of the skills, insights, and knowledge I learned from this course were the amount of hours and amount of dedication necessary in order to really understand languages. I came in knowing three other languages Spanish, English, and Chinese, and I forgot the difficulty in learning a new one. With language comes culture and understanding, and I cannot believe how much I appreciate the intricacies of German now. I will be working even harder and harder to perfect the very nuances I've learned to appreciate.",

   "comments": [
    "Strengths: Thiti was a great instructor. He was engaging and fun. I especially liked it when he enforced running through pronunciation as a class. Weaknesses: I found the homework due dates confusing. It would be easier if they were more regimented in when we had homework due (every Thursday, for instance).",
    "Very well organized, structured, and clear in the milestones we are expected to reach.",
    "A definite strength was the email exchange; it provided a wonderful opportunity for practice and feedback from a native language speaker.",
    "The strength of this course is that it's everyday, but that's a weakness too. It's difficult to pay attention to a single subject at a set time every single day, and I was wondering if there would be a better way around that. Perhaps to allow for a day off in the week would allow for people to appreciate the language a little bit more and to not treat it as a chore. Lastly, it seemed rather weird that the German coordinator would specifically specify to lower the average of the course. I was quite peeved (as were many other students), and I thought that left quite a sour taste in my mouth. We were told not to worry about grades, only learning, and then you do that? A little hypocritical, in my opinion.",
    "This course provides a good foundation for learning German. The classes are varied in format and are usually interesting.",
    "Immersive teaching was super helpful and exciting. I really enjoyed this class even at 9:25"

    "Yes I certainly would! I would also say that I appreciate having the chance to audit the course. I think that was a win-win situation and should be allowed in the future.",
    "Take it, why not?",
    "I would recommend this course to any student interested in studying German, either for a credit or for future use. There is always extra help available whenever you get lost, and the instructors are always happy to lend a hand to struggling students.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. Now, of course, this course comes with a lot of work! And some people understand languages simply faster and easier than other students do. I think the most important part is to treat this as a grade-free class, and to do your best!",
    "I would recommend this course to another student. It is important to keep in mind that you will get the most out of this course if you are willing to put a lot of time and work into it.",
    "Yes! German, I only realize after I have started to learn it, feels like such important and relevant language to learn.",
    "Yes"
