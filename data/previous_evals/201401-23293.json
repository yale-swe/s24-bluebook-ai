    "Yes. It teaches you many skills that you will use in many other classes.",
    "Don't take it with Klemann. There's a bunch of work and she grades very harshly. People say that your English grades improve as the course progresses. This is not true for Klemann. And don't disregard my comments because you think that my opinion is biased. Many other people think the same way.",
    "English 114 is definitely necessary to take here. It significantly increases both your ability to write academically as well as your writing confidence. Just pick a section that interests you and you'll love it.",
    "Yes, this is a good way to improve your writing for all majors",
    "I would definitely recommend this class.",
    "Through this class, you will look at various aspects of childhood and will ultimately become some kind of expert of childhood. You will write read papers on varying topics from kids pop culture to philosophical arguments. Throughout the term, you will learn how to write an effective academic paper and possibly even creative writing as well.",
    "I would recommend taking some English course during your time at Yale. A lot of us enter college thinking that we can write pretty decently. The English courses take that concept, rip it apart, and then put it back together. For me, I liked ENGL 114 because it taught me how to put my thoughts into constructive arguments and how to link ideas in ways I never expected. It certainly improved my writing quite a bit. I actually really liked the section \"Childhood, Self, & Society\". It forces you to question the social construct that is childhood and reflect on how society deals and interacts with the concept. It was something I really enjoyed writing about. Moreover, Professor Klemann is great. She pushes you in your writing. You'll never get an essay draft back with no corrections, but that's a good thing. I don't think any of us could have improved if she had not pushed us. Yet, she is always very kind and understanding. This class is no gut class though. There were times I was clocking well over 10 hours on a given paper. However, I believe that the results were worth it. Just keep it in mind when making your final class decisions.",
    "I would recommend this class, but be prepared it is a lot of work."
