   "comments": [
    "Gained a lot of knowledge about the history but mostly the theoretical underpinnings of the political parties in the US.",
    "I learned a lot about some of the different political theories that seek to explain the origin and development of modern parties today. I liked learning about the many way theorists seek to explain why we see the trends we do, especially with regards to legislative inaction, polarization and partisan or moderate voters. I feel I am walking away with an overall understanding of various different theories though, not an in depth knowledge of one specific aspect of the party system as a whole.",
    "Very comprehensive understanding of the evolution of US political parties.",
    "Political Parties was an awesome class that touched on many different topics all regarding political parties and the government. Many of which were able to apply to this election and was interesting to look at how things worked out this cycle. Overall, this class brought in knowledge from many of my previous classes but also taught me new material that I will be able to apply to many more political science classes.",
    "This was only my second political science class. As a prospective political science major, I think it gave me a good understanding of style of political science literature. The case study allowed me to apply what I learned in class to 2016 which helped me see which theories are relevant to contemporary politics and which may be outdated or purely theoretical.",
    "I learned a lot of the American political system, the syllabus was extremely comprehensive and covered a broad range of relevant issues. It provided a good foundation of the topic.",
    "Interesting survey course on the American political party system - especially relevant this year!",
    "Learn a lot about the formation of parties in America and what the roles of the different parties entail. It is very interesting if you want to study politics",
    "Professor Henderson introduced us to not only various theories about US political parties but also case studies regarding them, which I found the more interesting piece. I particularly enjoyed our own case study assignments, as it solidified what we learned even more in the real political arena.",
    "I gained a very basic knowledge of American political parties and polarization especially. Not only did this course allow me to better understand the political structure of America but the ways in which it interacted with and influenced polarization.",
    "I gained a lot of insight into how the two major American political parties actually function within the U.S. (what they can and cannot control, how they interact with each other and with the electorate, etc.), which was particularly relevant in the midst of the 2016 election.",
    "I learned about various tools and models that I could use to analyze the political landscape, such as the Median Voter Theorem, realignment theory, etc. I also studied the intersection of political parties with various aspects of political life.",
    "I think taking the class during the 2016 election was very interesting, and I learned a lot about how political systems and parties have developed in our country. I feel like it was very topical.",
    "I didn't really glean too many valuable insights, skills, or knowledge from this course. I learned some wonky political science theories like the median voter theorem or some stuff about partisan gridlock or the textbook congress, but other than learning these swathes of theories, I didn't really learn any skills or anything too insightful from PLSC 254. I found the knowledge that I gained from some of the theories to be interesting, but I would say that the course was lacking in substance.",
    "Learned some of the history and the roles of parties in politics.",
    "I had a very negative view of American parties before this class, but this class helped me understand why they are essential to the democratic process but also explained why and how the pitfalls of American parties occur. I gained a better understanding of the election process as well, especially through the case study assignment.",
    "By taking this course I developed 1) Deeper insight into the evolution of the American political system 2) Greater familiarity with the historical and present-day dynamics of congress 3) Improved analytical and research skills from writing the case study on a 2016 congressional candidate, as well as from the extended case study on how the winning candidate would behave in the 115th Congress. I actually found this lecture to be a really great stepping stone from intro polisci classes into more intermediate PLSC lectures. Would recommend to all political science majors, even if the material appears dry at first. If you engage with it, it's actually really interesting! And the professor explains concepts very well and cares a lot that students understand the material.",
    "This course taught me a lot about how politics works in America through both theories and relevant graphs\/current examples. Clear explanations of why we have a two-party system and general political theories of American politics.",
    "Why America has a two party system and how different parts of government affect this. I also learned an immense amount about voters and politicians and our government in a more general sense."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The course got off track of the syllabus pretty early on, making it hard to know what readings we were going to talk about in section. Also the final paper topic did not seem to relate back to the course and was difficult to answer the prompt. Professor Henderson did a good job going not just reading the slides and always asking for questions.",
    "The course is very well structured and is a great introduction to many prominent political scientists and ideas in political theory. Prof Henderson is very clear, interesting, and always happy to clarify any points. I will say that while lectures were generally very engaging, the pace seemed to slow down toward the end of the semester. The only other thing I would change is that we fell behind the syllabus early in the semester, and because it wasn't updated, I never quite knew where we were. If this happens again, I'd make sure the syllabus is updated and that the lecture titles match what is on the syllabus. Other than that, the course was great!",
    "Strengths certainly include the lecture format. I think Henderson had a clear understanding of the ideas he wanted to communicate and lectures that accompanied them well. Unfortunately, he often posted these lectures well after, even weeks after, the lecture had been given, and I found that away from him speaking, their format seemed disjoined and I had difficulty following the threat of what he had wanted to express. More so, from the outset I felt like there would not be a cohesive narrative to the lecture. Rather than following any sort of trail, chronological, thematic, etc., I felt like course touched upon and briefly explained theories here and there. The lack of coherent framework made it difficult to seek a salient knowledge of what the course aimed to achieve, but that is not to discard that I did enjoy the class overall.",
    "Lectures are very interesting but the readings are boring",
    "Strength: Accessible for students interested in party politics Weakness: Hard to actually get engaged with the course material; the reading requirements were pretty demanding and didn't add much to lecture or section. Plus, after the midterm, I'm pretty sure lecture attendance was about 30% or so.",
    "There was a lot of material packed into one course -- some topics maybe could have been omitted.",
    "The exams are ideal. I think Professor Henderson's format for exams allows students to synthesize the most important aspects of the course. I wish more professors gave an extensive list of possible exam questions. I think the reading list can be improved. It is intimidating because of its length and I'm not sure how many of the readings are necessary to the course.",
    "While it was good that the course was comprehensive, there were far too many reading requirements, I think it would be impossible to finish all of them. It would have been fantastic if specific readings or chapters were highlighted before the lecture so that I could have felt less lost. This isn't to simply reduce the workload, but to have a more directed reading list to back up the theories in class. While I appreciate the host of reading resources available, the sheer number of readings proved to be inhibiting. Aside from this, I really do appreciate the degree of guidance given by the instructor, assignments came with clear and detailed instructions and I felt adequately prepared for the tests given. As far as administration went, I think that this class is a great job.",
    "Lectures were very well structured, section was helpful and relevant, and the exams\/assignments were fair. Wish there could've been a sample case study to look at (or a more detailed structure to follow), since I had never seen or done a case study before and wasn't sure how it might be similar to or different from a typical poli sci paper.",
    "It was a great course just could have better section times.",
    "I really enjoyed the lectures and relevant examples, though Professor Henderson sometimes repeated himself or focused too long on fairly basic topics (ex. Median Voter Theorem). I also wish that the final paper deadline was at the end of Reading Period; I absolutely wouldve chosen that option if I couldve turned it in later, but theres simply too much going on in the last week of classes to put together a paper as well.",
    "The strengths are that the material was relevant and intriguing, the instructor was highly knowledgable, and the pace was reasonable. I wouldn't say there were any glaring weaknesses. I loved this course!",
    "Great course, very interesting lectures and helpful sections",
    "Interesting class on information that is particularly relevant to our lives as citizens within the American political system. Fairly light workload as well, with choice between a final paper and final exam. The exams were super easy, and the one short paper wasn't too bad either.",
    "It was a very well taught course and the syllabus was organized and concise. The only thing that would've allowed me to enjoy this course more was if someone had told me at the beginning of the year that all the readings were available as PDFs in the Course Reserves section of Canvas. Being new to Yale, I had no idea of this resource and went looking for each individual reading by myself until the midterm. I also wasn't aware that it was custom for classes to release a practice final and then select questions from the practice final to put on the actual final--if I'd known this, I would've prepared very differently for the final exam.",
    "I think that the lectures were very interesting, and I enjoyed them each week. But, there were often too many readings, and we often didn't even go over them in section. So, I would say the strength was the information we were given, and the weakness would probably be section, since I feel like we didn't really talk about what we learned about in lecture.",
    "This course did have a few strengths. First of all, the material itself proved to be incredibly relevant as we watched the 2016 election play out. It was interesting to be learning in a poli-sci environment as this election unfolded. Furthermore, I found a few of the readings to be interesting and that some of the theories they presented to explain political phenomena were really great. However, I think the course did have a large amount of weaknesses. Firstly, there were way too many readings assigned that were completely irrelevant and we fell so far behind the syllabus that it became laughable (this is a mix of what happened through section and lecture). I just don't think we needed all these readings to get the point across. Furthermore, I think you can judge a course aptly based on whether you can get away with not paying attention in lecture and not doing most of the readings and still get a good grade. I think that will be the case for myself (I obviously don't know my grade yet), but that shows that a lot of the stuff covered in lecture and in the readings was quite vacuous. I think another main issue of the course was that it provided way too much room for editorializing and there was a lot of editorializing done. I took 2 political science classes this year and one was only slightly partisan (which for Yale is a miracle) whereas this one was quite partisan. Professor Henderson sometimes maintained an air of neutrality, but other times blatantly opened the spigot of liberal propaganda. Ultimately, I think this course has a tremendous amount of potential to be better as the topic is quite interesting, Professor Henderson is tremendously passionate about it, and there is a good body of readings to cover the. To improve it, I would encourage Professor Henderson to be less biased, to shorten the syllabus (and add more practical readings such as more scientific studies), increase accountability with lecture attendance, and mandate a better curriculum for the TAs. I obviously had some major gripes with the course, but want to acknowledge that I think it has great potential and that I am sure Professor Henderson will tap into it.",
    "Very interesting class, no complaints.",
    "Get rid of the course, it's just no good.",
    "The course material was solid and interesting. The reading load, however, was slightly heavier than felt appropriate for a lecture-based class",
    "Professor Hendersen's lectures are straightforward, clear, and interesting which is a definite strength. The way he set up the class (i.e. Assignments, syllabus schedule, etc) was also a strength. The readings could be very confusing and long but he was always willing to answer questions. The only \"weakness\" of the class is that I wish Hendersen had assumed we knew nothing about American politics because sometimes he said something about Congress for example that he assumed we knew and I felt silly asking questions but I had no idea what he meant.",
    "At the beginning of the semester, I sometimes felt that the professor moved too quickly through the slides. But then I got used to his teaching style (and he posts the slides anyways) and found lectures to be extremely well organized and well explained. The slides are very cohesive and useful in studying for the exams. But it's MUCH easier to understand them if you don't simply copy them down word for word, but add notes on Professor Henderson's explanations from lecture. Exams are extremely fair and are best studied for by reviewing notes alongside lecture slides, then completing the study guide in full and memorizing your answers. The study guide is awesome, it's just so weird to me that some students didn't even do it. It's literally almost the entire exam! Another useful thing I found for preparing for the midterm was writing down the author of each reading and adding a two sentence explanation of what the reading was about. Made the exam very straightforward and even enjoyable to write, because I could cite authors in my essays. Section was helpful because the TA reviewed readings and key concepts from lecture and helped us make sense of what they actually meant. I also enjoyed Professor Henderson's lectures because of the funny video clips he showed, and also because he was always interested in getting students' takes on current events. I wish I had volunteered answers in class, but I was shy. Instead I went to his office hours for the final and sometimes asked questions after class, and Professor Henderson was extremely helpful. Definitely not one of those professors that's just there to get published. Henderson is also a gifted teacher and cares a lot about his students. This course was extremely well organized, which made the dry material easier to get through and the more interesting stuff a joy to learn about. I really loved the option to write an extension of the case study for the final rather than taking an exam. Took a lot of stress off of my finals period. I feel that I've gained a more nuanced understanding of American politics through taking this class.",
    "Prof Henderson was always very helpful and had clear powerpoints. Overall a fantastic and thorough introduction into political parties in America.",
    "Weaknesses: a lot of reading--daunting at times which turned me off. Strengths: Concise and interesting lectures. Very straightforward requirements for assessments. Fascinating content that was often very relevant to our current political situations."

   "comments": [
    "Great course. Very fun and interesting material and not too much work.",
    "This is an amazing course for anyone interested in poli sci to take early on in college, especially freshman year. It's a very well organized course that will teach you how to learn from a lecture class in an effective way. It's also a great introduction to some of the most prominent thinkers and theories in political philosophy. It's not too difficult - if you prepare for the midterms in the way that the professor suggests, you'll be fine.",
    "If you are interested in getting a brief overview of themes in the US party system, I recommend this course. If you are looking for a more sophisticated, in-depth understanding of how this course fits into the larger framework of politics\/political philosophy in general, or even a more specific understanding of one or two particular theories, I would say to perhaps find a more challenging course.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student. Professor Henderson lays out his understanding of political parties lucidly and it helps you understand politics much better. I'm very glad I took this class. The midterm and final are not too difficult considering he gives you comprehensive study guides for both",
    "The lecture was pretty dry, workload pretty irrelevant, and my TA didn't do well in actually facilitating discussion. I probably wouldn't recommend it unless you need a gut class and have a genuine love of the American political system.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone who doesn't have a good knowledge of US politics and how the political system works.",
    "Political parties was a very interesting class about government and political parties in total. It touched on how parties influence government workings but also how they influence the general population. With a midterm, case study paper, and final it was a great 5th class. Professor Henderson is also really knowledgeable about many different topics making the class even more interesting.",
    "Yes. This is a great fifth class because it's interesting and does not require a lot of effort. However, I would not recommend it if you're looking to really dedicate yourself to a course. Lecture can be a little dry at times and there was not much discussion in section.",
    "I would recommend it to anyone interested in American politics as it provides a great foundation to understanding the system.",
    "Very good PLSC lecture course, even if you come in with no interest in political parties. Well structured, exams are super fair (the study guides are great), and Prof Henderson & TFs are all very helpful.",
    "Yes I would recommend this class to other students.",
    "Yes! The workload is totally manageable, Professor Henderson is a very clear instructor, and he balances policy and theory well. Sections were somewhat useless, but they didnt necessarily distract from the strengths of the course.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student because the material is relevant and intriguing, the professor is wonderful, and the TAs were top-notch.",
    "Yes would absolutely recommend",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course. It was an interesting class on information that is particularly relevant to our lives as citizens within the American political system (how the two major American political parties actually function within the U.S., what they can and cannot control, how they interact with each other and with the electorate, etc.). Fairly light workload as well, with choice between a final paper and final exam. The exams were super easy, and the one short paper wasn't too bad either.",
    "This is a great course to develop one's theoretical political knowledge and equip oneself with tools to better understand the political landscape. Prof. Henderson was nice, helpful, and an overall very good lecturer.",
    "If people are looking for an easy, laid-back, interesting class, I would recommend it. But, if people are looking for something that will really get you thinking and engaged, I probably wouldn't recommend it.",
    "I would be hesitant to recommend PLSC 254 to another student. The course is not too difficult and it does cover some fascinating political material, but it was arguably the weakest course I took at Yale. The syllabus was not well-organized, the class had a gutty feel, the teaching had a clear liberal slant to it, and I did not feel like I came away from the few months in that class with a real heap of useful insight or skills. I do believe this course will get better in the future as Professor Henderson was likely overwhelmed with an incredibly large number of students this year compared to what he usually has and would encourage you to wait the course out for one semester to make sure it has improved.",
    "Yes, if you're interested in how parties think and act.",
    "There was nothing about this class that was redeemable. Maybe 30%-40% of the class showed up for lecture and I don't blame the students. There were times where his explanations were factually false. I don't expect my professors to know everything but I attended lecture every day and I don't think I got one thing out of that class that I hadn't already learned in other political science classes. 80% of the readings just barely skimmed the topics in class and I quit reading them after the midterm because they weren't necessary at all to doing well in the class. I don't know if it was the professor or the way the class was structured but if it was up to me I wouldn't offer this class again because it was honestly the worst class I've taken at Yale.",
    "Yes if you are very interested in American political process or why we have parties and how they work. Henderson is awesome- straightforward, not trying to trick anyone, understands students and cares about them and is very knowledgable.",
    "This is a really solid intermediate polisci course! If you show up to the first few lectures and feel the material is a little dry, don't be discouraged-- it gets progressively more interesting throughout the semester, and Henderson always links the dry theory covered in the readings to current events. The lecture atmosphere can feel a little depressing since it felt like half of the class didn't care about the material and was just there for a PLSC credit, but if you engage with the material and with the professor, it's actually really interesting and you can learn so much from the course. Plus it makes it easier to do well on exams. Henderson is a really caring professor and gifted teacher. Office hours are extremely helpful, especially for the case study\/final paper-- go to them if you can. Henderson gives you the option to either do an extended version of the case study as your final, or to take an exam (for which he always provides an extremely helpful study guide). I chose the final paper option because it interested me an it freed up my reading week (it'd due by the last day of classes). Took a TON of stress off of my finals period. The midterm is also very straight forward because of the study guide-- fill it out in its entirety and memorize your answers. Be able to cite a few authors and their theories for the essay questions. Study your lecture notes alongside the slides (which he posts after class), and pro tip: don't just copy down the slides during lecture. Include Henderson's explanations of the concepts, because sometimes the slides aren't entirely clear. Also, do the reading. You don't have to read them in full (I did that and it took forever). The strategy that worked best for me was simply what I did for the midterm- writing down a three to four sentence explanation of each author's article and saving it in a google doc. Super helpful. Overall, pretty stress-free polisci course that gives you a more nuanced understanding of the history\/dynamics of political parties in the U.S. Great professor, interesting material if you engage. This is definitely the kind of class where you get what you put into it. Very fair, very easy to do well and learn a lot if you try.",
    "good course. I thought it would be a lot of things I already knew but I learned a great deal from it, and at the same time it was a very chill class",
    "Absolutely would recommend this course if you have little to no understanding of American politics or even if you love following election cycles but have had little formal education about it. Clear powerpoints, get a helpful TA, and midterm and final are fair. I really learned a lot and enjoyed every lecture!",
    "Absolutely--Henderson is great and the information is super relevant and interesting. I learned so much and feel much more politically literate."
