    "Music 205 is SO FUN. It's basically teaching you what you already knew subconsciously as a musician (or avid music lover), but didn't know why you knew it (if that makes sense). For that reason, it's super enriching and wonderful. TAKE IT.Make sure to shop around for TAs though, if your schedule permits it.",
    "Advice for those with AP theory experience: a significant percentage of the material in this class wouldbe new for you. However, that still amounts to very little, because this class moves SO SLOW. If you want an easy A, take this class, but if you want to really move forward in your knowledge of theory, take 210 instead. And take 218, it's the best.",
    "I've been playing music for 16 years and reading music for at least 11, but had never really taken formal theory. This class was EXACTLY what I wanted. Also, Andr\u00e9 is wonderful and I'm very sad for the future that he's not teaching anymore.",
    "I would recommend Music 205 to any student interested in music theory.",
    "Definitely--you'll learn some interesting material",
    "Yes. I learned a lot about music that I think will help me with whatever I want to do musically, be it perform, compose, take MUSI 218 next semester, or all three. Also it was well taught and the workload was perfect.",
    "Music 205 covers a wide variety of concepts in music theory, in the areas of harmony (intervals, chords, counterpoint, harmonic function) and form (sentences, periods, binary forms). I really enjoyed this class and found it really interesting (you probably would as well if you play an instrument or sing but don't really know much theory). I would definitely recommend taking this class. The workload isn't that bad but you cover a lot of interesting material.",
    "Music 205 is a lot of fun. It's not that much work, but you will learn some cool skills and learn to appreciate classical music more.",
    "It is difficult to master these different skills and is usually filled with kids who already knew how to do it. I would recommend it if you like music."
