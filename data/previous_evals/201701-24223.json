    "This course essentially surveyed many digital humanities projects in order to get a sense of what's out there in the field and what the challenges\/possibilities are.",
    "Prior to this class, I had never known what the term digital humanities meant. This semester was a wonderful introduction to the field of DH, the background behind it, and many DH projects.",
    "How to approach analyzing DH projects, in what ways computers could be applied to the humanities",
    "I learned about the Digital Humanities in general which is a discipline that I had no prior knowledge about. I learned at how to analyze things in the media with specific lenses (i.e. feminist, racial).",

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "This course had pretty much no structure. Being that digital humanities itself is largely undefined, I suppose it's hard to define a clear curricular structure. We covered a lot of interesting material and the free flowing discussion format led to great conversation. As I head into submitting my final project proposal, I have absolutely no idea where I stand grade-wise in this course, but I think the de-emphasis on grading is part of the essence.",
    "Professor Wexler was a great strength. She was incredibly knowledgeable about the field and what the field encompassed. I liked how she spent a lot of time defining DH through the projects associated with the field. She brought in many guest speakers (almost 1 \/ class) to help illustrate these projects, which was wonderful. The only big weakness of this course is that I did not have any expectations when writing my final proposal. Even the outline given to us was rather vague. Although I think that may have been done on purpose (to help us discover what the proposal should be), a clear-cut outline with defined terms would be preferred, so that way we can be confident in the proposal.",
    "Low workload, interesting DH projects showcased, but didn't really feel like profound concepts or themes were taught. I just learned how to approach creating a DH team, writing a mock proposal for a DH project, and how to analyze other DH projects. The class was loose and not well organized, which was somewhat frustrating -- having clear learning goals each week could have made the class more fulfilling.",
    "Felt very unorganized and the purposes\/learning points were unclear.",
    "I am not sure if I got anything out of this course. I needed a 5th class and this was the only thing that fit into my schedule so I had to take it. The classes were never related to each other and we really just kept having guest speakers that would talk about DH tools that were so straightforward that we could have used them at home on our own.",
    "The class opens you to a whole new field and prepares you for it"

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. This class assumed no prior knowledge, which to me is important, since many intro classes here still refer to background info. Wexler knows what's up, and she was more than willing to work with her students to achieve great DH project proposals. Additionally, by bringing in several guest speakers, we were able to see how the term DH changes with different people. This class is definitely a gut, although I don't think that's a bad thing--I certainly learned a lot from this class. If you're looking for a unique fifth class, this is definitely for you.",
    "The pros: Laura Wexler is brilliant and has a strong and unique perspective on the field, and there are some wonderful (if sometimes hit-or-miss) guest speakers. If you're invested in DH, you'll find the readings interesting. It's not a CS or methods course (there are no assignments focused on learning coding skills or particular software programs), but a series of workshops\/discussions oriented around theoretical questions, which worked well for me. However, the course is somewhat haphazardly organized, which makes it less rigorous than it could be--but if you're looking for a lighter workload, then that's actually a plus!",
    "If you're willing to feel like you're not learning too much or too deeply, then take it. Otherwise, look for another class or Hu credit",
    "Professor Wexler is great, but I would not recommend this class. It just seemed very pointless to me.",
    "Yes! I took it because I didn't know what \"Digital Humanities\" meant, and I loved it!",
    "Yes for someone who wants to a explore the Humanities in a different way"
