   "comments": [
    "If you are Jewish or remotely interested in Judaism, take this class. It puts everything you know about Judaism in historical context, and Elli Stern is a fantastic lecturer and lovely person.",
    "Intro to Modern Jewish Thought was an overview of early modern to contemporary major Jewish thinkers, from Spinoza to Zionism and beyond, through the prism of comparing Eastern and Western Jewish resposnes to modernity. I would definitely recommend this class to another student who is intereted in modern Judaism. If you have no Jewish background, Professor Stern will make the material interesting and accessible (though he won't help you at all with spelling Yiddish names...). If you do have some background, as I did (k-8 at Jewish day school plus active in Jewish communities) you could still gain a lot from the class in filling in the gaps of your knowledge and connecting the dots. Professor Stern is awesome and adds real character and life to the material. The class was not much work at all (midterm paper, final paper, final exam) and most of the readings, while interesting, are not required to do well in the class or section.",
    "Intro to Modern Jewish Thought is a great overview of the currents in intellectual and philosophical thought that has shaped Judaism since the 17th century. I would recommend it to a student who is looking to deepen their understanding of the way Jewish thought has come to be. The assigned reading is a bit much but you can definitely get by with skimming and reading only whats most interesting to you. Overall, a great introductory course.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. Make no mistake, it's a survey: the course moves very fast, and there isn't always as much detail as one might like, but it provides a fantastic introduction to modern Jewish thought while also touching on its relationship to Jewish social history and more general 'Western' philosophy. There is quite a bit of reading, but it's manageable; the papers are both interesting and not terribly difficult.",
    "I would DEFINITELY recommend this class to other students, whether you're Jewish and want to deepen your knowledge on Judaism, or are just curious to learn more about it. Professor Stern is wonderful, the lectures are interesting, and it's a very interesting overview of modern history from the perspective of a unique minority.The class itself is pretty straightforward, the readings are interesting, and although there are 2 papers, both professor Stern and the TA (Mordu) are really helpful.",
    "Stern is awesome, the class was interesting in retrospect although some of the weeks were kinda like \"meh.\" He's a very talented lecturer - probably one of those profs who will become semi-legendary when he's old. There's a ton of reading, none of which anybody ever did, which was awkward because he always tried to (verbally) quiz us on the readings during lecture, but still nobody did them. Probably because they were wayyyy too long.I wholeheartedly recommend this class if they get rid of section. If the next incarnation still has section, don't take it or take it Cr\/D, because the section was a pointless waste of time, even though lectures were fun and engaging."
