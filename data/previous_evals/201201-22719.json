    "I liked most of the readings for this class. The grading on the first paper was pretty harsh for most of the class. There is also a final paper.",
    "This course explored many interesting topics that applied to women around the world. I enjoyed learning about these topics from different angles and liked that the class was very active in class discussions. However, people started getting stuck on the same topics and the course focused on just a few countries instead of being truly global. That said, the readings were interesting and although it seemed like there were a lot of readings, it was engaging.",
    "To be quite honest, Globalizing Gender was a consistently awkward, infuriating, and overall bizarre course. Admittedly, some of the material was interesting and novel to me, but if you have any sort of background in WGSS, don't bother with this one. Prof. Chanda's moods are utterly fickle, and she as much as told us that she wished WGSS were just Women's Studies. I guess this would be a good class to take if you need a writing credit, want to be frustrated, and enjoy marginalizing queer people, but other than that, I can't see much of an upside to this class.",
    "While interesting at first, the course goes around in circles. Our class ended up debating the same questions again and again. The readings were sometimes interesting, but we did not refer to them a lot during discussion so often they seemed quite pointless. Professor Chanda often provides interesting perspectives on the material we are studying. However, it does seem that she often has a certain opinion and if yours differs from that, you cannot be correct. She is also a rather tough grader in terms of papers.",
    "Worse WGSS class out there. DO NOT TAKE IT. You will actually be dumber and less informed at the end of this class than you were at the beginning. Avoid at ALL costs.",
    "Yes. I good course on the globalized nature of feminism.",
    "I would not recommend this class to another student. Quality of discussion was poor, and expectations were unclear (even when clarification was sought). Readings ranged from interesting to irrelevant.",
    "No I would not. I did not learn much in this class at all, it felt like I was reading the same things over and over again. Do not take this class.",
    "No, for reasons above.",
    "DON'T. TAKE. THIS. EVER.",
    "A good introduction, and often really interesting readings, but if you\u00b4re already pretty engaged with feminism\/gender\/sexuality stuff, you might be frustrated with the redundant discussions and Professor Chanda\u00b4s old-fashioned views. Also a very easy\/interesting writing credit! There are only two papers."
