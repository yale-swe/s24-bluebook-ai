    "I would definitely recommend PHYS 170 to a fellow student. If you are looking for a classic physics course in the style of AP Physics, this is certainly not the course for you, but if you are interested in biology, chemistry, and medicine and how physics can be applied to any and all of those disciplines, then it is certainly worth taking.",
    "PHYS 170 is definitely tough, but the exams are fair. The weekly psets are not fair, they might make you cry sometimes because it is suddenly so much more complex and confusing than anything you saw in class or in the reading. Every week I did my best and finished and met with people to check answers and went to the study halls, and I received 1\/20 on one, a lot of 12\/20, etc. Very rarely did I get a decent grade on the psets despite trying really really hard on them. The answer is to just let go. The course can be finished even with your psets getting wrecked by the TF's pen every week, because the exams are fair and they are worth a lot more. Also you will learn a lot of really cool stuff, so take it if you're a bio student.",
    "Do not take this class unless it is a major requirement (etc). It's miserable. It tries to teach you some very amazing concepts, and if you go in for those you may enjoy it, but you really have to be a physics\/math whiz not to struggle like crazy.",
    "Don't take this class lightly. It is quite difficult and will take up most of your studying time. Having said this, it may be useful for premeds, provided you are very skilled at physics. The modules are annoying, and I wish there had been a textbook to accompany this class.",
    "Take it over 180 if you don't love physics-I had physics background and still opted for 170, and I don't regret it. Beware that it is A LOT OF work though.",
    "I would definitely recommend PHYS 170 to another student who needs to take introductory physics. This class makes physics fun, interesting, and relevant in the context of biology. Be warned that it does involve a lot of work and the psets can take awhile! However, that comes with a ton of study halls and office hours to help students out.",
    "PHYS 170 was interesting at times, and you learn a lot about physical relationships, diffusion, etc. You can a really good sense of physics in biological contexts, something that is relevant for biology and for medicine, and it's a really interesting new way of approaching physics. However, do NOT approach this course expecting to gain a general background in physics, and do NOT approach this course thinking you will gain a solid foundation in physics. DO NOT take this course if you have not taken physics prior, you will not have time to learn both the basic physics, and to extrapolate to life sciences and all of its applications. I cannot imagine haven taken this course without already taking physics in high school. The course also overwhelms itself with its depth. It tries to cover a lot of topics, and each one warrants its own course for a full semester. As a result, you end up only glossing over important topics, and you don't have time to fully understand what you are doing. The course might as well have been called \"A Bunch Of Really Cool and Kinda Related Topics in Science.\" PHYS 170 generally was very convoluted and frustrating, but you do come away with a better understanding of physics and biology.",
    "Would recommend (esp if you're pre-med) Not the easiest class, and I'm not sure if it'll be helpful to me down the line, but I would say the same about a more traditional physics class as well",
    "I would not recommend this course. I do not feel like I understood the topics covered even after extensive studying.",
    "If you're thinking of taking this class, it's probably because you have to take this class. If you DO have a choice, stay away.",
    "I would recommend this course for pre-meds who need physics. It is less straight physics than 180 and is decently taught. The problem sets are very annoying, but the midterms were easier than the homework assignments.",
    "This class was a fine way for people not interested in physics to fulfill our physics requirement. The instructors generally did a good job at making the material interesting to biology folk. Claudia was consistently extremely helpful and great at explaining information. It was always clear that she wanted us to enjoy the class and get something out of learning physics. Simon was also very helpful, especially in the study halls. He sometimes explained things a bit too quickly in lecture, but would go over information we were uncertain about if asked. Sometimes the problem sets were frustrating for their level of difficulty, but the study halls were extremely helpful in figuring out all of the questions. Problem sets were practically impossible to do on one's own.",
    "Yes I would recommend 170 over 180 if you want to go into a biomedical related field. I learned so much more practical uses that were new and exciting rather than going through what most have already had to go through.",
    "PHYS 170 as a whole just felt really unnecessary to me. The psets were ridiculously hard for no reason and didn't do a good job of reflecting our actual understanding of the material. When studying for the midterms I looked over maybe 1 of the pset questions but ignored the rest because they were so ridiculously difficult. I know that the math requirement is what often makes people choose 170\/171 over 180\/181 so there's not really much of a choice. But if you have the math for 180\/181 choose that. It will make more sense, it will be more straightforward, and you'll end the term feeling like you've learned a good amount of physics.",
    "Don't take it unless you have to.",
    "PHYS 170 is a difficult but rewarding intro physics class. If you know that you want to take a more biological-oriented physics class it's totally the right choice; however, if you are looking to take a more standard physics class do not take it. The problem sets and exams are difficult so you have to keep on pace during the class!",
    "Take 180 if you want a more classic intro physics class, take 170 if you want biological applications and probably slightly less calculus (actually, almost no calculus - you need to understand calculus, but rarely do you have to actually do derivatives or integrals). The problems sets are long, so start early and go to section (maybe multiple sections) because the TAs will always go through at least one problem from the p-set completely. A lot of the topics are really math with biological applications, and very loosely tied to what you usually think of as physics.",
    "It's a solid course, especially considering pretty much everyone takes it for their major or med school requirements. It's superbly well-organized and transparently graded--seriously, absolutely amazing in terms of management. The teaching is fine--not spectacular, not bad. That would be a problem considering the amount of material if it weren't for the massive availability of TA office hours, discussion sections, and peer tutors. If you use those properly you'll be all right. If you're a life sciences-oriented person who needs physics, I'd recommend it over phys 180 just because you'll be more interested. They use a lot of weird examples that can make the problems harder, but it's also way easier (or at least more interesting) to cover topics in terms of bio if that's what you're interested in. In terms of work: one 5-7 hour p-set per week, one very low-key quiz per week, 2-3 hours of optional (but strongly recommended) reading every week, occasional in-class activities with a little out-of-class prep, a few midterms, and a final. I think I spent around 12 hours per week on things outside of class.",
    "Just take Physics 180. Do not bother with this class, even if you are a premed. You will not get a good understanding of physics through this class. You would be much better off in Physics 180, especially if you don't have a strong physics background. I was scared to take 180 because I was afraid that it would be much more competitive and harder to do well. It turned out that I should have been afraid of that in 170. From what I've seen of friends in 180, they have a much better understanding of physics than I do and they seem a lot happier with their class. If you are going to still take 170, go to study hall. It will help you so much with the problem sets and preparing for the weekly quizzes.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class for people who don't like traditional physics but have to take a physics class. It's not for people who want straight forward ball rolling down a hill problems.",
    "PHYS 170 skips many normal physics topics (ex. inertia, torque) in favor of more biology oriented topics (ex. infectious disease modelling). At certain points, the class felt more like a statistics class because of how much probability we did. If you are interested in a more general physics education, go with PHYS 180 - PHYS 170 seems focused almost to the point of its own detriment, using very simplified models to try to connect to biological systems. Also, be prepared to attend study halls and sections - psets are near impossible without them.",
    "Awesome physics intro class. If you are interested in biology\/chemistry, this class would definitely be super fascinating to you. The class constantly ties the physics concepts into their application in other fields, which was really fascinating. The professors are incredibly helpful.",
    "The class requires too much time out of students. Otherwise, the class is interesting and is well-taught. However, the problems sets are too much time and are too hard. The math level required of students should be clarified and be constant throughout the entire course. I would recommend the course otherwise. Students are often rudely passive aggressive to the professors, but the professors try to be flexible and adaptive to students. This is the only class that had surveys throughout the course that I have ever taken at Yale, and I really appreciate that. If the professors would just make the problem sets less demeaning because it's unreasonable to expect that much time out of students (we do have other classes and activities), the class would be amazing. I otherwise really enjoyed the class.",
    "The overall course was difficult, and at times the round about way of teaching physics with a biology integrated curriculum was frustrating. However, once I got used to learning physics from this form of teaching, I found it to be much more interesting and applicable, as I saw overlap with subjects like biochemistry, chemistry, etc. Understanding the physics side of things, for topics I was already aware of as a biology major was immensely satisfying. However, for those looking for a traditional High School intro physics course, this is definitely not the class to take. But, for those looking for a more integrative approach to physics with regards to other sciences, then by all means take 170.",
    "It's tough to say which introductory physics class is better. Both have very apparent advantages and disadvantages, but I think PHYS 170 is the better class for premeds. Psets are practically impossible on your own, so expect to go to the weekly study halls they provide. They are helpful and if you've accepted that you will spend all of Thursday nights doing the pset, you will be fine. It's a lot more work than what you think it should be. You devote a lot of time to this class, and it doesn't feel like you're getting much out of it. But in the end (and pretty much only at the end) will you see that it was worth it. Yeah it may not seem like some of these things are relevant to physics, but they do provide a good understanding for physics in biology. I feel like this is the class to take for the MCAT, but again, that's for you to decide. Both classes are brutal and you will have to know which you prefer. The psets for 170 are worse, but the exams for 180 are much more demanding. You'll probably end up regretting your decision throughout the semester (friends in both classes did), but you probably made the right decision for you.",
    "PHYS 170 is a life science-oriented physics class usually advertised to pre-meds. As a pre-med myself, I liked seeing the intersectionality between physics and biology\/medicine. Although lots of students say that this course does not really teach physics, I think it does help with MCAT preparation, since the new test does not emphasize classic physics anymore. The two professors really care about the course and about their students, so if you are willing to seek help, they are always there. The TFs are also extremely helpful. If you are unsure, just shop both PHYS 170 and 180 to see which one suits you better."
