   "comments": [
    "Yes, take this course especially if you are looking for a L5 credit your freshman year. It was filled with freshman, a very small class, fewer than 10 people for sure. It gives you a very good opportunity to practice speaking in French and it helps you with your writing as well. You watch some very interesting movies as well. The readings can become a bit too boring sometimes.",
    "I would highly recommend French 160 to anyone looking to improve his or her conversational French. The class teaches quite a bit about French culture, at least on a surface level, and provides the opportunity for comparison among different cultures. The class is largely determined by the students who are in it - we had a small class with several international students, so we were able to have rich discussions with a variety of viewpoints. Certainly shop the class, and don't be discouraged if it seems a bit overwhelming at first. As the year goes on, comprehension improves, and it gets less intimidating to speak in class.",
    "The course pretty much consists of readings (or other forms of media) from modern french publications centered around different key issues, and class discussions about those issues. The course is great if you already have pretty decent conversational fluency (writing and grammar is less important, though still necessary) but it would be a struggle for a student with under-developed speaking\/comprehension skills.",
    "Absolutely recommend it. The reading is interesting and the assignments are fun.",
    "Be aware: It is a lot of work.That being said, it is a very interesting class, and so much more interesting than 150!You learn a lot about today's France, and it is 100% discussion-based.Your oral French - especially your vocabulary - will greatly improve.Also, if you can take it with Jonathan Cornillon; TAKE IT. You will not regret, I promise.",
    "YES. Great!"
