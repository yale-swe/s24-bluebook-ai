   "comments": [
    "I would not recommend Arch 150 if they had my TA's but perhaps the other TA's were better?",
    "Yep, definitely take if you are creative and interested in architecture or design.",
    "I would recommend this class to another student. It's fun, very interesting and Alexander Purves is a great lecturer. Architecture is such an interesting discipline I feel that everyone should take up the opportunity to learn something about it and ARCH 150 is a great way to do that. If you work hard you will certainly take a lot away from this class and have a great sense of achievement after the final project review.",
    "So much fun!!! Gives you an entirely new perspective on the world around you, and you get to draw every week, which is such a nice break from all of the reading\/writing of other classes. The readings are all entirely optional and not necessary (but interesting if you feel like doing them). The only thing to beware of is that you don't get back any grades -- ever. So, nobody has any idea at all of how well they're doing in the course until you get back your final grade at the end of the semester (so I actually still have no idea what my grade is -- so I can't even comment on whether the grading is fair or not!) Aargh. But a really great choice for a Credit\/D, or a regular course if you're feeling brave!",
    "A perfect class if you're looking for something different than the typical midterm and papers type of class and are interested in learning more about architecture. It is more work than a general class, but you can really get a lot out of it if you put in the effort.",
    "ARCH 150 is a good transition into architecture and learning how to observe the world around you with an architect's eye.",
    "ARCH 150 01 is a comprehensive introduction to the study of architecture. The professor begins with present day examples of architecture to highlight the theoretical and applied creation of architecture through light (or the lack thereof), the interruption, reuniting, and ordering of space, and the way architecture is realized via movement through space. We then work our way back to origins of architecture (primarily the western tradition) by focusing on the a comprehensive set of examples of architecture that span recorded history. The course wraps up with guest lectures on the present state of architecture, urban planning, and nuances in architectural design (such as ornament vs. sculpture vs. decoration). In tandem, the course's TAs (who are graduate students in the Yale School of Architecture) develop students' technical capacities through weekly drawing assignments, group projects, and independent design projects. The projects, as well as an essay, allow students to respond to lectures and weekly reading assignments.",
    "Interesting class, gives you a pretty good sense of the field, good to take as a prospective major or just interested student. Downsides include bad TAs and not knowing what your grade is until the end of the semester.",
    "You will learn a new way to read your surroundings, especially if you take the weekly sketchbook assignments as an opportunity to out and explore beyond your own college or favorite area of campus. Lectures and assignments have relatively little to do with each other, and readings are never discussed, but you will not feel like you are getting enough out of the course unless you do all three. There are only two assignments where you actually make something (a bit of a shame), and a short paper.",
    "Great course even if you're not an architecture major, but just enjoy drawing! The assignments do take time and are challenging, but it is definitely less work than any art class. The lectures are amazing, you'll walk away with a real appreciation for architecture",
    "It's a good course and you cover a lot of different types of material. You get out of it what you put in to it. Even though the very basic necessary work is minimal (attendance at sections, weekly sketchbook assignments), the amount of work you CAN put in to the course is infinite--there are tons of readings, and you're encouraged to do multiple drafts and exploratory sketches for every sketchbook assignment. I took this credit-D, which was a little counter-productive. I didn't get the best elements out of the class, and it was stressful to create projects that I wouldn't be embarrassed to present to my section. Don't take this as your fifth class--there are a lot of easier architecture classes that you can use if you just want to dip your toes into architecture. Take this if you're interested in it and excited to put the time into it. If you plan on BSing it, you'll end up miserable.",
    "Take this class! It is wonderful! I took it as a senior with zero drawing experience and it was one of my favorite classes. The assignments are challenging but designed to help you improve, and they're always interesting and encourage you to explore Yale and New Haven more than you might have in the past. It's really not that much work and you will find yourself coming away from the class with a new perspective on buildings and cities.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS. I'm not an architecture major, never planned to become one, and had zero drawing experience before the class started. And I loved it! I became much better at drawing and I had so much fun doing it. This class makes you look at buildings in a completely new light. Also, the architecture TAs are all fantastic.",
    "Amazing class. Take it even if you don't plan to be an architecture major.",
    "Great course. I would take it even if you do not intend to become an architecture major.",
    "Yes, I would recommend ARCH 150 for other students considering the major. It is a great introduction to architectural theory and sketching",
    "A good introduction to many different aspects of architecture. Professor Purves is a good lecturer and he keeps class interesting. Some of the guest lecturers were pretty boring though. Overall an interetsing class that helped me start to look at things in a different way. Good humanities credit. Most of the assignments were just sketches, but if you want to get anything out of the class you do have to spend a while working on them. Some of the readings were interesting, but there are a lot. No reason to do them for the class really, so just read the ones that look interesting to you.",
    "Required for majors, great for non-majors. I am a major so I kind of wish it gave a better sense of what to expect in the next semester of architecture, but it's an intro course, so it makes sense. Still super interesting and drawing and design assignments are great!",
    "Definitely worth taking even if you're not an architecture major. You'll start observing your surroundings more thoughtfully.",
    "This is a pretty good course. If you are even remotely considering the possibility of majoring in architecture, take it, and then you will get a sense of what the major is like. I'm glad I took the class, even though I now know that I don't want to be an architecture major (hint: the major is a heck of a lot of work that's how the major got the nickname archi-torture! even though the intro course is very manageable). Professor Purves is a wonderful lecturer. His passion for the subject was palpable, and, dare I say, infectious. I loved listening to him speak. Even though it was my first class of the day and an early (for college students) one at that I never wanted to skip a lecture. The readings are supposedly \"required\", but I don't know anybody in the course who actually kept up with them. I completed maybe two of them the entire semester. They're definitely not necessary to enjoy the course. A lot of them are rather esoteric and let's just say that architects are not known for the quality of their writing. I was a bit reluctant to keep a sketchbook at first, but it's definitely a good practice to get into, and I think it improved the way I draw, which is really saying that it changed the way I look at the built world. You won't come out of this course with a distinct body of knowledge; rather, it will give you an appreciation for the art of architecture. And you'll probably find yourself really digging Le Corbusier.",
    "It is one of the best introduction courses at Yale. I learned a lot and the instructor is very good at giving a general idea about architecture.",
    "I have already recommended\/promoted this course to many of my peers because I learned so much from this class.",
    "Very interesting class",
    "Great, interesting course with probably the best section I've ever had at Yale. Purves is a great lecturer and all the TAs were really laid-back and friendly. The mandatory section is a drawing section. Each week we had a drawing assignment that we would then discuss during section. Critique was not harsh at all, but definitely constructive. Not necessary to do the readings. One paper and a final project.",
    "A fantastic course for anyone interested in deepening how you think about architecture. Not so much an architectural history course, as a a review of architectural concepts or themes (such as the use of light in architecture, the ways in which groups of buildings can be organized, etc). Professor Purves is great, as are the TAs. The assignments are weekly sketchbook assignments, which are challenging but also very fun and rewarding (they generally ask you to interact in some way with the campus architecture). One of my favorite classes I've taken at Yale",
    "I would highly recommend Intro to Architecture to another student. The course gives you a bit of a window into how to think about architecture (and how architects themselves think and write about architecture) without all the nitty-gritty details of how structures work. The course looks at architecture through a number of lenses: space, light, materials, the environment, etc. and does not move chronologically, but jumps around in time so that you can see the commonalities across a wide range of architectural styles. During lecture Professor Purves shows slides of hundreds of photos he has taken and remarks about them. There are readings and drawing assignments each week, plus a model, a paper, and the final project. The assignments are enjoyable and challenging--they take some time if you want to have a product that you are proud of. No drawing experience is necessary, but a lot of people who take the course are very talented, which could be intimidating. I found that the drawing practice really enhanced my observation skills. The TAs are great, and section was a fun and friendly environment.",
    "ARCH 150 is a great introduction into the study of architecture through a number of different lenses, including: light, material, style, ornament, plan, landscape, urban design, etc. Those with a background in design will have an advantage, but the class is good for those without too.",
    "An interesting class that is probably very different than anything you will take if you are not an Architecture major. I would recommend, but only if you have some skill at drawing.",
    "If you are even remotely interested in architecture, you should consider taking this class!",
    "yes",
    "An art class with a decently large time requirement, would recommend, off tops. If you're even considering the major its A MUST TAKE AS IN YOU CANT DO THE MAJOR WITHOUT IT."
