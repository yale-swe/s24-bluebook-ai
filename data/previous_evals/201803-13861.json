   "comments": [
    "This course taught me a lot about craft and about materials. It has made me look more carefully at everything around me--from the mugs in my kitchen (most slip-cast, some overly obvious about their handmade character) to the materials of chairs and clothing. I learned to think about how things are made and what assumptions and norms are built into them, and how to see some of this just by looking at them. I also learned to think more about the metaphorical meaning of objects.",
    "I developed a greater appreciation for the work of craftspeople and the various ways to study and write history through the lens of material culture.",
    "I learned so many new hand skills - from spoon carving to spinning wool - and from these hands-on experiences I gained greater appreciation for the importance of understanding the processes rather than simply the products of making."

   "question_id": "GS403",
   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The major weakness of the course was just that there wasn't enough time to really get into the practical explorations. A three-hour seminar would be better, and I'm sure some of the practical elements could even benefit from longer periods of time. That said, the practical portion was probably the greatest strength of the course. Another strength of the course was having both Ned and Glenn as co-teachers. While they agree on many things, they have slightly different styles and preoccupations, and it was useful to have both of them providing input and direction.",
    "I enjoyed the structure of the course, with hands-on workshops as well as traditional seminar meetings. I also enjoyed the two books that I read and reviewed.",
    "All of the planned aspects of the course I would consider strengths. The workshops and West Campus visits were exciting and unique opportunities, and the reading list offered a thorough survey while also introducing specificity and depth. The seminar discussions and class participation I found to be less stimulating. It was a combination of a sense of repetition in the patterns of discussion, and the lack of an established common language that each of the students could equally engage and interrogate. I am not sure how this might be improved as it would vary with the particular group of students, but that is one impression I had on reflection on the semester.",
    "The strengths of the course are definitely its hand-on engagement and the resulting mix of artists, art historians and other material culture focused disciplines represented in the course. The only weakness is possibly that some readings were somewhat too technologically detailed, which made it difficult to engage with the texts until after class had happened."

   "comments": [
    "I would absolutely recommend this course. You learn a lot about craft and theories of material culture and making, but you also learn a lot that is incredibly relevant to everyday life about the objects around us and about workmanship.",
    "Yes, the combination of readings and exercises made it an unusual and fun seminar!",
    "I would definitely recommend the course! It is unique in its particularly phenomenological model of learning and Ned Cooke and Glenn Adamson are both incredible sources of knowledge."
