    "For something that's required, this is a very enjoyable experience. You listen to different speakers, but don't have to worry about memorizing stuff--it's just learning for learning's sake. There's an abstract due at the end, but c'mon; it's just an abstract!",
    "Yes!",
    "It's required for all Cognitive Science senior majors, but that's a good thing because this course is very chill and super cool. How often do you read about research and then get to talk to the author of the paper!",
    "One of the best things about being a cogsci major!",
    "It's very interesting, though some lectures are a bit long.",
    "Loved this class. A different cool guest speaker from Cog Sci every week, and you get to meet all the other cog sci seniors and discuss everyone's research in a low key environment. The workload is perfect -- one or two papers of reading a week (which I do recommend reading as the guest speakers didn't really tend to review the reading too much), and at the end you write an abstract for your senior thesis. Possibly the only half-credit class I've taken at Yale that actually assigned a half credit worth of work. Joshua Knobe was awesome and supportive. If you're taking it it's because you have to, but definitely something to look forward to."
