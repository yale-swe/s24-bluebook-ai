    "It feels wrong to give Karen anything less than an excellent for her teaching because she is so extraordinarily patient, intelligent, responsive, and committed. I want to clarify that the reason I gave a \"two\" for the class was to reflect my constructive criticisms regarding the course structure. I think the seminar needs lectures from the professor, not the students, in order to frame some of the ambitious material within the course as a whole. The discussion sometimes felt hijacked by the agenda of two or three students that wanted to frame all of the readings in terms of Marx or Foucault. Notably, Foucault wasn't on the syllabus -- not a priority for the professor nor all of the students that signed onto the course (having read the syllabus). It would have been helpful to have terms clarified, and a structured discussion (including, perhaps student summaries) of each reading. The conversation didn't match the reading in a constructive way, and I think Karen could have been more proactive in making sure such coordination occurred. That said, I give this critique with some misgiving because Karen really astonished me over the semester with how diplomatically and expertly she bridged interdisciplinary material and engaged all of the students in discussion. So -- it's a hard class to criticize given my sincere respect for the teacher and the material."

    "I really enjoyed the reading response requirement and the weekly feedback from Karen on my thought process regarding the works we covered. It was very helpful to have a regular (and detailed) critique from a professor. I also gained a lot of understanding from Karen's office hours sessions and from the readings generally. I think the three hour conversations managed to remain lively but sometimes at the cost of feeling intellectually \"safe.\" I can't tell you how turned off I was to some of the readings (and on a bad day, the field of anthropology) due to some very outspoken people who seemed more interested in correcting other students as opposed to learning anything new.",
    "The weekly in class discussions among students and professor.",
    "Great readings!!Also, having food made the three-hour course format much more pleasant."

    "I guess I'm beating a dead horse here but the seminar discussion needed ground rules and more structure. Karen had some difficult students so it wasn't entirely her fault. Still, the conversation was too Machiavellian (she who sneers loudest speaks most) and would have benefitted froma) structured lectures at the beginning of the seminar outlining the key points that we should take away from each readingb) student presentations on aspects of those key points, or adding to the lecture of the professorc) seminar discussion on the lectures and readingsIn this way the discussion could avoid being steered to the personal agenda of a few overly vocal students and would force all students to engage with the material beyond their personal research interest. Bringing personal research interests into a class can enhance a discussion, but when everyone is talking around the reading then the readings itself become less useful.",
    "Slow the reading down. Make more explicit the material versus social approaches to the material among the students, themselves.",
    "I really liked the course, so these comments should be taken in the context of \"ways to make a good thing better\" rather than harsh critique. That said, there are two things I would modify:First, although I loved the readings, the load was really much heavier than a normal 3-credit course. As much as I hate to say it, I'd suggest cutting down to a maximum of four different texts per week. This would keep students from feeling overwhelmed, and might also facilitate a deeper engagement with the content of the readings.Second, although I understand that at this level we're all supposed to be engaging with the texts for ourselves, I would have liked just a bit more direction from Dr. H\u00e9bert as to the key concepts to pull from these texts. I don't mean to suggest that there should be a full hour-long lecture for each topic, but even just 20-30 minutes of comments on how the readings relate to each other, why they're innovative (or not), and where they fit into a broader theoretical or disciplinary landscape would be hugely helpful. The format as-was worked out relatively well (and Dr. H\u00e9bert does a great job of moderating discussion), but it did feel like we ran across some major difficulties with individuals taking entrenched disciplinary positions in the discussion, on one hand, or, on the other hand, people who were engaging with these materials for the first time feeling like they didn't know how to situate them within a broader context. More direction from the professor at the beginning of each class could be a huge help for preventing some of these difficulties in future versions of the course.",
    "Instructor could offer a bit more historical framing at the beginning of the class on the readings. Instructor could also take more of an active role in directing discussions.",
    "The course material was sometimes more than necessary. The concentration and time required to read 7 articles is more than a book with 7 chapters!Often theoretical material was not explained, and the class did not have any instrument to digest it collectively."

Karen is generous with criticizing student writing and giving suggestions, she is easy to talk to but also a challenging professor, and overall just a wonderful scholar and human being.I suggest she give thirty minute slots as opposed to 15 minute slots because she was usually running behind.",

    "At the beginning of the course I felt that the Callon readings, the Marx in a week, the intemperate scallops, etc, had nothing to do with me. By the end of the course, while reviewing the readings to write my paper, I realized how valuable the syllabus had been and how much I had learned. This is another reason I want the class to have more structure -- the reading list is so intense it deserves a systematic method of organizing all that material so that it isn't lost in marathon and meandering discussion sessions. That said, I definitely did get something out of the discussions because writing the paper was an inspired process where many ideas came together.",

    "I was interested in the title and reading list.As there is no place to comment on readings in this survey I'll do so right here.1. There should be a Foucault reading or non-anthropology students are left out in the cold2. The Marx reading should be shorter and should include a reading from Harvey or Smith or someone who synthesizes Marx (maybe Castree?) otherwise it is too overwhelming to cover in a week. A lecture is definitely needed here.3. The ANT readings were too much -- one week would suffice.4. Would be nice to add more case studies to the readings and a little less theory.5. Thank you for introducing me to Polanyi, Castree, ANT and I really loved Lawn People.6. Gidwani isn't brilliant enough to merit the full book. Neither is Biocapital. What about just a chapter or two and then something critical on them, a book review, who knows?7. The nature theme was sometimes lost in the readings, would be good to add more direct case studies on how humans use nature. O'Connor? Ostrom?",

It's working with very cutting-edge literature, and it's the only Yale course that I'm aware of offering a robust theoretical grounding in the Marxian perspective on environmental anthropology. This makes it a great (and much-needed!) complement to the rest of the required coursework for the joint PhD.",
