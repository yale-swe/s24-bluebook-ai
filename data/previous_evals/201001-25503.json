    "An overview of the social history and philosophy surrounding Monteverdi, Haydn, Mozart, and Beethoven. The material is fascinating (though a lot of background in philosophy and history is helpful), and the listening selections are a treat. I would highly recommend this course to another student.",
    "Yes, a real gem of a class.",
    "I would wholeheartedly recommend this course to someone interested in and somewhat knowledgeable about the subject. I had a considerable amount of music background going into the class, but many students didn't, and I think that those of us who did have some background got a lot more out of it.",
    "Leon Plantinga is both remarkably brilliant and exceptionally kind. The course readings are manageable and insightful, the music is beautiful, the atmosphere is relaxed. The final paper is very open-ended and allows plenty of room for creativity. I took this course having only taken Music 131 and not knowing how to read scores, and I still enjoyed it a lot. I came into this course loving classical music - now I love it more and understand it better. Highly recommended.",
    "Take it by all means, if you can get in. He only teaches it once a couple of years."
