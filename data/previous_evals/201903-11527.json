    "Gained an understanding of the development of various philosophical themes through the early modern period. Developed close reading skills and enhanced philosophical writing skills. Additionally, students worked on their ability to convey their developed philosophical ideas verbally, since Professor Darwall would utilize students' reading responses as a guide for the discussion.",
    "Lots of knowledge about Early Modern Ethics Practice thinking through ideas on my own Experience in a section with really sharp peers\/graduate students Practice writing a longer essay in Philosophy",
    "Analytical skills in understanding primary ethics texts, dissecting arguments, understanding puzzles,"

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The syllabus was excellently designed. We read a broad range of philosophers, and the connections between them were clear. Professor Darwall also helped solidify these connections in the second half of the course by referring back to previous philosophers when relevant. The level of discussion in the course was also extremely high and made me appreciate the depth of the views we were examining. The reading responses (three per student spread throughout the semester) were also quite stimulating; they gave students a chance to develop some ideas more thoroughly--particularly useful since over half the grade is a single paper--and allowed us to take on a larger role in the discussion occasionally.",
    "Professor Darwall is super knowledgeable about all of the things that we read. This allows him to discuss any point which people bring up and to be fantastic to talk to during office hours where he is always friendly and approachable. Also his feedback on the 3 short response papers is fairly detailed and very helpful to aid overall understanding of the topics you wrote on. The texts we read are fantastic and span from the most famous to people I hadnt ever heard of before. Got to be in a Seminar with fantastic students (and graduate students) Seminar often would spend lots of time on a very small portion of the (often quite sizable) assigned reading. This is not necessarily problematic, but sometimes led to a feeling that I was missing the forest for the trees. The class time (7-9pm) was difficult, as it made it somewhat difficult to focus sometimes. Also I understand only having it meet once a week, but in general I learned that I prefer more often just to stay more immediately engaged with the topics being covered."

   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this course to any undergraduate interested in the early modern period, or ethics more generally. However, they should go in with the understanding that the course basically assumes some prior knowledge of the authors. Or, alternatively, you must come to class understanding what is going on in the reading, since the class spends the vast majority of its time discussing very specific points within the text. The course is not expositional in nature--it's investigative and critical. Students certainly learn lots, but exposing undergraduates to new philosophers is definitely not the focus of the course. This makes it challenging for undergraduates, I think, since some of the philosophers are not taught in more introductory courses (eg. Hutcheson, Butler). Indeed, graduate students far outnumber the number of undergrads, who have more experience with these texts. So, in short, an excellent course for students looking for a course that critically engages with these thinkers.",
    "If you know what you are getting into and have some experience with the topics then yes. It is great to be able to take a class from Prof. Darwall, and the stuff we cover is compelling and listening to discussion was always helpful. If this would be your first exposure to this material, though, then I would expect this course to be quite challenging due to the relatively high level of discussion which is had in seminar.",
    "Absolutely. Professor Darwall is an excellent professor, so dedicated, so clear thinking, and a great seminar leader."
