   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this class because Prof Kastan is a great teacher and very knowledgeable about the course material. The only problem is he likes to go off tangent and sometimes the class is confusing. But if you like to explore the relationship between print culture, print capitalism, literature and reformation theology, this class has it all.",
    "YES - take this class! A look at the materiality of Shakespeare's sonnets (as well as Donne and Herbert). You will likely spend more time in the Beinecke than our class did (we didn't spend much time there because of the Shakespeare exhibit that was running at the same time). Professor Kastan is one of the best professors you will ever have and getting to interact\/have discussions with him in a non-lecture setting is such a wonderful experience!",
    "I would recommend this class if you don't mind an utter lack of structure. It's laid back, easy and a nice change of pace -- though it can be hard to start thinking about texts as physical materials rather than close reading for meaning after 4 years of standard English classes.",
    "I would only recommend English 210 if you are really interested in the material. Professor Kastan is great and this is a good opportunity to experience his teaching, but I found the format of the class to be a little challenging. We only met once a week (for 2 hours) and studied whatever Professor Kastan wanted to talk about, but the only graded assignment was a long paper at the end of the course.",
    "This is a very wacky course.The reading is fantastic and the seminars are fun. There is not too much work, just one research paper on a topic of your choosing at the end.I would definitely recommend it if you are self motivated and interested in the materiality of the Renaissance book. However, if you do not push yourself to keep up with the reading and pick an interesting paper topic I can imagine that the class would feel slow and be easy to disengage from.",
    "I liked it. It might have been a bit much of Kastan talking, and also a bit much of people trying to impress him with their comments, but the concept of talking about the material nature of books is interesting, and Kastan is brilliant as always. Class was particularly good when we dissected a sonnet at length. I ended up really enjoying the final paper, too.",
    "This course is basically whatever Professor Kastan decides he wants to do for the semester, which is actually really fun and rewarding. Be prepared for some uncertainty: we didn't get a syllabus and only found out which authors we would be reading after a couple weeks of class. If you can get in, though, it's a really fun course. Professor Kastan is really funny and of course, incredibly knowledgeable and smart. I would recommend this course.",
    "It's difficult to decide whether or not to recommend this class, first of all because Professor Kastan has been known to change the curriculum of the class with this title fairly drastically from year to year. The basic idea is that you are considering texts not just from the conventional perspective of literary analysis, but with an eye to the historical and material circumstances of their writing, their printing, their publishing, and their dissemination. Kastan is brilliant and a lot of fun and the subject, when you really get into it, is fascinating. But he tends to dominate discussion, and it was at times unclear what we were supposed to be focusing on. There were also no real assignments (other than reading) beside a final paper and no written syllabus; we flew, if not blind, then into a fog. High risk, high reward, I guess. , If you're shopping it, try to get him to say in the first class what he wants to do over the course of the semester, and if you take it, definitely meet with him early and often outside of class to get on his wavelength, as it were.",
    "Yes! Great class, really interesting material unlike anything else you'll take at Yale. And of course Kastan is incredible, you should try to take a class with him before leaving Yale.",
    "Take it if you're interested in the history of publication and in the role materiality plays in drawing meaning from texts. If you've never taken a class with Kastan before, definitely go for it.",
    "English 210 is fantastic because of Kastan's expertise, but it's also a bit of a ride, as we were given no syllabus at anytime during the semester and it could be difficult to know exactly what we were learning.",
    "Take it if you want to get to know Prof. Kastan and if you are interested in print culture. Do not take it if you are primarily interested in close reading.",
    "Generally a good class, but fairly frustrating in some senses. Sometimes you feel like you're talking in circles. There's no syllabus, and definitely don't count on grades being in on time. The final paper was very difficult - a combo of literary analysis and research in pretty much any topic you think of, which feels like a huge undertaking on your own. Still, Prof Kastan is really enthusiastic and knowledgeable, and you'll learn things in this class you wouldn't elsewhere.",
    "I would definitely recommend it, you learn how to think about literature in a very different way. Talking about the work in context brings in this missing puzzle piece that had always been ignored in the english classes I had taken before. It's very satisfying."
