    "Basically the class is the equivalent of a feminist book club.",
    "Take this class! It was an awesome seminar, and covered a wide range of issues. As a premed student, I found it especially interesting to learn about the history of women in medical school.",
    "Absolutely take this course! You will learn a lot and have really interesting in class discussions. The papers are not too much work, and your writing will greatly improve. Fabulous junior seminar regardless of your major to learn more about the female body and its relation to society throughout America's history.",
    "A class about women in medicine, from the experiences of females in insane asylums to women physicians, HSHM 445 is a great class to take especially as a female HSHM major. The material that you learn is applicable to many other classes, and provides a new and interesting perspective on material that you've probably already discussed in other class. I would highly recommend this course.",
    "I think this class is definitely worth taking. You are expected to participate in class, but if you do the readings this shouldn't be difficult. There are three papers. One 4-5pg, one 5-7pg, and one 15 pg paper.",
    "Definitely.",
    "A very informative class that is a perfect seminar.",
    "I would recommend this to another student. The workload and reading are manageable and interesting, and class discussion is usually really really interesting. I took it as a senior History of Science, History of Medicine major and I felt it was the perfect class to finish my major with. I definitely recommend it."
