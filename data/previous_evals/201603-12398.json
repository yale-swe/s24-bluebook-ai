   "comments": [
    "A really solid overview of literature in 19th century France as well as the historical events, developments and processes that formed it; in addition to this, which would have already well sufficed for a class on French realism, I gained really foundational understanding for the trends and markings of different schools and styles of literary criticism, such that I now feel capable of identifying the premisses and methods of other secondary texts that I encounter; lastly, I found all the exercises (book review analysis, presentation and abstract) to be useful and meaningful for anyone thinking about going into academia",
    "Gained a greater understanding of 19th-century history and literature and of the history of literary criticism in the second half is the 20th century.",
    "Skills in writing in French Knowledge of critical perspectives on realist and naturalist literature Skills in thinking critically about relationships between critical and literary movements",
    "This course introduced me to a variety of critical and theoretical texts and gave me a new approach to analyzing these texts. I also appreciated that this course encouraged us to problematize the category of Realism. Complicating the genre in this way enabled us to engage with canonical texts in a new way."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "See above response. I found this class superb -- it was rigorous, it was engaging, the choice of secondary literature was on point, all the readings were introduced and discussed in such way that nothing felt superfluous and I feel like I now have a harbor of knowledge and skill set that I can turn to when reencountering these authors or currents in lit criticism",
    "The course was really excellent. Prof Samuels is a great facilitator of discussion, but also shares his own insights about the literature and criticism. I really appreciate and benefit from his approach to teaching literature and theory.",
    "I really appreciated the way the course material was organized -- the mixture of primary texts and critical perspectives -- as well as the pedagogical structure of the seminar sessions themselves.",
    "I loved that this course incorporated literature, theory, and cultural artifacts. The short student presentations on cultural phenomena were very entertaining and gave useful background about the cultural context and inspiration for the novels we read. Since this course involved so much reading, I would have loved to have discussion questions or specific passages to focus on before class, so that I could be thinking in a more critical way about the works we read before class each week. Being able to prepare in this way before class would have made me more comfortable participating in class."

   "comments": [
    "Absolutely. See above and above",
    "Yes. I would recommend this course to anyone with an interest in French literature, regardless of his or her interests\/periods of specialization. The readings, which Prof Samuels makes very accessible, are hugely enjoyable and the course also serves as a kind of introduction to the literary theory of the past 60 years or so. I would also recommend this course to anyone with an interest in 19th-century European history.",
    "Absolutely",
    "I would recommend this course to other students. It was challenging and fun and enabled me to engage in a new way with canonical works."
