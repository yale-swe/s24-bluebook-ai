   "comments": [
    "No, it was too much work for this semester, with trying to pick a lab and do rotation work.",
    "A lot of work but you learn a lot of interesting things and learn how to critically read papers. Also, the term paper prepares you for Quals. i would recommend it to a diligent student.",
    "This is a course that discusses Eukaryotic biology with an emphasis on replication, DNA\/RNA repair, transcription and translation. Material highlights tools that were useful in uncovering the biochemical pathways that were discussed in the lecture such as EMSA, Western\/Northern Blots, IPs etc.I would recommend this course to anyone interested in eukaryotic RNA\/DNA or anyone who feels that their basic understanding of biochemical assays is lacking! I learned a lot.",
    "MCDB 743 focuses the processes required to maintain the integrity of the genome, transcribe appropriate genes and also regulate the expression of these genes as protein products. I would recommend this to another student because regardless of what area of biology or science you go into, if it in some way involves eukaryotic cells it is important to have a decent understanding of the mechanisms of genetic regulation. There is a decent amount of work that needs to be put into the class, but you get out what you put in which makes it worth the time and effort.",
    "If youare interested in biochemistry research and especially topics related to DNA repairs, RNA and protein degradation. You will find this course is very helpful in giving you a thorough introduction.",
    "Yes I would recommend this class to another student. It is basically an overview of all of the steps in the central dogma of biology as it pertains to the more complicated eukaryotic system.",
    "I thought this was a great class. It was challenging and there was more work involved than some other graduate classes, but I felt like I learned a lot and I appreciated the work because it helped me get more out of the class.",
    "I felt that this course was a thorough treatment of exactly what it says in the title. I would definitely recommend this class to a fellow student as I was quite pleased with both the format of the class and the information covered.",
    "Highly recommend, especially for learning biochemical experimental approaches.",
    "The class gives an overview of how cells are regulated going from DNA replication, to transcription, to protein translation, to how proteins are degraded. It is useful information if you are interested in how levels of proteins or RNA are regulated by a cell.I would absolutely recommend this class to another student, since I learned a lot about experimental design and how to communicate that design well.",
    "I would recommend. I learn a lot from this class.",
    "Yes: euks is useful for understanding the general biochemistry and molecular genetics of the central dogma and related topics. But somehow, it still feels like a gut class... ultimately it's minimally relevant to most MB&B students' future labs and theses.",

   "comments": [
    "I thought the final paper was a good idea, the proposal writing experience was definitely beneficial. The paper topics were interesting, but I am not really working on anything that pertains to the course material.",
    "Yes, it deepened my knowledge of genetics and of biochemical and genetic assays. It will be very helpful toward my research and qualifying.",
    "It was really helpful in learning biochemical techniques that I can now reasonably see myself using in my lab now that I really understand how they work!",
    "I would like to go into a genetics lab so this course was vital in providing information that will help me in future study. The experimental methods used will be especially important for use in the future.",
    "I am not interested in these topics and my future research has nothing to do with them. So in terms of knowledge, it help little, though it help me keep away from illiterate. But the general biochemical experiment design will be very useful for future research.",
    "I learned more about the processes in between replication, transcription, and translation like mRNA export and decay and proper splicing. They are the more interesting aspects that never really get covered.",
    "The course was a great review of topics I had covered in undergraduate and it was also a great supplement for the material that I had not really studied too much in the past. After taking the course, I feel more confident in my knowledge of molecular biology.",
    "Really increased my knowledge of biochemical experimental approaches. Will definitely influence my research and encourage me to consider biochemical experiments.",
    "I may not use much of what I learned in the class for my dissertation as far as subject area, but as far as research design and critical reading of the literature, this class was immensely helpful.",
    "The course broadened, rather than deepened, my knowledge of molecular biophysics and biochemistry. The course will likely add little practical or direct information for my research. Instead, the strategies for designing, understanding, and analyzing experiments in general have made me a better scientist.",
