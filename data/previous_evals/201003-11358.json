    "The course provides a lot of exposure to basic formal models and will force you to develop\/refine calculus and algebra skills. However, the class is not a review of how models are applied to the study of politics. It's a methods course.",
    "I would recommend it for anyone interested in diving right into formal modeling. Definitely takes some getting used to though and is challenging for those without a good mathematical background.",
    "I would recommend it. I think it is a good way to start a sequence on formal modeling. However, I would place less emphasis on the microeconomic content at the beginning of the course. In addition, the math camp should be longer, or students should be advised to take math lessons before the semester begins.",
    "It is an introduction to formal modeling. I would recommend it as an opportunity to learn about the basics of modeling."

   "comments": [
    "It has definitely improved my ability to think mathematically and exposed me to the basics of formal modeling, which is an important skill to develop in the study of political science. Ideally, this class will provide me with the basic building blocks needed to develop any formal models if I need one in my dissertation.",
    "I have a much greater appreciation for modeling, and understand its applicability to many questions within political science."
