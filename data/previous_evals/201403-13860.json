    "Laura won't be here next year, but I enjoyed the class, the reading, and getting to know the other students. My only suggestion for the class was that I wish it was more of a seminar (discussion) and less of a lecture (Laura and students would go over the paper reading for that week). It felt I was re-reading the material a second time instead of hearing what other students had to say.",
    "I do not know how to summarize it. I do not know what even was happening all semester long. What even",
    "Don't do it. The material should have been interesting, but it wasn't really. The professor is nice and wants to care... but this class was painful.",
    "I would definitely recommend it. The material is interesting and you learn ow to properly read an economics paper. The workload isn't too bad but the final paper is challenging since you have to write a proper economics paper with an original model and empirical approach.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class. It has to be one of the best seminars. Great professor, really interesting material, and manageable workload. Definitely my favorite class of the semester.",
    "I would highly recommend it. The subject matter itself is very interesting and applicable to real world. You get a solid background in social networks: how they work, what are their effects, how they can be analyzed etc. You also learn how to read scholarly economic articles and papers. You will definitely leave the class with much more knowledge, inspiration, and ideas than you came in.",
    "Interesting class in theory. Explore on your own time, don't take at Yale.",
    "Decent class - pretty interesting if you are specifically interested in the topic.",
    "This class was great. Reasonable amount of work, readings for each week were interesting, Prof. Schechter spent a huge amount of time helping us on our presentations and final papers, and the overall content of the class was fascinating. This is a great class to take if you're trying to improve your statistical paper reading skills without requiring too much econometrics work of your own."
