   "comments": [
    "ENG 011 is one of my hardest classes. I am intimidated every class, but I've learned so much. Take it if you want a challenge.",
    "It's an intensive study of Mr. Lincoln, with a good deal of focus on American slavery and the American Civil War. I would tell another student that, unless you have a relatively strong grasp on the history of the period 1850-1865, this might not be the best course for you. But for students with an interest in history, politics and writing this course does a great job of seamlessly weaving those together.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS. This has been, so far, the best class I have taken at Yale. I cannot imagine my Freshman year without it. TAKE THIS CLASS!!!!!!",
    "Yes, take this class if you want an utterly fascinating, totally comprehensive survey of Lincoln's writings...while at the same time getting a pretty good course in Civil War history. The class is very intense, and the grading is not easy at all, but you learn so, so much, and you really appreciate Lincoln's genius.",
    "An intense literary and historical study of the speeches and writings of Abraham Lincoln. I would absolutely recommend the course.",
    "Absolutely. Take it. Be prepared for the tons and tons of reading.",
    "Have you ever really wanted to begin to understand the genius behind the mythical and politically abused figure of Abraham Lincoln? Take this class. Explore the history, the politician, and the language of this legend.",
    "It doesn't say so on the syllabus, but there is an exam. I wish I had known that going in.",
    "If you want to read a lot of speeches and writings by an iconic American statesman, this is the course for you. The class demystifies the \"deification\" of Lincoln because you get an idea of his intents and motives throughout his career. Also, eighteen freshmen around a table talking with David Bromwich is a once in a lifetime experience, so take advantage of it.",
    "Very deep study of a very interesting man. I would recommend it if you intend to do the reading; if not, its kind of a waste and tough to get into. I don't mean all the reading; that would be impossible. But do some.",
    "I would strongly recommend the course for someone who is willing to do a serious amount of work. If you put in the effort you will get a tremendous amount out of the class.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course if it is offered again. It was challenging and well worth it. The course was arguably the best freshman seminar, based on my discussions with students from other seminars. Anyone who has a genuine interest in Abraham Lincoln as an individual and in the context of the decisions he made during the Civil War should attempt to take this course."
