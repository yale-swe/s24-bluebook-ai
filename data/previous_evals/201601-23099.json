   "comments": [
    "The reading load is heavy, so learn to summarize and absorb the most relevant and succinct points. The sections are the most interesting part of the course, so be sure to enroll in one even if you're taking the course credit\/D\/fail.",
    "Every Yale student should take this class. Take it Credit\/D or for a grade, take it now or take it later, take it with friends or alone, take it seriously or just to hear these lectures - just take it. This class reshaped the way I understand American history, politics, and government in so many ways. Professor Amar is exceptional and always provided new insight.",
    "This was an incredible course that I would recommend to anyone. Both the midterm and final have a take-home option that's great for Credit\/D\/Fail, or you can take the class for a grade and really have the chance to delve into issues and learn a lot about interesting cases and doctrine. Professor Amar's lectures were always interesting, and I appreciated his commentary and his providing historical background for the issues we were discussing. My section was simply the best section I've ever had at Yale: whether or not you are taking the class for a grade, you should absolutely sign up for a section.",
    "It's a legendary class. You know that already. I do think it's not as good as its rep might make it seem - Amar is very disorganized and he repeats the same few points in basically every lecture - but it's fascinating to learn about the Constitution from the best Con Law scholar in the nation.",
    "Really amazing class, but you get out of it what you put in. Relatively easy if you take it Cr\/D, but can be harder if you try to take it for a grade and shoot for the A-range. In any case, you'll learn an incredible amount about ConLaw and its importance in American democracy. Highly recommend!",
    "Lecture about constitutional law with a leading legal scholar. A lot of reading but you will realistically not get to everything. Good course for CR\/D. Open book exams and a short paper.",
    "Yes, only if you are willing to do the readings",
    "Con law is a really great class, especially if you're interested in law school. That said, it is a cr\/D MUST! Do NOT take this course for credit unless you want to spend hours and hours reading. Also, Amar is a bit aggressive with his opinions, but you still learn a lot.",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend this class, simply because I think that what we learned about the U.S. Constitution is imperative that all Yale students, or at least American ones, should know.",
    "Every single person living in or attending school in the United States must take this course or one like it. The cherry on top is that this one is taught by such an incredible professor and the peers surrounding you may very well be making such influential decisions or arguments as those discussed in class in the future. Incredibly important to understand the United States (and in a way, its global influence), and always relevant no matter what. TAKE IT!",
    "If you're interested in American legal history or sharpening your legal reasoning skills, definitely take this class for the privilege of learning from a brilliant constitutional scholar. The readings for the class are quite lengthy, but don't fear--the credit\/d\/fail option for the class is very doable if you don't want to take on the packed syllabus. Sections are optional, as is the research paper.",
    "I took this class credit\/d as a second semester senior, so my opinion is probably very different from most of the try-hard underclassmen who took this course. I will say that you get as much out of this course as you put in. I read 0 pages of Professor Amar's books but kept up with most of the case reading and I could follow the discussions well. That reminds me -- if you take a section be prepared to be surrounded with many eager underclassmen who are vying for the option to prove how much they know about law and how much they want to go to law school. While they are usually well-meaning this can sometimes be off-putting if are like me and a bit of a slacker. Just don't take a section if you want to avoid this (they're optional). This course is pretty much designed to be taken credit\/d -- no homework, optional section, and just two essay-based finals with a short paper (5 pages). I will say that it is very easy to slack off during lecture, so if you want to learn you should probably put away your laptop and listen to the words coming out of Professor Amar's mouth. He's a great lecturer and his lectures on American history and policy are really entertaining. You also get to hear some dope guest speakers because Professor Amar has some awesome connections -- we had Justice Breyer randomly pop in for a lecture and we got to ask him questions!",
    "A wonderful course",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. It was extremely interesting, whether or not you are interested in going to law school.",
    "While taking the class, I didn't like it that much but in hindsight this was probably one of the best classes I've taken at Yale. At first the class is super hard because you need to adjust to legal thinking and reasoning, but as the semester goes on and you get better at reasoning and the cases get more interesting, the class gets really good. Plus it makes you a more informed citizen. Take it. There are so many readings, but really you just need to read the cases and go to section. Definitely take a section.",
    "Great overview of the nation's constitutional history. You get to read all of the cases you heard about but never really understood. Tons and tons of reading, but not all of it is necessary.",
    "Don't take this class. Worst class of my semester. I found the lectures largely disorganized, hard to follow, and sometimes more focused on name dropping than on content. The class was incredibly frustrating. Without section, the key themes of the course would have been very difficult to understand.",
    "yes yes yes!!",
    "Interesting. Worth taking to see how you feel about law classes. Amar is a passionate lecturer, but not always easy to follow. Really easy Cr\/D class, on purpose.",
    "Yes, but not necessarily one of those must-take Yale classes everybody says it is (although I did cr\/d, so it probably would've been better if I had done all the work). The material is interesting and Amar is really into it, but the beginning of the class is much more exciting than the middle\/end, and it gets somewhat circuitous and lost (or at least it felt that way to me, someone who wasn't keeping up with the reading). Pretty easy: take-home, open-note midterm and final, and a 5-page paper.",
    "This is one of those classes that you simply must take while at Yale. I took it credit\/D as a second semester senior and it was a major highlight of my college experience. Take a section, credit\/D or not - the TAs are INCREDIBLE people teaching incredible material. It was awesome, I totally recommend it to any and everyone no matter your major or interest in pursuing law in the future. And Amar is a great lecturer so there's that too",
    "Yes take it if you're interested in law.",
    "Amar is great. Is a lot of work if taking for a letter grade but if not, really great CR\/D class. You will get a lot out of the lectures if you just come to them and pay attention. Will likely change you perspective on the US government and constitution. I did not do the section. Math major taking the class CR\/D. Amar even says its easy to take CR\/D",
    "Amazing lecture class; exams may seem daunting, but are always incredibly fun; really gets you thinking about things in a different way; Professor Amar is an incredibly compelling speaker and really distills the most important parts of the readings; thoroughly impressive and always helpful TAs; crucial class to take for anyone who wants to learn more about political science or public policy; definitely not limited to aspirant law students; would definitely recommend",
    "I would definitely recommend Conlaw to another student. Great class, lots of reading however. The substance of the course is extremely interesting.",
    "A fantastic course that I believe everyone should take, even if Credit\/D. You learn so much about American history, the structure of government, and the political system in general. Truly a unique experience.",
    "A great course for anyone interested in law or the history behind our Constitutional project. Each lecture is full of interesting information; Professor Amar has a very unique approach to Constitutional Law. You'd be amiss to skip taking this lecture because of a rumored difficult workload. It is worth the work if you take it for a letter and is an excellent Cr\/D\/Fail. If you take it, take it with a section.",
    "Awesome class for people interested in law or not. But even if you take it creditD try to do the readings and still go to lecture and section or you won't enjoy it to the same capacity. CR\/D just decreases the stress factor! Awesome class",
    "Great class! Take it even if you are vaguely interested in law or the US government. Professor Amar is obviously a stellar scholar, and most of his lectures were incredible, although his lecturing style is uniquely discursive and takes some time to get used to. The reading load is insane, but you don't really need to do the reading as long as you are very attentive to the content in lecture, go to section, and take perfect notes. The midterm and the final are intense but the open-note, open-book format is a life-saver. Overall, this class is unlike anything else you can take at Yale. Don't miss it!",
    "It's a great credit\/D class. Would recommend it as such. It helps you get an understanding of the constitution over time, but can be a little overwhelming!",
    "I came into the class with a deep background in US history and government (helpful but not necessary), and I still learned a lot and got a fresh perspective. Con Law gives you a new way of thinking and hones your interpretation and argumentation skills. My main complaint is that Amar sometimes rushed through cases because he went on tangents, but you will still learn a lot from this luminary, and the TFs will help you cover the important cases. Do read the casebook, do write the optional paper, and do take the in-class exams.",
    "Great Credit\/D, but tbh not that hard to take for a grade, shouldn't even have to take a section if you're a good writer. The guest speakers are incredible, we even heard from a supreme court justice!",
    "Quintessential Yale class that's worth taking if you're even only remotely interested in constitutional law. Really great Cr\/D class, but take a section regardless because it helps you get way more out of the class (without putting more work in, if you do Cr\/D). It's definitely possible and worth it to do for a grade, so don't let the amount of reading scare you too much.",
    "It's as much work as you want it to be, and lectures can be a little disorganized, so definitely find a good section.",
    "I would recommend this enough to say that if there is one course at Yale everyone should take, this is it.",
    "It's ok. I didn't love it.",
    "ConLaw is a great class, and you will learn more about the American Government in it than you will in any other class. Professor Amar is wonderful, and the TAs are all great and hugely accomplished. This is a great class to take.",
    "Do NOT recommend taking this course unless you can set aside the time for the reading. It is all worthwhile, but it IS a commitment.",
    "Good class!! Take it! Maybe CR\/ d if you don't want to do work.",
    "Insanely amazing class, whether or not you're interested in law school. Amar makes this class a true Yale classic, and for good reason. Meets, or even lives up to the hype. Take a section, even though they're not mandatory. As good as Amar is, it's nice to have a TA break down the material weekly, and Amar always picks super solid TA's. Optional 15 page paper means you can make this class as intense as you want it to be (Who would ever write a 15 page optional paper? Someone who wants a good rec for a top law school). Also great as a Cr\/D class, if you're into that.",
    "A good introductory course to constitutional law. The class did a really through job of explaining the process of constitutional thought and made its way from early american history to court cases in the 21st century. Really good class.",
    "This is a must-take Yale course. I would recommend it for both its value to an academic curriculum but also for its value in the life of students as citizens.",
    "This is a wonderful class and an essential part of a Yale education. If you have any interest in law school, take it for a grade. You will work harder and enjoy it more. If you will not be going to law school, take it for credit, but do the reading and pay attention. You will be rewarded. Definitely do the section. It was one of the best parts. But no matter what, take Constitutional Law with Akhil Amar.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to any Yale student, even if there was no previous interest in law.",
    "I'd recommend taking this class - it opens your eyes to a lot of things about how our country's legal system functions, and seem like great preparation for anyone interested in law",
    "The content is really interesting and Amar is engaging, if at times ramble-y. This is a very easy class credit-d and most, but not all of the TAs are very interesting. Take it only if you like the subject matter a lot.",
    "I would recommend this course, I think it's really useful to learn about constitutional law.",
    "I will preface this evaluation by noting that I already had an interest in constitutional law before taking this course, but what I really want to do is encourage you, dear reader and fellow student, IN THE LOUDEST DIGITAL VOICE THAT I CAN POSSIBLY SUMMON, to take \"Constitutional Law,\" whether or not you have any interest in law, politics, or American history. Obviously, I think the course will likely be easier and more broadly enjoyable if you do already like those subjects, but the course is genuinely meant for just about anyone and everyone. However, do not be mistaken: teaching to the masses, for Professor Amar, does not mean teaching to the lowest common denominator. He and the (extremely accomplished and well-equipped) teaching fellows expect a fair amount of critical thinking from their students -- though not necessarily too much work. You will read a lot of cases, or you won't, but either way you will have an opportunity to do well. The crown jewel of the course is, however, Professor Amar's lectures. He is a total character - brilliant, bizarre, and bellicose. There is perhaps no teacher at Yale who is more excited about his course material, and more fanatically dedicated to evangelizing about his personal vision of pluralistic American democracy. He beautifully and powerfully evinces his own personal, and quite esoteric, views about the Constitution, and given that he is by far the most prominent liberal originalist in the history of American judicial scholarship, you are likely in for quite a treat. Put simply, take the class, attend lecture, and if I'm wrong about you loving every minute of it like I did, then, well, sue me.",
    "I think that PLSC 233 01 is a great class for anyone because it gives you interesting insights into why the U.S. is what it is today and what your role and rights are as an individual living in the country. I did not Credit\/D the class, but a lot of weight in the class is placed upon two major tests (and the final is 60% unless you opt to do a 10-15 page research essay, in which case it becomes 40%), so you might consider starting the class Credit\/D if you want to try it out but do not want to stress too much about it. The class is also just pretty Credit\/D-friendly in general, which both the professor and TFs are aware of and supportive of. That being said, (based on the midterm and essay) it is possible to do well on a regular grading scale; I just found it personally stressful to go into a test knowing so much of my grade could be determined in one day.",
    "It's a great class but very heavy on the readings. It was great to take Credit\/D, although I wish I had spent more effort on it than I did! It was ultimately better to enjoy it than to fret about a B on a paper of final, though, so I'd suggest not taking it for credit!",
    "Con Law may not be for everyone. The reading may strike some people as dense and unenjoyable. But learning about the Constitution from Professor Amar is a great way to study American history, especially given his focus on the historical developments that shaped the Supreme Court's decisions. Con Law is not easy, but the workload really is not unmanageable. The reading picks up in the second half of the course. It's best to plan ahead if possible by doing some reading over spring break or previewing the readings each week.",
    "If you want to learn the values and history behind the American political system - take the class.",
    "I would say that constitutional law is a great opportunity for students to pick Akhil Amar's brain and see how he thinks. It is also a very intellectually stimulating introduction to a law course. I would strongly recommend this course to another student because the way Amar teaches constitutional law involves politics, history, and even elements of philosophy. It is truly an interdisciplinary class, even if it may seem niche.",
    "PLSC 233 is a great class to take, regardless of a student's interest. It is so important to increase our understanding of the government we live under.",
    "Prof. Amar is a really engaging lecturer who made me think about the material in new ways. He was really kind and approachable, offering Wednesday lunches and the opportunity to speak with him. I'm really happy I took this class my senior year. Take a section with Alexandra if you can!!",
    "Great lecture course.",
    "A fantastic class if you're interested in law, improving your reading\/writing skills, or just want to learn about the U.S. Constitution.",
    "This is one of those fundamentally Yale courses. But that's not necessarily a good thing. This class is lecture based with optional section, which is nice. Textbooks will cost you an arm and a leg, but you really only need two of the books (the case book and The Law of the Land, both written by the professor). These lectures move very fast, covering a lot of material that you probably haven't heard before without a lot of explanation, and the course is graded on just three things: a midterm, a reaction paper, and a final. Based on the sheer amount of material you have to digest, I would recommend taking this course Credit\/D. And ultimately I would recommend it. It's a lot of work and worry, but you'll learn a lot about Constitutional law, which is something everyone should know."
