    "A must take for anyone looking to take a fun, useful English course without the long, dull readings and tedious essay assignments. The course is about climate change so naturally you aren't going to find many conservative opinions on the topic being thrown around, but the class isn't about the truth of climate change. It's about how and why certain ways of framing the issue are successful and why others are not. This is why the course was cool. The readings are short and varied, coming from scientific journals, books, magazines, newspaper editorials, and online resources. It made me a better writer without having to write massive essays (there are a bunch of little response assignments and three 5-7 page papers and that's it). And it made me think about who I was writing to and what sorts of frames and rhetoric would best suite my goal. Overall, a very low-stress class that I ended up appreciating more than I thought I would. Would definitely recommend it.",
    "ENG 121 05 is an english course geared towards educating students about the methods used in social science writing, mainly about climate change. I would recommend it because even if you are not too concerned about climate change, your writing will improve and you will learn a lot about mainstream writing.",
    "I really enjoyed this class! I learned so much from the professor, the readings, the assignments, and from my classmates. I was lucky to be in a class with a mix of students from different backgrounds and knowledge about climate change. The class taught me to see climate change in a different light, and I have to say that it also made me more aware of the issue. The assignments were thought-provoking and all in all, taking this class was one of the best decisions I have made at Yale.",
    "A good course you can take after taking ENG 114 or 120 if you want to further develop your writing skills."
