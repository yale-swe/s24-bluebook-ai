   "comments": [
    "The class is great, but the section could be a hit or miss, depending on your TA. I'd take the class even if you are semi- interested in the class. Studying is necessary though, it's not a gut.",
    "I would summarize this course by saying: its a fair amount of work, very interesting, and a well taught course. There is a fair amount of reading (two full sociological studies per week), as well as a fast paced lecture where missing it is not recommended, but I am happy I kept the course and didnt drop it like a few of my friends did.I would definitely recommend this course to anyone interested in sociology as well as anyone just looking for a very interesting course that studies the way people behave.",
    "Yes was very interesting",
    "No; I took it because it was supposed to be a \"gut class\" and now I'm left with a C+ before a final that's worth 50% of my grade. For the exam, I'm expected to memorize a good twenty hours worth of lectures and readings so I can regurgitate them for Professor Smith. It's absolutely ludicrous and I highly recommend you steer away from this course and Professor.",
    "Solid introductory course of criminology over time. The usual - take notes, midterm, paper, final. The material is lengthy so you will need to devote a day or two for studying. The papers are based on interesting topics and your grade is reflective of how uptight the assigned TA is. Choose wisely. Discussion is standard. Fulfill the requirements and dedicate time to studying and you will come away learning a lot of material that perhaps you had never seriously contemplated.",
    "Credit\/D yes, otherwise be prepared to learn a lot and memorize a lot. The curve is epic for credit\/d tho",
    "This is a great class to take credit\/D because the material is interesting and you can get away with just going through the motions. Taking it for a grade was slightly stressful since the grading scale is so different and the assignments are graded pretty hard. It would have been much less stressful when taking the very generic tests to know that all I had to do was pass it.",
    "If you need an easy Cr\/D, go for it, but I wasn't that impressed.",
    "Yes, I took it Credit\/D but even if I didn't it wasn't bad.",
    "This is a horrific course. While the concept seems as if it would be interesting, I assure you the way it is taught and tested, this material becomes anything but. Professor Smith speeds through his lectures, clicking through his sparse powerpoint slides only after he has made his point. He doesn't post the slides, and talks so fast that you will manage to take down optimistically 1\/4 of the information you need to. This becomes a problem on the midterm, which is unreasonable hard and squeezes a huge amount of writing into 50 minutes. You'll think you did great until you realize that you aren't graded on how much you know for each question, but rather on if you hit the key words Professor Smith wanted but that you probably didn't manage to write down during lecture and were never subsequently informed you should know. The final is the midterm on steroids, meaning you should begin doing hand exercises now, so as to avoid debilitating hand cramps that will break your body as Professor Smith broke your spirit.Kidding, but not really. Just don't take this course.",
    "Definitely shop it before you set your mind do doing it. It is interesting, but could be made more interesting if more of the fascinating relevant subject matter were explored. The course is not that demanding.",
    "Yes I would recommend this class. It's extremely interesting, and applicable to everyday life. Professor Smith is a great lecturer and is engaging.",
    "yes if you need another course to take credit\/D or need it for a soc credit or if you want to be a soc major",
    "Yes, take this course, but not as a gut. The lecture aren't posted online, and even if they were, they have minimal information on them. If you mis a class you miss A LOT....each lecture is completely packed. 2 exams and a paper isn't so bad compared to other classes, and the materials and the readings are really actually fun to get through. Don't really need to do all the readings, just get the gist of each one.",
    "We have two readings a week that pertain to the material we cover in class that week. There is a midterm and a final in addition to one written assignment. The work is minimal but the material isn't very interesting. We learn about a bunch of theories and the tests were just based on rote memorization.",
    "I would recommend this class, it's interesting. That being said, it is important to note that this is not an easy class, although there isn't a lot of work throughout the semester it's important to not let that fool you. The tests are challenging and require A LOT of studying.",
    "The course was good and I definitely learned a lot, but it was sometimes dull in it mostly involved memorizing a lot of people\/dates. There didn't seem to be a lot of opportunities for critical thinking. Prof Smith was hilarious and had a really great sense of humor (and Australian accent!). I think the structure of the course was strange in that it was pure memorization, but I think lectures were really engaging and fun.",
    "An interesting surface look at crime and deviance. It is an interesting class but it is not particularly deep.",
    "I definitely recommend this class, a very easy A if you do not procrastinate and are very engaged. Very though provoking, and you will definitely come out of this course enlightened.",
    "I would recommend this class as a credit\/d\/fail option. The curve is pretty steep.",
    "super-interesting, just a lotta jocks",
    "SOCY 141 is an interesting lecture about the major theoretical work in sociology and criminology. It can be very interesting, but only if you are actually interested in the subject matter.",
    "The course is a lot of memorization for tests, but you do learn a lot about criminal theory. I also suggest submitting a rough draft for the one paper, because its worth a substantial portion of your grade and you dont want to tank it.",
    "I would highly highly recommend this class to any prospective student.",
    "This lecture is not too much work 2 readings per week for mandatory section. However, tests are very hard and require a lot of studying. Pr. Smith is the man! He's funny and teaches the class lightly. His style is kind of unique so shop before you commit. The powerpoints tell you nothing so you must attend class or get notes from another student.",
    "I would recommend this course because it is not demanding in terms of work until the midterm and finals where a lot of memorization is needed.",
    "If you are interested in sociology, it is a good class to take because of the interesting material. I enjoyed the articles we had to read as well. The only work is 2 articles per week, one big paper, a midterm and a final. The tests are pretty difficult though and take a LOT of studying to do well, so be prepared.",
    "This is not an easy course because it does require attention to detail and factual memorization. However, the material is interesting. In my case, I took it with a contemporary theory class, which worked well together. Good lecture notes are crucial.",
    "A pretty chill class to take in general, especially if you have a moderate interest in the subject matter.",
    "I very much recommend this course. There is never a boring day in class, both in terms of the material and how Professor Smith teaches it. It's a class that a lot of people aren't going to need for a career or a major, but the material is still fascinating and at least interesting or useful information to know about society's perceptions and problems with crime and deviance. The work load only consists of reading two primary articles a week, but it would be hard to catch up if you fall behind in this respect: the articles are uually between 15 and 30 pages.",
    "yes! It's not much work and I learned a lot."
