   "comments": [
    "structure and content of assignments",
    "The grading. Professor Tomlin would make up criteria after the fact, and how folks did from week to week, and even what assignments would end up counted in grades, seemed quite random. For example, Professor Tomlin decided toward the end to grade in three segments: the first half of the course, the second half of the course, and the final project, and then drop one of the three. Students who maybe averaged HP within both halves and then got an H on the final project then did worse than students who maybe had a P in the first half, an H in the second half, and an H on the final, even though those two performance records would otherwise be about equal. I also found the curve really discouraging. For example, the brainteasers, which were supposedly extra credit, really became required for folks who wanted high grades because of the eventual allocation of semester grades according to a predetermined distribution, further expanding the already large course workload. The inherent competition in curves, too, just seems very against FES culture. One of my favorite aspects of FES is how non-competitive it is. I'd rather there be objective standards for what constitutes an H, HP, etc., even strict and hard-to-reach standards, than a curve.",
    "Grading rules and parameters should be established before each homework is assigned. In that sense people would have a clear knowledge on how they are going to be graduated.",
    "Professor Tomlin's grading system is opaque, and it is difficult to know what criteria he will use to assess students work until after the work is finished. Also, we received very little instruction on creating dynamic models, which we needed to know in order to complete the final assignment. While being able to use model builder is helpful, it is my impression that it is rarely used by professionals because model builder is clunky and similar functions can be preformed more easily using Python programming language.",
    "I would like to see this course taught in a computer lab.",
    "The expectations and workload for the class should be re-evaluated. Students were often not taught the skills and concepts necessary to perform well on homework assignments. Homework grading seemed entirely arbitrary, and students were not made aware of the grading structure prior to submitting assignments.",
    "None. Workload is too heavy?",
    "Towards the end of the course the lectures on modeling did not seem to be particularly well related to the homework, which led to lots of frustration in completing the project.",
    "A lot of the time I did not understand what the instructor was talking about. It might be helpful to use slides with the examples drawn out. Also, it would be nice to tell students early in the course how heavy the course load is.",
    "More transparency regarding grading rubric for weekly hw assignments - the grading rubric was sent AFTER assignments were due to explain grades, but this doesn't help students who would like more guidance on what is being asked of them for each assignment.",
    "Sometimes the homework assignments were frustrating in that the instructions were vague.",
    "Too much psychological messing with.",
    "Clarity at the beginning of the semester concerning how the course will be graded - and then proper follow-through. More tool-use practice time during class. Staying with what we are told will be done, or giving us some choice in the switches. Not dropping assigned group projects from the grading. Not dropping some of the most challenging weeks from the grading without some input from the class. What a painful waste of time and effort. Not wasting significant portions of two classes outlining how grading will be done -- then failing to follow through on the outline. The software itself is clunky, slightly buggy, non-intuitive. It is state-of-the art, but it should be better.",
    "The assignments need to be related to the environment. Dana tries to make everything ridiculously hard- like a puzzle that must be solved. In that attempt, he misses the fact that these assignments need to be based on real issues within the environmental field.",
    "there need to be incorporation of group work from start to end of the course If Dana could record his lecturer they would be helpful for review",
