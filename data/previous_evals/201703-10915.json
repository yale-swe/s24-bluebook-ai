   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths - Numericals based problem set and exam means a student learns much more than just definitions and proofs Weaknesses - Classes could cover a bit of application",
    "The course is great.",
    "I really liked this course,",
    "Better textbooks should be provided in both parts of the course. For the first part I felt that MWG was not the most appropriate textbook. MWG would be great for the second part of the course. The book used in the second part is very difficult to read because of its notation and its many typos.",
    "The strength is that the lectures cover both very individual factors (e.g. choice theory) and macro analyses (e.g. general equilibrium theory) that provide not only solid analytical tools but also chances to think about assumptions behind economic analysis and whether\/how\/when they are appropriate or need modifications. This will help me conduct researches in subsequent years.",
    "The homeworks were very useful and the exams felt reasonable. It would be useful if Truman used slides or gave out lecture notes.",
    "It would be helpful to more explicitly discuss approaches to utility maximization and maximization of welfare functions when preferences are not differentiable. Also, one lecture should be reserved for working out different types of insurance problems on the board.",
    "Mira is an amazing professor. Truman is not.",
    "Strengths: good instruction from professors and TAs. Allen Vong was excellent.",
    "A strength was the instructors and their concern for student learning. One weakness was its engagement and requirements to work through some of the perhaps less practical facets, such as certain derivations.",
    "Coherent calculum.",
    "2nd quarter very clear; first quarter very well taught, great applications",
    "Professor Bewley is an excellent instructor but sometimes he could be difficult to understand because he speaks so quietly. Additionally, I would have really appreciated a PowerPoint to accompany the lectures since it could get difficult to follow the lecture while drawing the appropriate graphs and writing down notes."
