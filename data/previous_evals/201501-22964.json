   "comments": [
    "Would recommend to a friend (provided you like poetry and are interested in formal features)! I found this to be a very fun class.",
    "Do it if you love poems and music, and you want to explore the mechanisms behind their beauty.",
    "In each unit, we read and discussed poems that Professor Glaser assigned where it was worth paying special attention to a specific poetic device such as meter, enjambment, rhyme, etc. The workload was reasonable, with 3 short 1-page exercises, a 10-page midterm paper, and a 15-page final paper\/project. We analyzed lyrics in the final weeks of the course, and it was refreshing to perform poetic analysis on blues lyrics and hip-hop tracks like Kanye West and Kendrick Lamar. If you like close reading and want to study how formal characteristics function in poetry, take this course!",
    "You need to take it if you want to read poetry.",
    "This course has been extremely helpful for filling in the gaps in my knowledge and appreciation of poetry. We studied a lot of different styles of poetry, and looked closely at some key examples of different poetic forms. It has greatly enhanced my understanding of English literature. Definitely take it if you want to love poetry more.",
    "I would recommend this class, with all enthusiasm, to readers and writers of poetry.",
    "A cool class surveying poetic form - beginning with reviews of rhyme and meter and formal structures and then moving on to see how those concepts work in poetry through the ages, song lyrics, rap music. Very light workload, but read the poems to participate in discussion. Fun and interesting. Professor Glaser is super super passionate."
