    "In the class, I gained valuable knowledge about how to properly administer the SCID-5. Going through the SCID module-by-module, and becoming familiar with diagnostic criteria allowed me to become more fluid in my administration of the SCID, as well as become more aware of inconsistencies and other information that will lead to further exploration. Despite being a structured interview, the administration of the SCID is very nuanced, and Dr. O'Brien is very effective at teaching us about these intricacies. This course taught us to become aware not only of our clients' words about their symptoms, but to also pick up on their non-verbal cues, behavior during the interview, and other subtle details. Importantly, I also learned how to handle a suicidal patient and the proper protocol for ensuring their safety. Because of the final project, I now know which mistakes to avoid during a SCID, how to write a clear, concise history report, and how to present this information to a meeting of other professional psychologists. I now feel more competent and assured in my interview skills",
    "We gained an in-depth knowledge of SCID interviewing and various forms of psychopathology and, through Mary and Hannah's rigorous, detailed feedback on our reports and mock SCIDs, were able to refine our clinical interviewing and report writing skills.",

   "comments": [
    "This construction of this course, as well as its alignment with Advanced Psychopathology, allowed for a deeper understanding of DSM-5 criteria for each of the major modules in the SCID-5. The final project, which was a mock SCID and history report, allowed us to apply what we've learned in class into a realistic scenario. Because this course requires us to work with a client whose symptoms were and personality were unknown to us before the interview, we were effectively prepared to administer our first intakes at the clinic. One weakness of the course is that I wish it were longer. Because we will be administering intakes first, for the first semester, I think it makes more sense to have the SCID lab be an hour and fifty minutes and Intro to Psychotherapy be an hour and a half. Class was always pressed for time, which left many lingering questions to which we sometimes were unable to return.",
    "This class was fantastic and structured so thoughtfully and purposefully. It was a great idea to have it linked up to Jutta's course and the tandem learning across these two courses was really effective. At times, I felt like this course should be longer than it was because it often seemed like we were running out of time at the end. Also, I know it's tough to end courses on time when there is so much to discuss, but I often had to schedule lab meetings\/assessments right after the class and it was tough that it would run over by an average of about 10 minutes. It would be totally fine to extend the class to be longer, as long as this was the expectation. Also, I felt like we could have been better prepared for the first Super Mom report, although this lack of explicit preparation pushed us to learn a lot on our own."
