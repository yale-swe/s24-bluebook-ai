    "A good course, but not GREAT. Lots of the readings concern how power works in our society and the \"consequences of modernity\" i.e. critical examinations of the institutions which characterize modern life. I would say, take it! Eyerman is very very nice, if not very skilled at leading discussions. 2 papers, 2 5pg essays (midterm) and then a 10 page \"research\" paper at the end. Weekly 1-3pg responses, but these can be very breezy and informal (they basically aren't graded. You just get a 3\/3 for having done at least an okay job.) Can be a lot of reading, but you dont absolutely need to do all of it. Though, you should. It's interesting stuff!",
    "shows the different dedevelopments in theory since the modern wra. Take if you're a sociology major",
    "I would definitely recommend this class- even if you aren't a socy major",
    "Great if you're interested in sociology!",
    "basic theory class for sociology, great if you're interested jn the readings",
    "A great course with thought provoking readings and a very cool prof. I think a lot of it is what you make of it -- if you're interested in sociology, social theory, and discussing major events and trends of the past and present through different social lenses, and especially if you can take the time to really deeply read the books, you'll have a great experience with this class."
