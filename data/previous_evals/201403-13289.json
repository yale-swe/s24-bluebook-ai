   "comments": [
    "Yes I would. The course features many extensive readings, which must be read or participation in the class will be extremely difficult. It forces rigid time management, which is difficult at first but becomes easier as the semester progresses.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class to anyone, regardless of interest level in history. Professor Echeverri really helps to ease the transition from high school to college; her expectations are high, but she is there as a guiding figure the whole way through. The seminar class environment works very well, and you'll often find you're learning as much from other students as you are from the professor - that being said, you should take care to do all the readings and weekly comments so as not to get left behind in discussion. Overall, this course defined my first semester, so I would absolutely advocate for everyone to give it a try.",
    "You definitely get out of it what you put in!",
    "If you enjoy history and more specifically american history, definitely take this course.",
    "For a student interested in history this course is likely to be his or her favorite one. Interesting topics and excellent sources for research. Learned to write effective papers analyzing historical sources.",
    "Much of the work done in this class will be preparing for class discussions. Although it is possible to get by without doing the readings, you're wasting your time and that of your classmates if you choose to do so. Ms. Echeverri always manages to choose very interesting sources and scholarly articles, and you will come away with an appreciation for Latin American history."
