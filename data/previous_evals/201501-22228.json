    "If you're an HSHM major, this class is really core and such a great foundation for other History of Science material. Prof Bertucci does a great job to really complicate the scientific revolution, and her lectures are super nuanced and interesting. I love her excitement over Yale's resources, and she takes full advantage of it - we went to Beinecke several times and the Peabody once to look at some really incredible stuff. Also, this class is really different than other history and HSHM classes I've taken. It feels like you're entering this secret, underground world - you talk a lot about alchemy, for example, and the changing nature of authority, experience, observation, illustration, and the changing relationship between the artificial and the natural world. HOWEVER: the material is very very white and western. I know this is European history, but still - I would have liked to talk more about women, people of color, and not just about the aristocracy.",
    "HIST 236 was a fun course, but not a gut. It offered a good introduction to the 1500-1700 time period in Europe with a focus on the scientific developments of the time. The course's main themes were the evolution of knowledge, the authority of knowledge, the scientific process, social status as a tool in science, and the icons of the Scientific Revolution. Overall, it was a good experience, though not thrilling. I thought it could have been improved by being made more explicit in its themes, while at the same time going more in depth with the characters of the Scientific Revolution. Some of the course's topics felt vague. With regard to the teaching, Professor Bertucci is clearly intelligent and knows a lot about the Scientific Revolution. She is good at stringing together a meaningful narrative, but at times she seems to ramble, and then go over important points very quickly. Her power points are often filled with typos, and sometimes feel like they were thrown together. Overall, she is an enjoyable lecturer, but some people find her accent difficult to understand, and at some times the course was boring. I would recommend the course to people with a genuine interest in the Scientific Revolution or history in general. Otherwise, I would lean towards other courses.",
    "I would recommend the course to anyone that was interested in the scientific revolution - and definitely recommend to science majors that want to fill in a humanities credit - really shows how far we've come in science in the last 600 years",
    "Take the course. The grading is fine, especially on essays. The workload is low, especially later int he semester.",
    "I would recommend it, just keep up with the material, don't leave it to the last minute. Readings aren't necessary for the exams.",
    "Take the class. Not a hard HSHM class with not too much work",
    "This course is a great starting point for anyone interested in HSHM. The readings are usually manageable, although most of them can be skimmed. The two books are quite useful in understanding the material, so I would suggest buying and reading them. The writing workload is also manageable, and the midterm and final are quite easy as long as you've attended the lectures. This class is really interesting because it will teach you about how we came to understand the practice of science as we do today. It's not just about the lives of the famous geniuses typically associated with the history of science - the course will teach you how to think about and assess changing trends in how people thought about experiments, scientific authority, the relationship of religion and science, and many other important factors in the history of science.",
    "The material is awesome. the readings are interesting.",
    "Covers all major people, places and innovations within the scientific revolution in an organized way",
    "HSHM 226 was an interesting course that changed my perspective on the scientific revolution and how knowledge is understood and passed on. Lectures were incredibly interesting, though not always easy to take notes on. TAs were great at answering questions and explaining the more difficult concepts.",
    "I would definitely recommend it! An extremely fascinating history of \"ways of knowing\" in Europe, from alchemy to the first experimental laboratories.",
    "Keep with the major themes and the important images, since they will be key in your success on the exam and the course in general. Offers a new perspective on the Scientific Revolution",
    "Scientific Revolution was an excellent course. Professor Bertucci really cares about preparing great lectures, and it shows. She is really dedicated to the course material and ensuring that students get a lot out of the course. The object essay, which requires you to visit a Yale collection and study a historical object from the time period, was an excellent supplement to the course material. A great Hu credit for anyone who's looking around for one.",
    "It was pretty interesting for a preindustrial European credit. I'd never taken an HSHM class before--and its a little different. I'd recommend.",
    "Fantastic material taught brilliantly by the superb professor Bertucci! If you like this stuff, just take this course. Workload: 2 short reading response papers, 1 object essay (great fun!), a midterm and a final (IDs and essays). Lovely class visits to Beinecke and Peabody--you'll get to see all the amazing things Yale has!",
    "I would recommend SciRev in a heartbeat. It alone made me decide to become a HSHM major. Extremely interesting thoughts on revisionism, history of science, and the development of knowledge over time.",
    "The Scientific Revolution reviews the history of science during the Scientific Revolution centuries (1300-1700) in an engaging way. It dispels popular misconceptions that surround the subject to convey the reality that the achievements in science were not a linear progression.",
    "I recommend this class if you think you are interested in the history of science during the 16th and 17th century. I found the content of this class interesting! I really learned a lot about a various 16-17th century scientific ideas and about great thinkers and philosophers. I liked the fact that we discusses the importance of images and numerous frontispiece to better understand the different ways of gaining knowledge. Professor Bertucci kept the lectures super entertaining. She was also very nice and knowledgeable. I can't really see any weaknesses in the class. Even section was also a great addition to the lectures. I thought my TA did an amazing job of providing us with clarification when we had questions. The lectures are usually full of important information, so it is very important to attend lecture.",
    "Take this course if you are interested in the time period or if you are just looking for one of those unique Yale courses.",
    "This is a great course! Very interesting, manageable workload. I learned a lot while writing the essays.",
    "I am a science major who had never taken a history class before and I thought this class was one of the best I'd taken at Yale. The class traces the evolution of how natural knowledge is gathered and applied - you will question the aptness of the term \"Scientific Revolution\" by the end of the semester! The responses and essay were not too much work and the midterm and final were both very fair. Take this class! You will get a lot out of it, science major or not.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS!!!! You learn so much and this course really changes the way you think about the \"Scientific Revolution.\" Through the past, we understand how we go to the present of institutionalize research and inductive reasoning. We covered from Da Vinci to Newton, so a lot of information but worth it if you're interested in science and history.",
    "Great course that gives a broad overview of Renaissance history that I have found myself applying and relating to so many other things that I have encountered such as museums. This course also gives a wonderful opportunity to engage in multiple primary sources. (Charlotte is a wonderful TF!)"
