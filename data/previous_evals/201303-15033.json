    "Yes I would recommend it but I don't know any other students who would need Classical Ethiopic since we've already taken it.",
    "SMTC 542 teaches the fundamental grammar and vocabulary to understand texts of Classical Ethiopic.",
    "Intro to Classical Ethiopic, in one semester, teaches the syllabary language of Ge'ez and the fundamental grammar so that one may begin reading texts after one semester. I would definitely recommend, mainly because Ge'ez is a cool language and alphabet to know, but also because the class was a good use of my time.",
    "It is a fun, chill, and exciting class. It's amazing at how fast one can grasp the info if one puts in the time!",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class to another student. It is an important language for those interested in certain fields."
