   "comments": [
    "This course really helped me learn and become comfortable with Spanish at the L1 and L2 levels. I remember the majority of the vocabulary and nearly all of the grammar from the textbook, have a general sense of various Hispanic cultures (including Spanish texts such as Don Quijote) and between in-class practice and office hours, my fluency in Spanish, while nowhere near perfect, has improved greatly. I believe that with additional studying on my own, and practice with the Spanish teacher (who is enthusiastic about working with all of her students), I could achieve mastery of the entirety of L1 and L2 content.",
    "I have grown in my Spanish abilities immensely. I feel much more capable and confident in my availability to speak in everyday conversations in Spanish.",
    "I was able to advance my Spanish a lot by taking this course. You start from the basics, but you gain a very strong foundation for the basics with this class. The Professor is also incredible and this is the most I have advanced in Spanish ever. The Professor is super nice and very helpful.",
    "I learned a great deal about the fundamentals of Spanish grammar and vocabulary, and I improved my speaking, reading, and writing skills greatly.",
    "Definitely got a better grasp on grammar and writing. Your speaking skills definitely improve because of the volume of time you speak Spanish in the class and interact with partners. You also get a basic understanding of Spanish culture and current events in Spanish speaking countries. Overall, this is a pretty good and comprehensive beginning language course."

   "comments": [
    "The Spanish-only environment and the instructor's ability to speak at a level high enough for us to learn new words, but not so high that her students fail to comprehend what she's saying, creates an immersive but unintimidating environment, fostering an excellent learning experience. The Supersite assignments are quite helpful, though I feel obligated to note that the instructions for the online assignments are, at times, unclear, and the machine-grading is imperfect. While my instructor has enthusiastically expressed her willingness to regrade the machine-graded assignments, I still felt bad always having to make such a request; thus, my Supersite grade is perhaps a bit lower than it should've been (not by much, but this is still one area of the course that could potentially be improved).",
    "This class was extremely strong. You learn a lot of Spanish in a quick amount of time, but you learn the Spanish well. I have dramatically improved my Spanish in this course. The Professor is extremely helpful and so kind in helping every student improve their Spanish and she teaches Spanish very well.",
    "The only weakness is also the course's greatest strength: the time commitment. We spend so much time in the classroom, as well as doing homework outside of class. But this commitment is the only reason I feel as good about my Spanish as I currently do."

   "comments": [
    "Yes, with an important caveat: you must either have previous experience learning Spanish or be especially enthusiastic about learning the language. Preferably both. Spending two hours in class, Monday through Friday, learning a language isn't easy, and that's not counting the roughly two hours each night of homework. The instructor did her best to make it manageable - don't get me wrong - but two hours a day is tough no matter what (I don't know how I would've survived with anyone other than Profesora Sab). If you previously studied Spanish, but forgot it, it may come back to you, as it did for me, so starting out in intensive is not a bad idea. Just know that you'll need the stamina to get through each class - two hours a day, five days a week, fourteen weeks a semester. If you think you can get through it, and if Profesora Sab teaches the class, then by all means, take it. But be prepared for a class that is both very difficult and very rewarding.",
    "Yes!",
    "Yes, if you dramatically want to improve your Spanish because you know some Spanish but not much or just coming out of high school Spanish, this is a wonderful course to greatly improve your Spanish and take it to the next level. The Professor is also amazing and super helpful every step of the way. It is a lot of work, but well work the work if you want to improve your Spanish.",
    "I would recommend this course to a student familiar with basic Spanish set on putting in a lot of effort to improve.",
    "I would recommend this course to any student that has had a bit of background in the past (whether high school or middle school). This course would be on the more difficult side for an individual with absolutely no experience with Spanish because it is so fast paced."
