    "Strengths: we can get access to different areas in microbial pathogenesis, especially ecology and structure, which are somewhat unfamiliar to me. Weaknesses: the knowledge can be more organized, and discussion can be more engaging.",
    "I really liked the format of the course, and how we alternated between lectures and paper discussions. It was great being able to learn a little about all the professors' research interests. I found the idea that the grade was almost entirely based on the final exam a little daunting, especially when we had no feedback on our paper summaries throughout the semester. Overall, I really enjoyed the course - my only (small) issue was that the reading assignments were rarely distributed as far in advance of the deadline as we were told they would be at the beginning of the semester (so that we often only had one day to get it done) - but it was still do-able."
