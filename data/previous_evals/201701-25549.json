   "question_text": "What knowledge, skills, and insights did you develop by taking this course?",
   "comments": [
    "This course was a survey, so the skills were more broad then deep. I learned to compare and contrast multiple academic articles on individual research topics, and to pick out themes that provided a comprehensive understanding of ethics and climate change.",
    "I developed knowledge of many of the ethical problems that have been presented as relevant to the debate on climate change, as well as some proposed solutions and how they intersect with these concepts philosophically and practically. I can now reliably formulate a framework within which I can try to understand various policy interventions in the environmental field.",
    "I really learned how to read all kinds of arguments (science papers, theory, philosophy, and more) and look at the connections between different ideas.",
    "I learned all about climate change from this class and became more conscious of my impact on the environment. Through the writing assignments I learned how to better analyze the readings I had done and incorporate them into my thoughts and writing.",
    "I had very little background knowledge about climate change and the economic and philosophical problems behind it before taking this class. The class presented a good overview of modern discussion of climate change and the challenges it presents.",
    "I gained insights about the various ethical principles that must be considered when making climate change policy or when discussing climate change mitigation and adaptation approaches. In particular, it was interesting to use philosophical theory to make better judgements on how burdens and responsibilities should be distributed when it comes to climate change.",
    "This course provides the foundation for developing an ethical framework from which the issue of climate change can be analyzed. As a student with no background in philosophy prior to this course, evaluating the various components of climate change from an ethical perspective completely changed how I think about the issue altogether."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "strengths: nice, broad range of topics. This keeps the course interesting, avoiding repetition. weaknesses: possibility for low student participation or avoiding doing the reading. It would be helpful, perhaps, to have quizzes or a few, brief reading responses. Or, maybe student presentations.",
    "Great course, the only thing I would like to see more of is class discussion. I think maybe some discussion questions for students to mull over before class would be a good way to make sure discussion is steered towards the areas it needs to go.",
    "This course was so well organized and the readings were always relevant and interesting. In class discussions were super active.",
    "The professor was extremely engaging and enthusiastic about the subject. The lecture slides were very informative and well organized and the readings were interesting. I thought the workload was very reasonable and manageable and the class discussions were very though provoking. I see no weaknesses with this class.",
    "The course was organized very well with each week featuring a different topic within the larger framework of climate change discussion. My one problem with the course was that it would have been nice to have someone in the class who didn't totally agree with everything we were saying. I think everyone (or at least the majority) came into the class believing that climate change was a serious problem that should be mitigated. It would have been useful to encounter some of the resistance to climate change that happens outside the classroom. I felt like we were discussing how to convince people to mitigate climate change without having to actually try and convince people.",
    "The class style was half seminar, half lecture. Professor Sayegh's lectures and slides, while interesting, could sometimes be disorganized. The normative framework he kept alluding to and referencing would have been made clearer if a primer on philosophy had been given at the beginning of the course. Because of the varied backgrounds of all the students, it was difficult for students without as much philosophical background to understand the more theoretical readings. However, this course was extremely strong in that it allowed me to think about climate change in a multifaceted way, taking many different aspects into consideration. The class discussions were always very lively and involved, and were my favorite part of the course. As a future recommendation, I would recommend that the course be even more discussion based, with a focus on getting students with many different view points and perspectives, like we had this year.",
    "The course is incredible in that it is able to cover so many of the intricacies that comprise the climate change issue, in addition to considering the morality of such factors. The only improvement I could think to make is to spend a short period of time covering the aspects of philosophy necessary for the discussions in this course, or perhaps giving out a suggested reading list in the beginning of the term that provides a basic understanding of the fundamental ethical concepts. Being that this course is listed under the Political Science department, it should be considered that students may have little to no knowledge of philosophy prior to the course."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "Absolutely! The material is engaging and offers a foundation in philosophy and how it relates to the ethics of climate change.",
    "I would recommend this class with the proviso that it is what you make of it. It is an easy class in terms of workload, but if one wants to learn about the topics involved it's a terrific class to get credit for investigating a VERY important subject matter.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course, I had a blast. It was definitely my favorite of the semester.",
    "I loved this course so much - it really touched on all sides of climate change from science to ethics to policy.",
    "Yes, I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this class to another student. It was great!",
    "I would recommend this course to philosophy and political science students alike. Even if you have no background in thinking about climate change, this course serves as a great introduction while simultaneously prompting deep thought and discussion about climate change.",
    "Yes, if you are at all interested in climate change or the environment, I would recommend this class. Professor Sayegh is a dynamic and interesting lecturer, and is very passionate about his work. You will read economic, philosophical, and political articles about ethical approaches to climate change, and if your class is good you will have many very interesting discussions. Be prepared to read and be confused by some philosophical theory if you don't come from that background, but overall don't be daunted, because this class is worth the effort and time. Professor Sayegh truly pushes you to consider your own role in the fight against climate change and put it on paper, something that is very powerful in terms of goal-setting!",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. For anyone remotely interested in climate change or the environment, this course provides the moral foundation imperative to forming a well founded opinion on the matter. Furthermore, it raises important questions as to how the issue should be dealt with and what factors must be considered in doing so. Also, Professor Gajevic Sayegh alone makes the class worth taking."
