    "I would recommend this course to anyone, especially as a fifth class to take on top of your other work. This will not feel like a class - it will feel like a movie night.",
    "Heroes and Villains in film and literature focuses on the development of these characters within their media forms and what works or does not work for the viewer and what connections they make with the character(s). I found it incredibly interesting to learn why and how we as viewers connect with certain characters and their situation more than others. I would highly recommend this class. I am saying that there is more homework than other classes because there arefilms to watch and books to read, but it is fun homework. I would love to sit down and watch a James Bond film or read The Godfather over other Yale homework. It was enjoyable, both in and out of class.",
    "This was such a fun course!! Take it as a 5th class. I was exposed to several different genres of movies and really felt like the professor refined my palate in terms of distinguishing good movies from otherwise. This class also taught me how so many of the tropes and themes that we see in current movies all have predecessors; there are better, classic movies that did them all first! I did get to learn a lot of cool movie trivia, but I wish there had been a little more emphasis on the historical context of each film. You can get by without doing all of the reading. Literally your homework is to watch movies...what more could you want?",
    "Fun class, 3 papers. Friedfeld is the man.",
    "Yes",
    "Yes- fully recommend.",
    "A gem. Great selection of films, freedom in the writing assignments, fun and interesting. This is the class that your friends and family won't believe you actually get to take. \"I have to watch Bourne Identity for homework\" etc. The professor is passionate; the course is driven by his passion and wisdom. In a given week, there's a lot of reading\/viewing. You don't have to do it all but you will want to do. My only critique is that Eddy brought in Hershey's Hugs every week which became redundant. I wish he would have diversified the snacks.",
    "Yes I'd definitely recommend it. I loved the class and it only meets once a week so there's really no excuse not to take it.",
    "Take it; it'll be fun, you'll watch a lot and learn a lot without working a lot."
