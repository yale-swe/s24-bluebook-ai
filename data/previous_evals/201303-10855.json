    "It's a great class to take if you're interested in Korea and want to learn the language. No previous experience is necessary.",
    "KREN 110 is a great L1 language class. The workload is reasonable for a language, the topics are fun, and the instructors engaging and entertaining. Honestly, this class was one of the best classes I have taken at Yale. 50 minutes of fun everyday. Korean is also surprisingly easy to pick up, initially, as the alphabet is much simpler than it looks.",
    "Of course, you should take it! It's the best language at Yale!",
    "A pretty good course overall. Utilizes a book and is pretty much structured all throughout. Gets a bit harder near the end of the semester because the learning pace picks up though.",
    "Definitely take this class if you want to learn a new language and have fun along the way!",
    "Korean can be challenging at the beginning -- the first few units before the first test are always the hardest. But don't despair -- soon you'll get used to all the homework (it usually took me about an hour per day) and the daily quizzes (for which you have to memorize ten words a night). Despite all the work, the class is remarkably stress-free. Korean is fun -- take it!"
