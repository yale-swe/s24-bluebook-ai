    "Iachello might not have the reputation of being the most dynamic lecturer, but his lectures were actually rather clear and thorough--if you can stay awake. The class covered Griffiths' Introduction to Electrodynamics from cover to cover, even though we weren't expected to master all of the content. The material can get pretty hairy, especially in the second half of the course. I wouldn't recommend going out of your way to take this course, but if you're a Physics major (and especially an intensive major), just get 'er done.",
    "Follows the textbook very closely. An ok course, not too much work. You learn electromagnetism.",
    "Do not take unless you must. If you have to, it's not that much work, but lecture is very boring and exactly like the textbook. Material is pretty cool actually, there is just way too much of it."
