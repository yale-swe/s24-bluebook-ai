    "I would recommend ENAS 509 to other students in the microelectronic track of EE department and in other departments such as materials science.",
    "Easy class to get the basics of semiconductor physics. Highly recommended for those without much knowledge of the field, not recommended to physics majors because the material is far too simple.",
    "Starting at the quantum mechanics level and working the way up to understanding bulk and surface electronic material properties. I would recommend this course to anyone who wishes to work with semiconductors or other electronic materials.",
    "I would recommend this class to someone with no knowledge of the material.",
    "I would recommend this course if there are no more direct subject in his\/her major involved.",
    "I would recommend this course for any engineering student that is interested in getting a better idea about how materials in modern electronics work, maybe as a first step towards further study in this field. This was a good introductory course in this subject.",
    "Good. Yes, definitely",
    "I want to recommend this class to graduate students.Sometimes I need some fundamental concepts to learn it.",
    "For students who need to do material growing, I strongly recommend this course. For those who need to do device fabricating, I also recommend taking this course."

    "The topic included in the course is closely related to my research and is very helpful",
    "It was mostly review for me but I did learn some new things about materials growth.",
    "For this semester I wasworking with carbon nanotubes. This course helped me understand such concepts as band gaps and hole-carrier models that are critical to understanding the electronic properties of carbon nanotubes.",
    "It gave me a brush up on my silicon industry knowledge but it doesn't related directly to my research. Overall a good course.",
    "It is very helpful",
    "I didn't know much about material science. By this class, I could learn it."
