   "comments": [
    "This course was so helpful to develop writing skills and to reflect upon the art of history. You learn to criticize your own way of writing by discussing how other scholars write their monographs. You learn to evaluate the different techniques to write historical accounts.",
    "The course was insightful as a study of methodologies and means of constructing different kinds of narratives. We did a close reading of and intense discussions into the nature of different types of writing on the same subject. More than anything the course teaches you to do focussed reading which in turns greatly informs and improves your writing. It greatly help me focus my ideas and also develop the skills to tell the same story in different ways, use the right words and techniques when necessary. A great learning experience.",
    "I am grateful to Professor Shore for teaching me to trust my instincts and be braver in expressing my ideas about the issues, once I dare to take pen to paper. The different styles of texts we covered in the course allowed us to see the various techniques we can use to tell a story, to integrate narrative and analysis. I am grateful to Dr. Shore for having enthusiastically shared with us (within and outside the seminar) the art of setting the stage, introducing the characters, and giving voice to the protagonists in our stories. The technique (or rather, again, the art) of working with sensitive material is another thing I was happy to learn in this course. These are just a few things from a long list of skills students acquire in Professor Shores course, which make one a responsible and more effective writer.",
    "About storytelling, for example how to narrate a story, how many protagonists one should organize, when should let these characters on stage, etc. Beyond the writing skills, we also get to know much about ideas that may influence our choices in life."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Great course.",
    "The biggest strength of this course is the Professor, Marci Shore's own experience as a historian which informs and enriches the discussions and choice of reading materials which are diverse and interesting and can hold any student's imagination and interest regardless of their area of studies. Professor Shore gives detailed feedback on the different writing assignments and guided us with our individual projects which was very time consuming for her but extremely helpful for us. It would be difficult to improve a course this effective. Truly learned a lot from it.",
    "I am sure every student, who submitted an evaluation for this course stated in different wording something along the lines that this course has no weaknesses I am of such opinion: an incredible kind of responsibility and care with which Dr. Shores approaches her courses leave no room for any sort of weaknesses or shortcomings. Insightful discussions that followed the in depth readings of the texts allowed us to cover the many pertinent issues and exchange our ideas about. Thanks to Professor Shores seminars, which were held on the first day of the week, I always looked forward to Mondays because despite the depressing nature of the topics we covered, upon leaving the classroom I had a feeling that we are moving a little closer to making this world a better place.",
    "It is a perfect course. Prof Shore well organizes the class and the reading materials are interesting. Moreover, she corrects carefully our book reviews and gives us very detailed and useful comments, which could help us improve writing skills. Maybe one thing can be improved is that maybe it is possible to share the good book reviews to all, so that students can learn from each other among them."

   "comments": [
    "Yes, professor Shore will really help you improve as a historian.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to anyone with an interest in history or just storytelling and writing.",
    "This is where I get jealous (for I no longer am Professor Shore's student), but, of course, recommend Professor Shore's course to everyone because this is the best experience a student can have. The kind of conversations we engage in in the seminar will leave a life-long impact on anyone. Get ready to be leaving the classroom feeling as though your head were about to explode from all the emotions and thoughts that the discussions in this course will inspire you with. Among the many things to appreciate and look forward to is an incredibly detailed, generous feedback that Dr. Shore provides on her students' writing. This feedback and her heartfelt advice will serve as a guide not only for this course, but also for other courses and projects.",
    "Definitely. Largely because one really can learn a lot from Prof Shore, not only knowledge about intellectual history, but also about attitudes toward others and life"
