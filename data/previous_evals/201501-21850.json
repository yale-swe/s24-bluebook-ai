   "comments": [
    "Most people who take the first half of third-year decide not to take this course. This is a big mistake. My Japanese improved much more this semester than last. If you have an interest in really developing strong language skills, take the time to at least finish out this year.",
    "JAPN 151 01 focuses a lot on reading and kanji which is helpful to students after L3 and those who want to improve their reading skills after understanding the basic grammar. The workload is not as high as that in L3, but after taking the class, your Japanese does improve.",
    "This class is excellent for students who are willing to spend a significant amount of time outside the classroom preparing and studying material. However, if you do not have talent or time, you will soon get left behind and find it arduous."
