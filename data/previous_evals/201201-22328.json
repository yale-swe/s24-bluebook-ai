    "I would not recommend. A lot of work and if you don't have the time, you can fall behind very easily",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to a student who is interested in music. I would also recommend it to students who enjoy languages, math, or logic. It filled that role for me this semester in that there was relaxing, problem-set style homework. It is also not overwhelming because even though there is a lot of work, it is always small assignments due frequently, so you cannot get behind or overwhelmed.",
    "Fast paced and challenging but fun introduction to Music Theory. Yes, Professor Lalli probably goes faster than most, and he's very much a lover of music more than a traditional teacher. You practice the material in class and must at least look over the lesson the night before (the syllabus is very organized and accurate) so you're not totally lost in class. Try not to be intimidated by Professor Lalli - he's very nice and has lots of office hours!",
    "Yes! If you want to learn the basics of music theory you should definitely take this class. It is a great introduction to music and you shouldn't be worried if you don't play any instrument or have never had any musical education. Lalli is great!",
    "If you have little or no experience in music theory, take this class! Otherwise, don't. There are higher level courses for you.",
    "Take it! I was in band for seven years and already knew half of the material, but my band director never stressed theory so I still didn't know what inversions of chords were, for example. If you already know that, you'd probably be bored by this class, and 205 would probably be better.",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone who has ever wanted to understand music or wanted to sight read. The class starts off teaching the most basic concepts of music, so those of you who know NOTHING about music are not at a disadvantage to those with slight musical knowledge. However, the class also gets into scales, meter, and intervals pretty quickly so those of you who know FACE and EGBDF will also learn new things pretty quickly. It's a must take for anyone with any musical interest."
