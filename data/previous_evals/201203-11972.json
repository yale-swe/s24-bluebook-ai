    "Yes! Audrey Hoffmann is the best.",
    "Yes! The grammar review really clears things up, especially if you have any confusion. The new material is great as well, and the pacing for this is especially good. The readings and films are all very good. Take this with Prof. Hoffmann! She's very sweet, and never, ever makes anyone feel embarrassed for making mistakes. She keeps the class fun and light, so coming to class is never a chore.",
