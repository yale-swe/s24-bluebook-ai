   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend it! If your a humanities major, this class fulfills either your QR or SC requirements!",
    "An AMAZING look at some very cool science. Not a gut at all - but the math's not too hard, the stuff you learn is great, and it's completely worth it. I took it for the Sc, but I would recommend it even if you don't need a science credit.",
    "Astro 220 is a great class, especially if you have already taken 210. You cover a lot of material at a pretty in-depth level and learn a lot of really cool stuff about the universe. Problem sets are very straightforward and exams are fair. The observing project is pretty short and interesting, too. The thing that makes this class is the professor. She's very dynamic, helpful and approachable. I highly recommend it.",
    "This was the QR\/Science class I always dreamed of.I am a social sciences major who always loved science in high school and wanted to take a science class that would be fun and would make me go \"Wow!\" -- without distracting too much from my major-related work. \"Wow!\" is an understatement. This class taught me all the most fascinating things about the universe, and I could tell Prof. Glikman was enjoying every minute of it right along with us.Homework was structured in a way that I was using math skills I already possessed to solve new problems. Take it if you were competent at math in high school, and want to do problem sets that like solving puzzles. (Puzzles whose answers tell you how old the M37 galaxy cluster is, or how hot the universe was 380,000 years after the Big Bang.)In short, perfect class for a busy non-science major who knows math can be fun and thinks the night sky is the coolest thing ever.",
    "I would highly recommend this course. The lectures were so interesting and fun to go to! The workload was reasonable. The professor was an inspiration.",
    "I probably would not recommend this class to another student. There is a lot of tedious unit conversion and plugging numbers into equations, and you don't really get too far into really interesting stuff outside of class.",
    "Astro 220 was a great course. It was really a gem - one of the few science courses at Yale that is accessible to people with very little background in the subject, but that is not taught to be a gut. I had no particular interest in astronomy before taking the course, and while I still have no intention to change my major, I learned an incredible amount about astronomy and about our universe and am now more interested in those fields as a result (particularly given the final project where you actually use the observatory on science hill to calculate the age of a galaxy cluster!). Learning how to think about new things in new ways is always rewarding, and this class does that perfectly - teaches new concepts and methodologies while remaining completely accessible to anyone who knows how to use algebra. Highly recommended for anyone who needs a science or QR but doesn't want to waste their time in a gut class."
