   "comments": [
    "Definitely take it. It's a lot of wok but really worth it.",
    "This course is a good mix of grammar\/language and literature. There is a good emphasis on class discussion, with most of the work done independently. I would recommend this course! Your writing will definitely improve, and speaking as well.",
    "This course is a ton of work. If you are willing to do it all (or even most of it), your French will undoubtedly improve vastly. But be prepared for many hours a week spent on tedious grammar or vocab exercises. The texts and movies for this course are generally good and interesting.",
    "TAKE IT! PRENDRE CE COURSE!!!! It will improve your French without class pressure. The French department is amazing and will help you out with anything you need. It was a bit of work but worth every minute.",
    "Don't take it if you've taken FREN150, it's basically a repeat. If you haven't taken 150, by all means go ahead. It'll help enhance your grammar and you read some interesting literature and watch relevant movies. The class experience really depends on which instructor you get.",
    "I enjoyed the readings of French 151 a lot, and I'd like to think I became a much more fluid writer. The class is not as much work as 140, so don't let that be the factor that prevents you from taking this class. I think my oral skills have improved, but I'm still not wholly satisfied with how much stress was placed onspeaking. However, how much you get it out is definitely how much you put in - participate a lot in class and you're bound to make much more improvement, as disheartening as it may be to constantly receive criticism.",
    "A lot of work, but set up like a high school course in that tests and essays are biweekly instead of big midterms and finals."
