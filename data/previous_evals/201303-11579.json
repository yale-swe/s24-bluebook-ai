   "comments": [
    "A study of education politics at the local, state, and federal level and by major issues such as finance and accountability. I would absolutely recommend taking PLSC 260 followed by PLSC 240 in the spring semester.",
    "Great look at hte way politics influence public schools policy, structure, and outcomes -- definitely taught me a lot of things I didn't expect.",
    "Look at your life. If you haven't taken Public Schools and Politics yet, or haven't tried, it probably is a bit unfulfilled. This class was one of the best academic experiences I have ever had. I didn't think there was as much work as suggested on previous evals, and the experience is truly great.",
    "Yes, if you have the time to put in the work you will learn a lot. I preferred the spring semester course more because I'm more interested in the topics presented in the spring, but the structure is identical and well thought out. I also enjoyed the relationships with other students that are built in the class (my study group-mates were awesome, which is not a universal experience).",
    "Absolutely. My only caveat would be: do not take this class unless you are 100% willing to put in the time and effort. You probably should not come into it Credit\/D either. If you take this class because you've heard it's incredible, but do not have the time in your schedule to commit to the substantial amount of work it involves, please do not take it\u00e2\u0080\u0094the course is centered on small group learning, and you will only be hurting your classmates.",
    "I think it is definitely for people with experience in both political worlds and public education. The variety of experience in the class can really make it great. I honestly think it has a big cult following, perhaps bigger than it deserves, but I enjoyed the class and learned a lot. I think people may enjoy it so much because one has to commit so much time to the class. What made it for me was the dynamic within my study group - and that was just lucky.",
    "This is the course. Whether you are an ed person or not, this is a really well run course that is worth the wait. It is supremely well-taught and asks a lot of good questions. This is not an in-the-classroom discussion of education policy, that's 240, so be mindful that this is about politics and how that ends up leading to certain decisions that end up affecting the classroom.",
    "PLSC 260 is one of the best courses I've taken at Yale. JBS is very knowledgable and selects excellent students for the course, which make the discussions thoughtful. You really learn about how various political levers are used to affect the public school system through intense case studies. If you get in to the class, take it. Be aware that you do have to put in a lot of time, though it is definitely worth it.",
    "PLSC 260 has the curious distinction of being a class in which you learn a great deal while simultaneously walking away with few answers to the big questions you came in with. That is to say, PLSC 260 will take you through a rigorous investigation of the role that local politics play in education, and ultimately leave you with the conclusion that there are no shortcuts to success, that local politics are entirely idiosyncratic, and that the capacity of community organizations to develop complex titles and acronyms is unparallelled. The prestige of this class within the PLSC dept is driven mostly by the cult of JBS - perhaps one of the few true teachers I've had at Yale. The opportunity to learn in small group settings promotes insight without the section-asshole syndrome of most seminars, and JBS' carefulorchestration of the class schedule reflects careful thought. This is an overwhelmingly positive review, but I do have one caution: this class didn't change my life, and I think the same is true (regardless of the hype) for most of my classmates. Also be aware that PLSC 240, his policy class taught in the spring semester, may be a better fit for those interested in education policy rather than in chronicling the stupid decisions of local mayors and presidential administrations. That said, take PLSC 260 if you have the opportunity: be excited to learn from your fellow students (a cream of the crop group, to be sure, and one of the main highlights of the class), to learn from the expertise and teaching ideology of JBS, and to investigate firsthand the complex web of local, state and federal politics that shape something most of us consider to be of paramount importance.",
    "JBS is awesome. The class is actually a very manageable amount of work, but you should expect to do 150-200 pages of reading per week. You wont get very much out of the class if you don't keep up with the reading, but thankfully the reading is about all you have to keep up with.Definitely take this class if you're interested in education and really want to dig into the political issues surrounding ed policy.",
    "This is a truly extraordinary class. JBS is a master educator and puts incredible effort into making the class a wonderful learning experience. It is not your typical seminar -- the bulk of learning takes place in study groups outside of class, and small group discussions (3-5 people) during class time. By the end of the semester, I actually know all my classmates, and greatly respect them as intelligent peers, which is something that doesn't happen often enough here.The casebooks are quite a bit of reading each week, and you must read them thoroughly to get by in the class. But they are very well edited by JBS and usually pretty interesting, so it's never tedious. The weekly short paper is short enough that it's not too much work if you've done the reading.If you're prepared to do the work, absolutely take this if you can get in. Whether or not you're particularly interested in education politics, you will learn a TON. It's one of those classes that will make you glad you went to Yale.",
    "Take this class. It is wonderful. You will annoy everyone you know by how much you talk about it. If you are interested in schools the content is fascinating, well-scaffolded, and specific. JBS is the best and is incredibly accessible and helpful.",
    "Absolutely. If you get in, there is no reason not to take this course. Take it over anything else (except for maybe a different class that you've been trying to get into for several semesters). The class is the most interesting and engaging seminar offered at Yale-- each two-hour session is split up into several small group discussions, so they pass by in the blink of an eye and you get to know almost everyone else in the class. My favorite class this semester; my favorite class at Yale.",
    "The class is worthwhile if you are interested about learning more about the US public school system.",
    "This class was far and away the best class I have ever taken. It was simply at another level than every other seminar I have taken, and it is no accident. Starr (or JBS) puts in so much effort and care into every aspect of the class. The readings are assembled in comprehensive casebooks. All your assignments get real feedback, and can be redone if you like. Class discussion is split up into many small group activities, which makes for a 2 hour class that flies by. I'd come out from class happier, and feeling as if I had a deeper understanding of the material. You don't need me to tell you this: if you get in, take it, even if that means rearranging your entire schedule. It's well worth it."
