   "comments": [
    "This class is almost impossible to describe. It is an insane mix of Ernesto's often inappropriate humor; his insights on life; his very unusual ideas on reading poetry, watching film, and listening to music; and the students' attempts to comprehend the aforementioned poetry, film, and music. The title of the course doesn't really do it justice - the class transcends both language and genre limitations. Although it requires a certain suspension of disbelief and a willingness to go with Ernesto's flow (there is no syllabus), this class was truly an outstanding experience. This is Ernesto's last year at Yale, so I HIGHLY recommend that interested students take his Contemporary Poetry off the Page class next semester, which will essentially be a continuation of this semester. Not difficult workload-wise, but very demanding mentally. Take it if you want a class unlike any other you have ever taken, or will ever take.",
    "Great class, very little work and fair grading. No syllabus, but really not very much work. You'll write 2-3 short papers reflecting on what we've learned. The class stimulates thought and is a nice change from other classes at Yale that do not allow you to be as creative. I enjoyed it and would recommend it.",
    "This was a great class with a great professor. Take this class even for fun (the work load is minimal).",
    "I would definitely recommend this course for students who are looking to develop new tools for looking at poetry. It is a very detail-oriented course. It definitely requires patience and persistence in order to reach a point where developing a personal relationship with a poem becomes natural.",
    "I would not take this class again.",
    "This class is terribly structured. Do not take it. Ernesto is awesome, but his class is terrible. You'll have no idea what is going on."
