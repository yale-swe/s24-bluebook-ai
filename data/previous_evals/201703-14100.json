    "The content was incredibly interesting, but the class structure as a whole was somewhat disorganized. We often repeated lectures and it was confusing what would be on exams or expectations for the essay, but it turned out okay in the end regardless, so it wasn't that big of a deal.",
    "Pace of the class sessions really needs to be changed up. Too much dry lecture and not enough discussion and interaction. Good selection of readings, just not the most engaging and helpful way of examining them.",
    "The premise of this class is very interesting but it was taught and assessed in an extremely disorganized manner that distracted a lot from the material."

    "Decent 5th credit. Not too much work, material isn't incredibly interesting but it's ok. BUT JUST KNOW, Professor Siemer is a pretty boring lecturer so just be aware of that. He's not very engaging but he grades tests pretty easy so you'll do fine on those. Nice guy though, just not engaging.",
    "It depends. This is perhaps one of the only classes at Yale that covers this material and the content was probably the best part of this class. We learned about cognition and emotion along with how to research it, so it was very applicable to other courses or senior theses and whatnot. If you're easily frustrated by disorganized classes, however, then this probably isn't for you. We sometimes had repeat lectures or weren't sure about what was on exams or didn't know what to expect about the essay, etc. But the class itself turned out okay and exams were easy enough, so it's not like the disorganized nature of the course hurts your grade in any way. And again, the content is interesting even if the lecture itself can be somewhat boring.",
    "Siemer grows on you and you learn more towards the end once you get used to his teaching style, but some of the lectures are boring and dry."
