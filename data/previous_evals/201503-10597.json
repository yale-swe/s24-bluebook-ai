    "The course was exactly as it is described by the professor: a look at various aspects of politics through the lens of anthropology. The course was valuable. I learned a lot from fellow students and the professor. I would recommend this course to other students.",
    "I would highly recommend it. The course provides a foundation in Anthropology while also pushing the boundaries and thinking critically about the field. I am not trained as an anthropologist, but think the field has really important insights to offer to other disciplines. A great way to get out of your comfort zone and think about real issues outside of just an academic setting with the chance to explore topics through art and media."

   "comments": [
    "The course was greatly beneficial to my understanding of african studies and anthropology. It expanded my view and my exposure to the fields, allowing me a deeper understanding of my field and providing me additional academic perspectives on how I may approach my MA.",
    "I was able to use the final paper to write a chapter of master thesis and it allowed me to step back and think about my research in a very different way which I found useful."
