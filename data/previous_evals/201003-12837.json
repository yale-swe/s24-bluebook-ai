    "If you're a painter, and you're going to do your project in painting, you're going to take this class. Let's be real. But anyway, yes, you'll learn something. Maybe a ton, maybe a little.",
    "This class allows you to explore self-generated projects, artistic practice, and methods of critique. If you want to figure out some stuff about how to make your own work, it's great.",
    "If you're a painting major and a senior you should definitely take this class. The course is basically totally self-directed and geared toward independent research, with the added benefit of getting to be taught by Clint. Clint is really helpful in terms of guiding your painting and he really encourages you to develop your technique and your ideas. He's really wonderful.",
    "Continuation of Painting Studio I - depends completely upon the teacher (however, in my experience, both times have been good experiences in that the work has been very independent).",
    "natural and necessary progression for painting concentrator. obvious reasons for taking. worthwhile only if you work hard.",
    "Painting Studio II, in the way Clint teaches it, is a continuation of work begun in earlier painting classes. Assignments take the form of suggestions on ways to further ones work. A think a reasonable amount of work is expected from students, you are expected to always be making new things but not pushed to do too much. Critiques are every couple weeks and Clint meets with everyone once a week. I would definitely recommend this class, it is one of the most helpful painting courses because you actually learn how to paint the things you want to be painting."
