    "yes! If you want to learn about mental healthcare policy, different forms of therapies and treatment for mental disorders, and socio-cultural factors relating to how society views and handles mental illness, then look no further. A fun, engaging, low-stress course in which you learn a lot about yourself and become a much more empathetic person. If you want to go into clinical psychology this course is a must.",
    "Well if you took the first semester of this class then you have to take this semester so I'm not sure why you're reading this BUT if our year is any indication, the class becomes more organized this semester: you learn about a different form of therapy each week, and the triad exercises become better. Personally, I LOVED having a psych class that actually applied to clinical practice instead of just theory\/research, so I highly recommend taking this class for anything interested in potentially practicing as a clinician. The skills you learn in this class are useful not just in your future career but for anyone in life. Prof. Lockhart is a little crazy but in a good way - she's very willing to help students and SO passionate about mental health care.",
    "Really enjoyed this class. Great if you are interested in learning about the current state of mental health care and different types of clinical therapies. Getting a good placement is key. Triads (groups of three) are also really cool way to practice different therapies. Assignments are mostly thought questions and journal entries each week. Pretty relaxed class which some students may find slow - but personally I liked the casual mood. Prof. Lockhart also always brought snacks. Just be aware that this is a year long class.",
    "PSYC 356 is the second part of clinical psychology in the community and its great! You learn about all of the different types of psychotherapy which really opens your eyes because other yale courses do not talk about psychotherapy or if they do they only talk about CBT which you learn is only one type of empirically based technique. Also, you learn about culture and mental illness and how different culture heavily influences the mental illness one has which is super enlightening and important. I would ABSOLUTELY recommend this course to another student. It really contrasts with other yale psychology courses which can really stifle you and forget the human element of psychology. Professor Lockhart is absolutely fantastic.",
    "This class is most definitely worth the year-long commitment if you get a good field placement. Your assignments are mostly short reading responses and journal entries. The first semester, the lectures are led by Professor Lockhart, but the second semester they are student-led powerpoints on different types of therapy. These could get redundant from week to week; however, when it comes time to do your own presentation, it makes sure you REALLY know that one type of therapy. When picking your field placement, definitely go for ones that allow you one-on-one personal interaction with clinical populations; they are hands down the most rewarding (and worth the time commitment).",
    "If you're at all interested in mental health, clinical psychology, or psychiatry, you should definitely take this class. You learn so much not only about these topics specifically, but with our placements and triad groups you learn a lot just about how to help people in general. It's a skill that can be applied universally, and I'd definitely say it's played a factor in strengthening some of my relationships at Yale.",
    "A pretty good class. Weekly thought questions and reflective assignments, so not too intense.",
    "A continuation of the seminar\/fieldwork placement combo from PSYC 355. This semester started off more organized than the last semester, which was great, and we covered some important topics, including mental health care policy and the current mental health care system in the U.S. We spent the majority of the semester learning about different approaches to psychotherapy - pairs of students were assigned types of therapy (psychodynamic, existential, music therapy, play therapy, CBT, and many more), and each pair had to prepare a 30-40 minute presentation about their assigned therapy. Each time the class met, one or two pairs would present, and then Professor Lockhart would follow up with a related discussion, more video clips of the therapy, etc. We watched videotapes of three different therapists working with the same client and compared their styles, which was particularly interesting. The presentation-based format got a bit monotonous after a while, and it would have been nice to spend more time comparing and contrasting different therapy styles (as we did with those video clips), but we had some good discussions along the way. At the end of the semester, everyone did a brief presentation about their fieldwork placement, which was more interesting this time because everyone had had more time there (most had been at the same placement for the full school year)."
