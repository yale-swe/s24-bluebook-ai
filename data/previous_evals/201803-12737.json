    "I like the lab works, and it would be great if we can cut down the tree earlier.",
    "Great feel to the lab, I would have liked more microscope work but that's just me.",
    "The strength of the labs is that they test you on general concepts we discuss in class. The downside is that sometimes I felt that once the lab was over, we were more-or-less done with that topic (what happened in lab stays in lab). In a couple instances this wasn't the case, like with the leaf spreadsheet or with the tree analysis. I would have liked more frequent homework assignments that build off the labs. I think this would allow the students to build off both the lab practicum experience while considering the larger context of the issues--and the first mid-term is an excellent example of how this could work.",
    "I enjoyed all of the lab assignments, especially the ones where we took measurements outside and\/or looked at plants under the microscope. While the final project was interesting and illuminated challenges in research and modeling, some of the work involved (e.g. measuring rings) was a bit tedious. Perhaps this project works best with large class size.",
    "N\/A",
    "One strength is that students were able to use the devices and learned the methodologies. We were given the freedom to choose our own topics for the final presentation. The class was also very interesting for connecting our field trips to our work in the lab."
