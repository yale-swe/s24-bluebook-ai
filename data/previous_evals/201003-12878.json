    "Course on how to do basic global health research. Course on how to write a proposal for global health grants.",
    "Yes, I'd recommend this course. It provides great real-world experience via the group and individual projects. Finding professional contacts can be frustrating, though, and there were several weeks were I just went to lecture, took notes, and didn't do much else. This might sound like a plus at first, but I feel like I didn't get as much out of some of the lectures as I could have. Still, Kaveh Khoshnood is wonderful, and by the end of the course, you will definitely have a solid research proposal to turn in for grant money if you want to do research the following summer. If you're interested in conducting your own global health research, definitely take this course.",
    "Good course that introduces students to the methodologies of qualitative and quantitative studies. The professor offers a lot of insight and brings in many pertinent speakers; Deadlines and expectations for the course were not made as clearly as they could have been.",
    "Great class! Take it if you're ever planning to do any research (or if you even think you might). The class is very relaxed, with no homework besides reading and no quizzes or tests. You have two major projects, one being a group project to design a research question that you carry out during the semester, and the other being an individual project where you design a theoretical research proposal. Both are very helpful and significant in different ways, and you get experience handling some of the more bureaucratic sides of research, such as theYale Institutional Review Board. Absolutely great class. Best time to take it is as a junior, so that you can design the project you will be researching next summer for a grade, and perfect it before submitting it in for grants. Take this class!",
    "Yes. If you're interested in research this is a great class to take.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class because if you're interested in conducting a research, you need to know everything taught in this class! Prior to this class, I assumed I was ready to do my own research, but I was wrong! It's a must take class even if it's early in the morning on Fridays!"
