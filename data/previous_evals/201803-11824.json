    "Further developed Italian language skills through discussion of films, poetry, short stories, art, and food culture. Learned a lot about the \"La Dolce Vita\" period in Italian history and about important cultural figures in Italy. I am now much better and more confident at forming my ideas and thoughts and being able to convey them in Italian. There wasn't a ton of writing, but my writing skills definitely still improved in this class.",
    "Developed my fluency in Italian and learnt more about Italian culture",
    "This course used the idea of \"la dolce vita\" as a theme to tie together many different movies, songs, short stories, essays, and other cultural artifacts to improve our Italian in a way that was also intellectually stimulating and satisfying.",
    "This course helped me solidify my Italian in an academic environment.",
    "I was definitely able to improve my spoken and written italian over the course of the semester. I am far from fluent, but definitely more comfortable and confident speaking in italian."

    "Anna is one of the nicest, most understanding, and funniest professors. She made class fun to attend and facilitated interesting discussions, even though we often had trouble formulating our ideas. The small class size was great since we got to know each other and were comfortable talking to each other in Italian. The material we studied was interesting and the class didn't have that much work so it was never stressful. The one thing I would improve is the clarity of assignments; sometimes it was confusing what our homework was since Anna had a unique system where you chose three assignments to do during the semester (you didn't have to do them all). Overall, the class is very loose and free and really fun!",
    "Strengths - The course provided an interesting view into multiple aspects of Italian culture, all while helping develop mastery of the language itself",
    "I can only speak highly of this course. It was so much fun, enjoyable and interesting. We worked in groups, independently and collectively as a class which made the class non repetitive. The classs main strength was both the breadth and depth we experience in studying countless sources (movies, documentaries, articles, comics, poems and paintings) to appreciate the Italian culture. Anna was amazing and she made the class so interesting and exciting to come to.",
    "The course was very well-designed and well-ran. The number of students in the class was perfect, and students' engagement with the course material was high throughout. I personally really enjoyed the narrative of the class itself. Using Fellini's \"La Dolce Vita\" as a starting point to introduce the larger cultural idea (and possibly myth) of the sweet life which then guided the rest of the class. This was a really effective way to familiarize us with a broad variety of elements of Italian culture (from literature -- short stories and poetry -- to food, to song, to art, to cultural self-examination) while all the while reinforcing Italian language skills. Because of the relaxed but careful approach the instructor took, I felt free to explore what really interested me while still recieving a large amount of guidance in the classroom. I would say the course was a great success as a result.",
    "I wish the trajectory of this course had been a little more clear, but the course materials were engaging and useful for my vocabulary.",
    "This course is really interactive and forces you to use your spoken italian and to converse with others. Also, we do a lot of projects such as small essays and presentations which are fun ways to improve our skills. Doing a little more grammar and vocabulary might be helpful to brush up on some skills."

    "I would definitely recommend this course to anyone looking to improve\/continue their Italian! It's the perfect setting because of the small class size and low-stress environment. I originally wasn't going to continue taking Italian but I'm so glad that I ended up in this class - it has inspired me to continue with Italian and go for the language certificate.",
    "Yes - the course is brilliant for developing Italian language skills",
    "I would recommend this class to all students in L5. I came out with better speaking skills as Anna always created a comfortable environment, better writing skills and a larger appreciation of Italian literature.",
    "Yes! at first this class seems very very chill, but you learn so so much. The selection of short stories and poetry you read in this class is incredible and so I highly recommend it!",
    "Definitely -- Anna is exceptionally kind and very fun, but her approach to teaching keeps the students interests and objectives in focus. I particularly enjoyed the poetry we read in class, and thought Anna's specialty in poetry really shined in these classes, but I can't imagine that anyone who is interested in Italian and Italian culture wouldn't find something to enjoy in the class. It's a well-designed, relaxed, and enjoyable course.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. It is fun and Anna is a wonderful professor. It challenges you, but it is never stressful. I feel like my italian has improved greatly and have learned a lot about italian culture."
