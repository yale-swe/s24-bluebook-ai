    "This is a Asian literature class. Thus, if this is what you are looking for, take it!",
    "Take this class if you're interested in discussing ideas, and specifically ideas related to an area of intersection between history and literature regarding contemporary China.Do not take this class if you do not like reading!!",
    "This is a survey class of recent East Asian Studies - China topics. It was what I was looking for as a returning Light Fellow trying to decide if EAST was something for me, but the class itself was kind of a mess. Prof. Tsu is really knowledgable and meant well with the organization of the class, but various things (her absences, the hurricane, etc) threw a wrench in the plan and it kind of fell apart halfway through. Its really divided into literature on Tuesday and history\/philosophy\/whatever on Thursday, not always cohesive, and the TA was nice but not a good discussion leader. There was no guidance on the papers, but I kind of enjoyed that - it was a good opportunity to build my independent research skills, and Prof. Tsu gave as much guidance as I wanted once I figured out my topics. The material and the readings are great, the organization and the flow isn't so great. Go shop it, and if you like what you hear then take it. If you're not sure, it might not be worth the amount of work unless you're willing to treat it as guided reading with a random weekly talk from Tsu.",
    "This was a good class, though much different from what I expected. It is cross-listed in 5 departments, so I did not realize how literature-heavy it would be. However, I enjoyed it as my first lit class, especially because of Professor Tsu. I loved her teaching style and it was obvious that she is extremely knowledgeable in her subject. She was very straightforward and honest with us, and did not treat us like students but rather as peers. She was also lively and interesting in every class.",
    "The class turned out to be not what many of us expected. It teaches you about China, yes, but not in a direct way. We looked at China in an oblique way - through the Chinese diaspora, through language philosophies and globalization. We surprisingly did not cover the Cultural Revolution or Communism. The class is not about the mainstream China you hear about in the news (at least not until the very end of the class), but rather about an unheard-of China, like the story of Chinese coolies in Peru. The class is more of a literature than a history class - recommended to lit\/history students or anyone interested in learning about the obscure sides of China.",
    "Jing Tsu was a very cool, engaging professor who had a strong command of the subject material of her class. The way she organized and conceptualized the class was interesting too, in that we examined China's relations with the rest of the world over the past few centuries through an assortment of literary, historical, and social texts. We read a (historically relevant) novel for our section on Tuesday, led by our TA, and then a shorter, often fascinating, text dealing with history or social theory for our seminar on Thursday. I personally found the shorter texts more interesting and struggled (as did many of my classmates) to finish the novels every week. The seminar was definitely more organized in the beginning--Professor Tsu would lecture for the first half, and then we'd break into discussion--but gradually got less structured as the semester progressed and became more discussion-based. There was good discussion in the class, for the most part, but I missed Professor Tsu's (pretty fantastic) lectures from the beginning of the semester and wanted more out of the class by the end. Overall, I'm still glad I took this class, as Professor Tsu offered a distinct perspective on China's incorporation into the wider world. She was also always happy to talk to us about our papers, which were self-designed and pretty manageable.",
    "An extremely interesting and important course that all individuals interested in modern China should - and can, as it is very accessible - take. The workload is just right, and the materials are varied and intriguing.",
    "Interesting perspective on China."
