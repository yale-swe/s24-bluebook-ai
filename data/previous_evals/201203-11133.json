   "comments": [
    "The material isn't overly difficult, but I found that I had to teach myself most of it through the psets. Take it if you need a stats course.",
    "Great course to grasp the basics of statistics in political science. I would strongly recommend it to anyone without a background in quantitative methods.",
    "Definitely take it! If you're confused about any of the concepts, Prof. Butler's lectures and problem sets will ensure that you leave with a good understanding of the fundamentals of statistics.",
    "This is a general introductory statistics course designed for students who have just come out of math camp and already know how to use STATA. If you have adequate preparation, you'll do fine, otherwise I would not recommend the course.",
    "Dan's teaching style can be unusual, so I would suggest that they read over a few statistics books on their own before starting the course. The exam questions are far from straightforward, so I would suggest that they practice a lot with long word problems.",
    "Yes, I'd recommed it, as it is an essential course forPolitical science.",
    "I would recommend it for anyone coming in without a really strong background in Stats.",
    "Political Science 500 01 is an introduction to statistics. I would recommend it as a useful foundation to understanding the subject. In particular, I enjoyed learning the matrix algebra underpinning to regressions.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to any empirically-oriented political science grad student simply because it is the first part of a sequence of statistics classes. However, I would also recommend to undergrads and to theorists: it is easily accessible and very useful!"

   "comments": [
    "The course seemed more like a pure math course, rather than a poli sci methods course. We will see how everything lines up. Statistics is obviously useful in political science.",
    "It's essential and I'll certainly use what I learned here, in future courses and in my own work.",
    "Made me more interested in learning statistics, which I knew I had to do anyway.",
    "It set me on the road to understanding statistics, which is very necessary for my discipline. To the extent it contributes to my dissertation, it is because it has equipped me with the necessary tools for conducting research and engaging literature in the field.",
    "Thanks to the instructor's original approach, I took a different look at material I had seen before. I think this will help me in the future."
