   "comments": [
    "This class was truly incredible. I developed my skills as a writer across five genres (narrative, policy proposal, profile, humor, description of place), read incredible essays, and participated in fascinating class discussions.",
    "I developed new insight into concise and understated writing, and improved construction of strong arguments.",
    "I loved the way that this class demonstrated different ways to think about the personal essay--ways that I had never really thought of before. The class also pushed me to be more of a \"real writer\" with its timeline, forcing me to get the work done so as to start on a new project.",
    "Really helped me think about writing and about myself as a writer. At the end of the semester, I felt so inspired that I went out and wrote an op-ed for the YDN on my own (which I've never done before) during which I found myself using tools from literally every single unit (including humor!) and was so happy to have these resources. I didn't submit it yet because the YDN is over for the year but if I still like it in the fall I'll submit it then. That's 100% thanks to this course and to Professor KQA who is one of my personal heroes and one of the incredible mentors I have had on this campus!",
    "This course was definitely challenging for me but I think I learned an incredible amount. I learned about my own writing as well as how to find the root message in essays and how effective a short piece of writing can be in conveying an important message. I also learned how difficult it is to write well and how valuable of a skill it is to have."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "This class was honestly so perfect that I have no idea how it could be improved.",
    "The strengths of this course lie in the professor and reading material. The required reading is no chore, but is genuinely interesting and varied. The Professor, Kimberly Andrews in my case, really takes the prize for working individually, creatively, and earnestly to improve the student's writing and to help him\/her develop a writing style.",
    "I did not feel like I could freely express my opinions.",
    "Daily reading quizzes would have encouraged me to do more of the readings. I was able to BS this part a bit and I really wish I wasn't because I think the readings would have been super valuable. (I know Professors always say they can tell when students didn't read thoroughly but I was actually commended for \"clearly having read\" on a day when I just briefly skimmed the text). Otherwise what a great course! Professor KQA's dry witty commentary always kept me entertained and on my toes. She was unafraid to have a strong opinion (some professors are constantly hedging) and I think I learned more BECAUSE she was so confident and I knew I could trust her.",
    "I loved the assigned readings, I think that by far they were one of the greatest strengths of the course, as was Professor Andrews. The format of the course overall is extremely efficient and effective, maintaining the attention of all the students and conveying information in an engaging and interesting way. The five essays and the focuses of each were a great way to teach the different styles of essay writing and allowed for a lot of creativity."

   "comments": [
    "One of the few best classes I have taken at Yale. I looked forward to this class every week and feel like I've gotten so much out of it. I'm a STEM student, but this class was approachable, enjoyable, and definitely pushed me out of my comfort zone (in the best way). The essays are fun, the workshops are helpful, and class discussions ranged in topic, but were almost always fascinating.",
    "Yes. I enjoyed the course and felt that my writing improved significantly.",
    "Yes, take this course. If you come to Yale particularly strong in writing and care to skip 114's, begin here and you won't regret it. Also a great course to take at any time. You'll improve your writing in all domains of life--necessary in any major. You'll take your thoughts and stories and finally put them to paper.",
    "yes!",
    "Yes definitely, the texts were very interesting and the assignments were very fun to do--except for when i had to do them at the last minute",
    "English 120 is so important for development as a writer, which will be critical no matter what field you go into! Additionally, I get easily overwhelmed by enormous writing projects, so this was a especially great way to get a WR while keeping the length of each individual assignment pretty manageable.",
    "Absolutely! It taught me a lot about my strengths as a writer.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course! I thought it was a great way to learn more about myself and my writing and also improve in many ways, both in generating thoughtful ideas and streamlining my writing."
