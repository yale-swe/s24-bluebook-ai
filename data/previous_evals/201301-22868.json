    "Professor Edgar is great for philosophy. Fabulous at explaining things and leading the discussion.",
    "Take it! Second DS semester is great, esp. philosophy.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to any other student. If you get Professor Edgar, do not trade out of his section, and count yourself lucky every time you go to his class.",
    "I'd recommend DS philosophy to other students for a good introduction to philosophy.",
    "An excellent overview of modern philosophy. Take it if you have any interest in the topic or in the history of Western thought.",
    "Continuing on from last semester. You know the drill.",
    "Yes, absolutely. DS rocks. Enough said.",
    "A great introduction to philosophy, and an opportunity to get basic exposure to the major philosophers of western thought.",
    "Yes. Highly recommend.",
    "Definitely take it. DS philosophy second semester will totally revolutionize the way you think. I enjoyed it very much.",
    "If you have never taken philosophy before, or the first semester of DS philosophy is not enough for you to get a good grasp on the subject (such was my case), this course might still be a little challenging. But then again, as long as you have a mild understanding of Kant, no part of this course can be as bad as Aristotle. I would recommend this course to anyone who is sure he\/she has a good professor.",
    "YES YES YESI pretty much stuck with DS second semester because I couldn't find a philosophy class that would cover what this class covers, and I never once regretted that decision. The combination of lectures and seminars (with really really good professors!) is so useful; you get background info from lecture, and a chance to push back on\/delve more deeply into the things that intrigue you most in seminar.Also, take this section if you can. Professor Edgar is extremely clear, extremely thorough, extremely systematic, and really friendly. He goes out of his way to make the sources really *make sense* to his students, and the result is that you end the year understanding --instead of just having memorized-- the texts."
