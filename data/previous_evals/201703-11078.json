    "This course gave me a number of new perspectives on the field I am studying and showed me that I do have a real passion for the topics we discussed. It also gave me invaluable field experience.",
    "- systems approach to researching and managing ecosystems - broad understanding of the historical underpinnings to ecology as a field - understanding of biogeochemical processes - budgeting techniques - understanding of human impact on landscapes",
    "I learned so much from this course! Basic ecosystem processes; modes of ecosystem management; and how to form opinions, debate, and expand my perspective on current events in the ecology world.",
    "This class first of all helped me understand systems thinking in general, not just for ecosystems. Also, I think the in class debates were very helpful in practicing discussing current environmental topics, and I most vividly remember the ecomodernism debate.",
    "None. Solely relied on previous knowledge to get through the class projects and papers."

   "comments": [
    "This is an interesting and well-designed course, for the most part. I personally do not prefer flipped classrooms and didn't enjoy the reliance on heavy amounts of outside reading, especially because they didn't continue to be relevant after we discussed them in class. My motivation to do the reading was low because there was little consequence to do it in the midst of my other work - I almost wish we were tested so that there were more of an incentive to really engage with the material. Discussions were by far my favorite part because they allowed for critical thought about real-world problems, and summaries\/critiques were also great learning tools.",
    "Strengths: - online video lectures - integration of the lab with classroom work - systems approach to budgeting ecosystem resources Weaknesses: - poor classroom management - nearly exclusive reliance on group-work format - little feedback to check understanding - little guidance in research to understand how to complete budget terms",
    "don't take this class unless you need it for your major. I basically had to teach myself everything.",
    "I really enjoyed the lectures given in the beginning of the course. By the end of the course we shifted to mostly classroom discussions, and while they were engaging I feel they would have been more productive if preceded by comprehensive lectures on the topic\/readings. I really enjoyed the budget and ecosystem management projects. The process of searching the literature and churning the numbers gave me a renewed perspective when reading related articles. The one thing I would say is that it would have been helpful to receive the project examples earlier, perhaps when the project was assigned.",
    "I like the discussion component of the class, however, I feel that the flipped classroom is not the best way to run the class. The flipped classroom well works for days in which the class debates different viewpoints in the literature. When it comes to reviewing online lectures, I believe it would be better to just present those lectures in class. There was a lot of dead time during lecture this semester, and many of the smaller discussion activities could have still fit into the 80-minute time slot after a 30-minute lecture.",
    "I think that I would rather have more small assignments as opposed to the two large ones we had in class, but the budget assignment definitely helped me understand how complicated it is and how much uncertainty there is, especially when we couldn't find a good number."

   "comments": [
    "This is an interesting course which has the potential to be really informative if you're willing to do the readings. I, unfortunately, did not dedicate the time necessary to do the readings, because there's little incentive. There's no tests, just some in-class discussion. Also, I found that (this being mainly a graduate school course) I didn't have the real-world experience to offer good points to some discussions or to do some of the more detailed assignments. I don't really feel it's designed for undergraduates, but it is manageable and enjoyable with a really comfortable workload.",
    "For a student already interested in ecology or considering core classes for the Environmental Studies major, definitely. For someone just trying to get a science credit, probably not.",
    "again, unless you 100% cannot get out of taking this course....",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course! I took it as a requirement for EVST, and it really enhanced my learning in the field. Whether you are focusing more on hard sciences or policy, the information in this class is crucial.",
    "I heard the lab section is good. I took the non-lab section and it was not engaging at all. Since it was flipped classroom, there was not much incentive to go to class. The professors are very nice and know what they're talking about but don't really provide good feedback. I felt lost most of the time, especially because 50% of the non-lab section's final grade rests on a final review paper. It was also unclear if my section had a TF or not.",
    "Mark and Pete are actually cool guys that do some interesting research. However, it seemed like Yale EVST threw them on to teach this class that they did not have any interest in or preparation for. Would strongly advise against taking this class unless, like half of the undergrads in it during my semester, it's the only science core requirement class left for you to get your degree."
