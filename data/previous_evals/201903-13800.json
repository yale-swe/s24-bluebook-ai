    "I used this course to become comfortable programming in a new language, and I feel like I achieved that. I feel confident telling potential employers that I am fluent in that language, and that comes directly from this course. I also learned how git and Github work, which will prove indispensable for the rest of my professional and academic career.",

    "The best part of this course is that you learn what you want based on the project chosen by yourself.",
    "New data cleaning, shaping, and plotting techniques. Learned the basics of a new software language.",
    "I learned how to code in R, how to use Github, and I got these programs installed on my personal computer. I also learned how to create useful plots, clean data, and research my own questions. I think I got to the point where I can do basic data science projects on my own and I am interested in learning more so I can get to a more advanced skill set."

    "They aligned pretty much exactly with my expectations.",
    "Very well. I thought this was the most practical course Ive taken. This coupled with the skills learned through workshops and self study, I think it is an important part of Data Science acquisition.",
    "It did not match my expectations. The course format was ambitious but in my opinion, it did not work. I was looking for more feedback, more targeted learning and more frequent interactions but it appeared too unstructured to be able to facilitate any of that.",
    "Very well. I received individualized coaching and support as well as the opportunity to take classes on my own that supported the type of learning I was looking for. I really hope this class continues to be offered. I would be interested to take it again if I have a data science project that I would really like to complete after my summer internship, for example."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of the course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I like the format of the course, with fewer class meetings and more attendance at workshops and things around campus. Also, while the group reflections in some of the class meetings didn't do much for me, it seemed like others in the class got a lot out of it so I would say the discussion bit is another strength. The flexibility to choose my own project based on my programming experience was also nice. In fact, that flexibility is exactly why I chose this course instead of taking a Python class or something elsewhere on campus. I think the main thing to improve would be to add a little more structure. I don't see a need to meet as a class any more than we did, but biweekly or so 1-on-1 meetings with the advisors might be nice to keep things going. I think that most people in the class (including myself) could probably have done even more if there was a slightly more formal structure, and slightly more defined requirements on what can constitute a complete project. I had my project mostly all coded up before the peer evaluation, and I wasn't ever very sure if I was doing enough. Also, and this isn't a comment on this class specifically, there aren't very good Python workshops around campus. I went to a few, but I found them largely unsatisfying and there are no intermediate-level options like there are for R over at Statlab.",
    "Strengths include the format of how it was set up. I cant think of any weaknesses but possibly",
    "Strengths was its obviously ambitious mandate, and it seemed quite exciting. However, because it lacked structure - for instance, by not having bespoke workshops - I ended up with attending lots of workshops, none of which matched my question. In hindsight, choosing a project that matches skills offered by these workshops would have been a more useful exercise. It can be improved by: 1) letting students decide on a project much after the mid-semester presentation 2) More classes, where we brainstorm each others' workflow of what we would like to achieve and which workshop will help which link in the workflow",
    "This class is pretty much what you make of it, and I think that's perfect since everyone is looking for something different. But at the same timeas someone with not much knowledge of what skills are most importantit could have been nice to have a few labs in class on specific techniques. In other words, a couple of in-class workshops on topics we chose together might have been useful since it's not always easy to find what you're looking for in the wild. Overall, the professors were very supportive and helpful in trying to guide us through.",
    "Strengths: - individualized instruction - self-guided learning - regular meetings with other people in different stages of the learning process - exposure to \"big picture\" questions about how data science can be useful and where it is going - applied learning - flexible schedule - I could work on the assignment on my own time Weaknesses: - The trainings offered by CSSSI were not very good and in some cases they were poorly timed for my needs. - There were some kinks to work out since the class is pretty new. For example, the instructions for the final assignment (creating a slide in R) were not very clear."

    "Definitely take it if you have a specific skill you want to develop, and\/or a data project you want to work on.",
    "To give consistent time per week for the project and keep a log of sources used and skills learned throughout the process. The more time you are exposed or spend working with data, the better you will in acquiring fluency in R or python etc.",
    "Students need to be self-driven if they really want to learn things in this class.",
    "Pick out a project that will teach you some new skills.",
    "Do it! This class was an awesome opportunity to learn data science in a low-stress, self-guided way with a lot of support. If you are curious about data science but intimidated by taking a technical course that is specific to a specific program, field, or discipline (such as R, Python, statistics, etc) then start with this class. It solved a problem that I think many first-year students were facing, not knowing which technical skill to focus on first."
