Or also \"materials concepts as seen by electrical engineers.\"Yes, I would recommend this course to other engineering students; the instructor is good, and the workload is not overwhelming.",
    "Yes, I would. Because if the student is microelectronics track in EE, I would say the materials covered would really help to widen our view.",
