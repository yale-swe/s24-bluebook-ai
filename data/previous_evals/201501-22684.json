    "You read lots of Indian religious texts and discuss them. I would recommend it to someone who doesn't have a problem with having to read a lot.",
    "RLST 015 is a great class. If you're interested in learning about religions and reading awesome, ancient texts, this is definitely worth taking. If you're not, the class is still worth taking--it's fun, the professor is great, and the readings are really interesting. There are weekly, ungraded reading responses and two papers. Don't take this class is you're not interested in a small seminar environment, but it's a really comfortable discussion space, not intimidating at all.",
    "Great class, a lot of reading, but it's enjoyable. Definitely take it if you're interested in the subject."
