    "It depends on what you're looking for. I think English 114 will teach you how to write a really good English 114 paper, and that structure can often be extrapolated and applied to classes outside of the English department, but not necessarily always. I spent most of the semester in English 114 thinking of myself as an inadequate writer, and that's a very sad perspective to have about oneself. I think the class will make you a better writer, but it also will make you struggle to get there, so be ready for that.",
    "Be sure to find a class that suits your interests - your experience in the class may significantly expand past simply learning English skills.",
    "The class hours were used mostly for the discussion about reading assignments, and were used less for teaching writing - what is college level writing, how to write or how to improve it. So I recommend this class to those who already feel comfortable with college level writing and want to enjoy inclass discussion.",
    "I would recommend ENGL 114 18 to another student because the Anthropocene is a very recent subject that is becoming more and more important. Writing about these kinds of scientific events can be useful, and the class exposed us to several essays on the subject."
