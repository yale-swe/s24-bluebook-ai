   "comments": [
    "I enjoyed the readings for this course immensely. Spinoza, Hobbes, Sorel, De Maistre, Schmitt--they're hard to beat. The course exposed me to a philosophical milieu I had little familiarity with, that of the Counter-Enlightenment; for this new knowledge I am very glad I took the course.",
    "I learned a lot about the rationalist and anti-enlightenment traditions in Europe and how to engage with the political-theological tradition",
    "Cool and insightful survey of both sides of the political theology course",
    "A great introduction to questions and themes of political theology, as well as to some lesser-known political theorists.",
    "I learned a lot about the dialectic of modernity and its reactions, and I think that I developed a better understanding of what it is that those who reject modernity are rejecting and proposing instead. In addition I think I understand better how my beliefs relate to these criticisms. Also, especially given the size of the seminar, I think I made progress in figuring out how to interact in a seminar environment to learn and help others learn through the discussions.",
    "Biggest takeaway from this class was definitely Spinoza's TTP and Schmitt's Concept of the Political (and Strauss's response). The course was good as an intellectual history class, providing a broad overview of post-Enlightenment discourse on sovereignty\/authority, but towards the latter half of the course especially, the material that we read (de Maistre and Sorel) was not as stimulating. I left the course with a good grounding on the writers of the counter-Enlightenment."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The course was well-designed. My only suggestion would be that the first paper be assigned somewhat earlier; that way students could receive feedback sooner.",
    "This class is doing something more classes should do. I loved reading spinonza and Mann and hated Sorel. I would like to see more theologians doing poltics in addition to the political thinkers doing theology that we read",
    "Strengths -- Prof Smith and the other seminar participants had really good insights Weaknesses -- I really disliked the way it was a Q&A kind of seminar, where each student was clamouring to speak and the responses mostly had nothing to do with one another... I also didn't like how Prof Smith was tracking who spoke\/who didn't. In terms of the content, I felt quite lost from the second half of the course onwards. More guidance in reading the continental philosophers would have helped.",
    "Great syllabus, continuity of themes. Seminar discussion seemed very strong and was well-directed by Smith.",
    "Overall, this was a really great course. Prof. Smith is a wonderful seminar leader and strikes a good balance between explaining the material and allowing for discussion. The syllabus is actually pretty good, but I think it could have been more varied, especially in the second half of the semester. We could have spent only one week on Sorel, for example.",
    "Overall this was a really good class. One suggestion I have is to have a little bit better of a pre-modern segment to the course. I think a more serious engagement with political theology in, for example, the medieval era probably would have helped make the class better.",
    "Seminars were frustrating, as it felt like everyone was talking over each other. There were so many lines of thought that didn't get picked up, and even the ones that were addressed often felt disjointed and were done so only after long intervals of digression. There were times when I would ask a question about the text, but no one would answer the question and instead move on to another conversation topic. Also, Reflections on Violence should not be read in its entirety."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "I would.",
    "For sure! But I did enjoy the first half thinkers more than the second half",
    "Yes -- it's a really insightful and useful class that teaches you about the oft-unheard-of realm of political theology (as opposed to political philosophy).",
    "I would recommend this course if it's offered again. The syllabus is interesting and well-organized. The texts may seem like an eclectic mix but the 'politco-theological' themes actually develop with great continuity from week to week. Professor Smith can sometimes seem to put on airs but led the seminar very well and will make himself available to speak more outside of class if you ask.",
    "Yes! A great introduction to questions and themes of political theology, as well as to some lesser-known political theorists. Prof. Smith is a wonderful seminar leader and strikes a good balance between explaining the material and allowing for discussion.",
    "Yeah this was a cool class that wasn't too demanding of the students and helps people engage with the ideas of liberalism that they so often take for granted. It should be noted that this is not really a theology class, so don't go in thinking that's what it's going to primarily be about.",
    "Professor Smith is as good as it gets. I would definitely recommend this course, or any course with him.",
    "Title might be misleading--less about political theology and more about Carl Schmitt's (and thinkers around, before, after him) interpretation of the term. It's definitely not for everyone. Schmidtt lies in a very particular strand of political philosophy, and the course might just as well be called \"The Thinkers That Influenced Schmitt's Political Theology\". You'll encounter writers that you probably won't ever read in any other poly sci class (Sorel, de Maistre), and parts of Hobbes that isn't traditionally covered (books 3 & 4 of Leviathan). If that's your thing, then this course if for you. Otherwise there's other courses you should look into. Worth it just for the Spinoza."
