    "this is a great way to fulfill your science. it is super interesting and well-taught. prof harris wants the class to be a seminar so there can be discussions, the only problem with that was that often we didnt really know enough and so had kind of misguided discussions with a lot of misunderstandings. but other than that, highly enjoyable, not too much work but you definitely learn a lot of super interesting things!!!",
    "this class, i think, offers some of the coolest material at yale. sure, it's not taught that well, but you gotta learn this stuff!!!!! seriously.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class to another student. All science credits for non-science majors should be more like this one: without insulting the intelligence of those involved, it also does not require the advanced technical knowledge that higher level courses do. Quantum physics is an almost terrifyingly interesting field and the chance to learn a bit more about it in a non-intimidating, friendly atmosphere has been totally invaluable. I'm an English major, but I think this was probably my favorite class of the semester. It's also not too much work - not a gut by any means, but if you actually do the reading and problem sets each week you should be in no trouble.",
    "It is a discussion based class centered around teh readings. YOU HAVE TO DO THE READINGS IN DEPTH. Cannot just skim. The questions make sure you do them. I would recommend it if you need a science...it could get confusing.",
    "Physics 120 is an amazing ride through the most important questions in modern physics. You should definitely try to get in. There are really only one or two formulas you need to learn; most of the material is conceptual. The weekly problem sets are not a joke, but are easy if you've done the modest and interesting reading. The science credit, of course, is a bonus.",
    "i had high expectations which weren't entirely met. the readings were fun but classtime devolved into dumb Q and A's where the answers didn't really make sense. This should probably just be a lecture course or have a more focused seminar structure.",
    "If you're looking for a really, really easy science credit, do it. But make no mistake: this class is a COMPLETE gut, and you will learn next to nothing in it. It is very little work, and occasionally discussions are somewhat interesting so it is more than tolerable if all you're after is a credit. But if you want actual intellectual stimulation, don't look here.",
    "I would recommend Physics 201 to anyone interested in studying our physical universe. It is perhaps more work-intensive than I imagined, but ultimately, the workload is worth it. I left with a greater understanding of how the universe was formed, the quantum mechanics behind so many of our daily interactions and of course, cool theories like Many Worlds and the Copenhagen interpretation. At the end of it, you get to write a paper on a topic of your choice, which is a lot of fun.",
    "This class was alternately incredible and irritating. The material is counter-intuitive (counter-intuitiveness being one of the hallmark facets of quantum physics) and as a result, discussions are sometimes entirely too difficult to make sense of. at times, many of the students were at a loss about the implications of the material. Despite this, it's fun anda great opportunity to learn about key concepts of modern physics in a much more accessible way. There is no complicated math (very little math at all) and the bulk of the course reading comes from Scientific American articles which Professor Harris assigns. Speaking of Professor Harris, he's kind of ridiculously awesome, though this awesomeness results in him being slightly less accessible than one might want because he dashes off to Geneva 3 days of the week for his research at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). Google the LHC. If it interests you, try to take the class.",
    "Decent class, not a lot of work. Classes were largely lectures, and the \u0093discussions\u0094 were more Q&A sessions. Homework was a weekly \u0093Problem Set\u0094 of reading comprehension questions (the reading was pretty good), 1-2 quizzes, 2 quizzes, and a final paper rather than an exam. I was a little disappointed by the lack of intellectual rigor in the course \u0096 I had hoped for some more critical thinking, and a way to make it more relevant to my own life. (I mean, quantum mechanics is so revolutionary! Ought to be mind-blowing every day, but I never really had that \u0093aha!\u0094 moment.) Still, if you\u0092re looking for a fair non-major science course, PHYS 120 is a decent option.",
    "This is a strange but great class. Probably is quite different depending on who is in the class. Definitely worth it though if you enjoy the subject but don't have the math for a normal quantum physics class.",
    "ONE OF THE BEST CLASSES I HAVE TAKEN AT YALE. This is the kind of thinking I came to Yale to do--mind blowing topics that pushed me outside of my comfort zone and forced me to confront the biggest questions about the nature of the universe we live in. Professor Harris is extraordinary--such an incredible opportunity for a non-science major to work with one of the most famous physicists in the world. Weekly readings and problem sets were interesting, midterms were reasonable and final paper was the MOST INTERESTING RESEARCH IVE EVER DONE. TAKE THIS CLASS.",
    "If you have always loved the monumental questions surrounding the existence of the universe- its birth and innermost operations, absolutely you must take this class. Be prepared to work pretty hard, the homeworks take an annoyingly long amount of time. However it will satiate you Astronomy curiosities so that you have no niggling uncertainties about being a (e.g.) Lit major.",
    "Great class if you're interested in the material. If not, you'll probably not like it at all, however. Not too much work--weekly p-set but take time out to understand all the readings, they can get a bit confusing. Again, if you like relativity\/quantum physics\/string theory, you'll like the class--which is nice for those interested in science but not majoring in it.",
    "Take this course, it's great. But the class dynamic is key and the course really depends on the people who participate in class. You learn a lot of mind-blowing, life changing material and get a science credit on the way. Not bad. Plus Prof. Harris is a total badass.",
    "PHYS 120 will offer an interesting overview of some of the \"hot topics\" in quantum physics; as Prof. Harris promises, it will equip students with the ability to hold reasonably informed cocktail-party conversations on the course's subject matter, and will give them a chance to explore in greater depth one piece of the course they find most interesting. The course material - inc. an overview of general and special relativity, black holes, and more - is fascinating, and I appreciated having the chance to learn about it in a guided way, from a professor who really knows his stuff. If you aren't a scientist, but you want to learn more about the strange and spooky world of the quantum (and, for that matter, you need a science credit), take PHYS 120.",
    "The homework load was immense and extremely difficult, and class conversations did nothing to elucidate the work. Instead, we spent most of class answering students' random questions. This would have been enjoyable had we been not expected to cram for incredibly difficult exams that required teaching ourselves much of the material. However, I did learn an incredible amount about quantum physics, an extremely interesting subject. Take it at your own risk.",
    "This is the perfect science course for the intellectually curious non-science major. The material could not be more interesting, and the class could not be less stressful - the seminar format has a great vibe. Sure, there actually is work in this class, and admittedly I was worried that I wouldn't be motivated to do it. But the readings were so interesting that the weekly assignments and problem sets were never particularly taxing. The exams were very fair, and the final paper was entirely open-ended and fun. If you are looking for a pure gut, don't take it. But if you want to learn a lot, have fun, and actually get your money's worth for a Yale credit, do what you can to get into this course. I could not be more happier to have taken it. Highly recommended.",
    "A lot of work for a science credit, difficult though mind-boggling assignments, and regrettably boring (2-hr!) class sessions. Half of the students asked unanswerable questions that took up most of class and I feel that alienated many students who didn\u0092t feel particularly indignant about any unanswerable questions or frankly, didn\u0092t care. I think many students needed to be eased into the inquiry process in a way that laid a common, solid foundation about the material read for HW. Take this class only if you are willing to put in a good amount of time in it. Perhaps it will change over the years. The material itself is awesome and mind-blowing, but I only wish we got a better foundation before jumping into 2-hour long inquiry about material none of us truly have grasped."
