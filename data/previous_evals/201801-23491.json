   "comments": [
    "This course taught me several valuable techniques for interpreting historical points of view, interjecting in historiographical debates, pursuing the craft of historical evidence-based writing, and understanding the frames that have been constructed for science, medicine, and neuroscience in modern times (modern in the historical sense). I learned a lot of fascinating history as well, of course, about phrenology, craniology, neuroscience, Oliver Sacks, and so on. One big insight was into understanding the way disease, selfhood, and medicine are all socially constructed entities.",
    "I learned about the history of neurology and about how society oftentimes plays into medicine.",
    "I learned about how disorders of the brain\/nervous system were understood and explained over time. I also gained a new appreciation for the philosophical ideas that influenced ideas of brainhood.",
    "This class has furthered my interest in the study of neurology and reaffirmed my decision to become an HSHM major",
    "How to read historical medical works, and form opinions about them.",
    "Close historical analysis of primary and secondary sources; historical writing for long pieces as well as book review style writing. I learned a lot about past considerations of mind, although it was not always connected in a way that provoked greater thought.",
    "I enjoyed Professor Elder's seminar greatly. I liked the sources used and found the material to be interesting. She is a fantastic conversation facilitator and so it was rarely if ever quiet. I was able to form a more cohesive understanding of the division between neurology and psychology."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I thought this class was generally great, but I would've appreciated more input from the professor. I see the value in students conversing and learning to speak well, but a stronger foundation from the professor would have made it that much better. Also an attempt to even out some of the glaring inequalities in speaking time might have helped the class by encouraging the quieter voices to engage.",
    "Strengths: The peer review for the paper was incredibly helpful. I also liked the book review assignment, as it got me thinking about my project early on in the semester. Weaknesses: Although learning about the philosophical arguments surrounding selfhood and the brain were interesting, I found these discussions challenging without having any background in the subject. Some of the discussions surrounding selfhood were difficult to follow, so I think there could be a bit more guidance on these philosophical thoughts.",
    "The strengths are definitely the open discussions as well as the pieces professor Elder selected each week.",
    "Overall a very great course! Challenging, but super interesting!",
    "I think that discussions felt forced and disconnected between the readings in a lot of ways. I think that the professor could have done more to perhaps teach a short piece at the beginning that provided greater historical context of the material for the week, and then allowed a deeper discussion, rather than just recapping each of the readings for two hours."

   "comments": [
    "I would recommend it! The readings are fascinating and cover the issues from all different perspectives: doctors, patients, race, class, and gender. I predict the class will only get better as Dr. Elder teaches it more.",
    "Yes! Very interesting class with lots of fascinating readings.",
    "Yes, I thought this was an interesting class. In general, I enjoyed the readings. Although each week was unique, the themes of the course seemed to build on each other from week to week, which I enjoyed.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student.",
    "Yes! If youre interested about the brain, it would be great to learn the history of the field of neuroscience.",
    "Absolutely. This course explores the history of medicine through a fascinating lens: that of the way people see their brains. The variety of subjects and narratives was incredible. Workload wasn't too intense but you need to really do the reading to participate in discussion properly. She gave us a lot of freedom with choosing paper topics as well.",
    "I think that the topic is interesting and had a good foundation, but the actual discussion facilitation could be done in a way that was much more intellectually interesting, as the material itself is very rich."
