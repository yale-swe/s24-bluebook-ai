    "Spanish Grammar",
    "I gained more in-depth understandings of different subjects in Spanish grammar.",
    "This course was very useful to refine my Spanish speaking skills, and I appreciated that it stayed true to its focus on grammar because that is at the root of most problems communicating at this level of Spanish."

   "comments": [
    "I don't know if I'd say the course had any weaknesses. I can't think of how one might improve it.",
    "The course was excellent. Very well organized and well taught. The compaeros de conversacin are not extraordinarily helpful. It's a more exciting idea in theory than it's utility in practice.",
    "This course was a lot of work, and much of the homework felt redundant and insignificant. The class time was when I felt like I learned best and was most engaged. Therefore, I would suggest a heavier focus on in-class activities to reinforce lessons and less out-of-class requirements, especially taking care to eliminate assignments that reiterate the same topic.",
    "Overall the course was helpful to develop my Spanish grammar skills but I feel it would have benefitted from relying more on written work rather than exams",
    "This course depended heavily on the energy and effort of the instructor during class meeting time, so it suffered having an instructor who had very low energy, enthusiasm, and demonstrated investment.",
    "Very Effective. Very straightforward. Feels like busy work sometimes."

   "comments": [
    "If someone wanted to improve their spanish ability, or wanted to take an L5 course but wasn't fully confident in their abilities, I would recommend this course.",
    "If you want to learn advanced Spanish then this is a great course.",
    "I would only recommend this course if the student is particularly passionate about grammar or mentally prepared to put in a heavy amount of work. Otherwise, I would suggest a different course for L5 credit.",
    "Yea if the primary objective of a student is to advance their grammar skills. No if they want to learn about culture and greatly improve their written and oral command of Spanish",
    "I would recommend that another student should do research on the possible instructors for this course before determining that they will take it.",
    "Very straightforward class that does exactly what it says it will - teaches Spanish grammar. Not necessarily very interesting, but effective. Doable after AP Spanish.",
    "I would recommend this course to other students who truly want to improve their mastery of the Spanish language. For students who just want to get a language credit, this workload was pretty heavy.",
    "I would recommend this course to any student who comes in a freshman looking to improve the Spanish they already know or to any upperclassman who has completed the other levels and wants to get to the root of any communication issues."
