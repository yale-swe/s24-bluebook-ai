    "The first semester of the senior essay isn't all too bad, though you certainly have to have some stuff figured out by the end of the semester. It does a good job keeping you on track.",
    "It is what you make of it. Just remember to not slack off - you'll really regret it.",
    "A lot of research followed by a burst of activity to turn in your \"draft.\" Slow and steady, people, slow and steady.",
    "Not much choice here. My only advice is to pick an advisor that will force you to stay on top of your work.",
    "Pick a topic and start researching",
    "If you are a senior history major, you must take this course to graduate.",
    "Senior Essay! It's a really interesting experience, but you have to take it anyway.",
    "If you're a history major then yes....",
    "Beginnings of the senior essay. Basically desperately searching for something to write and then struggling to write it on top of all your other work. Not really a very useful first semester, but could be fantastic if you love your topic and work steadily.",
    "Well, its required for the major...make the most of your advisor. The deadlines help you stay on track, and the senior essay guide is a great resource, but if you don't keep in touch with your advisor you'll wonder what you were doing all semester.",
    "Mandatory.",
    "Yes...you have to take it if you are a history major",
    "Must take for senior majors. Make sure you stay on top of deadlines. Get as much done first semester (and over the summer) as possible!",
    "Um, I guess yes, if you are a history major since you have to take it to graduate.",
    "Run. Run far, far away from the senior essay. Better to transfer or drop out of school.",
    "Great",
    "Only if you're a history major.",
    "Necessary for the major.",
    "It's the senior essay: you have to take, but don't worry, it's not that scary.",
    "It must be done. But it is also a truly enjoyable experience, if you get into your topic.",
    "If you're a history major, you'll have to take this. Just get your work done now, it will put you in a good place for second semester."
