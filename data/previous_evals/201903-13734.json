    "I gained an overview of energy economics and policy relating to traditional fossil fuel sources as well as electricity markets, renewable energy, etc and learned frameworks for addressing energy-related externalities such as air pollution, climate impacts, etc.",
    "Deeper and more research\/evidenced based understanding of energy economics, as well as the economic theory underpinning necessary policy changes for renewable energy, energy efficiency, transportation and climate change mitigation.",
    "I learned valuable techniques for policy and economic analaysis, which I'm sure will help me in my post graduation endevours too.",
    "This course is a terrific deep dive into the economics of a variety of energy systems, to the extent that material can be covered in a semester. It is mostly focused on the U.S., but also includes a variety of examples from global energy systems. The problem sets and final project provide students a material to learn applied energy economics modeling skills, although it is assumed that students have a certain background in these skills from prior coursework.",
    "How basic economic principles relate to the energy sector and how this can be utilized to analyze policy",
    "Deeper understanding in general of energy economics.",
    "Most all of the material and skills were new to me.",
    "I developed a broad understanding of the major issues, questions and debates relevant to energy economics.",
    "I learned a lot about energy markets in the U.S. and how to use my R skills practically on the group project. I also learned a lot about various energy policies.",
    "Deepened my understanding in energy system and energy economics. The final project is also very meaningful and learned a lot about modeling.",
    "Understanding of the energy system at a deep level, as well as the policies in the sector around the world and the economic models used to evaluate them.",
    "Electricity, renewable, and transportation policies as pertains to economic theory. We discussed equity concerns Associated with implementations of policies.",
    "Knowledge of policies that govern renewable energy projects, energy efficiency as well as the oil and gas industry as well as the pros and cons of each",
    "Detailed overview of energy policy landscape and trends in industry. All of this information is tied back to the foundational economics that drive it.",
    "Lots of different methods of how to calculate the effects of different policies.",
    "energy economy",
    "Economics, Energy Policy, Renewable Energy financing",
    "How to analyze policies around energy and natural resources.",
    "Very good and road knowledge of energy economics",
    "Excellent course that covered a wide range of energy policy and economics. Exactly what I was hoping for.",
    "It seems a little cheating, giving a review of this class as an auditor. I learne to speak fluently and competently about energy markets and understand the various policies levers which are currently in place to incentivize clean energy development in the US and some international countries",
    "Through this course I learned a great deal about energy economics and renewable energy. Because of it I am better able to understand an industry I would like to work in.",
    "A general understanding of issues in energy policy making and the economic basis behing the decisions",
    "This was a great application of the economic skills I have learned in an area that I am very interested in. I learned a lot about recent research on energy and environmental economics.",
    "Great understanding of energy economics, covering a range of topics from \"traditional\" oil and gas economics to efficiency and renewable energy. Good dive into a specific area of energy economics for group projects -- reasonable amount of work, great and relevant readings for anyone interested in energy (can take some time if you are going to do all of them -- but typically relevant).",
    "The course material was excellent and I must say that I learnt a lot from this course. It covered the topics of energy policy and economics quite comprehensively with sufficient depth as well. I am glad to have learnt about a lot of new concepts like the social cost of carbon, emissions trading, policies and incentives governing the energy sector. The course captures well the complex transitions occurring in the energy sector and gave me a stronger grasp of the important elements and developments in this sector.",
    "Learned a lot about the energy system and how to apply economic reasoning to thinking about it."

   "comments": [
    "This class was pretty much exactly what the title implied.",
    "They met my expectations.",
    "My expectations from the course were fully met. The course encourages hands on learning, which was highly appreciated.",
    "The knowledge, skills and insights exceeded my expectations, although I think I would have gotten more out of the class had I reviewed basic economic concepts and calculus more recently, as well as had I already taken a course on renewable energy project finance (which I intend to take AFTER this course).",
    "Very well",
    "Very well",
    "The class exceeded my expectations",
    "In general, the knowledge and skills gained aligned quite well with my expectations.",
    "It aligned well with my expectations.",
    "I believe they aligned pretty well with my expectations.",
    "They exceeded my expectations. Even though the class is very dense, it's all interconnected which gives an opportunity to understand everything as a system and get an insight of what really matters and how you can use the current knowledge as a basis for either implementation or further research.",
    "Very well",

    "Met my expectations.",
    "Exceeded expectations.",
    "Great",

    "Very well. This was a great course.",
    "Well",
    "Very well.",
    "Yes - I was told this through the energy concentration grapevine that this was one of the best classes to take in order to understand the political realities and tools available for clean energy. The project was especially useful in that regard - it gave me a much better understanding of the political levers being used for offshore wind in the US.",
    "Completely aligned.",
    "Pretty well",
    "Perfectly.",
    "Very well aligned. Great discussion of market failures in energy economics and policies that can be used to help us move along in the energy transition.",
    "The course certainly met and exceeded my expectations and I would possibly revisit many of topics covered during the course.",
    "I expected a bit more quantitative economics to be emphasized in the course lectures (the lectures ended up being more about the energy system\/discussing academic papers). Prof. Gillingham expects that students will come in with an adequate level of economics-applicable quantitative reasoning ability and that he won't have to spend time on developing those skills."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of the course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I think we spent kind of long at the beginning on oil, and the beginning of the class could be tightened to leave more room for renewables at the end. I especially wish we had covered more about electricity markets. The project selection process is problematic: using the online process resulted in my group being too big and not being able to do anything about it. Also, the exam could be re-balanced away from quantitative work. It seems wrong to me that a full 50% of the exam is assessing something that we spent 0% of class time on. It's fine to assign quantitative homeworks, but it's totally mismatched to spend 100% of class teaching us about qualitative things and then have that be only 50% of the exam.",
    "The course was a good overview of energy econ and policy, I think the final project was a good way to do a deeper dive into a topic of interest, but i think the group size of the final project makes the logistics challenging and it might be more effective to have smaller groups.",
    "I really enjoyed the course, appreciated the rigor of problem sets, the exam, and the final project. I loved the content covered and any time there was discourse\/discussion in the class. I would have appreciated more guidance on the specific research and analysis expectations for the final project. I also could have used fewer visual reminders in the slides that 99% of economists are white men. I also would have loved if more time had been dedicated to unpacking and understanding the economic underpinnings of different policies for spurring renewable energy development and their success\/failures in different contexts (RPS, FIT, etc.). Finally - while the required readings are fantastic choices, there is little strict incentive to read all \"required\" readings which lessens the feeling that they are actually required. At the same time, I would never have had enough time to read all of the required readings each week. Not sure what the right balance is - maybe it's fewer problem sets and a weekly short write-up required for readings.",
    "Cant think of anything.",
    "The course is well-balanced in terms of the curriculum and its distribution of topics covered throughout the semester. The workload is high and problem sets are doable but difficult. It would have been helpful if the TAs had arranged for a multi-session skills recap at the beginning of the semester, or if the professor coordinates with the professor of Energy Systems Modeling to find synergies in terms of skills-building between the two classes.",
    "Strengths- very organized, clear expectations, great lectures, fair amount of work, quick grading, lots of feedback Weaknesses- none",
    "Some of the renewable energy policy content seemed repetitive but maybe thats just the nature of the political environment",
    "The class was interactive, interesting, informative and challenging. I'm not sure it could be improved significantly.",
    "I really enjoyed many of the course readings and the in-class discussions. I also appreciated how Professor Gillingham took great care to annotate the readings and make it clear which sections to prioritize. At times I felt the course went a little too slowly and that more information could have been included in each lecture. I would have liked to spend more time, in particular, on the details of energy\/power\/capacity markets and to bring in a few more current examples (e.g. some of the policy debates going on at FERC).",
    "I thought the problem sets helped cement the concepts in class and thought the group project was a great way to apply what we learned in the class to a real world scenario. However, I do wish the presentations for our final projects could have run smoother and that there were more instructions for the logistical aspects of that process.",
    "I believe this is a very nice class and I really enjoyed it.",
    "The course is very well structured in a way that makes sense and is very easy to follow. The only weakness may be that since the professor loves student participation, it sometimes takes too much time to wait until someone answers very insignificant questions, time that could be used explaining something else or asking more relevant and interesting questions.",
    "I thought the course generally moved a little slowly. I felt like I was on top of Much of what we discussed in class and would not have minded a faster pace. I loved the electricity and transportation sections. Martens lecture was a highlight. I thought the energy efficiency section was too focused on behavioral response as opposed to top-down policy options. Ken was an amazing teacher and is great at responding to feedback and questions from the class. I enjoyed our discussions and Mini debates. I appreciated that equity was a constant theme in the course.",
    "Strong policy focus. The teaching approach is more geared towards providing general information on broad concepts and does not focus on application of the knowledge. While problem sets made up for this gap, it would have been more helpful to reduce the content to make time to understand how concepts can be applied in class",
    "Ken is a fantastic instructor who knows this material as well as anyone. Sometimes classroom discussion were too drawn out and we didn't move as quickly as I would have liked. I would also like to see more guest speakers from the business or policy spaces.",
    "Strengths: Professor Gillingham is a great lecturer. His classes are well organized in materials as well as his handouts that are provided for the class. The homeworks were great; they were challenging but manageable. I felt like I learned new things by doing the assignments. Weaknesses: I was one of the students that needed to leave early to make it to a 10:10 class at SOM. Moving the class by 15 mins helped, but with the construction wasnt enough. I felt like I was always disrupting both Kens class by leaving early and my next class as I arrived late. Weakness: The final exams last question was poorly written. The toughest part of the problems was keeping the units straight. As an engineer, I recognize how important unit conversions are, however I didnt think that was the goal of the exam.",
    "Great",
    "It was pretty much US-centric",
    "It might be improved with some kind of guide for the problem sets.",
    "Big workload",
    "I thought the course was great, went into enough detail without getting bogged down. Perhaps a few more examples of international energy markets and policy would have been nice, it was heavily USA focused, and outside of the USA only really touched on Europe. More examples from BRIC and developing economies would have been a useful addition.",
    "Strengths - great lectures, good feedback Weakness - there were some office hours available for students, but I feel that Ken mostly focused on his research.",
    "Problem sets were key for learning. More problem sets and no exam would be better.",
    "Having both the classical lecture and psets as well as a term projects makes the learning process comprehensive and flexible",
    "Strength - Professor's extensive knowledge on topic, great TAs Weakness - Very large class, too early in the morning",
    "I felt that there could have been more effort to guide the final term project with more interim support and deadlines.",
    "Professor is great, problem sets are relevant, group projects are a great chance for a deep dive. Sometimes felt as if we could have moved a bit more quickly through some material -- oil markets were interesting, for example, but could have been nice to spend some more time getting into transportation and cities, etc... (which felt a little rushed towards the end of the year)",
    "The course material was well organized and I wouldn't change much about the curriculum except perhaps add a section covering major companies operating in the energy sector and their business activities or profiles. I would also encourage greater distribution of notes for exams and a bit more correlation between topics contained in them.",
    "All around this was a good class for those who want to learn more about the energy system from the perspective of an economist. However, after taking Prof. Kotchen's economics class last spring, the problem sets in this class were pretty confusing since they were set up and written very differently. It seemed like most of the students found the problem sets to be confusing and not written in an intuitive way."
