    "I would not recommend this class as I didn't get much out of it.",
    "This was a very interesting class, covering a fascinating period in Russian (and world) history. The readings were quite good, and the discussions were pretty solid. Prof. Brinegar is obviously very knowledgeable about the subject; she could be a bit better at leading discussions, but this will come with experience. Workload was probably on the heavier side, but not extraordinary.",
    "Definitely take it. Russia in the era of Revolutions is a fascinating subject. Professor Brinegar is great. The discussions are good and the readings are fascinating. Overall a very, very good History seminar."
