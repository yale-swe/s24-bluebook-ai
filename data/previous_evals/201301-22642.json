    "Spanish is a fantastic and useful language to learn! I feel like the Spanish program\/classes here at Yale does a good job teaching the language -- especially to those who are picking it up for the first time. I can't speak for all of the Span L2 classes, but I found my class, in particular, to be very helpful and amusing. It was nice to start my days with this class.",
    "A great way to learn the Spanish language and to fulfill a distributional requirement for those who need it. There's always some work to be done, but it almost never feels overwhelming.",
    "Good intro class to Spanish language, but necessary to take upper level class to gain knowledge in speaking.",
    "A very interactive class. Made great progress over the semester.",
    "An intensive intermediate spanish class",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. Coming from a high school that did not put much emphasis on the language department, I really appreciated the way the class was set up.",
    "I prefer language classes that are conversation heavy, so this wasn't my favorite class. But for someone who is used to studying languages from textbooks, Professor Piazza is great."
