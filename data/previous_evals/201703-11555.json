    "Math 112 taught me almost all of high school calculus and more within the given three months. It was a very difficult course but it is definitely important to have taken a calculus class here at Yale.",
    "I learned a lot of single variable calculus",
    "I learned basic understanding of calculus.",
    "Good base in calculus.",
    "I gained a deeper unferstanding of the basic fundamentals of calculus.",
    "I learned how to solve problems mathematically and better understood key calculus principles.",
    "I learned the basis of differential calculus and gained new deductive and analytical skills.",
    "Problem solving and critical thinking",
    "This course reinforced a lot of the calculus work I had already done in high school while giving me a greater fundamental understanding.",
    "I learnt about the philosophy of Calculus. Coming from high school where maths was just fact, it was interesting to see where the differentiation equations came from and the power of estimation. I had never done limits before but I had covered the other material in high school. Because it was the first section covered, this made the first midterm the most challenging for me. I also never thought it was possible to do maths without a calculator but this course has shown me the power behind factoring and the meaningful applications of other mathematical computations. I am always interested to know where things come from so I really enjoyed that aspect of the course. Thank you Maths 112.",
    "I learned the basic skills of calculus I. I also developed the skill to apply these basic principles to many different questions.",
    "I learned a basic understanding of calculus, but don't feel that I learned its applications.",
    "I feel significantly better at math after this course. Not only does the course go extremely in depth on single variable calculus, you will also strengthen your pre-calculus base in the process.",
    "I learned basic calculus.",
    "Got the skills needed for an econ degree",
    "Learning theorems and recognizing various kinds of problems, and developing the skills to apply tools and techniques in succession to break down tricky problems."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "This course goes by very fast and the information given in class is much simpler than what seems to be on the exams. There is a lot of information taught in a short amount of time and it can be hard to understand when not spending a sufficient amount of time on.",
    "Sometimes Psets were not too related to exam questions.",
    "Strengths is the material. Weaknesses is that it disadvantages those who haven't take calculus before.",
    "Strength: Lots of practice Weakness: Lot of time",
    "I think that the tests were much harder than the problems we worked on in class but overall the explanations of topics were good.",
    "Less webassigns would be an improvement. Too many webassigns took away from learning new content.",
    "Strengths-straightforward Weaknesses-there should be more group collaboration",
    "The teacher was very good at explaining concepts and going through example problems in class.",
    "Strengths: Peer tutors and office hours were readily available and helpful. Weaknesses: Sometimes the class material was taught in a scattered manner, and had to be clarified by email.",
    "I think the content of the class was a good set-up for further calculus classes. However, I do think that less time could be spent on approximation methods. The sequence of lessons was logical and easy to follow. I personally found the teaching style of my TA to be relatively disorganized, which was something I struggled with, however, the overall content of the course was very manageable and approachable, as was the workload.",
    "WebAssign is an effective tool to work on your skills and understanding on certain topics. I also felt that I had to teach myself a lot of concepts to truly understand everything.",
    "Strengths, nothing. weakness, hard if you never took calculus before.",
    "You need it for the econ degree",
    "The daily worksheets and readily available office hours were key to grasping the expansive concepts covered in this class. Without Daping's readiness to help each student understand, this class would have been hard to succeed in."

   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this course to a student looking to fulfill and QR credit here at Yale. Although it is a challenging course it is very rewarding with the knowledge gained by taking this course.",
    "Math 112 is not super interesting, but definitely take the course with Daping if you can.",
    "Yes it's necessary for Econ.",
    "Yes, if you need a better understanding of basic calculus this will do the trick.",
    "I would recommend this course because it provides a challenge while still being relatively easy math concepts.",
    "Yes it is a good course for math skills.",
    "Yes I would recommend it to other students looking to get a basis in Calculus 1.",
    "Yes it gives you a good base in math",
    "I would recommend this course as a helpful interaction to calculus, or a refresher of things already learned in high school.",
    "I would recommend the class to people with very little prior exposure to calculus.",
    "Yes I would. It is an excellent introduction to calculus and it makes you start thinking about real life mathematical applications.",
    "I would recommend this course to other Yale students because it gives great background to many other courses.",
    "Yes, only if you want to have an understanding in calculus or it is a prerequisite for your major. Unnecessary otherwise.",
    "Yes, there is no shame in taking this course, I personally learned a lot.",
    "Only take this class if you have to. If you have the opportunity to take Math 115, take that instead, don't go down to math 112 because it's easier, it is not.",
    "Yes take this course!! Much easier than 115 and quite easy to do well on.",
    "Yes, it is a very engaging and interesting math class. If you don't like math, then don't take this course. It depends on your professor, but if you commit to showing up to class and office hours and reaching out to peers, you will learn a lot and do very well."
