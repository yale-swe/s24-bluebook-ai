   "comments": [
    "A class in which you will study wonderful pieces of nonfiction writing, looking to tease out the authors' structure and voice. I would recommend this course to others in the sense that you will learn a lot about how to structure your own work. However, be prepared for a competitive class environment that can be exhausting and demoralizing and can take away from the fun of what is otherwise an interesting course.",
    "One of my favorite courses this semester, and probably one of the most valuable class experiences I've had at Yale. It takes a few weeks for everyone to acclimate to Prof. Strebeigh's very particular teaching style. But you will read great things (from the reader and from your classmates) and have a blast, and spend lots of time with one of the most tirelessly enthusiastic and warm-hearted teachers at Yale.",
    "A good but not great nonfiction writing course in which you'll learn some helpful techniques for writing pieces with structure and voice and get a chance to write two nonfiction pieces of your own. The time puts real limits on the kind of writing and reporting you can do, and so do the class's requirements (especially about voice) so you probablywon't write the best thing you've ever written. You'll probably be comparing this to other nonfiction classes. I haven't taken Brill's Journalism class but in my opinion if you have a choice between this and Anne Fadiman's 469, there's no contest -- take 469. If you have a chance to take both, though, this class is definitely worth it; I do think I came out of it as a better writer.",
    "If you get in, take it. Strebeigh is all intensity and energy. But he's also so buoyantly excited by your writing and your work that it's really encouraging. You get out of this class what you put in. The group workshopping tactic is unique and actually very constructive.",
    "This is a class that will change the way you think about writing forever. You will learn how to empathize deeply with a reader's thoughts and write with an audience in mind. It will change the way you write papers and any piece of journalism in the future. You must take it.",
    "Definitely take this class! Professor Strebeigh is terrific \u00e2\u0080\u0094 engaging, energetic and insightful. Best creative writing class I've taken at Yale. You can see people improve as workshops progress throughout the semester.",
    "Take it, without a doubt. This is one of the best classes on nonfiction writing you'll find at Yale, and its focus on two specific aspects of writing is very valuable. If you're serious about journalism or nonfiction in general, do it.",
    "I would recommend it if you're interested in particular topics beforehand and you like reporting. This class emphasizes good reporting and fact-finding in addition to good writing and that kind of thoroughness comes most easily if you have a pre-existing interest or two or are naturally curious and want to explore topics in the area on your own drive. This class provides the perform place to get school credit and excellent peer review for what could be a long piece you write for a campus publication. It's a good deal, in other words, and a fun experience with a good class.",
    "Take this class if you can get in. There is no better writing course at Yale.",
    "Yes. Students are smart and Prof. Strebeigh leads excellent discussions. Reporting is time-intensive, but you will reap the rewards if you devote yourself to your pieces."
