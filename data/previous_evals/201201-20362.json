   "comments": [
    "It's a class where you learn about techniques that you will probably end up doing at some point during your thesis research. It will help you do them properly and give you new ideas for your thesis research as well (when you look at the dusty, old notes from the class 2 years after taking it). Do not panic if you don't understand what's going on during the lectures; the professor might not be very good at explaining it, and your peers are probably just as lost. Befriend some biophysicists and biochemists, and have them explain things to you.",
    "I would recommend",
    "No, but unfortunately it is required.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to all students planning on doing any chembio\/bio research.",
    "Yes, this is a good course for getting a broad overview of biophysical\/biochemical techniques that you will most likely come across during your research.",
    "It gives a good overview of various biochemical, cell biology& biophysical techniques. If these techniques would become relevant to a student's research, I would recommend it. But I probably would not recommend it to a student interested in genomics or bioinformatics.",
    "Given my research interests, I did not benefit so much from this class, so I'm not sure I would recommend this class.",
    "overall it wasn't a bad course to take. hopefully the grading won't be difficult.",
    "I would recommend it, though I think a lot more hands on work needs to be done.",
    "I would not recommend this class for a fellow student.",
    "An overview of the latest methods in biochemistry and biophysics taught as a mixture of lectures and discussions about papers.I would not recommend it to a student interested in genomics, however I would recommend it if they are interested in the topic.",
    "Perfect course, I really enjoy taking up so many fancy techniques and getting a general big picture of biochemistry methods like microscopy, mathematic model etc.I would definitely recommend this course to other students.",
    "Yes, I recommend the course. It is a course when you could learn a lot of very usefully techniques and their applications.",
    "i would or would not recommend this course based on the fellow student; some topics may be very useful whereas others may not"

   "comments": [
    "I think it did a great job showing off the breadth of techniques available to us in the future when we do our thesis projects and beyond. I have no idea how it will contribute to my dissertation or research yet; check back in 5 years.",
    "gives me an overview of the current state of the art in many science methods",
    "It will aid in all aspects of my future research",
    "I have a much better understanding of laboratory techniques and what methods are available for my dissertation\/research. I predict that this course will contribute a great deal to my research in the future.",
    "My research here will be focusing on genomics and bioinformatics. So a lot of the techniques are not directly relevant. But it was definitely interesting to learn.",
    "I really wished that I walked away from this class with a deeper understanding of techniques I don't have the chance to use in my lab. Getting hands on practice with some microscopy techniques would have better contributed to my dissertation research.",
    "i have a better understanding of biochemical techniques that i would otherwise not use.",
    "It did deepen my understanding of the scientific approach to biology.",
    "I think I learned useful concepts\/techniques from this course, but this course could be greatly improved if discussion sessions were held with professors in all instances. I spent alot of time learning the material myself and going through the literature myself, which was good, but I think i would have gotten more out of it if the course had been structured differently.",
    "This course was described as being an 'essential' requirement for the MCDB track (along with genetics and cell biology in the 1st semester), however I have heard this is not necessarily true. Personally I did not find this course relevant to my proposed area of research (genomics) and resented having to attend in place of other, more relevant, courses. In the future it would be good to clarify whether students have to take this course.",
    "I enlarged my horizon by getting to know the current technique and approach as we address biological questions. The discussion also prepared me better for the application of these method than just knowing the basic mechanisms.",
    "This course allow us to learn a lot of techniques. And identify the strengths and weakness of thetechniques. So, for the research, we have more option for make experiments",
    "it was helpful to hear of certain techniques i did not know existed"
