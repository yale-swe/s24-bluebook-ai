   "comments": [
    "Econ 111 is more straightforward than 110. It's pretty laid back with Prof. Alonso.",
    "Take it if you like Econ",
    "I would, ultimately. But only because it's a prerequisite for many upper level economics courses.",
    "The class is a non-math and non-logic intensive basic overview of macroeconomics.",
    "A very very good course. You'll come away with an in-depth understanding of the foundations of macroeconomics, important tools, techniques, and models, and also a great deal of content directly applicable to understanding real news and world affairs. Some of my favorite parts of the course were analyzing the recent financial crisis and ensuing recession (and examining how it changed some of our economic models), learning how central banks actually influence economies, and how they choose what to do, and covering a few fascinating topics where multiple plausible answers exist and economists are divided over which is correct. It was also enjoyable to learn the important relations and interactions between unemployment, inflation, growth, interest rate, the money supply, price level, and others.There is some overlap with microeconomics, but surprisingly little. Essentially all the material was new to me, and all of it seemed worth learning.The textbook is absolutely fantastic. It is extremely well-written and lucidly clear. It doesn't skip over any important cases or details, but it also manages to be pretty succinct and great for reference. Since the material the course covers is almost entirely covered in the book, it's a fantastic resource to have.The homework assignments are generally straightforward and are graded leniently, though sometimes there can be tricky questions. The midterm was decently difficult, but was curved to make the actual grades reasonable. The final was less difficult, but still not easy.Professor Alonso's first few lectures weren't stellar, but as soon as she got intothe bulk of the material, her lectures became much better. They were generally engaging and interesting, though her teaching and way of explaining content may take some getting used to. She is an extremely knowledgeable economist and knows the course's material backwards and forwards. She's very helpful with answering questions and explaining confusing material one-on-one. She's also a tremendously nice person and a wonderful human being.I would absolutely encourage you to take the macroeconomics seminar. The content of the course is definitely enjoyable and worth learning. Professor Alonso is a great professor to have, though you can always shop several sections of the course and pick the professor you learn from best.",
    "I would love to recommend this class because I found the material quite interesting. The professor really discouraged me, however. I remember reading the poor reviews before I signed up, but I thought I could get through by doing all the reading. I did end up doing this, but it made the process grueling. There are so many interesting, well-taught classes at Yale. It's unfortunate when you end up taking one that is so poorly taught.",
    "Yes, especially for possible economic majors. The seminar setting gives students opportunity to ask questions in lectures.",
    "This class was very difficult - not in content, but rather in mental endurance. Prof. Alonso was not the most interesting lecturer, to say the least, and I frequently left a class significantly more confused than I entered it. To her credit, Prof. Alonso was very responsive to e-mailed questions, but I (and fellow students) needed to ask many because her classes were so unclear."
