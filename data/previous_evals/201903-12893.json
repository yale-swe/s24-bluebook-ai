   "comments": [
    "I understand it wasn't exactly a methods course, but I would have liked to have had more hands on time with the software. I also wouldn't have minded more overviews of the theoretical material, whether as a lecture or in some kind of supplementary reading, as it wasn't always clear to me what the takeaway of the readings was, at least initially. If I had been able to say before sitting down to read: \"these articles are all an example of phenomenon X as discussed in Y\" I think I could have read more effectively. All of this information was there implicitly, but as a beginner, it's not always clear what the important information is. On the other hand, there is definitely something to be said for the sink-or-swim approach to learning where you just keep going till it all starts to make sense. The only other thing is that there was a pretty wide range of ability\/degree of familiarity with the material among the students, which made some discussions difficult for those of us who were new",
    "The strengths of this class provided a wide variety of papers that demonstrated the various applications of network methods and theories. It was great to see how diverse the field is. I think, however, that the class would benefit from including more room for discussion and practice of actual analytical or data gathering methods. Methods were discussed occasionally in the class but we're very rarely the focus, and this would add an additional layer of skill development to the course. I also thought the reading load was a but excessive. Perhaps if one or two papers were dropped and replaced with a methods exercise, that would be a good compromise. Then half the class could be used for discussion of readings and the other half could be for skill development.",
    "The course was very strong in terms of content. I think sometimes the class seemed to be on different wavelengths when it came to reading and discussing the readings in the course, but this is mostly because of the eclectic backgrounds of the students in the course. Because of this, sometimes topics could be too simple for some students and, at other times, too advanced for other students. This is not the fault of the teacher or the course design, but perhaps there could be more than one social network class, where one is more introductory key ideas, and another class that is more advanced."

    "yes, if they were interested in the material",
    "Yes, for an introduction to social network analysis.",
    "Yes, I think, even if one does not want to conduct social network analysis, the course is important for understanding the basic methods and theory behind the work. The course also includes a broad array of subtopics and therefore allows for a number of pathways into social network analysis, crossing a number of different interests."
