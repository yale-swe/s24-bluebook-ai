   "comments": [
    "I would summarize Health 081 as a way for students to learn in detail about several issues at the forefront of medicine and science today. I think the class is enlightening about a lot of the larger institutions and corporations that are involved in medicine and science and it was extremely interesting to learn about that. I would recommend this class to all pre-med and non-pre med students alike!",
    "This course provides a useful new perspective on the issues we may eventually be faced with in health professions. I would recommend this course, as it helps broaden and enrich our views on this matter so we can make informed and responsible decisions later on in our careers.",
    "The title says it all: you will learn about issues in medicine and public health. I would definitely recommend it to someone if they are interested in the field or have a general curiosity about the subject.",
    "HLTH 081 is a relatively lower stress class that allows students who are both dipping their toes in and already interested in public health or how issues in the news and in medicine effect society as a whole both in reality and just mentally. Even those who haven't found their passion for the area would find it an interesting class as it explores a wide variety of topics from bioethics to e-cigarettes. I would definitely recommend this class to a fellow student who is at a more introductory level as it's both interesting and informative.",
    "This seminar is a great way for students to be introduced to the effect of media on public health. I would recommend it for anyone pursuing a degree in public health, medicine, or journalism. Professor Bazell has professional experience in media and is knowledgeable on many common health issues. I learned a lot about health from this class and thought it was interesting. It would definitely be appealing to students of all interests.",
    "I would recommend this class to anybody with an interest in public health. It's very interesting and informative, the class is fun, and Dr. Bazell is a great teacher.",
    "I recommend this class for anyone interested in medicine or public health, and even to those not interested in pursuing those topics, because it is important to learn what is taught in this class. After taking this class, you will look at the media and medical world with a more critical eye, and understand the reasons why a lot of what goes on goes on."
