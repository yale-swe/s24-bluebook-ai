    "A great way to round out your French grammar and reading skills. The workload is a lot, but at times it is fun.",
    "If you want to be fluent in french, this is a step in the right direction.",
    "Definitely take this course with Madame Burton. She is very organized and pleasant, and has expertise in WWII France. French 140 is a LOT of work, but I think my French has improved more this year than in all my years of middle school\/high school instruction.",
    "I would certainly recommend this class. It is challenging and fast-paced, but you will improve as a French writer and speaker, without a doubt. The cultural themes of the course also give the class an extra depth that many grammar classes lack."
