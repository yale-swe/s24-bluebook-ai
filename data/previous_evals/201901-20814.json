    "I learned how to become a better writer in terms of clarity, character development, plot development, and story structure.",
    "I learned about the basic elements of writing a story, including setting, dialogue, and characterization. Since this was my first course in fiction, I got to experiment with a new genre of writing that excites me.",
    "Professor Choi does an awesome job in the first weeks of focusing on specific skills: dialogue, setting, revision. I had never taken a fiction course that focused on specific details on how learning to read fiction affects our ability to write fiction.",
    "I learned how to be my intentional when crafting fiction: reading the short readings we were assigned definitely helped me with this.",
    "I learned how to employ different fiction writing skills."

    "Good format, standard\/classic. Would keep the readings in first half as is as they were useful.",
    "Professor Chois comments were always generous and helpful. Sometimes your peers dont put as much thought into their responses, which is a little frustrating.",
    "A strength of the course is the workshop environment. Being able to talk over creative decisions with peers who are also writing fiction is such a valuable and intimate environment. A weakness of the course is because of the need for intimacy all students should be willing to share.",
    "I cant think of any major weaknesses! The class was rather well organized. However, the workshop format and the many consecutive workshops we had became tiring after a whileperhaps alternating workshop classes with classes to discuss readings would be better.",
    "The readings exposed me to various different forms of fiction, the workshops helped me in the revision process, and Susans feedback was phenomenal."

Second, this course is a great form for you to improve your fiction writing, given you'll spend most your time editing either your pieces or workshopping your classmate's.",
    "Yes!!",
    "Yes!!!! Professor Choi is a warm, humble, and kind. On top of being a wonderful person, she is an excellent teacher who gives clear, thorough feedback on all your work.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone who wants to try their hand at writing fiction or have a low-key, encouraging environment in which to push an already-existing passion for fiction.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this to any student who is interesting in improving their creative writing and wants feedback.",
    "Absolutely! Professor Choi gives wonderful, meticulous feedback and is a great instructor overall. Hearing her comments on your work will be invaluable.",
    "Yes! Susan is an amazing teacher, and you are encouraged to find your own voice throughout the course."
