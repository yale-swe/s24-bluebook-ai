   "comments": [
    "An appreciation for the nuances of these two philosophers and their philosophies. It was a very interesting class.",
    "This class pushed me harder intellectually than all of my other classes from this semester! I was able to engage much more with Latin text than I ever have before, and I now have an even better appreciation for the language. Professor Solodow taught each of us not only to think about the Latin itself but the meaning behind the Latin and the deliberate choices an author made. He was not merely teaching us what to find in texts, but he was teaching us how to reach a conclusion on our own.",
    "This course was exceptional both in terms of knowledge, skills, and insights gleaned. Professor Solodow made sure not only to engage the students with the Latin translation of the philosophical texts he chose, but in fact he went far beyond this, immersing us completely in the ideas of the time. In addition to translation skills, I feel that my writing skills and analytical skills were greatly refined.",
    "Increased my understanding and appreciation of Lucretius\/Epicureanism and Seneca\/Stoicism",
    "I used more skills than I developed in this course, but I got a treatment of two Roman philosophers which I hadn't encountered in any other course. It was very worthwhile."

   "comments": [
    "Fantastic class.",
    "It was a lot of work and it was hard to tell whether you were improving or doing well. If there were shorter assignments, I think my latin might have improved, but I relied on shortcuts because I simply did not have time to keep up.",
    "This class at times had an inconsistent amount of translating. While Professor Solodow did make adjustments to the syllabus to make it more manageable, I certainly remember a few ties that the load was not fitting a \"bridge\" level curriculum. I also wish that I had been able to review more of the grammar in this class. Instead of just quizzing us on the grammar, I wish we had spent just a bit more time on it even just within half of a class on one day. As for strengths, Professor Solodow did an incredible job ensuring that we were all appreciating and engaging with the texts to our best abilities. I love how this class was structured as a class of discussion, not as merely a class of translation. He encouraged us to think about the meanings not just what the Latin said.",
    "Strengths: quantity of material covered, depth of material covered Weaknesses: first essay required comparing\/contrasting a passage that was not studied in class, which made writing the essay difficult",
    "I enjoyed the course a great deal as it was."

   "comments": [
    "Absolutely would recommend. Professor Solodow is an incredible professor, take as many classes with him as you can. The material is interesting, workload is quite manageable.",
    "Definitely. Professor Solodow is a pleasure to learn with and you will start to get an idea of why studying Latin is as important as it's been for the last several centuries.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS! Professor Solodow is the most engaged professor you can have, and he makes you a better thinker and learner. While the course load was meant for a bridge class, the translations did take me a bit of time, and grading was certainly tougher in this class than my others. However, do not let this deter you if you truly enjoy the language! I grew so much from this class, and I have a better appreciation for the language!",
    "I would highly recommend this course to any Classics major. The sheer amount of lines read resulted in a vast improvement in my own reading skills. This was a successful bridge course.",
    "Yes, especially if intending to major in the classics",
    "This course is a very worthwhile treatment of two important philosophers, conducted by a fantastic instructor. The workload is significant, but take this course if you're at all interested and up to the challenge."
