    "Weekly problem sets, 2 midterms and a final. First midterm was pretty standard, but second midterm was very difficult. Not a very engaging lecturer.",
    "Complex Analysis is a must-take, but if Margulis is teaching it and you have other interesting options I would wait for a new professor to take over.",
    "In Complex Analysis you will learn a lot of truly beautiful mathematics. Professor Margulis is not a young professor, however, and so a lot of his energy has been drained. Nonetheless, he is a very precise lecturer, and I thought it was fun to watch him perform the various proofs. Problem sets vary greatly in difficultly but aren't worth that much. Exams are usually easy, but the class tends to be smart as a whole, and so the curve is usually brutal. (Sometimes exams are also more difficult than the practice ones, so be careful not to rely only on the practice exam he gives out.)",
    "The material is fairly interesting--complex analysis can be very elegant. But Margulis is one of the driest professors I've ever had (and that's saying a lot for the math department). His lectures aren't necessarily unclear (also saying a lot for the math dept), but if you can stay focused through them, then you, my friend, deserve a cookie. Although PSets were mostly reasonable, they often seemed a bit arbitrary (since they were usually on material we had covered a month earlier in class). Take the class to learn complex analysis (and you'll learn it alright), but know what you're getting yourself into.",
    "Math 310 is a standard intro to Complex analysis. Margulis is not a great lecturer and his board work is a bit sloppy and if you don't understand his thought process it can be easy to get lost. The tests are good and the homework is very doable. I would recommend this course to anyone who wants to learn complex analysis and has good mathematical intuition.",
    "Complex analysis was one of the most disappointing classes I've taken at Yale so far. It isn't very difficult, and problem sets and tests were objectively quite reasonable. However, I felt extremely discouraged by the end of the class simply because Margulis was such a bad lecturer and uninspiring teacher. I had no motivation to actually think deeply about the things we were learning about. Consequently, I don't think I have an actual understanding of complex analysis",
    "The material you learn is really cool stuff. Margulis isn't the most engaging professor but he is clear and has his moments if you follow his lectures. In the end, I don't think math\/physics majors should pass up this opportunity to learn from a great mathematician like Margulis.",
    "A fine course on a beautiful subject",
    "Read Stein and Shakarchi, and avoid Lang. Margulis is a great mathematician and a very helpful teacher if you ask him the right questions. However, you should always come prepared with a very well-worded question, because otherwise you might receive a very confusing answer to a question you would never have thought about yourself. The exams are fairly predictable but make sure you study really well the types of questions that were given on the previous ones (he always hands out previous years' midterms or finals).",
    "I'm told that complex analysis is a beautiful subject, and I saw glimpses of that, but my overall experience was one of frustration and disenchantment. Professor Margulis is super famous and super bad at teaching. His lectures were disorganized and opaque, and he failed to communicate with anyone but the top students. Because there is no TF, and Professor Margulis is terrible at answering questions, there are no dedicated resources to help students understand anything. The subject itself is very cool, of course, and you can't help but learn some of it if you read the textbook and do the problem sets (which are of moderate difficulty--say 10 hours a week if you don't utilize the extensive online resources dedicated to answering questions out of our textbook). It's a shame that this is the best way to learn complex analysis at Yale right now: take it if you want to learn, but don't expect a positive learning experience.",
    "I would not recommend this, at least not if Margulis is teaching it. Wait for a different professor. And if you do plan on taking it, make sure you've actually taken 250 and 300 because I skipped those and boy oh boy that was a poor choice!",
    "Complex analysis is a great subject. Margulis is a tad dry, and has a lot of weird verbal tics, but you'll get used to him fast since he does a pretty good job presenting the material. If you care at all about the subject, this is as good of a way to learn it as any.",
    "I enjoyed the material in this course a lot. Sometimes the lectures were pretty dry, but the class covers really fascinating topics that make up for it. Professor Margulis is obviously brilliant, but sometimes I wish he brought things back down to an undergraduate level -- especially when we hit gamma and zeta functions and the prime number theorem in the last couple of weeks. I found that his exams were very fair, though I've heard bad things about the curve.",
    "A pretty solid covering of the basic ideas in complex analysis - holomorphic functions, Cauchy's Theorem, calculus of residues, open mapping theorem, conformal maps. The last two weeks we \"proved\" the Prime Number Theorem, which was really more of a sketch and rather messy - that said, the main material of the class is very worth learning for anyone interested in math. Should be comfortable with basics of real analysis before taking the class. On Margulis: he is not the most energetic \/ enthusiastic lecturer but will get the job done, as long as you are attentive enough.",
    "I'd definitely recommend the class to another student, and I am very glad I took it. I wasn't sure at the beginning of the semester whether I should take this or MATH 230, and I am very glad I chose to take this class.",
    "This is a standard intro complex analysis course, but you will learn everything from reading the textbook and doing the homework exercises; not much is added to the course by attending lecture.",
    "If you are a math or physics major, you should definitely take this class. Very interesting material with a Fields medalist!",
    "Intro to Complex analysis is an interesting class. I'm not a math major, nor have I taken anything past linear algebra (225), and this class was very challenging for me. The textbooks are pretty good, but do assume some familiarity with analysis. The lectures follow the books for the most part, but Prof. Margulis is not always the most clear lecturer, so the majority of my learning came from reading the textbook. Problem sets generally included a couple computational problems and a couple proofs\/derivations, the latter of which could be extremely difficult, especially since most involved applying newly learned theorems in ways I had never seen before. Tests vary greatly in difficulty, usually depending on whether they focus more on computations or proofs, but are mostly fair. Despite getting lost often on the more difficult topics, I'd recommend this class to anyone interested in the material (and the material is interesting!), but also recommend some background in analysis first.",
    "I would definitely recommend it to anyone interested in the material. Margulis's lectures aren't always the most exciting, but I thought he was a good lecturer overall.",
    "I thought MATH 310 was a solid course overall, and I would recommend it if the idea of complex analysis interests you. Its a beautiful subject as well as a useful one, and I thought the course did a good job of covering the material rather completely. Professor Margulis is without a doubt a brilliant mathematician, and I also found his presentation of the material to be generally clear and very well-prepared, well-organized, and complete. He was certainly approachable and willing to answer questions, but that being said, lets just say I certainly didnt find him to be the most effective communicator in answering questions (youll see what I mean). As is the case with many advanced math classes, there was also no TA to turn to for support with questions and for help digesting the material, which can be frustrating, so just a heads up. With regard to problem sets and exams: Problem sets were only worth 10% of the final grade, which I found disappointing as I thought it didn't do a good job of reflecting the amount of time students put into them in the final course grade. They were definitely manageable but often relatively time-consuming and sometimes a few questions were definitely on the difficult side (I would note that there was a pretty broad range of difficulty from problem set to problem set). In my opinion, questions were also not always the most well chosen with regard to complementing and reinforcing the breadth of material we covered in class. As far as exams: The first midterm was definitely too easy, which made small mistakes brutal given the curve in the high performing class (it was also practically a rewrite of the previous years exam which he gave as a practice). The second midterm and final were more challenging and less similar to the practice exams from the previous year, which I think was a good thing. I cant really predict what theyll be like in the future though because it wasnt super consistent this year. Taking or at least starting the class Cr\/D as a precautionary safety measure might be wise, as I dont think Professor Margulis has a reputation of being particularly generous with final grades. Overall, I would definitely recommend complex analysis to anyone interested in 300-level math, but just be aware of these few things upfront so you can plan accordingly if you choose to take the course."
