   "comments": [
    "First half is survey of theoretical and analytic tools employed for infrastructure reforms. Second half case studies for each sector. A lot of reading assigned but you can be selective but the midterm is mostly main points from lecture. Excellent senior seminar with a great prof if you are interested in the material.",
    "There are better Econ seminars.",
    "Great senior seminar if you have an interest in infrastructure!",
    "It's a lecture-based class and the readings can be overly technical sometimes, but it covers a pretty interesting topic. Definitely learned a fair amount this semester.",
    "Very informative course if you are interesting in developing economies. Midterm and 20-25 page term paper.",
    "I would recommend it because I think it's real-world, practical and almost nittygritty in a very different way than other more lofty GLBL classes.",
    "If you like infrastructure, which I do, then you will find the case studies and the subject interesting. The lectures can be dry, but in writing my paper I felt like I really knew the central concerns in the field. There was not much participation this past year, which is a blessing and a curse, depending on whether you would like to talk or not.",
    "A great course to engage with a tangible side of development economics.",
    "Absolutely.",
    "Good introduction to infrastructure issues, if a bit lengthy on summary and light on examples. Not really a seminar, unfortunately, but interesting topic (if it is for you) and readings are interesting.",
    "Yes, its very interesting subject material that everyone should be informed about. However, the term paper is very long and a lot of work!",
    "This seminar is not difficult and covers interesting information and an extremely important sector of economics. I felt that I learned some interesting concepts and I benefited from completing the policy paper. But the information in this course could be presented in a far better way. Unfortunately, Professor Kessides spent almost all of the class lecturing from plain PowerPoint slides with far too much text. While he constantly encouraged us to interact more in the seminar environment, he never really offered any outlet for us to do so and gave short answers to our questions. The overall result was interesting information presented in a way that made most participants disengaged. However, Professor Kessides was always available and helpful outside of class, and the midterm examination was fair. The paper might sneak up on you considering the slow pace of the class up until reading period."
