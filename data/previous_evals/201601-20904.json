    "Yes. I've heard that all of the professors are great, but I would especially recommend Dru. Take this course if you get in.",
    "It's the kind of class where you get out of it what you put into it. I went in not knowing if I wanted to take pictures at all and while I'm not sure I will now that the class is over I am really glad I took it. I loved the class and I learned so much. Take it if you're interested in photography, and don't be intimidated if you don't know anything about the subject.",
    "This was an absolutely wonderful class, and completely shaped the way that I look at the world. I am an English major and aspiring writer, and taking class felt like it gave me a whole new language, one rooted in the visual and lens of perception. This is different from just taking a technical class on the nuts and bolts of photography (although we did learn this as well) because Dru is so insightful and helpful, and because the students come from a diverse array of academic backgrounds and interests and all brings something different, a new way of looking, to the table.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to anyone who is starting out in Digital Photography. Dru was a phenomenal teacher and it is a great loss that she is leaving next year to pursue her professional career more seriously (Good luck to her!). It definitely teaches you the technical basics of the craft but more importantly focuses on self-exploration and your personally interest in creating photos.",
    "In the past four years, ART 138 has been my favorite class. Though I had not seriously pursued photography prior to this class, this changed my view on light and movement. The digital printing process, while challenging at times, was essential to seeing images in a new presentation and an important technique to be developed."
