   "comments": [
    "Good course but I would have liked to explore the issues more in depth",
    "strengths - seminar-style class, lots of class discussions",
    "good class. tons of reading. Not all of them are interesting.",
    "Strengths: Covered an incredible span of materials relating to health disparities in such a short period, Professor Jones chose really relevant and interesting reading for the course, and our class had very different interests which led to great discussion.Weaknesses: Sometimes hard to reconcile different opinions of students over sensitive issues- but Professor Jones was a great mediator of discussions.",
    "This was a course that I felt was really important for me to take. Disparities are SO prevalent in our society in so many ways, particularly health. But honestly, I felt like a month's worth of information was stretched out over a semester. Every week, the readings essentially said the same things, and frankly, it really got frustrating. I don't know much in the disparities world, so I can't know what else is out there, but there has to be more than what we went over. I was bored out of my mind.It would have been really, really nice if the class was its expected size of 10 people, not more than twice that. It totally took away from the seminar nature of the course; had the course been smaller, I think I would have gotten much more out of it. Frankly, everyone who wasn't graduating in May should have been kicked out and told to take the course last year. I know some would argue that that's not fair, but I think it's much worse that the quality of the experience and education is significantly decreased because the class isn't the sizethat it's been designed for and how it's been conducted in years past.I liked the book club -- it was SO nice to hear a professor say that she knows we have so much academic reading that we don't get to read things that we'd really like to read! And then to assign us something we're interested in -- love the idea (especially because I'm a serial book buyer, and this gave me a legitimate excuse to go buy something!). I happened to not enjoy my book as much as I'd hoped I would, but obviously that's not Beth's fault. It was really refreshing to not have an assigned textbook or journal article(s) for class. Additionally, I enjoyed hearing what other people had to say about their books -- I learned about some new ones to add to my already-epically long amazon wish list!",
    "I'm so glad there is a class hear about health disparities. I was both interested in it from my research background and wanted to gain a better understanding of it. This class did that.The class should have been possibly been capped smaller for better discussion flow. Spots in the class should be based on seniority.",
    "This class included some of the best readings I have read during my time at EPH. Professor Jones makes sure to choose papers that are highly relevant and significant in the field of disparities. I would have appreciated a smaller class size, since I wanted to be able to critically analyze the strength of the studies.",
    "topics covered in the class were interesting. The discussion-group set up for the class was good because we could actively participate and hear other classmates views. However, given the size of the class I think we might have gotten more out of it with a lecture styled class. (or at least half lecture half discussion)",
    "The course was extremely heavy with readings. Sometimes they were really good, other times they were not as interesting. Beth was a good professor (see comments in the next box). Her enthusiasm with the subject material was clear, which is nice to see for a student. The larger class size didn't always lend itself well to the ideal discussion-based format that I had expected, but overall we managed. I also didn't like how the assignment schedule wasn't totally laid out in the initial syllabus. I would prefer to have the readings all laid out at the beginning of the semester so I knew how to budget my time better over the length of the semester. Not finding out about the readings until the Friday before was frustrating sometimes. Finding out about assignments due the following week only the Friday before was very frustrating when it happened.",
    "I very much enjoyed this class, though I did feel the class size was too big for the purpose of the class. I know Beth Jones was trying to accommodate everyone who wanted to take the class, but because of the size, it was harder for everyone to participate in a meaningful way. I appreciated how much we examined the methodology of health disparities research and discussed ideas for elimination of disparities. I especially liked the book club assignment - it was a unique and interesting way to look at health disparities outside the box of epidemiological research. There were a lot of APMPH students in the class and I felt they were a little TOO outspoken and made participation for the rest of the students a bit awkward.",
    "Good course on disparities. Dr. Jones worked hard on trying to make the class interactive and unique.",
    "Excellent, excellent focus on the state of health disparities research as well as an integration of epidemiological methodology with the heart of disparities research and ethic. I felt challenged by the curriculum, but in a way that made me want to become a better epidemiologist!"

    "Instructor: Beth Jones \u00a0strengths - liked the way she lead discussions on every topic, prooked us to think about health disparities",
    "Instructor: Beth Jones \u00a0good instructor.",
    "Instructor: Beth Jones \u00a0Wonderful. Professor Jones is an incredibly gifted professor. At EPH there are people who are just born researchers, that get stuck teaching classes and you can tell they don't want to be there, aren't comfortable being there, and aren't really interested in what you (As a student) are doing or planning to do. Professor Jones is incredibly special because not only she is an impressive researcher- she is a very good teacher. I was amazed at how compassionate and empathetic she was with subjects we covered and peoples life experiences, how she had great personal stories that she shared to give examples of certain issues, and that she always seemed happy to be in class with us.She also had us do a bookclub which I thought was the greatest assignment during my time at EPH. It was so great to be REQUIRED to read something fun that had nothing to do with school, but then challenged to tie it back into public health. For the day of our book club meeting, Beth brought coffee, tea, and cookies and it was the warmest, happiest moment during a class at EPH. Everyone was so happy and so relaxed, and we exchanged books and ideas, it was a beautiful day in the class room :)Thank you Beth :)",
    "Instructor: Beth Jones \u00a0Beth was a wonderful professor who was extremely flexible and offered very constructive feedback on my written work. I appreciated her thorough comments and thoughtful criticism.",
    "Instructor: Beth Jones \u00a0Beth always had very insightful comments and led the discussion well",
    "Instructor: Beth Jones \u00a0Beth had a good initial organization for the class but wasn't always 100% clear communicating course changes when she had to make them. Her expectations werenot always totally clear either. I liked her enthusiasm for the material.",
    "Instructor: Beth Jones \u00a0Beth Jones was a great instructor and brought in a lot of her own expertise and experience with health disparities research. She asked excellent thought-provoking questions that helped up to disect the research methods and think critically about health disparities. She gave great feedback on our assignments and especially the preliminary assignments for the final paper. She was very flexible, but also didn't give a lot of notice for some assignments which made things a bit difficult if exams or assignments were due for other classes at the same time.",
    "Instructor: Beth Jones \u00a0Dr. Jones worked very hard to make the class interactive and unique. The class was quite large for the format that she attempted. She is a very good professor and worked hard to teach us.",
    "Instructor: Beth Jones \u00a0Terrific!",
    "Instructor: Beth Jones \u00a0Wonderful instructor. Called us back again and again to integrity of good scientific evaluation; promoted dialogue and kept conversation on track in a way that did not shut people down but allowed for the material to be covered."

    "Wouldn't recommend it. I mean, I'd recommend that students read a few of the articles we were assigned, because an overview of these issues is incredibly important. But that said, it was too repetitive. Again, though -- I'm sure this class would have been very different had it been the traditional seminar size that was originally planned.",
    "I would recommend the material to another student, but I didn't particularly like the class set-up. Beth was a good professor but definitely would do better with a smaller class size (which is what she was expecting - I believe this class this semester was inordinately large).",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student. The articles we read for the class were very interesting and pertinent to the subjects at hand. I felt that all of the assignments were meaningful and not just busy work. It is great exposure to the field of health disparities.",
    "Overall good course. Some unique features for a course of this type including a book club was really fun.",
    "Good overview of the reality of health care in the US!"
