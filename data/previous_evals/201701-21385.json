   "comments": [
    "I learned to think like a poet, seeing the world through a more abstract lens. I learned how to use words to creatively express my surroundings. I now understand how to treat poetry as a craft and I significantly improved my own writing skills.",
    "Poetry!!! I have learned how to develop a voice and recognize the voices of other poets.",
    "Some classic poetic texts, and how to 'write' poetry",
    "I developed as a poet, by practicing. I learned about the nature of poetry.",
    "This course was a wonderful introduction to the craft and nuance of modern poetry. I gained a much deeper appreciation for the poetic craft and the class' emphasis on revision bettered my writing many, many times over. A must take for nervous writers delving into the poetic world.",
    "I feel like have a strong foundation in formal poetic tools with which to continue to craft my own poetry."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The strength of the course was the breadth and amount of poetry we read. We studied poets of all different time periods, backgrounds, and ideologies. However, we mainly focused on poets from the western canon; it would have been nice to explore the traditions of other cultures. I also wish that the portfolio requirement had been greater than five poems; there were several ideas I left unexplored because the class did not require more than five.",
    "Class time was kind of repetitive in a way that got tired after some time. Always the same study of poems and workshops; some variation in how class time is spent could be useful. Maybe less entire class workshops and more independent workshops, and more writing exercises (like the sound exercise) in class.",
    "Good course. Could be improved by taking a slightly more formal stance\/reading more theory. A lot of theory issues came up, but we had a pretty small body of theorists to work with.",
    "The workshop setting and the revision process are at the crux of what makes this class such a great one for improving one's craft and understanding of the poetic art form. Perhaps requiring more out of class workshops would push the students to revise even further.",
    "This course is really really excellent. It provides students with ample examples of poems and readings to contextualize those poems and opportunities to practice writing."

   "comments": [
    "Any creative writer should take this class. It improved my poetry-writing skills, but it also made my prose writing better. I find that I am able to articulate my ideas more consicely from having had to condense big ideas into the length limitations of a poem.",
    "Absolutely! Take it! If you have any interest in poetry whatsoever, even if you've never written or read it before, you absolutely should take this class.",
    "This is absolutely an outstanding course that everyone should take. Reading and writing poetry is a great way to sharpen your writing skills generally, and the class will enrich your life and inspire new ways of seeing the world. The course is also a nice introduction to the poetry scene at Yale. You will leave the course with new friends. You may even leave the course a poet. Prof. Chapman is one of the best instructors Ive had at Yale: her feedback is insightful, her facilitation of seminar is effective, and above all she cares deeply about her students and their development as writers. Prof. Chapman is especially good at organizing the academic semester. This class stands out among other courses in the way that the progression of the course engages students. In the course, you will read and analyze poetry and essays, complete poetry exercises, write and revise poetry, workshop poems, attend poetry readings, and assemble a portfolio. I only have a few small suggestions to improve the course. I would prefer more instruction about craft and less discussion. Perhaps the first few classes could open with mini-lectures from Prof. Chapman. I enjoyed analyzing poems with my classmates, but, since were all beginning poets, that time might be better spent listening to professor. Prof. Chapman could use that time to talk about the historical development of poetry, or to introduce more formal terms for poetry analysis, for instance (The class was light on terminology and I wasnt sure if we were already supposed to know it). And then I think we could spend more time discussing the essays. So I might like more instruction in craft and more discussion of theory.",
    "Good class if you are really invested in poetry and want to put in the work. You can get away with not doing much, but won't get much out of it either. It all depends on how much energy you want to allot to writing\/reading poetry this semester.",
    "I would recommend this course, especially to someone who's willing to put in the time to do the readings well.",
    "Yes, I would absolutely recommend taking this course. Especially with Danielle Chapman. Anyone, from people who have been writing poetry for a long time, to people who are just beginning would benefit from her thoughtful insight and encouragement. Its a great way to learn with peers as well."
