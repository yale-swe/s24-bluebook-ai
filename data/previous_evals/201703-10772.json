    "Strengths: very organized, very well taught, the teachers are absolutely amazing-- so kind, interesting, and knowledgable, and it is very fair. If you study and do the homework, there isn't a reason why you can't get an A in this class. I was scared by the other reviews that I read that said that this class is very time demanding. I honestly felt like it wasn't that bad-- I really only spent 2 hours per day doing homework and studying and I still did well Weaknesses: sometimes the teachers don't give clear instructions about how to do things-- like we had to submit canvas recordings of ourselves but some people never knew we had to do that",
    "Strengths - Teachers constantly work to make sure you're omg, high levels of engagement. Weaknesses - Overwhelming, sometimes expected work is unclear or confusing."

   "comments": [
    "Yes absolutely take this class if you're even remotely interested in learning Chinese. The teachers are soooo amazing and sweet and they really want to help you learn. There isn't that much work for this class-- really just 1 hour of homework per day and then maybe like another hour of self studying. Learning Chinese is so much fun.",
    "Yes, if your passionate about learning a new language take this class!",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to other students who are interested in learning Mandarin. After just one semester, I have made significant progress and now feel as though I have a decent grasp of fundamental Mandarin. The units are practical and they teach you how to speak in different situations such as when buying something from a store or traveling. Also, after one semester you can apply for the Light Fellowship, which is an amazing opportunity if you are interested in studying abroad or learning the language in greater depth."
