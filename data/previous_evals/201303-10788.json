   "comments": [
    "I got a lot out of 152; it definitely wasn't easy and at times it can be a lot, especially cause it meets everyday, but at the end, you've learned SO MUCH. And Xu Laoshi really cares about her students' success.",
    "If you want to learn Chinese well, Chinese 152 is a great class. Meeting everyday forces you to be on top of your work, which is essential to learning a language, especially one like Chinese",
    "This course is amazing. I came in thinking that I would be one of the worst speakers and incredibly unprepared, but Xu Laoshi was very encouraging and pushed me to be the best I can be. She cares about each and every one of her students although it may not be clear, but do spend the time to talk to her. She is a wonderful human being. She expects and demands a lot from her students, but your Chinese will definitely improve after taking this course.",
    "This class really focuses on Chinese language and grammar. It is a great class - I enjoyed it, and would recommend it to another student because it further helps students learn the language in a small seminar environment.",
    "I would say that you must be prepared to work and memorize a lot of characters and you must come into the course well equipped in the Chinese language but it is a very comprehensive course that you will learn a lot from.",
    "Chinese 152 was a good class, but it took a lot of time. We had to memorize characters each day and had daily quizzes. But the grading was reasonable, and there are enough homework assignments to balance out a bad grade on a test. The tests are also very reasonable, as long as you spend time memorizing the characters and grammar patterns. You do learn a lot of Chinese.",
    "Tons of work, but rewarding. Recommend with caution",
    "I would definitely recommend it to a student of the heritage speaker level. I feel like this course has improved my writing skills tremendously and built upon my oral skills as well",
    "A good course to take to fulfill your language requirement, but be sure to keep up with the work!",
    "As with many language classes, Chinese 152 involves a lot of brute force learning-basically writing the characters and sentence patterns over and over again on your own time. This class is very fast paced with about 15 vocab words\/phrases to learn every day. But since this class technically starts somewhere in L1 and then accelerates through L2 before ending the semester somewhere at the end of L3\/beginning of L4 chinese, the workload of this class could vary immensely depending on how much chinese you know coming in.Personally, I was very surprised to have been placed into this class because the last time I went to chinese school was middle school, and so almost all the vocab, even from the beginning was new to me (the characters not necessarily the word itself), and I found the workload overwhelming. My friends in this class who went to chinese school for around 6 years and who have taken the Chinese AP, definitely got higher grades in this class and probably had a little less work, but were also always complaining about the amount of work. I guess in the end all that work does pay off in the sense that you will know many more words and will have an easier time reading chinese articles. But if in the first week the lessons don't seem like review, I recommend considering dropping to L3 heritage chinese because a weaker background definitely made it difficult to take advantage of this class's attempt to teach higher level\/more sophisticated chinese.Finally, as a heads up, this class doesn't focus on speaking ability (other than to correct pronunciation)as much as reading and writing.All in all, if this class is your level, I do recommend it. Xu laoshi is awesome."
