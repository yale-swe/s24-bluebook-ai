   "comments": [
    "ECON 338 was a fun class for people who know a lot or nothing about China. The lectures are interesting and sections are a lot of fun! There's a lot of reading, but no problem sets and you can really talk about anything you want in the paper.",
    "this class is good. professor roach is very approachable and likes when you ask him questions. go to see him for office hours. he is very passionate about chinese economics and chinese culture and yale is incredibly lucky to have him as a professor. the lectures are interesting but repetitive at times. also, you dont know your grade until the very end of the semester.",
    "Take it if you are interested in the modern Chinese economy; however, if you are really interested in the topic you might know a lot of the material already.",
    "Great start on China.",
    "interesting material; would take it again",
    "I went into it with high hopes, and they were not met. Professor Roach talks repeatedly about the same topics, yet he was able to expand those topics into a semester-long course. Amazing. I should have just read his book to get the idea. Credit\/D or audit this course.",
    "This is a perfect class for anyone interested in economics, China, and the way China will develop in the next few decades.",
    "take it.",
    "I am extremely enthusiastic about the topic of China's economic development, I think I can say the same about many of my classmates. However, even with this awesome group of students, Professor Roach failed to get most of us from coming to class. The entire class can basically be summarized in about 2 lectures, but the professor speaks in unitone at a snail's pace. The only reward I got from the class is a sharp improvement in my sudoku skills.",
    "I would recommend this class for anyone who wants a better idea of the political debate that surrounds China right now.",
    "Nah, if you're interested in China just read the news.",
    "Yes",
    "This was a great class, but only take if you have a solid macroeconomic background and are interested in China's development.",
    "Take it if you're interested in contemporary China. This course has a heavy economics focus.",
    "Yes, if you're interested in learning about the Chinese economy. Again, class gets a little bit repetitive but Prof. Roach has some very interesting insight to offer.",
    "Great survey of China's economy past, present, and future. not much work until the end of the term",
    "Good analysis of the China situation is presented in this class. It was especially interesting this year as Professor Roach's views became more adopted in policymaking circles and the news! Some points do repeat throughout the semester, however. Take if you're interested in China and feel that you don't have enough of a grasp of the trends there.",
    "I really enjoyed this course. Professor Roach is very knowledgable on the subject (he was Morgan Stanley's head of Asia operations, and meets with Premier Wen Jiabao regularly), and it's a very pertinent subject for today.Not a huge amount of work - just a 2-3 page paper proposal, a 10-15 page paper due during reading period, a take-home final, and section. The readings look like a lot but you don't have to do many of them.Main issue with the course was that some of the lectures repeated a lot of earlier material. Often Professor Roach did this to emphasize several key concepts, but it was a little overdone and would have been time better used on other topics.Also, make sure that you've taken at least ECON 116 (ECON 122 would be even better) - this course assumes a strong comfort with Macroeconomics, especially exchange rates.",
    "It's a helpful class for both econ majors and the average student.",
    "A great course if you are interested in the future of the China, the USA, and the globe in the wake of global recession.",
    "This is a great class to take if you want to get a good idea of the major issues facing China today. I would recommend this course to anyone who has an interest in the future of China.",
    "Take this class for insights on China from a professor who is incredibly qualified to tackle the topic. Lectures are clear and engaging. Compared to most other econ lectures, this one is entirely readings-based -- no math.",
    "It would depend: the work very much fits into your schedule: you can do the readings kind of whenever, which was important because I caught up a bunch of thanksgiving break. I was able to write the big paper over break also.",
    "Take it. Don't miss it.",
    "This course is really what its name says: the Next China. Professor Roach goes through different aspects of China's growth into what it is today and spends a lot of time analyzing the future of China. The mandatory sections discuss topics somewhat related to the lecture. There are very few assessments for the course. The workload is substantially higher towards the end of the course due to the final paper and the take-home final.",
    "This is a great course introducing China and its contemporary economic issues to someone very unfamiliar with these areas. Good econ credit because not that much work, but still interesting. Repetitive as repeated main thesis (china needs to switch from export and investment led growth model to a consumption driven one). Course does not do a good job of going in-depth nor does it look at other sides",
    "Next China is a good course that I'd recommend, but be prepared to have some of the topics repeated heavily.",
    "Definitely yes.",
    "I would recommend this course to any student interested in studying China's political, economic and social future. The course isn't as mathematically rigorous as the description may suggest, so those who are not econ majors shouldn't feel apprehensive about enrolling.",
    "I would recommend it. The work is pretty minimal and the material is interesting. Professor Roach presents a very insightful analysis of China's economic past and future, a topic very relevant to our economic future here in the U.S.",
    "Yes, the class was an eye-opener to both economics and China. The professor, although repetitive, is extremely knowledgeable and cares a good deal about his students. Plus, the one paper in the course was fun to write if you pick a topic you enjoy, because the TAs and the professor are really willing to discuss it and help you out.",
    "No. No no no no no. No. No no no. No no no. You know how every semester you take one class that you end up really regretting? This is that class. Don't fall for the sexy subject matter.Professor Roach is really accomplished and is actually a funny guy. But the lectures were a joke. He literally repeated the same 4 or 5 taglines over and over and over again in EVERY SINGLE LECTURE. Going to class was completely useless.Then, however, he assigned really really long, detailed readings. Like 200 pages a week. So you kill yourself reading but get nothing out of lecture, which is a terrible combo. The only redeeming factor was section, which focused on the readings rather than the lectures.In the end, I just stopped doing the readings after week 3. It doesn't matter. You can BS in section (15% of your grade) and your paper is about a topic of your choosing (50% of your grade). The final 35% is a take-home final, but you can just BS your way through that.I really don't think this is a good course for anyone. I feel like I haven't learned anything beyond the opening article he had us all read.",
    "Yes, take this class. You need to know this stuff and Stephen Roach is absolutely the #1 expert in the United States on the topic. Take it c\/d\/f if you really need to, but definitely, you have to know this stuff -- there is no excuse!",
    "I would recommend this course to any student interested in global economics, global affairs, China, or Asia. It is a very comprehensive course that covers not only how China became the nation it is today, but also the real-time aspect of China's position in the international scene, as well as thepotential of China to make changes for growth in future years to come.",
    "Like sylvester stalone--GUTsy, and shallow.",
    "I would recommend this course if you are interested in learning about broad macroeconomic themes of China. However, one really trying to learn about specific aspects of China may be disappointed.",
    "It was a good class which offered a different view on modern China than perhaps is the norm. It got a little repetitive, but I would recommend it anyway.",
    "Take The Next China if you have a chance! Yes, it covers things you read in the news, but Professor Roach provides a great framework through which you can analyze China.",
    "INTS 338 addresses the fundamentals of the Chinese economy and highlights the transitions that will be necessary for China to continue expanding its economy into a stable, balanced, coordinated and sustainable economy. Issues addressed include: urban-rural income divide; creation of a social safety net; expansion of the service industry; and other factors that will be necessary to create the next version of the Chinese economy. Good class for both people will no experience with China and those with substantial language and\/or historical experience with China.",
    "Recommended if you want a survey of recent issues in the Chinese economy, but not if you already have a sufficient knowledge of China. Take it as an intro course.",
    "I would recommend The Next China to another student. I'm sure that if the course is offered again it will include updated readings. This course is interesting because it is always up to date with the latest that is happening around the world.",
    "Yes, if one is interested in the future of the Chinese economy, and even the world economy.",
    "This class gives a good overview of the Chinese economy and its prospects for the near future. I unfortunately did not make it to as many of the lectures as I would have liked, but I enjoyed the ones I attended. The readings sometimes assumed a more thorough knowledge of economics than was explained in the lectures, but the main conclusions of each unit were very well explained. Take this class if you are looking for a good basic understanding of the realities of the Chinese economy, but not if you are looking for a class that deals with econ theory."
