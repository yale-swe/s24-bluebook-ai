    "High expectations, mostly met. The quality of the course in this case mainly depends on student's work.",
    "My expectations for this class were to learn about the history of furniture and furniture design, and to design and fabricate my own piece. My expectations for the latter were obviously met, but I wish there had been more of an emphasis on the former.",
    "This was a fun course that certainly gets to the complexity and difficulty of furniture design. Its a great class in terms of the design and build process. very fast pace and not enough time to go back and make any corrections to your design. its almost a two semester course, once you see the final project, built before you- you see all the changes you want to make."

    "I would like to see more of a focus on the history of furniture and furniture fabrication. Perhaps a lecture or two?",
    "fewer students? more class discusion- would have had more design input from other classmates."
