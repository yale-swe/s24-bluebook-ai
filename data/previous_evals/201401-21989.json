   "comments": [
    "I would absolutely recommend it. Developmental psychopathology is a very useful perspective on many mental illnesses, and the discussions and readings every week really expanded our knowledge across disorders such as ADHD, depression & anxiety, personality disorders, etc. This class is a fantastic way to top off your psychology studies at Yale.",
    "Fantastic course, I would absolutely recommend it. It is a lot of work though, especially the weekly readings. If you do them though you'll gain a ton and Professor Kim-Cohen is fantastic.",
    "Perhaps with a different class composition, the class would have been more engaging, but this year it simply wasn't. The material is very interesting and the class is perhaps worth it just to see the material, but don't expect a lively class unless you're willing to make it that way.",
    "A very interesting course that has a good balance of biology and clinical psychology. It's not too much work for a senior seminar, but you do read a lot of papers so you gain a broad knowledge of many interesting related fields. The discussions are stimulating you come away feeling you've really gained a good grasp of many areas in the field of developmental psychopathology.",
    "PSYC 456 is an exploration of psychopathology and the factors that influence its course and development across the lifespan. I would recommend PSYC 456; I learned a lot (from both lectures and readings) and I feel that the course was organized in such a way that I got a comprehensive overview of many of the issues pertaining to developmental psychopathology. I also wrote a paper on a topic I was interested in and had the opportunity to discuss issues I was interested in with other great students.",
    "This course should be taken by anyone interested in psychology, neuroscience, or development. It is very enjoyable and not very stressful.",
    "This was a great senior seminar for psych. While weekly readings can be long, you learn how to manage it and the reading response is only 1 page so it is not really stressful. Professor Kim-Cohen is one of the sweetest and most helpful professors I've ever had. She really wants you to think and grow and goes out of her way to help you. While sometimes I felt like I didn't gain as much from class discussions as I would have liked, I thought the environment was very stress-free and I thought the topics we covered were really interesting. If you're at all interested in the subject matter, take this as your senior seminar! It's very interesting and Professor Kim-Cohen is a wonderful professor to get to work with.",
    "TAKE IT! GREAT SENIOR SEMINAR!"
