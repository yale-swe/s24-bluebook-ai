    "The richness of Being and Time means that at any given point you're \"improving\" your capacities on a bunch of different levels at once. You're re-tracing paths in intellectual history, both ones that preceded Heidegger and ones that followed from him; you're asking after the relationship between ontic or ontological structures and the conditions of possibility that underlie them; you're grappling with two minds structured by an astounding degree of philosophical rigor (Martins Heidegger and Hgglund); and you're asking about two main themes, the relationship between being and time and the centrality of self-ness to any sense-making subject. All of these modes of engagement push you in a variety of ways and to a variety of degrees; your relationships to philosophy, intellectual activity, and living will be much richer for your having taken the class.",
    "This course familiarized me with Heidegger's Being and Time at in depth and deep level.",
    "A comprehensive, if not complete, understanding of Heidegger's \"Being and Time\" and critical insights into phenomenology writ large.",
    "I gained an understanding of some of the major themes in Heidegger's Being and Time (notably care, death, and time). I learned about pertinent secondary sources that help to unpack the text. I acquired some knowledge of the types of exegetical arguments in contemporary scholarship that pertain to Heidegger's Being and Time."

    "I recommend the course to my peers unequivocally. As I see it, the course doesn't have any flaws which its great strengths don't overwhelmin terms of the 'net-worth' of the class. And specifically, I found the structure of the class to work really, really well: one semester for the whole book; more or less one chapter per week; lecture with roadmap and open opportunity for questions from students. Some things I found difficult: Because the whole book is read over one term, it was often confusing, especially in the first half, to have to defer our understanding of concepts from a given chapter when those concepts rely on LATER concepts that Heidegger hasn't fully explained yet. But I can't think of how this problem would be resolved. The second reading assignment I found very long. I couldn't finish it in time, and that set me back for the next couple weeks. The other assignments were all more manageable, length-wise. I wished we could have talked more about historicitysecond-to-last class, I believe. It seems an important part of his account but one I found particularly difficult to come to grips with on my own. Students in class often ask the same question in different forms over the course of the semester. This CAN be overall a benefit, but sometimes in this course I felt it distracted from the arc of each seminar. I wonder if there wouldn't be some way to prioritize getting to the end of each seminar's roadmap FIRST, with some way of leaving more time for possible questions at the end. I actually like the structure of having a single, exercise-like paper at the end of the course. The one downside to it is that I felt, to a certain extent, our ownership of our relationship to the class was deferred until the end. Even if one is doing the readings assiduously and participating attentively in class, one isn't responsible for rehearsing the concepts oneself in any extended way, until the final paper. I wonder if there wouldn't be a way of having a brief mid-semester assignment of a page or two in which we simply had to articulate the intellectual parameters of a question or rehearse a logical structure we found significant and\/or difficult to understand.",
    "The only notable weakness of the course was that I would have liked to have spent more time actually look in depth at the text, this was likely impossible due to time constraints, but would have been useful for navigating difficult passages.",
    "Some parts of \"Being and Time\" are richer, and more essential, than others. When the syllabus incrementally went chapter by chapter, we were left with too little time on some issues, and unnecessary repetition of others. Generally, this was fine, but certain concepts, particularly in Div 2, might deserve a larger designated syllabus space. Further, at a few points we read articles by scholars on BT. This was very helpful, particularly when it came time to write our term papers (John Haugeland in particular). Perhaps more of that would improve the course\/expedite certain sections. Lastly, the Dreyfuss supplementary text for Div. 1 was helpful. It would have been excellent to have such a text for Div 2. If no suitable text exists, perhaps Dr. Hagglund should fix that.",
    "Going through Being and Time chapter by chapter, slowly, is essential. Prof. Hgglund is always open to questions, to elaborating, and to clearing up worries. The course also benefits from his very clear formulations of delicate material. The only criticism I might add, is that because these formulations are so clear sometimes they obtrude slightly on the odd negotiations that go into properly understanding them through the text. Perhaps a little more direct work with the text itself would be beneficial--although it must be said too that the semester does not quite provide enough time for much of it.",
    "I have no serious recommendations for strengthening the course. However, collegiality among the students and a more welcoming environment for class participation could have been achieved with personal introductions on the first day of class."

    "I recommend this course without hesitation. First, if you're going to study Heidegger (either for the first time or as a continuation of your engagement with him), there's no one better to do so with than Prof. Hgglund. There are certain dominant misunderstandings that have persisted in the general corpus of Heidegger scholarship, and Prof. Hgglund is amazingly cogent and precise in drawing out these points of misunderstanding and showing how the text of Being and Time clearly is arguing something different from what most readers think. Second, if you're not sure whether you want\/need to study Heidegger: Coming away from this class, you'll very likely see Heidegger as fundamental both to the entire intellectual history of the 20th century and as fundamental (in terms of what he's concerned with) to the most basic, as well as the most complicated, questions of living and of intellectual judgment. Being and Time is an unbelievably rich text; Prof. Hgglund's class lives up to its merits. You'll be much the better, as a person and as a scholar, for taking it.",
    "I have already recommended it to several other students, it ranks among the best courses I have ever had.",
    "Yes. Depending on the student. This is not a class for students who want to bring Heidegger into alignment with preconceived traditions, and the pedagogy is not personalized to make students comfortable. This is a compliment, a far as I am concerned, speaking as someone whose tradition stands often in direct opposition with Heidegger.",
    "I absolutely would supposing that the student in question had sufficient background.",
    "Yes. Any student with an interest in twentieth century intellectual history needs to take this course. In fact, Heidegger's Being and Time is a text that all students in the humanities should have some familiarity with. This class was a terrific introduction to Heidegger studies and offered an in depth reading of one of the most significant philosophical works to date."
