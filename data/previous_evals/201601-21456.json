    "This is a class on Nietzsche viewed through a strong and unusual interpretive lens. It focuses on Nietzsche's perspectivism in particular, and traces the evolution of Nietzsche's thought throughout his corpus. It also looks at some interpreters of Nietzshe - Bataille, Heidegger, Derrida, Kofman, and De Man. Interesting material, peculiar framework, intelligent professor. Highly, highly recommended for anyone with the most remote interest in philosophy.",
    "I would not recommend it. Reading Nietzsche is really a life-changing experience, but you will get more out of it by reading it on your own and maybe discussing it with someone than by engaging with it in a very academic, pretentious way like the one this course took. If you go to the first class and decide that North's style is not for you, then follow your intuition and do not take it."
