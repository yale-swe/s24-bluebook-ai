    "Planning, planning, and more planning. I initially intended to pursue a semester-long project, but after having well exceeded the year-long threshold, petitioned to shift to a full-year essay. I would certainly accredit my sanity during this tumultuous period to both my dean's office, the EP&E registrar, and my primary advisor, all of whom offered thoughtful input and advice. Beyond planning well, I have certainly developed a new attention for spacing out my work. It feels tempting to do bare minimums, and working under the impression of a semester-length project turned out to be a blessing in massive disguise; I now feel I have a strong working product to remake and refine over the spring semester."

   "comments": [
    "Quite frankly, I find it hard to opine here simply because my experience (and I believe most students would agree) is highly individual and idiosyncratic. However, from the macro EP&E level, I believe personnel communicated information about workshops, office hours, and deadlines with relative clarity. Although I do think some students would prefer a bit more advanced notice of upcoming benchmarks and what exactly is expected."

    "Yes, I think the year-long essay is certainly the way to go. However, I do believe it becomes a tax on your spring semester if you do not put in meaningful work in the fall."
