   "comments": [
    "Great!",
    "I am not afraid of hard work, but I find it extremely frustrating to have to teach myself statistics because the teacher is not competent to do so. Everything I learned in this class was due to my own effort and the the one good TA we had (Qiongshi). This course needs to be completely revamped. The final midterm exam was so poorly constructed that the TA was having to provide additional information throughout the exam; it was a joke.",
    "Lots of useful tools.",
    "Helpful class but too much homework.",
    "A little intense class. A lot of work to do, but they are helpful and necessary. The textbook is very helpful, too.",
    "Course is very relevant and must be a requirement for any public health program",
    "too much homework",
    "It was hard, but I learned a lot.",
    "Learned a lot.",
    "This is not the class you can get by. Both reading and homework are a little bit overwhelming. However, if you like it you'll love it because you are gonna learn a lot from the class.Bonus, the TA is excellent. I hope you can have the same TA this year.",
    "The instructor certainly cares about making the topics understandable but there was a lack of real time problem solving to better sink in the topics and how the statistical tests mattered in real life.Biggest feedback that would be helpful in my view would be to have some problems with partial solutions as students do homework to determine if they are astray and if so, why and where.",
    "The material is crucial. A lot is covered in one semester. Strength is comprehensiveness. Weakness was the instructing.Inaccuracies in some of the slides that resulted in a number of us getting points off homework that were not adjusted for.Final examination was extremely frustrating and stressful. We did not receive two pages of printout that were necessary for the exam. With the instructor not present, the TA managed to run an analysis and put the output on the board after 35 minutes, however we had lost that time during the exam. Second page arrived with the instructor the minute the exam was scheduled to finish. We were given 20 more minutes to complete the exam but were asked to leave the room due to the next class arriving. Very stressful and I could not concentrate during the exam.Homework was very lengthy and took away a lot of time for other courses.",
    "The topic could be really useful, and in fact the final project was a good example of how the topics we learned could be applied. However, the application of what we learned was NOT emphasized. Though the homeworks were really time consuming, they were helpful in learning the material. However, I wish there was more emphasis on how all of the components we learned pieced together.",
    "It is quite difficult at the beginning, but you will catch up if you pay attention to each class.",
    "This was an OK course. It wasa lot of work, but you do learn and cover a lot of material.It would have benefited from more of a putting it all together type of lecture. In the Survival Analysis class, which is only half a semester, there was still time to go over the steps in model building and validating that we could use as a guide in our final projects and future work, but when it came to the final project, that sort of guidance and organization seemed lacking.I wish that the examples could be related more to health: talking about cookie factories and real estate prices make it a little bit harder to engage in the process.",
    "Overall learned a lot, but this was only by reading the textbook, doing homework, and studying with other students. The topics covered are highly relevant and extremely important, and it was very frustrating how unclear the lectures were. The exams were also extremely frustrating, particularly the second where we did not have all the necessary information for several of the questions resulting in panic from students as we had thought we really missed something big for the first 45 minutes of the exam. This was followed by many interruptions as the TA and later the instructor spoke frequently throughout the exam as they realized various pieces of missing information. It was the most stressful exam I have ever taken, and I felt completely unable to concentrate. Thankfully she took this into account while grading the exam which was much appreciated, but these types of issues should not be occurring.",
    "I think a class covering topics like linear regression requires a big time commitment for both the professor and the students.The class would achieve better results if professor's slides contains no mistake, and the TA's slides elucidate (in writing) the meaning of each SAS code line.For me, the homework for this class is time consuming because I have to sort out how to write the SAS codes in addition to reading the textbook. Mistakes occasionally pops out in the class slides as well.",
    "Some of the work was tedious but I think necessary to fully understand the materialStrengths are the lab sessions that reinforced the material taught. Weakness would be a massive amount of work we had to do and it took away a lot of time from other courses. But I think it was overall worth it.",
    "The material learnt in this course is useful. However, I often felt that the course did not adequately deal with the larger picture. We often discussed various methods and procedures, but the course did a poor job in relating the various concepts to each other - for example, the order in which different procedures should be done.The course did not focuse on the critical thinking that goes into statistics. The greatest part of the course was the data analysis project at the end. The type of thinking and work required for this project should be incorporated into the rest of the course and not shoved all into the final project.",
    "Too much homework",
    "I would not recommend this course to anyone. The instructor did not do a good job presenting the information. Also, the content of this course was not focused on application as indicated in the title.",
    "I thought the course was okay. I enjoyed the material and think it will be helpful.",
    "The course got progressively tougher until around the mid-semester and then eased out by the end as some common themes emerge and allow to integrate the earlier concepts.Strengths: By the end of the course, you will be able toi)understand the need and interpret the results out of the 'proc reg' command of SAS.ii)Construct a linear regression equation and run various diagnostics.iii) Tackle some common problems with the equations.These skills are practical and the exhaustive home-works give a lot of practice.Weaknesses:i) Often, navigating through the software to obtain the answers took a lot of time.ii) The course is text-book oriented. I felt the text had more examples from aneconomics perspective. There could have been more public health related examples.",
    "In general, the course content and structure was good; however, the book was the main course guide and the professor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s lessons provided little additional help."

    "Instructor: Bingqing Zhou \u00a0Great!",
    "Instructor: Bingqing Zhou \u00a0I have never had such an awful teacher in my life. I hate to be critical and I am sure Dr. Zhou is a wonderful researcher, but Yale HAS to stop hiring teachers on their research ability without confirming their ability to teach. Dr. Zhou cannot and should not teach. She is indecisive, constantly vacillating on decisions in front of the class (open or closed book test, when homeworks are due, what the final project will be, etc). She also does not review her slides before class, which is obvious when she becomes confused by the slides (I don't think these are even her own slides!) during class and takes a few minutes out of class just talking to herself and trying to figure them out. It is appalling and as a student at Yale, I expect much more than this. A new instructor needs to be found for this class.",
    "Instructor: Bingqing Zhou \u00a0The professor really care about the students and also have a high standard for the class. She is a excellent professor.",
    "Instructor: Bingqing Zhou \u00a0She instructed in a well organized order. Her standard was high. Maybe the class can be distributed more clearly. And the instructor may need more time to prepare. She was not very familiar with the slides.",
    "Instructor: Bingqing Zhou \u00a0Organized lecture but too much homework.",
    "Instructor: Bingqing Zhou \u00a0Very helpful in class and after class.",
    "Instructor: Bingqing Zhou \u00a0I have to say that she could have done better. Her power points were filled with typos. She realizes some during her classes. But never, updates the corrected slides.Never answers adequately to student's questions.Exam time is not adequate for the kind of questions she asks",
    "Instructor: Bingqing Zhou \u00a0sometimes she is confusing, and the lecture notes have many typos",
    "Instructor: Bingqing Zhou \u00a0She was pretty good. Some times, a little disorganized and her slides had typos. Other than that, a very helpful instructor. She really wanted us to learn.",
    "Instructor: Bingqing Zhou \u00a0Pf.Zhou is very nice with students and willing to answer questions after class.",
    "Instructor: Bingqing Zhou \u00a0similar as above.Often when problems were reviewed in class, there was uncertainty regarding correct or incorrect answers. This made the teaching more confusing.",
    "Instructor: Bingqing Zhou \u00a0Strengths: pleasantWeaknesses: very difficult to follow in class; could not understand in lecture; switched back and forth between topics and slides during class, which was difficult to follow and confusing. Very difficult to understand verbally.",
    "Instructor: Bingqing Zhou \u00a0I think Dr. Zhou tried to accommodate students, however it would have been more useful to have set dates for assignments\/ exam and for us to know well in advance what these dates are instead.",
    "Instructor: Bingqing Zhou \u00a0Interesting",
    "Instructor: Bingqing Zhou \u00a0Dr. Zhou clearly knows a lot about this subject and tried hard to teach her students. She gave a sort of cold impression at the beginning of the semester, but by the end her friendly nature came through.There were several issues with lecture notes being unclear, and Dr. Zhou was not always able to clarify the problem.There was a lack of organization, which was particularly evident for the final exam, which was missing pages of information which were required to answer the questions.",
    "Instructor: Bingqing Zhou \u00a0She cares about students and seems to really want to improve the course. Her lecture stylethough is very difficult to understand. Many times she would trail off seemingly without actually finishing sentences, leaving us all very confused. More clear, concise lectures would be really helpful, particularly for the non-biostat students.",
    "Instructor: Bingqing Zhou \u00a0Sometimes the professor was unclear in her teachings, but overall a very nice woman and was very helpful in all aspects of the course. She was attentive and considered the feelings of students.",
    "Instructor: Bingqing Zhou \u00a0The instructor does a poor job of relating the material to the students. She often seemed ill-prepared for class and there were many errors in the lecture slides the required correcting during class. This is confusing. She did not connect the material to the larger issues of why we need to learn the concepts in class.",
    "Instructor: Bingqing Zhou \u00a0Nice lecturer",
    "Instructor: Bingqing Zhou \u00a0Poor teaching methods.",
    "Instructor: Bingqing Zhou \u00a0She did an okay job of explaining things. Sometimes it was difficult to understand her and the lectures would become confusing.",
    "Instructor: Bingqing Zhou \u00a0The slides and the other course materials were easy to follow. However, when presenting the slides, there were some pauses and apprehensions which disturbed the flow of thought. The instructor was flexible and receptive. It would have been interesting if examples from work done at YSPH were a part of the lecture.",
    "Instructor: Bingqing Zhou \u00a0The professor was punctual.Her ability in teaching was deficient. She had little patience and her attitude limited the communication with the group."

    "Instructor: Qiongshi Lu \u00a0very responsive, especially as I was unable to meet in person. Labs were helpful to a degree but at times felt like it was emphasis on how to code in SAS without as much discussion on the meaning of the results. But overall he was the highlight of the class.",

If you love statistics, this is the class you must take, it opens door to the world of statistics. However, be prepared to finish 500 pages of reading in the semester, work hard and your effort will be paid off.",
    "The syllabus was well structured and made logical sense in terms of the order of the topics discussed. Lots of time commitment without much gratification regarding homework problems. Also probably junior instructor who is still ironing out her own teaching style.",
    "No, I would not recommend this course.",
    "The class is useful, and you will come away from it knowing much more about regression analysis. However, do NOT take this course if you do not have a strong background in statistics, and do NOT take this course if you are not willing to spend a lot of time learning the material independently. It really won't be worth it, and you might fall behind.",

    "The text book ispretty good.",
    "this is a challenging course, not recommend for students without statistics background",
    "I would not recommend it. It is difficult to follow and it took too much time outside the classroom to learn all the material before completing the home works.",
    "An advanced overview of linear regression. You learn the necessary steps to correctly build a linear regression model. If you are interested in statistics this is a good upper level course to take since linear regression is very important.",
    "If you are motivated to learn, invest some quality time understanding the concepts and do not mind spending additional time catching up with some math or \"SAS-skills\" and are not paranoid about the grades or exam scores, it is an interesting and challenging course which teaches a valuable practical skill and I highly recommend it.",
    "Since I believe that the course content is very important for graduate students training, I would only recommend this course if the professor improve her teaching methodology. Otherwise, I would not recommend this course to another student."
