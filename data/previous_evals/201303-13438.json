   "comments": [
    "This course was fantastic. The readings were fun, the discussions were deep, and Professor Bilger was here to see you succeed. He is a masterful writer, and his feedback on your essays are very helpful.",
    "YES YES YES. If it's offered again, take it! It's a blast, I learned a lot about writing for a legit publication like The New Yorker, and the professor was such a joy to learn from.",
    "This is a fantastic class that focuses on journalism first and food second. You spend about half of the time in class discussing a few readings and the other half workshopping pieces or discussing your reporting. The class is dedicated to a 6,000 word profile on some food-related topic (it seems daunting, but it's really the culmination of a semester's worth of writing and workshopping). Burkhard Bilger is a great mentor. He's incredibly down-to-earth and approachable\u00e2\u0080\u0094not at all what you would expect of a staff writer at the New Yorker. Obviously, he's very busy outside of class, but he made sure that he was available to talk and give advice. His edits are comprehensive and full of insightful comments. He line edited our pieces as if they were New Yorker articles, so I felt quite lucky to learn from him. The scheduling got a little wonky towards the end of the semester because of reporting difficulties and time crunches, but Professor Bilger was always understanding. If he teaches this class and you have any interest in journalism or food, try to get into the course! Definitely one of the best classes I've taken at Yale.",
    "Yep! Take it if it's somehow offered again. But be prepared to put hours and hours into editing.",
    "You write a very long piece about food. it is time consuming if you want to do it right, but fun. Make sure you like your topic.",
    "A very good course. Readings across a broad range, appropriate assignments. The timing of the final assignment--a long profile--was a little wonky, and some people had trouble getting the reporting done in time. But Burkhard, who is a professional writer, was understanding about this and very available. He is kind to a fault and a capable clas-leader, and gives astoundingly helpful feedback on drafts.",
    "I'm not sure it's being offered again, but I would without a doubt recommend it to people with an interest in either writing, food, or both. We read a wide range of pieces, most of which I loved, and it was my favorite class of the semester."
