   "comments": [
    "A really well-taught course, but not one that you should take as an introduction to philosophy. I was expecting a general overview of different views on causation from all of history. But instead the class is all journal articles from the last 50 years going into very mathematical views on causation. The readings are sometimes very difficult and they seem to meld together in your mind and it's hard to see why certain ideas would be contradictory.The class is large for a seminar but small for a lecture (~20 people), so it is taught like a lecture with ample time for questions, but Szabo takes the lead. Professor Szabo is extremely well informed and it's clear that this is subject matter that he really loves and cares about. He is a great lecturer and the handouts that he makes for each class keep us on track and prove very useful for writing assignments.",
    "Causation is a great class for the intermediate- to advanced-level philosophy student. Zoltan's a good lecturer, and there was a fair amount of discussion too. Readings were nicely concise and the papers were quick to write.",
    "Yes. If you are interested in contemporary philosophy or metaphysics in general, this class is the way to go. The material is fascinating and the selection of readings hits just the right balance between breadth and depth. Zoltan is also a wonderful teacher.",
    "PHIL 301 is a fascinating course that requires a great deal of advanced abstract thought. If you are consistent with the readings and engage actively with the subject matter you will not find the class very difficult considering how rewarding it can be.",
    "Take this class yung philosophers. Zoltan is the man. He shreds. This class is very low stress- the readings are all quite manageable, and the assignments (3 short responses, 1 final paper) are all not too difficult or demanding. The short assignments are 2 questions a piece for a total of 3 pages of work, and the final paper, albeit demanding because of its length and difficulty, only makes up for 30% of the grade. The individual assignments (20% a piece) are all graded quite easily. This is the class for the yung philosopher, the kid who wants to put himself out there and do some heavy work but doesn't have much experience. It's all incredibly interesting- the readings are great. And to top it off, its high level material, but in small doses, and you can choose liberally what you want to write on for each assignment, so it's not like you have to be perfectly versed in every reading. This class will make you think, but isn't as stressful as some other higher level seminars. Take it if you have some philosophy experience, and might wanta bit of a challenge that won't pose to be overly stressful. Zoltan is a fire philosopher.",
    "This is a good, if a bit challenging, philosophy course. Some of the readings can be a little confusing, but a background from other philosophy courses is very helpful. Zoltan Szabo is quite effective as an instructor, and very good at explaining material. Some discussions ran on a bit long, but this means if you have any questions in class you know they'll be answered.",
    "I would definitely recommend it as long as you're not looking for a class that's applicable to the real world and are willing to heavily scrutinize readings and think pretty hard in general. Zoltan leads great discussions, and if you put time into doing the readings thoroughly, you can get a lot out of the class.",
    "A lot of the things we discussed about causation in this class were a lot more \"logic\" based and less grounded in the philosophical implications of the psychology of causation.. The topics we discussed at the end (like free will and knowledge) were thus more interesting to me, and the beginning\/middle of the semester sometimes got tedious. That being said, this class delves pretty deeply into a narrow topic and you get a lot of good foundation and learn a lot... Professor Szabo is really nice and very engaging during class (pretty funny sometimes too) and explains the readings really well. The workload was also totally reasonable, which was great (although some assignments were due during official breaks, which was annoying). The class was pretty small though (like 20-25?) and ended up being basically like a seminar, but it was awkward to speak up because it was still sort of lecture-format.... This balance between lecture and seminar could have been handled better. I'd recommend it, but definitely shop it carefully and expect it to be way smaller than on the first few days.",
    "Good analytic philosophy class. Recommend.",
    "This is a fantastic course. For me, things started getting really interesting in the second half of the semester, when we discussed causation with respect to issues like free will, knowledge, reference, and mental causation. Lectures were often led like seminar discussions. They always covered the assigned readings. This class was the first really tough philosophy course I've taken. (By 'tough', I mean that it took a while and some effort not to feel like everything was going over my head.) A big part of this is the level of the average student in the class. This can be extremely beneficial if you put aside the pride you put in your own ideas and muster up the courage to participate. The grader (no TA for the course, which is sort of a bummer) sometimes gave pretty minimal feedback, which did little for me in the way of improvement. However, as I continued with the course, I felt my ability to concisely and clearly analyze philosophical issues improve. If you're interested in causation or the specific topics listed in the syllabus readings and you'd like to develop your ability to think and do philosophy, take this course. If not, well... don't.",
    "Learn very specifically about the nature of cause and effect. I would recommend it.",
    "Phil 301 is a great overview to some of the more important topics in causation - if at least a couple of the topics on the syllabus excite you, it's worth taking. The workload is manageable, generally one paper per meeting, and one of the major virtues of the course is its in-class focus on fully understanding those papers before launching into broader analysis. For those who find philosophy papers challenging (if not, who are you?), this course is a great way to get used to exposition. The assignments are structured such that one can choose to discuss two ideas that excite them most, and set aside the one excites them least. That also means the course is flexible: if you miss a paper for whatever reason, or just can't get through it, you can just put extra focus on a different one that really interests you. All this said, the course is an okay seminar. The point is less group discussion and debate. The course fits some needs exceptionally well; I would simply recommend one not go in with the expectation that it'll be a great venue for group discussion. I found the course to be both manageable and very valuable for my writing, and more generally the way I approach papers and philosophical ideas."
