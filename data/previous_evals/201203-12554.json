    "It's basically kind of \"intro to college math\", nothing more and nothing less.",
    "I only took it because I had to. I highly suggest that you carefully choose a TF or professor that you can understand because if not, you're stuck for the rest of the semester. I had taken a good portion of the course material before I entered the course, but am leaving more confused and with a lesser grade than I desired or could have obtained in another environment.",
    "If you want to take a basic calculus course this is the one to take.",
    "It is a standard math course.",
    "Math 112 is an intro to calculus. It is a bit fast paced but it was worth taking to get a basic understanding of calc.",
    "A very standard class for students who have no experience with calculus.",
    "I do not like math. That will always be true. Nevertheless, I think this class was as painless as it could have been. When it was painful, it was my own fault.However, Yoav is wonderful. I have nothing but good things to say about him as an instructor. He's very personable and always willing to answer questions. My success or failure in the course will do nothing to diminish my high opinion of him.If you're going to take Math 112 and he's teaching it again next semester, TAKE IT FROM HIM. I heard some horror stories about other sections, and Yoav was a saving grace.",
    "Math 112 is a class that encompasses AP Calculus AB in a semester. It is good if you are interested in calculus, or want a basis in calculus. I would recommend it if you are trying to fulfill a distributional requirement or a requirement for a major."
