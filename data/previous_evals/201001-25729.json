    "Necessary, for whatever it is you will be pursuing academically",
    "It's the high school equivalent to Calculus AB.",
    "it's not interesting but if you need math then take it",
    "It's a tough course because there are a lot of students that have taken calc before and should be in higher levels, but fail the placement exam to be in a lower math class. Being someone who hadn't taken a calc course prior to this it took awhile until I really felt comfortable with the material.",
    "I didn't like how the small math class felt like a lecture. There was never any involvement on the student's part and the professor made no effort to get to know the students. I feel like I would have benefited more if the class seemed a little less impersonal. As far as math goes, the course is fine.",
    "I would recommend Math 112 with professor Lind ONLY. He was fantastic, and I learned a lot as a result, but I have heard horror stories about the other sections.",
    "Let's face it, math is math. I would recommend Professor Lind, but he's a visiting professor and won't be coming back next year, so I honestly don't have much to say for this class - only take it if you need to fulfill the QR requirement.",
    "I'd recommend it to any student interested in calculus\/mathematics in general.",
    "Easy class. DOOOOOO IT.",
    "Take math 112 if you never took AP Calc AB or if you need a refresher on that material. It basically covers the same material in the same order with a similar logical structuring.",
    "You have to teach yourself EVERYTHING! If you took Ap Cal AB or BC then you should be in pretty good shape though, just know that you're basically on your own so I would suggest getting a tutor early. DO NOT TAKE THIS IF IT IS NOT REQUIRED. There are MANY other classes you can take to fulfill your QR credit.",
    "Yes, I would recommend it.",
    "Too many take this class with previous calc experience so I would think twice if you have none.",
    "Yes. Take it, its still pretty demanding, but its a great review of the basics, and a good way to begin calc at Yale. It you haven't learned part of the curriculum, its still pretty accessible."
