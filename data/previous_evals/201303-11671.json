   "comments": [
    "I would strongly recommend this class to any freshman with an interest in religion or philosophy, or simply any freshman would would like to improve their writing or explore a new subject! I went into this class with very little interest in the subject, but Professor Najman's incredible passion makes the class (even at 9 am) a joy. She truly loves what she is teaching and is so willing to put in the time to help any student. The grading is extremely fair\/generous, and she allows rewrites on any essay. She will meet with you one on one to discuss your writing (some meetings are mandatory, but she is always encourages you to schedule extra meetings too). Overall, a truly wonderful experience for all freshmen!",
    "Would definitely recommend. Excellent class with interesting writing assignments that are challenging but manageable and help improve writing skill. Very engaging class discussions.",
    "A great class. The course is titled \"authorship, originality and forgery\" but the actual contents go well beyond that. The topics are very comprehensive, covering everything from religious studies to history, from philosophy to literature, and from music, film and art to mathematics. The readings may be a little challenging if you're not familiar with the Judaic discourses but Prof. Najman will offer tremendous help with the materials. Professor Najman is a charismatic and dynamic lecturer with boiling ideas; listening to her lectures is a thought-provoking experience. After this class my perception of authorship and originality has changed greatly.",
    "Definitely take it! It's not a huge amount of work, but it really helps you to think about the bigger concepts of authorship which can be very helpful in analyzing pieces of writing for other courses. Plus Prof. Najman is awesome! She's really enthusiastic and loves what she's teaching.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course if you're interested in religious studies. The class focused a lot on ancient biblical texts, so this might require some independent research for students who do not have a strong background in biblical history. However, Professor Najman is an excellent teacher who is more than willing to help you if you have any questions and is extremely knowledgeable and approachable.",
    "I would summarize this course as a study in how the role of the author has changed over history and how current artistic developments manipulate its role. I would definitely recommend this course because it is both informative and fun.",
    "I would summarize Authorship, Originality, and Forgery as a highly rewarding class and would most definitely recommend it, because of its facilitation for critical thought, its conversation with texts both contemporary and ancient (the Book of Psalms to the writings of Michel Foucault), and its encouragement of students to tackle these new thought progressions in their own writings.",
    "An easy class that nonetheless engages the students as Hindy Najman leads us through thousands of years of understanding notions of authorship.",
    "I would recommend this seminar to everyone. Professor Najman is incredible and the material is fascinating. Although there may be many writing assignments, the workload is manageable.",
    "Authorship, Originality, and Forgery is a class that seeks to explore what exactly is plagiarism, forgery, and the genius of authorship by examining he modern world and the ancient world. It makes the case for a strong reevaluation of what it means to plagiarize, and delves into the idea of contributing to a grander writing tradition. I would definitely recommend this class to other students. I am so glad I was able to take it. It was truly rewarding on an academic level, friend level, and class level.",
    "I would recommend this class. It allows you to think about abstract concepts in your own creative way."
