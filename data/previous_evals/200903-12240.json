   "comments": [
    "19th C. France is a great course and really teaches you the fundamentals of a country and period that shaped Western Civilization. No one should leave Yale without a fundamental understanding of the Revolution, the Terror and Napoleon. Though somewhat disorganized, the class is still deeply rich, informative and anecdotal. Reading is minimal, save a small handful of 19th-century novels, and the exams are not too taxing at all - especially the 20-minute oral final option! Great class and great professor!",
    "While I really enjoyed the content of the course and the lectures were interesting, I'm not sure that I got a really good overview of the course material. Lecture topics seemedsomewhat haphazard, and I think a broader overview of the historical events of the time would have been helpful before delving into the details. Workload and reading is manageable, and the oral final alternative (a 25-minute interview) is a nice option. I would suggest taking a broader overview of European history before taking this course.",
    "Shop it. Take it if you've never been in a class with John Merriman... but if you already have taken a class with Merriman, maybe consider looking at other options.",
    "don't take it unless you want an easy A. You don't really learn anything you can't get off wikipedia.",
    "Yes, Merriman is a wonderful lecturer, very responsive to questions, and clearly a leading scholar in the field (though this period may not be what he writes about the most). The best part is definitely the first half of the course--his analysis of 1789-Thermidor.",
    "i would recommend it because of Merriman; he's great. but don't expect to learn that much",
    "I would highly recommend. It is about one of the most exciting times in history, learn about unstable society and revolution. Merriman can talk about this like no one else can.",
    "I highly recommend this class. The workload is very manageable (brief midterm, average length paper, and oral final exam), and Merriman always keeps lectures interesting.",
    "Great class, I absolutely recommend it.",
    "Do not take this course. I did not learn a thing.",
    "This is a good overview of a tumultuous time in French history. Its important to understanding more current history and Professor Merriman is great, he's hilarious and entertaining in lecture. The coursework is not too heavy",
    "This is a great course about a crucial and important period in French history. The course will give you a good grasp of both the politics and culture of France. Prof Merriman is a very entertaining lecturer, and he will make the material come alive for you.I would note that the lectures are sometimes confusing. Also, the readings do not give a too good background about the political events and you will need to do outside research.I would recommend this course to other students: you will learn a lot about the interesting time period, the workload is manageable, you get to read French novels, Professor Merriman is a good prof.",
    "Not the best class I've taken at Yale, but you'll learn a decent bit about French history and enjoy lectures. Grading is reasonable, workload is also reasonable, and there are some fantastic books on the syllabus-if you at least read Balzac and Zola, you'll get something out of this course. You have to do a lot out of class to understand what actually happened in France, but the lectures are at least entertaining. Don't take it expecting it to be a wonderful class, you'll be disappointed.",
    "Yes.",
    "Take a class by Professor Merriman. End of story.He is great and wants to see everyone succeed. You'll enjoy coming to lecture and hearing his stories and the tests are not too terrible either. Just take the class if you are looking for anything related to history, France, or just amusement.",
    "Starts off pretty well, but Merriman runs out of well-put-together lectures about halfway through the semester. The second half is poorly organized social history. The main issue is that it becomes extremely hard to follow.",
    "Yes, Merriman is awesome and the topic is interesting",
    "Lots and lots of revolutionary france really. AS someone who doesn't really like french history at all i still enjoyed it and found the readings helped enormously with that.",
    "I would recommend this class if you are looking for a relatively easy history class. The work is manageable. However, lectures are not clear. and can be difficult to follow. Thus I was not as engaged in the class as other history classes.",
    "We covered the period of revolutionary france. A good overview of all parts of the french revolution. The different periods of the revolution are examined.",
    "The strengths of the course lie in the lectures by an enthusiastic Merriman; the literature-based reading list (Balzac, Zola, Marx); and the quality TAs, who provided possibly the first stimulating discussion section I've ever had at Yale.Professor Merriman's enthusiasm for French history is contagious. While his lectures are often a bit unfocused and scattered, the information they contain makes up for the fact that the student is required to sift through information to determine the overall theme. The sifting isdone with pleasure, and all of the information is fascinating.",
    "Hist 275 bridges, in a sense, the gap between broad historical survey and close, detailed analysis. I would strongly recommend the course for anyone with some background in French history (or, as I had, in French literary history) who wants to learn more about the complex dynamics of each revolution.",
    "Overall, I would definitely recommend this course. Professor Merriman is extremely entertaining and engaging, though the lectures often have very little to do with the exams or the actual content of the course. For example, he spend an entire lecture talking about absinthe and other alcohol that was abused during the period. It was a fascinating lecture, but not exactly relevant to anything you would be tested on. I didn't happen to mind this, and if you plan to take the course for general knowledge, or if it just sounds interesting, then you should certainly do so. Don't expect to gain an in depth understanding of the actual history or timeline though. This class is great if you're looking for a fifth class or something easy and fun to round out your semester.Oh, and definitely do the oral final. It seems rather intimidating, but it's absolutely not. The grad students who administer the 20-minute oral exam seem more intimidated of you then you are of them, and it was actually enjoyable. Certainly more enjoyable than a 3 hour written final.",
    "History 275 is a great example of Yale history at its best. The narrow focus and straightforward assignments made it a very enjoyable experience. I would recommended it to anyone interested in an amazing humanities class."
