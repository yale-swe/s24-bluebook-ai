    "I shopped this and the lecture, and I preferred this. Classes are small, so you're forced to work, and from what I've heard, our midterm was much harder than that of the lecture (I prefer hard exams with curves). The seminars are a bit boring, but at least they're more rigorous than the lecture. I really enjoyed getting to know my classmates better in this class.",
    "Yes, I thought this seminar allowed for close personal contact and a deeper level of understanding than a lecture could have offered.",
    "Yes I would recommend this for sure. Maybe with a different professor, but either way, it was a great class.",
    "If your choice is between the macro lecture on Science Hill and a seminar with Alonso, the seminar might be the lesser of two evils...as long as you can understand her thick Spanish accent. She could use a lot of work on explaining concepts more thoroughly and being a more engaging teacher.",
    "Much more interesting than micro, and gives you a much better perspective on economics as a discipline.",
    "Intro to MacroEcon is a great class in terms of the material. I found it much more interesting than Intro Micro. However, I would not recommend this section to you! Although Alonso is good during office hours, class can be really boring and you find that it is hard to understand the concepts that she is trying to explain. But her lecture notes are awesome!",
    "I would recommend it. The size of the class is the perfect learning environment."
