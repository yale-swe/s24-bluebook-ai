    "This class is a great introduction to Greek, teaching us about the language, history, grammar, and philosophy.",
    "I learned Attic Greek very well and now I am proficient in the grammar of the language. I am prepared to take L3 or possibly L5 Greek. I also learned how language works and how it developed from Indo-European. The class was fantastic.",
    "This is quite the crash course in Ancient Greek! If you manage to absorb all the (copious!) amount of information you are given the course the semester, you should be able to read some simpler texts by spring break!",
    "So much Greek! Amazing Class",
    "I learned Ancient Greek!"

   "comments": [
    "This course is beautifully taught by Professor Robinson, and he explains everything in the perfect amount of detail. While it is not easy, it is definitely worth the work.",
    "I loved this class because it was very immersive and I learned so much. I felt like Professor Robinson cared very much about my progress, and I got a lot of one-on-one help. Professor Robinson knows so much about Greek. He not only taught us forms of words very clearly, but he also explained the development of words from Proto Indo-European languages. I had taken Latin beforehand, and it was very illuminating to compare the two languages. One weakness of this class was that we did not have very many assessments, so I felt like I could not gauge how well I was doing. Also, it is a lot of work, which I did not mind. But, if you are not interested in Greek, it could be really terrible.",
    "I would prefer having a syllabus laid out at the beginning of the semester, not just after starting to read the Apology.",
    "The pace of the course is absurdly fast, which is both a weakness and a strength. On the one hand, it's an immersive experience, 2 hours day, and it's impossible not to learn something; on the other hand, it's so much material so fast it's very easy to become overwhelmed. I don't think it's a matter of improvement; the course is intensive by nature, so it depends mostly on the students shopping the course to figure out it they can deal with so much information at once.",
    "It is very hard, but extremely rewarding and worthwhile. The only weakness is I wish we could do more reading real excerpts early on instead of practice sentences, but I understand this is difficult because of vocab and the structure of Hansen and Quinn",
    "This course was incredible. Prof. Robinson is so kind and truly cares about not only his students' growth and development, but health and well-being. It is a tough course, and we truly do get through a lot of material, but he serves as a very capable guide through and through."

   "comments": [
    "If you're interested at all in the Ancient world and want to devote yourself to the classics, this is a great opportunity. One semester of daily grammar exercises and vocab flashcards is very much worth it.",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend this class. Again, it is a ton of work, so be prepared for it to take up a lot of mental space. But if that doesn't bother you, then it's an absolutely fantastic class. It's one of the best classes I have ever taken. I learned so much and I was challenged every day.",
    "I would not recommend this course unless you have a strong language background, especially in Latin. DO NOT take this with over 4 credits in a semester. Its too much work to balance, especially if you are working part-time.",
    "I would recommend this to a student who know for a fact they are suited to intensive language learning and who is willing to devote his life, at least for a semester, to Ancient Greek. Anything less 100% commitment isn't enough for this class, so I wouldn't recommend it to anything doing it on a whim. That being said, if you're passionate about Greek and are willing to put your heart and soul into it, it's the course for you.",
    "I would, as long as they are dedicated to learning the language and willing to put in the work. Professor Robinson is very understanding, but the nature of the course is that you will work hard; if you enjoy the material, it will be a more than worthwhile experience",
    "YES DO TAKE IT, ESPECIALLY WITH PROF. ROBINSON, AKA THE G.O.A.T."
