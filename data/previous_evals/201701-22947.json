   "comments": [
    "I learned from the applied research design and data quality discussions and feel better equipped to read and critique empirical papers in political science now.",
    "I learned how to critically look at and understand new research methods. I had zero background in it and probably still know only a little bit, but it was a great class to understand the basics of where the IR field is now.",
    "This class gave me a better understanding of the approaches to a political science study, from both an academic and policy perspective.",
    "I learned an immense amount about research designs and cutting edge inferential strategies in political science and in international relations in particular. Furthermore, I benefited from the replication exercise, which encouraged me to dig further and engage with the mechanics of other scholars' empirical strategies and find weaknesses and strengths in existing research. Course discussion was also helpful in that I was able to contribute my own ideas and learn from other students' and the instructor's insights into various readings.",
    "Learned a lot about the strengths and weaknesses of different research designs (more so than in other classes), which I really appreciated. I think I also got a good sense of the research agenda for several themes within the study of violence."

   "question_id": "GS403",
   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The class set-up is nice, with discussions of each paper and a brief lead-in by one of the students. I also enjoyed the background stories behind certain papers and\/or literatures. For improvements, this is pretty marginal, but it would be nice to get a few \"models\" of replication papers -- either discussed in the course or just as a list of suggestions -- as examples of what we could do.",
    "Strengths - small class, good selection of readings, professor very engaged and helpful - even to those of us who weren't PhD students. Weaknesses - none? It was a lot to take with IR1 in the same semester",
    "Strengths: deep engagement with research designs and cutting edge scholarship; encouraged students to push further through the replication exercise and in their own research; wide range of topics and empirical approaches Weaknesses: could have devoted one or two class sessions to IPE-related topics",
    "I think the strength was really digging into different papers, and I think this was absolutely invaluable. Do not change anything about the structure of class. The only thing I'd say is I thought too many of the readings addressed small questions or used reductionist methods. Now we often tore them apart well, but I think papers\/books with slightly broader ambitions would be nice. Finally, would've liked more than one work that relied primarily on ethnography\/interviews."

   "comments": [
    "Yes, if they are interested in security studies and\/or research design, this is a really nice applied course that both gives an overview of the field and of research design challenges.",
    "I would - I don't think this course is for everyone - but I think it was a good thing for me to take. It was a good mix of theory and research methods.",
    "Highly recommend--this is a crucial overview of methodology in political science. Even as a non-PhD student, I feel like having this background knowledge will be tremendously helpful going forward.",
    "I've recommended this to all students interested in international relations as well as those focusing on the American and political economy subfields because its focus on research design and empirical strategies is immensely helpful for my own research.",
    "Absolutely. Only caution would be that if someone is not that interested in trendy, DBI-type papers, this wouldn't be the class for them."
