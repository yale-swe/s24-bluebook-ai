    "If you're an econ major, then take it because you have to. Otherwise, don't even bother.",
    "ECON 121 is a challenging intermediate course in microeconomics. The course delves into the techniques necessary to explain consumer and firm behavior. The course problem sets, although lengthy, are necessary in order to explore the mechanics of how choices are optimized in real life situations. You see the applications of economics through this course.",
    "I wouldn't take this course unless you needed it for your major. It is similar in the topics covered to Intro Micro but with more math.",
    "Take it only if you have to",
    "Long problem sets that often have questions that require long tedious algebra. Expect to spend 8-10 hours a week on problem sets. Exams were hard but curved really well. Don't take this if not an Econ major, but if you are an Econ major this course helps explain a lot of concepts by using calculus that didn't make sense in intro micro. Overall it was a good class.",
    "Professor Larry Samuelson is a masterful lecturer. He takes this dry, mathematical material, and relates it in an engaging way to over one hundred students, most of whom are not interested in math. If you're an economics major, take this class (obviously). It will teach you that microeconomics could aptly be named \"math models for decision-making,\" and not \"making money,\" which is what most incoming freshman think it means. If you did well in multi-variable calculus, you'll do very well here. Practice tests are bountifully provided, and you need to do them. The tests are challenging, the problem sets are easy, and you will receive the grade you work for.",
    "If you don't have to take this course, don't take it. Else take it in the spring, it's apparently better then. But otherwise, welcome to the struggle and I hope you make it through. Best of luck, comrade.",
    "Solid covering of the topics in intro micro, albeit with a mathematical foundation and explanation. Prof. Samuelson was great, although lectures can get boring at times due to their dryness and often hypothetical nature.",
    "Challenging. The material is interesting if you can get into it, but it can be easy to get bogged down in the math\/formulas if you haven't studied them enough. Rewarding if you can invest the time and effort. Go to office hours (PSETS can be tough but TAs help a lot) and work with other people.",
    "Dont take this class unless you have to take it for the econ major. Incredibly difficult and painful, problem sets look incredibly different than any sort of sample problems we do in lecture.",
    "This course is necessary for the economics major, so most people are taking it for their major. The problem sets can be very tedious, and can take upwards of 6 hours to complete. Basically taking all of the concepts from Intro Micro and adding math to them. My math level isn't the highest and I was worried about this going into the class, but all you really need is a basic understanding of derivatives and integrals. Definitely make use of all resources available to you such as your TA's office hours and sections, etc.",
    "Econ 121 is a math-based continuation of Econ 115. I would recommend this class to a student who is interested in majoring in Economics but am unsure if I would recommend it to someone simply looking for a class. Expect to spend a decent amount of time on problem sets to fully understand the material.",
    "ECON 121, economics major weeder course. The textbook sucks, so don't count of it replacing lecture or helping you out on psets (which will take up all of Monday night and beyond if you procrastinate like I did). Office hours are damn helpful if you're stuck on a problem, so take advantage of them. The usefulness of section greatly depends on the TA; choose wisely or switch out while you can. This is not an easy course for us average people, although the curve is favorably skewed towards A-\/A (50% A- and above). Paying attention in lecture helps, but Samuelson will make some leaps that you might not catch. Oh, and Samuelson is the man. I don't know how the other professors are, but Samuelson had a great sense of humor, a very prepared lecturer, all while killing it on Piazza. Definitely take it with him you have\/want to.",
    "Yes, if you have to for the major. Else, no.",
    "Definitely do not take the class unless you are going to be an Econ Major. Class is heavily math based, and while there are real world applications, they are largely secondary. I enjoy economics, but often this class could be frustrating, as problem sets and tests would ask questions that go far beyond what is taught in lecture.",
    "Econ 121 is a survey of intermediate microeconomics. Intermediate microeconomics, like all of the neoliberal claptrap still being peddled even post-2008, suffers from many intellectual problems. It takes Homo economicus, a laughable, cardboard model of a human being, and proceeds to demonstrate how lots of things are true if you assume that people act to maximize their utility (usually understood in terms of money) and that firms act to maximize their profits. This would be fine if those assumptions were well-founded. Sadly, they are not. You would think that any discipline purporting to deal with human beings would care about modeling them properly, with accurate psychology, but this does not seem to be the case in econ-world. This class teaches you neoclassical economic theory, divorced from reality and moral considerations. You do not read economics books, you do not read economics papers demonstrating how many of the \"laws\" demonstrated in class aren't validated by empirics, and you do not contemplate the possibility that much of the scientism and physics envy of economics is a smokescreen for right-wing ideology. Professor Samuelson is an excellent professor, but an excellent professor can't make irredeemable subject matter any less irredeemable. Only take this class if you must. Otherwise, there are plenty of other social sciences\/humanities classes that will give you a much better grip on human nature and society. If you're looking to review your basic multivariate calculus, though, this could be the class for you!",
    "Take it if you are an Econ major, or EP&E. Otherwise, you better REALLY be interested in microeconomics. It is very time consuming, and if you don't go to lecture, and really try to understand the psets, you will struggle come exam time.",
    "If you are not strong with math, don't take it.",
    "An incredibly difficult class, but Samuelson is an awesome teacher. The psets are long, the tests are hard, but you will learn a lot.",
    "Hard. Take only if you need to. Just hard. Glad it's over.",
    "I would recommend this course if your major requires it. This is a difficult course, and the problem sets took a long time every week. Many students went to office hours every week because the problem set was difficult. The exams were challenging as well, so if you do take it, make sure you do all the practice exams to get familiar with the format\/difficult of the exams. This class goes more in-depth with mathematics to explain some of the concepts that were presented in Intro Micro.",
    "I would only recommend this course to those who are thinking of majoring in economics.",
    "Very challenging and required a lot of work. The psets were very challenging and the exams could go either way. Honestly, do not take this class for fun. I would never take it if it wasn't a requirement for my major.",
    "I wouldn't recommend it unless they are trying to figure out whether they want to pursue an economics major. I thought I was going to be an Economics and Math major and took this class, and found myself not very interested by the material covered in the class. It definitely helped in making a decision to move away from that major.",
    "This class convinced me I didn't want to major in economics. That being said, I don't think it was poorly taught but the material was just so dry and inapplicable. Unless you enjoy the math side of economics rather than the social science side, I would not recommend taking this class. If you are thinking about majoring in EP&E or global affairs, I would take this class credit\/D. It will save you lots of late nights of deriving math equations. The PSETS were terrible, but graded easily. They were not about learning the concepts, but rather manipulating long strings of equations with many variables.",
    "If you are an Econ major, you need to take this course. It's going to be a struggle, there's going to be a good amount of work, and you will need to study a lot, but there plenty of means for accomplishing all of these things. Take it if you need to.",
    "Econ 121 is a very advanced economics class, I would only recommend this for anyone who is planning on majoring in economics.",
    "Intermediate Microeconomics is a workhorse class of the Econ major. Take it because you have to as an Econ major or if you are serious about continuing in studying economic applications through other avenues. Otherwise, there are easier and\/or more interesting QRs.",
    "Take the class if you must for a major, but everything you actually have to know for an understanding of micro economics is taught in the intro course,",
    "This is probably just a class you have to take. There are only two reasons not to take it: 1) You're interested in proof-based math, in which case you should take 125 or 2) You don't have to take it. If you don't have to take it, you shouldn't because it's boring material. Period.",
    "I would recommend this class inasmuch as you should try your best to take it with Samuelson as opposed to other professors. Do not attempt Intermediate Micro \"for the hell of it,\" or for any reason other than it is required for your major.",
    "A very tough class.",
    "Difficult!",
    "This class was a great class. Larry Samuelson teaches it very well! Much better than intro micro. I would recommend it if you actually want to learn something, but just beware it's not easy and it'll take up a lot of time. Psets are a min of 3 hours and you usually have to go in for help to solve them. TA office hours are really good for this. It's a 9 am class so make sure you get up in time. It's also in Davies which is pretty hot and optimal for falling asleep. What I found most helpful was filling a water bottle with ice cold water before class and every time Samuelson takes a drink of his water, you take a drink of yours. Kept me awake most of the time. Also, the second midterm I found difficult in that I didn't really know what to study for, so make sure to bug your TAs. The hardest pset is the one about competitive equilibrium with production. Make sure you start at least 5 days in advance so you have enough time to stop in to all the office hours you need to",
    "I would recommend this class to a student who really enjoys Econ and who has a fairly strong math background. A strong calculus background is extremely helpful since most of the problems we do are based on first order conditions. Although multi variable calculus is not a prerequisite for this course, I would definitely recommend taking this before taking Intermediate Micro.",
    "It is a requirement for the Econ major, and the psets are very hard and long, but you'll get through it.",
    "The problem with this course is that the coherent system of math behind it is waaaaaaay high level, higher than one most people go into 121 knowing. This means you're taught a bunch of random models and the way you succeed on the test is memorizing the models and then being able to apply them in BS-y ways. Its completely disconnected from actual economics and is just a shitty and discouraging class to take. The tests are all just really fucking weird. Basically the material of this class just sucks and since its designed to be a weed-out class they intentionally make the material weird. They should actually teach us a coherent understanding of economics instead of a bunch of random bullshit models designed to confuse us. This class does way more harm than good to the economics major. But you have to take it and apparently 125 is super shitty so just get it over with. Take Great Recession as History concurrently with you to remind you what econ is actually about and how cool it is. Cause this class will just make you hate economics.",
    "A tough course, with some really tough material. The primary focus is on method, not actual new content, but you definitely become a better thinker and better economist and thinker overall through this class. Samuelson is great. If you're an econ major you have to take this class, so why not with Samuelson...",
    "Good class, an extension of intro micro with more math involved. If you have a decent math background the class should be enjoyable and not too difficult. The psets do take a long time but it can be managed if you work with other students",
    "It is interesting and important, but I would really only take it if you need it to fulfill your major.",
    "A required course",
    "Decent class, don't take it if you don't have to, but also not as hard as it's rumored to be.",
    "It's a required course for many majors and you got to take it. Take it with Larry, because he cares about his students. All his lecture notes are posted and past exams are given as study tools as well. The problem sets are a bitch, but they're once a week. Take it with Larry and get it over with.",
    "A very difficult course focusing on advanced theory behind microeconomics.",
    "Overall, I would recommend taking this class in the fall. Professor Samuelson is a great professor and can makes the material easier to handle.",
    "At the beginning, I would have said no, but as the months went by, this class felt more and more rewarding. I feel that understanding the mathematics behind fundamental economic concepts is critical, especially for future econ classes. That being said, I would recommend this class only if a student has a strong enough math background. Understanding what a lagrange multiplier does helps a lot with understanding the econ maximization problems.",
    "Econ 121 is a class that takes concepts from micro economics and uses math models to explain the intuition behind them and build upon them. Concepts from beginning micro are further explored and explained. I would only recommend the class for econ majors as beginning micro is good enough for those not attempting to major in econ.",
    "I took Intermediate Microeconomics as a requirement for the economics major, and as a mathematically challenged person, this was a very hard class. You need to be ready to put quite a bit of time into this class if you want to succeed. Prof Samuelson is a great lecturer, and if you take the time to listen, he can actually explain things very well. But it's often hard to pay attention at 9AM, and if you fall behind, it will be hard verging on impossible to catch up. His Problem Sets are also virtually impossible if you don't go to office hours every week and make sure to understand what he wants from you. Good luck with this class! I wish you the best. At least there's a generous curve.",
    "The problem sets are extremely difficult, time consuming, and stressful. Expect 4-page problem sets filled with 14-18 questions on average. These problem sets will have difficult calculations and you will need to be resourceful in figuring out how to solve them. The book is not taught from a textbook, the lectures gloss over how to actually solve the problems, and the sections (per usual) are at best a bit helpful in getting started on the psets. But, the psets are the worst part of this course. The lectures are interesting and the professor is clearly talented in applying microeconomic theory and using it to internet human action. For those interested in the philosophy of economics, this course can't help but reveal the assumptions, methods, and aspirations of economics. It is interesting that much of the course is taught from the notion that we can learn things about human behavior FROM the models we study. Of course, in practice the opposite is true: economic models aim to represent (=\"learn from\" and model) human behavior. Nonetheless, even after close scrutiny, I can't help but feel economics is probably one of the very best attempts humanity has made at explaining and predicting human behavior (in both economic spheres and outside of them). The tests are probably the easiest part of this course, ironically. In my estimation, if you are equipped with knowledge of intro micro & macro, you needn't attend a single lecture nor do a single problem set in order to do well on the tests. All you need to do is closely study the tests from previous years (this is also the best method to study for the tests even if you have done the psets and attended the lectures). There are typically 3-5 different types of problems that appear on each test. Each test is generally 3-4 problems long. So, master how to solve each type of problem, and you will be able to do reasonably well on the exams.",
    "Its a required econ class, but I did enjoy it.",
    "The course load is not particularly difficult, but given the high numbers in the class, the tests are hard",
    "Samuelson is an extremely dense lecturer and it was very hard to follow his lectures. Your success in the course really depends on the caliber of your TA and whether you have smart friends to help you through the course. I walked away from this class feeling like I didn't learn anything particularly useful. I would not recommend ECON 121 to a fellow student unless the course is required for their major.",
    "Basically just take it if you have to for your major. Not a great class to take for fun.",
    "Required class for Econ majors, take it with Samuelson. Very clear and knowledgeable professor and interesting material. You appreciate what you learned in intro to micro after taking this class.",
    "Definitely not a life-changing course, but if you're an econ major you have to take it. Often what you learn in class isn't necessarily what's on the psets, and the psets aren't very good reflection of what the exams are like.",
    "Most people don't take intermediate micro for fun, so if you're taking it, you're probably an econ or EPE major. It is what it is.",
    "If you liked Intro Micro, then definitely take this course! As an econ person, I absolutely loved this class. It gives a much more thorough look at some of the topics discussed in Intro Micro, usually delving into the calculus that was sidestepped in Econ 116. The course gives a solid base of theory and also presents some interesting applications in policy, etc. That being said, many of my classmates did not enjoy this course nearly as much as I did. So the moral of the story is, if you like econ, definitely take this course; if not, then consider looking elsewhere. The material is definitely challenging--problem sets often required 4+ hours and were rarely easy and the final was really quite difficult.",
    "Unless you are convinced that you enjoy theoretical mathematical modeling of economics, do not take this class for fun, as it is not exceptionally kind to your GPA and is focused on theoretical mathematical modeling of economics. If you know that you are supposed to take the class for the economics major or the EP&E major, consider taking this class later, once you are sure of your major, so that you do not have to take it and then realize that you will not apply it to a major. Finally, if you are an EP&E major who abhors math, definitely consider taking this class as your Credit\/D\/Fail required core course, because it will be difficult to get a good grade in this class if you abhor math.",
    "This class teaches the mechanics behind different markets and what it takes for this markets to function and how it is all applied in real life, through policies.",
    "This class was one of the most painful experiences of my life at Yale. Made extremely hard by the way it was taught. It is a requirement for the major, and the class doesn't make it easy to like it at all. But you have to take it, so you have to take it. You'll be sleeping during lecture and hate everything for most of the semester because the problem sets and exams are really really hard and nothing can be done about it becuase it has no structure.",
    "It's kind of tough, but not too bad. I think the hardest thing for me was to get up in the morning and since it's never taught at another time, if you take it, you've got to do it at this time. I think the problem sets were decent mostly, though you're allowed to miss one and I completely just didn't do the longest one... so that might skew my opinion. Samuelson's a great lecturer and is super good with any questions, so don't feel bad asking anything.",
    "Thought it was a solid class. No compulsory reading, just weekly psets.",
    "Only take this class if you HAVE to. Although the material itself is not too difficult , the psets are sometimes impossible to solve, and are always extremely long and time consuming. Both midterms were deadly and the final especially was a killer.",
    "I would recommend the class to any student interested in going more in depth in the basic dynamics of economics. In the end, most of the class is in the major, so there's little to choose, but I would say that this course is less scary\/boring than many claim.",
    "It is challenging but worth the effort if you are interested in economics.",
    "Not worth taking if not doing the Econ major. I thought it might be worthwhile, but it's main value was convincing me to explore other majors.",
    "Awful course do NOT take this",
    "A challenging course, but a rewarding one in which you will learn the techniques behind economic models. A large part of the course is devoted to the mathematics of maximizing a consumer's utility, while the second half of the course deals with applications of the model and instances where the model fails (i.e. market failure). Having completed a rigorous economics course in high school, my foray into college economics has exposed me to a new, mathematical framework in looking at the subject, rather than a content-based approach that I was familiar with. Weekly problem sets are difficult, but office hours (go for them!) are extremely useful and illuminating. My sections with Esteban have been incredibly helpful in clarifying concepts covered during lectures too. Lastly, the Piazza forum that Prof Samuelson set up is an efficient and helpful studying tool, both to post questions (anonymously, as most do) and to read Prof Samuelson's responses to others' questions. Overall, much help is available for struggling students throughout the course if sought for, even though lectures may get too complicated and difficult to grasp during the semester.",
    "It should be taken if necessary; however I wouldn't recommend it on its own, rather it is useful in the greater context of economics.",
    "Yes, take it! It's a great class and you learn some very useful material about the market!",
    "Econ 121 is a great course with a great professor, but be ready for a lot of math. If you have the opportunity to take Math 120 before this class, or concurrently with it, I would recommend you do. I think it should be a prerequisite for the major. I came in with a strong math background and was expecting the course to be a breeze because of this, but it certainly had its challenges. While I appreciated that the course was math-heavy, I thought that at times the details of the math crowded out the understanding of more general ideas, particularly in lecture. On tests, to avoid the tedious math that we covered in lecture, Professor Samuelson often uses tricks such as corner solutions and non-differentiable functions to make solutions shorter. I had a problem with this, as the problem tested a student's ability to understand Samuelson's thinking rather than understanding the economic ideas covered in lecture. Still, a good class to work through, and not too much work. Probably 3-6 hours for each problem set.",
    "This course is technical and challenging. Expect to go over the material a few times before you fully understand it. Attending lecture and section is critical. Professor Samuelson and the TFs are all receptive to questions, which is very helpful as you work through the problem sets.",
    "You have to take this course to be an econ major.... It's a fun course with Larry, but if I could go back I would advise a few things. -Make friends to check over psets with unless you're super confident in working alone -Go to office hours For the exams, the best guide will be the practice exams that Larry puts up. If you can do those, you'll be in decent shape for the midterms\/final. Just be prepared because Larry will throw curveballs at you. (The final had 2 questions when generally it has at least 3) Best of luck",
    "I qualified to skip ahead to this course past the into Econ courses, and I have no regrets about doing this. While some of the same topics are revisited, they are done with a more mathematical treatment, and it helped to understand the mathematical underpinnings of these models. This course is ideal for those who like mathematics but want a more policy-oriented approach, which they may not receive in ECON 125 or a more theoretical course; lectures often times address some of the policy implications of the material. Professor Samuelson is an excellent lecturer and very approachable, and sections were very helpful for clarifying material. However, it is a difficult course. Problem sets were lengthy and difficult and often stressed tedious computation. It is essential to go to office hours in order to do well on them. Tests were likewise difficult conceptually, and the problem sets did at times detract from test preparation. Overall, though, despite its reputation, it is definitely possible to do well in the course despite its difficulty. For those contemplating skipping the introductory sequence and going straight to this course, I would highly recommend doing so. However, I do feel that taking Multivariable Calculus before, or at least concurrent, with this course better prepares students to succeed here; while Multivariable concepts are introduced in the course itself, it helped to have the prior knowledge of it.",
    "I would strongly recommend this course, and not just to economics majors. The material is interesting and applicable in a broad array of contexts. The problem sets grow substantially harder as the course proceeds.",
    "Great course. Samuelson is awesome.",
    "HARD. Harder than it seems but don't worry, grading is very generous.",
    "Do NOT take this class unless you are econ major or you like to be sad all the time about a subject that you used to find interesting. tests were not related to lecture and were ridiculous the average grade for a test was never higher than a 70"
