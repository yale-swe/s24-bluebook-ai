    "I would not recommend ENAS 518 to another student mainly due to the disconnection between the Matlab write ups and the actual course material. Often times assignments boiled down to debugging the Matlab and ignoring the actual mathematical manipulations utilized for each section. I do not feel better equipped to do linear algebra or differential equations without the help of a simple Matlab function which I believe severely limits what is learned from the course.",
    "It seems to me like this course is still evolving. I would recommend it as a good introductory course, but I don't know how it will be taught in the future.",
    "I would certainly recommend to other students. It's not only beneficial for those who have not learned a lot about mathematics but also for those who have learned but do not know a lot about applications of those methods."

    "I believe this course did not deepen my knowledge of my discipline or profession because I learned little with regards to solving linear algebra and differential equations without being completely reliant on a program like Matlab.",
    "Yes it introduced me to matlab",
