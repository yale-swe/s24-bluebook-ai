    "Grading for midterm did not, in my opinion, reflect understanding of material, no partial credit in many parts so making minor math mistakes causes you to lose 20+ points. Also, the GMM section was a bit abstract at times, would be nice to cover more applications. Overall though, solid overview of econometric theory, well taught, clear presentation.",
    "Class was generally good. Exams could be a bit clearer at times. Also, it would help to get a bit more of an outline of how the topics fit together.",
    "I liked the coverage of topics and the style of exam questions. I wish we had not introduced GMM right before the midterm because we weren't focusing on that material but it turned out to be very important.",
    "It would be great if the prof can teach more intuition and empirical topics rather than just copying notes and proofs.",
    "could have spent less time on OLS and more time on topics (GMM, time series, panel etc.)",
    "Strength: It covers many topics from linear regression to non-parametric estimation.",
    "More shorter practice questions on the problem sets.",
    "The course was well organized",
    "I suggest standardizing the coding language folks use for the empirical parts of the homework (at least per assignment). That way, we can learn the applied methods together and consistently, and, perhaps develop some intuition about the limitations and advantages of different software packages."
