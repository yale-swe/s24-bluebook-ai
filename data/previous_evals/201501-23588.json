    "I think the course could be a lot more valuable to students with a few tweaks.",
    "Professor Benoit clearly couldn't care less about teaching. He puts in as little effort as possible, and just wants to go on the field trip with the students he wants (which are usually pretty girls, the guy is a real creeper). Despite having an active interest in the topic of the course, I learned next to nothing and was disappointed in almost all aspects of the course. Even the field trip wasn't an academic experience, as it was mainly just drinking on the beach and touring around. That being said, the trip was a great time, and the reason I took the course. As you can tell from previous evaluations, you certainly don't take this class to learn anything.",

    "The field trip was an awesome time, and gives you an opportunity to do other things that interest you in the Caribbean during Spring Break.",
    "The field trip was invaluable to the course. I learned more in a week in St. Thomas than I did during class the rest of the semester. I was able to bounce ideas off Gabe and Mary Beth about my project while we were there, and was able to use resources on the island that were unavailable here on campus.",

   "comments": [
    "The classes where students present the information in the readings should be more of a discussion than \"lecture style\". Everyone could sit around the table to discuss the material as an engaged group rather than having to sit through a power point presentations where more than half the class is not really paying attention and doing work for other classes on computers. The \"presenter\" could be the one responsible for answering questions and leading the discussion and have a typed up outline of the points for discussion. Trip: Give students the time to have interviews needed for their research. Make use of more local expertise as well. There are many on the island.",
    "Just about everything. See my answer to number 13. Really, the course just needs a new professor. Gabe Benoit is hands down the worst teacher at the school, and that's not just coming from me, but literally dozens of other students that I've talked to about it.",
    "The course should be more discussion based rather than presentation-style. I would have liked to see more teaching done by the professors rather than the students. The instructors could have been much better organized--many of the meetings on the island fell through while we were there, and classes were cancelled twice ten minutes before class was supposed to meet. Very annoying for those of us who could have planned our days better.",
    "Student-led discussions were hard to actually generate discussion."

And then if you do take it, make sure to get some extra funding and go to the Caribbean for at least the whole two weeks. Also, if you are a girl, stay as far away from Gabe Benoit as possible. There were many uncomfortable and unacceptable moments from him on the trip, so just be aware of that.",
    "This course is what you make of it. The professors will put in the extra effort if you ask for their help, but will do minimal work otherwise. Come in with an idea you might be interested in, as you will be conducting research for your final project almost entirely on your own."
