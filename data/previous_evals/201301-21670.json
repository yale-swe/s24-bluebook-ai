    "Developments in Modern Physics provided a survey of the basics of Newtonian mechanics, the wave theory of light and Maxwell's equations, special and general relativity, quantum mechanics, and cosmology for non-science majors. It was an excellent class to take if you are interested in physics but for whatever reason are not interested in delving into quantum field theory, tensor analysis, or intense calculus. You examine the various subjects conceptually and develop an understanding of the present post-Newtonian paradigm in a way that is unrivaled. Professor Tipton was a superlative professor. If you are looking for a science class that has no prerequisites, has a fairly light workload, and uses math to clarify instead of obfuscate, this is the class for you!",
    "Take this course!",
    "I definitely recommend this class to the type of student who would search through random physics topics on Wikipedia for fun, wishing that he or she understood half of the words in the articles.",
    "This class is a great overview of the developments in the history of physics, and a great science credit for non-science majors-- Professor Tipton is a very good professor in a seminar setting, and he struck a perfect balance going into just enough detail for us to understand all of the complicated topics we went through."
