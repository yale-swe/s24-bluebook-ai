   "comments": [
    "Rather disorganized",
    "Strengths: - as above, a good overview of the major technologies and the historiographic debates surrounding them. - I appreciated that the class didn't stick only to texts written by people who call themselves 'media archeologists' and instead took a broader and more historiographically sophisticated viewpoint. Weaknesses: - I feel the course could have benefitted from some introductory sessions in which we go more deeply into Foucault's archeological and genealogical methods, and discuss these in relation to some of the texts most commonly associated with \"Media Archeology\" as a field. Though, again, I felt that the syllabus took an approach to these topics that was ultimately more sophisticated than many current \"archeological\" approaches I feel many of us would have liked to leave the classroom able to speak with more authority (and critically) about the range of contemporary writing that goes under the name \"media archeology\" - Some examples, texts, etc. that are outside the European canon would be nice",
    "I thought that the course was well organized and covered an interesting range of media and technologies",
    "The readings were excellent and I appreciated the professors' presentations\/overviews in class. I would have liked more time for student discussion, but this was difficult in the time frame. Perhaps the course should be slightly longer, or extend into the spring."
