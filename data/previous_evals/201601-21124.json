   "comments": [
    "This class is very practical if you are interested in RCTs and impact evaluations. It gives you a very good foundation to build off of when you construct your own later on. Would recommend.",
    "Yeah, gives an overview of an interesting and important literature",
    "PLSC 128 is a great introduction into the world of development work in Afghanistan, Iraq and a few other places around the world. However, it is by no means reflective of all the stakeholders that would actually be involved in development projects. So, take the class if you want to know whether you'd enjoy development aid and strategy, but avoid it if you're already an advanced Poli Sci major.",
    "This was a good class, but it wasn't quite as good as I thought it would be from the first couple classes.",
    "Great exposure to theory\/research design, especially for someone without prior political science\/international affairs experience.",
    "Development aid in conflict zones. Great class, great readings, realistic assessment of aid work and its flaws.",
    "This class is HARD. There is a TON of dense reading (~100 pages to prepare for each lecture) and a lot of writing, too. But the material is very relevant and new. Practical knowledge comes along with theoretical chops.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to a friend. The content is accessible while still being in-depth and it made me reconsider a lot of my assumptions about development and aid. It has also taught me strong research methodology principles that will be applicable to a wide-range of future coursework.",
    "Super interesting, great balance of theory and practical evaluation skills. Really liked that we got to design our own experiment at the end. Important note: anyone who thinks that the class's content is so dark that its a downside to the class needs to hop out of their ivory tower and say hello to the real world. In the real world, you are not right all the time and trial and error is literally the foundation of all practical knowledge. An obvious difficulty of this class is that it is almost impossible to be completely right in terms of the strategy you use for your final impact analysis. I think this is a challenge but not a reason to not take the class.",
    "A nice introduction to development projects in conflict areas; the first half is theoretical (and more interesting, I thought), while the second half is more technical; essentially just about impact evaluations, which got a bit dry. Good class overall, though the material can be somewhat frustrating at times, as nothing we review in the class really seems to be working very well. Lyall is an amazing professor, engaging, interesting, and experienced in the field.",
    "- Difficult, challenging GLBL course - would recommend to junior\/seniors, but not for freshman - Would recommend - Need background?",
    "Solid class. Highly recommend to anyone interested in foreign aid and political violence particularly in the middle east.",
    "Definitely would recommend",
    "It's an okay class with interesting material. The course ended up being all about Iraq and Afghanistan and it wasn't the survey course I thought it would be at first. If we talked more about different conflict settings such as Sierra Leone, Colombia, Uganda,etc then I think the course would have been much more interesting as a result. We spent way too much time on theory. Readings were oftentimes highly technical and hard to get through, and the course and its discussion sections would have benefited from having less readings because then more people would have done them. Lyall's a really great lecturer though.",
    "Yes take it!!!!",
    "ABSOLUTELY",
    "Yes, this is a great course to learn about impact evaluation and its different considerations one has to take into account.",
    "I really enjoyed this class -- far more than I expected to. This subject matter is far out of my ken and out of my general interest area, but I actually found it to be very thought provoking. I have to admit that I took a lot of fault with a lot of the readings we did, just because I have strong reservations about studying large groups of people and drawing generalizations. But there was room for my skepticism and Professor Lyall definitely welcomed the pushback. Professor Lyall is a great lecturer and made class interesting and worthwhile. I liked that it was split up into theory and practice, and while I thought that the overview of running impact evaluations would be boring, it was actually very helpful.",
    "A solid global affairs course with a reasonable workload. Professor Lyall is great and the material is pretty engaging.",
    "Take this class! Development Under Fire was one of my favorite classes this semester, it taught me so much about conflict dynamics and foreign aid and the connections between the two. Professor Lyall is incredible, he really made the class engaging and interesting. There is a ton of reading, however, but the lecture and section go over it pretty well so there is definitely no need to do it all. The grading was pretty harsh though and the final paper was really hard but really interesting as well. One drawback to the class as a whole however, was that its approach was very centered around the United States and it sometimes felt like the US was the only country in the world being at war and providing aid which was very frustrating in the beginning. Otherwise, this class is a must-take in your Yale career!",
    "Very interesting course on development in conflict\/post-conflict areas. Cautionary note: there's a lot of focus on research design, particularly towards the second half of the course. Be ready for a lot of heavy academic papers (you don't need to read them in full, but I always skimmed abstracts\/section headings\/conclusions and made sure I knew that major themes were). Research design paper is a cool assignment, but definitely requires a lot of advance planning to do well. Great class, but don't join just for the cool stories about administering aid in conflict zones.",
    "Development Under Fire is a fascinating intro to concepts such as conflict zones and the effectiveness of foreign aid. Although the wide range of countries and situations seemed a bit overwhelming at times, Professor Lyall made clear the common trends and threads. It is definitely a manageable and engaging class that I would recommend to any student.",
    "yes very interesting class. class focused just as much on how to do studies as it is about this topic. so only do it if you are interested in that",
    "Take this class. Professor Lyall is one of the best lecturers I have ever had at Yale. He is also really experienced in the field and has visited many of the places presented in the readings. There were weekly readings, but you mostly just need to extract the important information from each. The first half is theoretical and the second, more practical. There is a very fair midterm and then a somewhat sizable final project, but Lyall had check-in assignments to facilitate and is really willing to help ahead of time.",
    "I would definitely recommend PLSC 128 to another student! No matter what you're interested in, this is a wonderful class that talks about engaging issues and current world topics. You learn valuable skills like conducting impact evaluations and leave the class with a vast knowledge on aid work (especially the areas that need improvement). The class mostly focuses on the pitfalls of humanitarian work so that can be a bit depressing, but they are important issues to be aware of. Overall, wonderful class!",
    "Definitely take this class. You will learn a lot about a truly relevant ad engaging topic. Professor Lyall is AMAZING. Just take it, you won't regret it.",
    "Interesting course on insurgency and how to combat it with aid.",
    "Definitely take!",
    "I would recommend it. The subject matter is fascinating but the TAs really make or break the class.",
    "Definitely take this class if you want to learn more about what's happening in the international development world, but are perhaps a bit hesitant about entering the realm of political science. I definitely learned valuable, retainable information, Professor Lyall is a lecturing rockstar, and the class is very manageable work-load wise (two 5-page papers, a midterm, and a final paper). As Professor Lyall will warn you on the first day, it's a \"dark\" class, but one that makes you a better-informed student and citizen.",
    "Take the class.",
    "Fantastic class with thought-provoking and engaging lectures that deal with cutting-edge studies. Professor Lyall is outstanding. Heavy workload of readings.",
    "Whatever your major is, take this course. What you learn about research design will help you no matter what your background; what you learn about Aid and War will change the way you see the world.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to a fellow student. Great global\/political science class with a wonderful lecturer and interesting material.",
    "I highly recommend this class. It is the best class I have taken at Yale and it has really shaped my course of study. Professor Lyall is an amazing lecturer and the content of the course is interesting and engaging.",
    "Yes this is a great class and a good break from strictly academic thinking--I felt more engaged with the world through this course and it helped me to stay grounded and avoid the \"Yale bubble\" of impractical academia for academia's sake.",
    "If you have any interest in international development or development aid, this is a must-take course for you. The workload is fair and I would take it just for Professor Lyall's lectures.",
    "GLBL 247 is a class I would definitely recommend to any student who wants to see what the Global Affairs\/Political Science majors are about. I think it's a great introductory class because it covers an engaging, exciting, and relevant topic--it takes in a lot that we hear about in the news: terrorist and insurgent organizations, NGOs, foreign aid to troubled countries, etc--and goes into explaining the theoretical foundations of all of this, and how we can go about fixing the problems that are there. Professor Lyall is a great lecturer, and extremely approachable, which makes the class even better. Lyall jokes a lot that this is a \"dark class,\" and I agree, based on all the failures on the ground that we read about, but the material taught in this class is important to know, and will definitely shape the way you see the world. Every lecture is simply captivating, and even the papers required by the class are fun and interesting as well. This has been one of my favorite classes so far.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class, whether or not you are a Global Affairs major. This is the kind of critical thinking everyone should develop, and thinking about these big issues makes me appreciate what we have and how we can help others in less fortunate circumstances.",
    "Definitely! One of the best classes I've taken. The theories of conflict and violence, and their evaluation in empirical ways is handled beautifully in this class. The lectures are great and the assignments are fair. It is a decent amount of work but well worth it.",
    "I would definitely recommend Plsc 128, one of my favorite classes at Yale so far!",
    "This course is a thorough introduction to impact evaluations and development assessment for counterinsurgency. I would recommend this course to any student looking for a critical analysis of development work. Lyall admits that the course is not very uplifting. It provides information on what people know doesn't work but not what does work.",
    "I would recommend it as an interesting course that definitely gets harder as the semester goes on.",
    "Take this course even if it is out of your comfort zone as a STEM person who was unfamiliar with the background of the class I was able to keep up and had a great experience. For the most out of this class do the readings so that you can actively participate in section.",
    "This is an amazing class and Professor Lyall is an amazing professor. You will learn a ton, and it isn't a ton of work. It is mostly about insurgencies, and aid in developing countries. The lectures are really interesting, and the weekly readings tend to be pretty cool.",
    "good class, interesting perspective on a complex topic.",
    "It's an amazing course if you have the time to do all the readings. I wish I could have managed my time so I learned more.",
    "I will strongly recommend it.",
    "I took this class because I thought it would complicate my understanding of international aid and engagement, which I knew to be problematic and wanted to explore further. Unfortunately, instead of being sensitive to the complexities of foreign assistance in conflict zones, the class predominately focused on aid as a tool of military strategy, which felt imperialist and neocolonial and gross. For this reason, I can't recommend the class. If you take it, though, do so with a critical eye -- it's easy to drink Lyall's KoolAid, but please consider the implications of what he's saying, and what he's leaving out.",
    "Good class, don't make the mistake of doing credit\/d - manageable to get an A.",
    "Overall a very interesting course, but it's hard to find a good section with a good TF. Lyall is incredibly compelling. The reading can be a lot, but it was my first political science class, so I think it was actually pretty normal for that.",
    "Take this class!!! Super interesting, very practical, and amazing professor\/teaching staff.",
    "This is a course that is absolutely fascin ating. The lectures are fantastic and the assignments are unique. I would absolutely recommend this course."
