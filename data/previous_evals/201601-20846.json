    "Take classes with Mercedes, she's great.",
    "Yes, definitely. It is a must take if you're interested in medicine one day.",
    "Yes! Absolutely recommend this class, especially if you are someone who tested into L5 but maybe hasn't spoken spanish in a while and needs a refresher course, or if you have an interested in health\/medicine! Light workload, but many opportunities to practice your spanish!",
    "Learn about medicine in Spanish. Would recommend.",
    "Mercedes is a saint. If you are worried about your Spanish skills, don't be, you'll do fine in the class. If you raise your hand and talk occasionally that's better than 75% of the class.",
    "Absolutely take this class. It's not stressful (v chill), and Professor Carreras is probably the sweetest, kindest professor I've ever had. Workload is weekly homework assignments, one final presentation, and one final paper.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course.",
    "Take this class. The workload is light but you will enjoy it very much and learn a lot. Profesora Carreras is amazing. Must take class for people interested in Spanish and medicine.",
    "Good class with not a lot of work",
    "10\/10 would recommend",
    "Lots of medical readings, that Castellaa accent is a little triply at first, but otherwise this course is great.",
    "This was an amazing course! I loved the dynamic in the class with the professor encouraging participation. It felt almost like a very relaxed seminar and we all had the chance to participate! And Prof. Carreras might be the treasure of Yale's Spanish Faculty! TAKE THIS CLASS!",
    "An easy L5 course that lets you expand your working knowledge of Spanish, without being too concerned about nitty gritty grammar rules, or memorizing hundreds of vocab words.",
    "I would definitely recommend it! Relaly intersting class where you get to learn about a lot of interesting diseases. Be warned: this is a class about medicine taught in spanish, it isn't really a spanish class, so if you want to learn spanish grammar, etc. go to another spanish class. I really loved learning everything that was taught and I honestly had a blast writing the final paper.",
    "This is a good course that did help me gain confidence in my Spanish abilities. It's not very intense but you do learn a lot."
