   "comments": [
    "It's interesting material, made me think about my built environment really differently. But that's probably because I had almost no experience with urban planning before this class.",
    "Not particularly. I still am unsure about what this course's ultimate goal for the students was. Class discussions were largely tangential with readings barely, if at all, discussed. Professor Rubin has interesting material for the course, however, and with a bit more introduction to his own opinions on infrastructure, this course has the makings of being much better in the future. It was taught for the first time this semester I believe; thus, my comments might be outdated even by its next offering. I think if you are interested in the material it is definitely worth shopping.",
    "Its really a political science course that relates to the process of developing infrastructure. It is interesting especially if you find infrastructure interesting.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this seminar. Its focus on the politics behind infrastructure projects is very interesting ... a topic not talked about in other poli sci seminars.",
    "The class was too broad to get much out of. Because of the way the class was structured (everyone taking turns bringing up points in a clockwise fashion around the room), everyone brought up interesting points, but they were never challenged or engaged by the other students in the class.It was interesting to have polisci and architecture kids together (there are rarely opportunities for the two groups to interact), but still, it was difficult for us to find common discussion themes in the class.If it's taught as a more narrow lecture next year, consider it. But shop carefully.",
    "If you can get in, take it. If you're an architecture major, be prepared to stick up for your voice because the polisci peeps tend to have a lot of confidence and slightly larger egos."
