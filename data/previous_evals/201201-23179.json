   "comments": [
    "The class is a good balance of classic American literature (Whitman, Melville etc.) and more recent works (authors like Toni Morrison and Junot Diaz), and emphasizes the connections between the various texts.",
    "Take this class with Prof. Avilez! I have a friend in another section and she has significantly more work. The workload in this class is super manageable. The works we read were really interesting. It is simply a really good class.",
    "Absolutely take this course. It is a great WR credit and it is interesting! The reading list is phenomenal as well.",
    "A nice class for anyone to take. Wasn't particularly difficult, had great readings, would take again",
    "I enjoyed every one of the reading assignments, and discussions were very engaging. This was simply one of the best courses I've ever taken anywhere. Everyone loves Professor Avilez. He is incredibly brilliant and very approachable. You will love him too.",
    "TAKE ENGLISH 127 WITH AVILEZ. Professor Avilez is so fun and each class he'll make you laugh. He also is very good at getting the whole class to really get engaged, making it an awesome experience. Take it with him!!! You won't regret it!",
    "Engl 127 with Prof Avilez was a great course - the readings were interesting and enjoyable and the class discussions were very interesting as prof Avilez gave great insight on both the texts and our work",
    "ABSOLUTELY TAKE WITH GerShun Avilez. Best Seminar prof I've had at Yale. 127 is super chill, very relaxed, easy, and a great introduction to the seminar style classes that are so common in the Humanities departments.",
    "Like I said before, take this class!!!!",
    "I highly recommend this course; in fact, I have attempted to persuade all of my friends to take it at some point along their intellectual journey at Yale. This course, which provides one withan inclusive knowledge of American Literature, strengthens skills essential for essay writing and verbal literary critique. Professor Avilez was refreshing; his discussions were current and scholarly.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course. Not only does the course emphasize improving your writing skills, but it also provides a unique opportunity (under the tutelage of an English professor) to read the work of some of the most renowned American authors.",
    "Definitely take English 127 if you enjoy reading and thinking. In particular, take Avilez's section if you are excited by the thought that not all American literature of merit is by dead white men. There is a lot of reading, but these assignments were the fun ones that I always wanted to do first."
