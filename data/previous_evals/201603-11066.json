   "comments": [
    "I learned so much! My favorite course this term.",
    "What \/didn't\/ I learn from this course? I came in with a very limited background in world history from 9th grade (that I honestly can no longer remember) and left with a great deal of knowledge about multiple different areas of Latin America. I may not have memorized every single detail, but I am the very least informed of many important figures in Latin American history.",
    "This course is a good introduction to Latin American history. It spans a lot of time and jumps both thematically and temporally to cover everything, and some things are ignored because of this. This is not a complete review\/survey, just an introduction. That said, its very entertaining and thought provoking. You learn a lot about some specific cases, but also there are clear patterns over the whole period which Professor Eller does a good job of making clear.",
    "I gained skill in working with primary documents. I also learned a lot about Latin American history in general (before I could have told you almost nothing about any American nation except for the USA). I always had a sense that we were pretty nasty during the Cold War and this gave me a number of solid examples. I also enjoyed contemplating some new ways of thinking about the capabilities of governments and political thought outside of the United States system.",
    "Not only did HIST 325 leave me with a deep understanding of the history of Latin America, it also taught me to appreciate and create digital humanities. Furthermore, it strengthened my capacity to see parallels in multi-decade, multi-region issues and to discuss them meaningfully.",
    "Got some good country-based knowledge of latin america"

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The readings felt quite unbalanced. Some weeks there was almost none and some there was too much. This didn't make it play well with other courses. The readings themselves are almost universally very interesting. I thought dancing with cuba was a little too literary and not historical enough. The lectures are great and the digital humanities project was fun. It can take up a lot of time, some people in the class wrote really long ones. I think you get out as much as you put in.",
    "I learned a ton of information and felt like I was introduced to fairly nuanced historical thinking, but I sometimes felt like I needed an \"intro to latin american history\" that was more of an intro than this: we were often given the major historical events as lighting-fast bullet points and then drawn into tiny details which were fascinating but left me without *that* much understanding of the big sweeps: in studying I leaned a lot on wikipedia and found it incredibly useful for contextualizing the things I had learned, taking time to place events and people on maps and timelines. I think the course could be improved if each regional case study started with a \"big picture\" moment with that sort of map-timeline-grand-narrative space before we dive into details that sometimes move too fast for students trying to get Arbenz and Armas straight.",
    "Clear strengths of HIST 325 are its instructors: Prof. Eller and Ms. Waters. Not only were they enthusiastic about the material, but also more than approachable, resourceful and a pleasure to work with. A further asset of the course is its breath: it covers events from precolonial to contemporary times and almost all Latin American geographies.",
    "I thought professor Ellet was very engaging, but their should be fewer countries covered during the course so the experience is more in depth.",
    "I thought the organization was a bit scattered. Would have liked to understand larger trends in addition to case studies.",
    "Strengths: * Being an overview course, HIST 325 course covers an incredibly important region across a broad time frame (pre-colonialism to early 2000s), thus exposing you to a lot of knowledge over the course of the semester * An intro course that was not easy -- it was not impossible, but you really did need to do the word (read and understand the readings, show up to lecture, etc) * A professor (Anne Eller) who knows and cares A LOT and is really fun and engaging * A digital humanities project where we got to focus on a region of our choice and using primary sources, construct an argument on that region\/across time, all self-curated on our webpage * The option to do that digital humanities project either individually or in a group * At least in the Fall of 2016, the class being really small. So although it was a lecture, there were only about 10-12 of us and Professor Eller led discussion section herself * Having a discussion section led by the professor: it, for once, did not feel like a waste of time, but an opportunity to ask her further questions, to tie the readings into what she had lectured on, and on getting to know her better Weaknesses * The class being organized into case studies. While in some cases it worked (it makes sense to have a week on Populism and focus on Argentina and Pern for example) overall it meant that I feel like I know rather niche things about particular regions, but I cannot, for example, tell you anything about the history of Peru post the early\/mid 1800s, because we never returned to it after that point."

   "comments": [
    "Yes, Anne Eller is an excellent professor and the course covers broad information with lots of specific details. She teaches valuable themes and uncovered a lot of important information.",
    "I think it's a good course to take, as you do learn a lot about Latin American politics and history. There is also a discussion of race formation throughout the Americas and the Caribbean that I think is particularly important. Overall, I think it covers",
    "This was a fun and enlightening course. Definitely worth taking. You will learn a lot, not necessarily all of it connected and organized in an obvious way, but it will be instructive and provides many avenues for further reading.",
    "I would definitely warn another student of the troubles I had in keeping up with Professor Eller's breakneck pace and genius tangents. As stated above, I really needed a wikipedia article and 15 minutes of simple who-what-where-when clarification in any completely-new-to-me area of history, which was almost everything we touched on in the class. However, for people like me in the United States who have lived most of their lives so far barely considering anything South of Texas I think this class or one like it is a necessity. I am very grateful for what I learned with Professor Eller, even though I did feel like a slower pace might have helped me learn more.",
    "If you would like to learn about Latin America, definitely take this class. Do the readings--they are meaningful. Come to class--it is inspiring.",
    "Yes",
    "Yes I would recommend this course"
