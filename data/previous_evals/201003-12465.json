   "comments": [
    "Intro stats -- it is what it is. Lecture notes are comprehensive.",
    "Take this class if you want a QR. Don't fall behind though. If you got to class, and put some effort, it's not too bad. Professor is a cool dude.",
    "It's a good foundational class, but you must be committed to keeping the information in order on your own. Definitely get a book and read it for the first half of the semester. If you have had stats in high school, it seems to be a much easier class, but if you've never had it before, there's a lot of material to keep straight in the beginning.",
    "why not? I would take this class only if JDRS was teaching it.",
    "I would recommend this class to a fellow student who would like a nice overview of statistics and\/or needs a math credit. While this class wasn't that hard, it wasn't easy either.",
    "If you have to take it its fine. Be sure to put in the work, take notes during lecture, and go to your TA with questions. I have heard that there are much easier QRs out there if you are looking for one.",
    "Take the class if you need an easy QR.",
    "Take this course. Really. If you keep on top of the work this course is a breeze and the teacher (JRS) is actually really good.",
    "No, its pretty damn hard, the lectures are long, most often confusing, and its on science hill. Also, the weekly homeworks were always a bitch to complete. I had little to no fun in this class and would not have taken it if I didn't need it for my major. JDRS seems like a great prof and tries really hard all but learning statistics simply is not fun.",
    "It is a not too difficult math class. Can get boring at times but Jonathan does a great job of keeping you awake. Definitely take it with him if you can. If you are able to choose what section, take the social science one with Jonathan as well. You'll be glad you did.",
    "Good class if you need a QR or something. Prof R-S is super engaging and about as good as you're going to get for a math class. Definitely go into his office hours early in the semester if you don't get things because he's very helpful and it sucks if you get behind.",
    "I would recommend this class, even if you aren't a poli sci major. If you are a math person, you should take a different course, but this class gives you a solid understanding in basic stats--which helped me with readings in multiple other courses this semester, as well as newspaper articles, the news, etc--without delving into the complicated math behind the concepts. The class can skim a bit too much over basics, and focus too much on applications of ideas rather than the ideas themselves, but it is still a good class. Problem sets are not too hard, exams are easier.",
    "Loved this class and so glad I took it. The teacher is exciting, the TA's are helpful, and the class is well taught. I would take it again next semester if I could.",
    "The course is a good overview of basic statistics.",
    "STAT 103 was a basic overview of statistics. Take it forthe distributional requirements or if your major requires it - don't take it because it's easy, because it isn't a gut. As far as which section to get into when STAT 10x splits, don't just pick based on what your interests are. From talking to friends in other classes, it seems that the section that stayed with JDRS may have learned the most, but it was also the hardest.",
    "Yes, I would recommend it. I learned a lot in the class.",
    "This is a relatively easy intro course to statistics. You WILL learn the basic concepts if you go to class even a little bit. He is very helpful by posting his powerpoints and including all of the relevant information. If you want a pleasant, nonstressful introduction to statistical concepts, this should be great for you!",
    "fun. not as easy as they say . a lot of material especially in the 103 section ( it is the only one with a cumulative exam). fun lecture and lots of useful info. Take it",
    "Can't think of a better way to do intro to statistics.",
    "It's a typical, big lecture class with a weekly problem set and 3 exams. Fairly straight-forward - neither the material, nor the work was extremely hard, but it was tedious at times. I would recommend this class to anybody who likes numbers - probably not the best class for the humanities people out there, but I still think it's an important class to take. If you do take it, go to lecture (I know there are printed out notes, but the lectures helped me quite a bit) and go to the TAs with your homework. They will help you quite a bit and hint at the answers...",
    "Great class for stats, take it.",
    "nope",
    "Only take it if you have to. Get the textbook and read it--JRS is sort of entertaining but not clear about stuff at all.",
    "Great intro class to stats that isn't too difficult, but there is a lot of regular work to be done in order to keep up with the class. Bad idea to put studying off until the last minute",
    "Stat 100\/103 is one of the few intro QR courses at Yale that is actually well-taught and somewhat enjoyable. JRS manages to be funny and engaging and still teach you a lot about statistics, although you will probably end up learning more by reviewing the notes and doing the problem sets than in lecture itself. Still, JRS makes statistics fairly interesting, and going to lecture is worth it. The problem sets aren't too difficult and you get a few weeks without one. Midterms are quite easy if you study, although the final is more challenging. A good QR - not a complete gut, but probably as easy as you can get if you still want to learn something worth knowing.",
    "A solid introductory course on statistics. Quite dry, but that was to be expected..",
    "I had to take it as an EPE Major, and honestly, although statistics is obviously not the most interesting subject, JRS was funny and tried his best to make it enjoyable, and it is useful in helping you understand political science\/economics readings (or any article or work that uses findings of some research to \"statistically prove\" anything.",
    "It's okay to satisfy a QR requirement. The information is useful and relevant outside the classroom, though be prepared to fall behind if you don't keep up or pay attention in class.",
    "Firstly, take this course with JDRS. Not the Spring Intro Stats. He makes all the difference. Secondly, in choosing what section to go into it is wise to know a couple of things. Clearly, choose according to your major. But also know that JDRS's final is cumulative whereas some (but not all apparently) of the other sections are not. I chose to stay with JDRS because I wanted the continuity - and I appreciate that I made that decision.",
    "Take it if you need it or if you want to know about statistics. There aren't too many other options. It wasn't too challenging, just be prepared to teach yourself a lot of the material.",
    "I am a humanities major with no background in calculus, so this was one of the few non-gut QR's (other than MATH 112\/115) which were available to me. The class was interesting and useful to me, and I would recommend it to anyone else in a similar situation.",
    "If you have to take statistics and STAT 103 meets the requirements (I took it for the psych major), I would definitely recommend taking it (provided that Professor Reuning-Scherer is teaching it). Even if you don't have to take the course, but are interested in statistics and curious to learn about one of the most important analytic tools in the social sciences, I would recommend taking this course.",
    "It's an introduction to statistics. If you're not a \"math person,\" like me, I think it can be difficult week-to-week. The material all came together nicely in time for the final, but with many bad grades along the way and a lot of confusion. It remains to be seen whether the skills will prove useful to me in the \"real world\" but I have found myself thinking about some of the concepts. If you take it and you're struggling with the material, I highly recommend going to JDRS's weekly review session with your questions. Going to those put me over some hump in the learning curve.",
    "A true intro to statistical concepts- the class isn't particularly interesting, but teaches you important statistical concepts that are useful.",
    "Its a good class with the usual math class workload: one problem set a week but they often require a computer program called minitab that is annoying to use, especially if you have a mac because its not compatible but you can install a \"virtual box\" onto your computer or use the computers in the printing cluster.",
    "take it if you need it for a requirement. don't assume it'll be easy though. harsh grading policy. the professor's a great lecturer and go to class to get the most out of it",
    "This is a great course to take if you do not much experience in statistics and would like to gain some. I would recommend this course because the material that we learn is valuable and the professor makes learning fun.",
    "Dooo it. Fun professor in JRS and the material isn't too bad.",
    "Prof. Reuning-Scherer was an amazing instructor and made the course as interesting as it could be. If you have to take this for your major, take it with JDRS.",
    "Yes. JRS is a great teacher, and the class is refreshing for both math weenies and math non-weenies alike.",
    "If you're a poli sci major, don't take it unless you really like stat and are good at it. It's silly to take a QR within your major unless you can be sure that you will do well in it.The class helped me learn about statistical analysis, but it was often frustrating. It moved too quickly, and problem sets were not at all similar to exams. Make sure you get help to understand it. Stay up on course material. Be prepared to teach yourself everything by reading the lectures. If you stop paying attention for even a second, you'll fall behind in lecture.",
    "Take it if you have to. The offer a lot of opportunity for extra help. I took every one of them and still struggled to keep my head above water.",
    "It was a fine class for a QR credit. JRS is pretty funny, even if his jokes are cliches. It just felt kind of unnecessary. We learned to little to apply it in real life, but just a bit more than Wikipedia. Take it if you need it, but it wasn't particularly compelling.",
    "Decent course, but because of the material it is difficult to pay attention and stay interested for the whole semester. Reuning-Scherer is charming and great. I would recommend taking this class with friends - It makes studying\/PSETs\/the whole experience more enjoyable.",
    "This class is hard. There's no official textbook, and I NEVER UNDERSTOOD the material. Minitab, which you have to use to do the hw, is HORRIBLE!",
    "I doubt many people are taking this class for fun. But if you have to take it, it's really not as bad as it could be. Review the relevant lectures for the tests carefully- if you really need to, you can get another book (this class doesn't have a textbook) but you can also do fine without it. Just make sure you GO TO OFFICE HOURS for the homework assignments. They're a big part of your grade and can really really help you out at the end of the semester. Just get good grades on the homework assignments. As for the exams, they are fair and test what you expect to be tested on. Memorize the lectures, review the homework assignments (although these are harder than the midterms), and clarify any questions that you have with a TA.",
    "Yes. I recommend it.",
    "Good intro stats course, learn how to analyze data. Take it with JRS if you can, he's great.",
    "I would recommend this course if you know you like statistics. If you are taking it for the QR, find an easier one.",
    "I recommend this course if you need it as a pre-req. Definitely don't be afraid of taking it, it's not too hard if you take the class seriously. I would definitely recommend getting a textbook and using that to give greater background to the concepts you learned during class and then going back over the slides. JRS is great. He's hilarious and manages to make the very dry material of statistics somewhat interesting.",
    "If you have to take stats, this is the course to take. But that doesn't mean that it's a fun course, it's just less terrible than every other stats course at Yale.",
    "it's not an easy class, focus on homework and go to lecture",
    "Good course",
    "If you need a QR that's not too difficult, go for this one! It's pretty fun; I would HIGHLY recommend taking it with a friend! Lectures are as fun as they can be, which is not that fun. Having a friend will keep you awake\/ keep you up to date with things you miss by dazing off.",
    "This class was kind of a pain, and sort of difficult at times, since I'd never taken any stats before. But while I didn't like actually taking the class, I am glad I know more about statistics now. So overall it was worth it.",
    "I never took stats in high school, so this course was very helpful and manageable. It was a great course, and I found JRS to be very engaging. I would definitely recommend this course to another student.",
    "The class is an intro statistics class during the first six weeks, then splits into different sections for the rest of the course. The social science part of statistics is taught by JRS as well. Statistics is inevitably boring, but JRS tries to make it more entertaining. The class is broad and tries to quickly cover a lot of information. I think that JRS doesn't focus on making sure that the students really understand the concepts because he strives to cover the concepts so quickly. The class is not very difficult though and if you need a QR or need it for a major, I still recommend it.",
    "The course was good, not terribly difficult but required a lot of work. If you pay attention in class you just need to go over the notes, if not you must read the book and pore over the notes. The course bends over backwards to not include explanations that involve calculus although many people in the class know it.",
    "Sure. It's a handy class in that you will be able to interpret papers and studies that use statistics. I expect the work we did in the problem sets will be forgotten a little sooner, because most of it happened in computer programs I didn't understand well. But don't let that intimidate you\u0097it's a manageable class that deals with some important concepts.Also, if you're a social science major, take it!",
    "an intro to statistics with minitab (statistics software)",
    "I hated it because I hate math and was only taking it as a requirement for my major. The subject is uninteresting and the material is difficult. However, JDRS is a great professor who brought a lot of energy to an otherwise painful class. He made it a lot better than it would have been otherwise, because his lectures were entertaining.Still, I wouldn't recommend taking it unless it's a requirement.",
    "Everyone takes it because they have to for a requirement...I wouldn't just take it for fun. You'll gloss over a bunch of topics, getting some idea for stat but not really feeling like you have solid mathematical understandings, even if you do everything right. Also make sure you go to TAs for office hours, because the homework answer keys ask for subtleties that the homework questions don't ask about specifically. And get ready for irrelevant stories and bizarre analogies in class - try not to space out because it's hard to realize when he's teaching again and you need to start paying attention. Overall it's not to hard though, once you get used to the class format.",
    "This is a good class with apparent value to political science majors, especially those in need of a QR. Though the class wasn't always engaging (more the fault of the subject than the professor), it shouldn't be overly difficult for those who take the time to review the lectures a little."
