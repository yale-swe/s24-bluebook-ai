   "comments": [
    "The most important thing about this class is you learn how to write lab reports well, which is integral for later classes and potentially moving out into the field of engineering later in life.",
    "I got to see some cool lab techniques",
    "i learned how to work with over-eager sophomores who haven't stopped caring yet",
    "Basic application of material science in a laboratory setting with an experienced scientist and his staff",
    "Conducting experiments on materials to explore their properties and reasons leading to the properties. The class definitely solidified my understandings for 285, and being able to see the experiments and treatments happening was exciting to begin with. Professor Schroers also tried hard to enhance our skills of scientific communication (writing and presenting), providing very personalized advice and helpful guidance.",
    "We learned about the strengths of materials, mostly metals, and how the microstructures of those materials affected their macroscopic properties.",
    "This class really harped on how to write an interesting and complete scientific report. Technical writing is a very niche skill that can always be improved by engineers.",
    "I learned how to write a polished and professional lab report that will be very helpful in future professions. I also learned how to give a very detailed technical presentation.",
    "This lab not only taught material related to material science in a laboratory setting, but also taught useful skills relating to scientific writing and presentation. The material for each lab was introductory and fairly basic, but also gave the students a taste of present-day research.",
    "I learned how to write engineering or perhaps moreso materials science reports for experiments and all associated skills that go with that. Towards the end I also developed my skills in creating presentations and giving presentations.",
    "I learned how to apply the theory that I learned in the MENG 285 to the actual testing methods. MENG 285 made me love Materials, and this class only increased that.",
    "This course primarily taught me about scientific writing. The lab TAs provided ample guidance in the lab setting (available to answer questions about experimental methodology) while Professor Schroers gave students detailed feedback about their lab reports in order to refine their writing craft to meet a paper-worthy standard. An excellent class to learn how to communicate clearly, concisely, succinctly, and effectively in scientific reports.",
    "I continued to develop my understanding of materials science with a reiteration of material in lecture form and practical applications in the lab. I now understand the process of creating an alloy, how scanning and transmission electron microscopes work, and material testing and processing."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The class was very informative and the labs were pretty coo. However, you don't know your grade because the professor doesn't give you grades for the lab reports that he hands back.",
    "The labs are long and vaguely interesting (not the most riveting of labs), but I appreciate that they help you improve your skills for writing lab outlines and lab reports, which will be helpful in the future. The lectures are kind of dry, but I appreciate that he doesn't make us go to class when there isn't anything to be learned. The one issue with labs is timing (they're long and in the middle of the day), so you have to make sure you have at least one day where you have the afternoon free for the lab.",
    "This course is low engagement until you have to write incredibly long lab reports. Some of the data analysis gets nasty.",
    "the TAs are great - jan is great - lab section is pretty useless - most things could easily just be demonstrated via videos - every other lab asks students to test something, to learn something, to calculate something - making brass seems pretty dumb. (lab 3 was an exception, but labs 4 and 5 were blatantly useless) the lab reports were dramatically longer than necessary because we were filling pages with backstory and the 5000-year history of brass rather than testing any mechanical properties.",
    "Great, no real improvements.",
    "Strengths: great exploration into the techniques and trivia of material science experiments, great feedback and assistance, modest workload, and fun people to work with (Jan and the TAs). Weaknesses: maybe the lectures could be a little more engaging and less wordy? More interactive components in class?",
    "This class was easily my favorite lab so far, everything was very well explained and the activities made sense and actually demonstrated what they were supposed to demonstrate. The only weakness I would say is that the microscope stuff at the end, while perhaps obligatory, was a little bit harder to grasp and didn't end up yielding results in the way that the other labs did, so it wasn't as satisfying of an experience not having a punch line.",
    "Professor Schroers focused on improving how we write and think about our laboratory, providing much feedback from an intellectual standpoint. Unfortunately I cannot say the same grade wise as I have still at this point have no idea what my grade will be like.",
    "I thought this class was very helpful in terms of real world application.",
    "This class was pretty well designed, in terms of the topics covered and the amount expected from the students. However, the organization was somewhat lacking, as the syllabus and calendar were out-of-date and confusing. This should be a quick fix. The labs were informative and educational, but the lectures, I found to be repetitive from MENG 285 (the lecture class about material science) and relatively unnecessary. Classes involving writing and presentation were more useful.",
    "Knowledge acquired is very helpful. Would like to know how academic performance is going throughout semester.",
    "This class is awesome! I think I would have liked more time in the lab OR perhaps less classes about course material like dislocations and more instruction\/feedback on the writing of lab reports.",
    "I liked that this class allowed us to actually do the tests we had learned about in the lecture course. It made it compelling. I also liked that we got a lot of teaching and feedback on how to write lab reports and give presentations.",
    "I loved this course- each lab outline that we completed (the bare-bones outline of future paper-type write-up of each of the five experiments) was returned to us within a week with comments for improvement. I wish that we met with Professor Schroers in our lab groups before the end of the semester to hear more about our progress.",
    "This course was excellent in putting into context the theories about materials science developed in lecture. I wish that we could have covered more in lecture (or gone more into detail) as a few of the lectures were a bit slow after having learned much of the material in a previous course (MENG 285)."

   "comments": [
    "This class is definitely a great 5th class to take because it is relatively low workload. It is a lecture\/lab where you don't have lecture the weeks you have lab (5 labs total), and after the labs are over, you don't have class for ~2 weeks until the presentations begin. Because there is so little work, it's easy to wait to do your lab until last minute. My one problem with this class is that while he gives comments on your lab reports and outlines, he does not give you grades with each one, so you have 0 idea where you stand in the class (even as I write this I have no idea). I would say if you'd like an extra half credit, this is a good class to take. (as a bonus, it's only .5 credits but counts as a full credit towards he mech e major)",
    "It is basically a 1-credit course due to the lab reports. Be aware of that. But if you have taken materials science already it isn't too bad for the learning curve. It's a survey course for materials science and is actually pretty interesting. Take it to fill out a schedule with 2 or three other hard courses, but be prepared to sacrifice a few Friday nights on the lab reports.",
    "ya gotta take it. its fine. make sure your group is responsible.",
    "Take it with Jan if possible. I wish he taught my 285. He explains the content very clearly and clarifies best practices with hilarious examples\/ analogies. He is also a very agreeable person to talk to. His TAs worked as a wonderful team to make the labs fun and engaging.",
    "Even though it's only half a credit, everyone should take this class. I learned more in three lectures than I did in all of MENG 285 and I got to break stuff in this class. It's definitely useful to know the stuff you learn in this lab and the activities are fun and it's not a whole lot of work.",
    "I would not recommend this class to another student unless they are a mechanical engineering major and have to take the class anyway. It is a very interesting but niche class so unless you have true interest in mechanical engineering I would suggest a different class.",
    "I would recommend this course to any student who will need to write technical documents in their profession.",
    "This class is worth taking if you took MENG 285 and want to see how that knowledge is used in a lab setting. Pretty fun and not too much commitment!",
    "I really like material science and this class gives you a tremendous opportunity to see what materials science research looks like as well as some information on advanced materials. If that sounds at all interesting then you will probably like this class so long as you are curious and take the initiative yourself; the material is not force fed to you like some other classes and that's really nice. I took the ME285 before this class and it I would recommend doing the sequence in that order however it is not necessary in the slightest. Just don't get too hung up on any of the details.",
    "I liked being able to actually do the tests and procedures we learned about in MENG 285. This class really complements that class.",
    "Yes- if you want to improve your scientific writing, this is the class for you! We only brushed the surface of the materials science curriculum, but the theoretical continuity\/interconnectedness of our five labs helped to refine materials science concepts while the act of writing outlines\/lab reports for the course proved to be a constructive exercise in writing papers. By far, this is the best lab course I've taken at Yale to date.",
    "I think this course is a strong addition to MENG 285 (Materials Science) where the course material is solidified with practical examples with clear ties to current engineering research. I also appreciated that we reproduced the information we covered in written and oral form. I highly recommend this course to any mechanical engineering major."
