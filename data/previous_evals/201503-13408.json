    "Good survey course, too much reliance on reading straight from PowerPoint",
    "I really like it. I wish there would have been more concrete nutrition concepts taught for those of us who didn't have nutrition background. I also though the lecture slides contained a few too many studies.",
    "The course was good in that I learned a lot about how nutrition relates to chronic disease, but could have been taught a different way.",
    "I thought the course was a little awkwardly sectioned off and could have used for multimedia to make the lectures more interesting. overall, I think it was a great class that showed the connection of diet with chronic disease.",
    "Strengths: really interesting material; very important no matter what your interest in CDE is specifically- all topics are touched on Weaknesses: The two hour lecture format can be a little long",
    "I enjoyed learning about the many different studies and associations between chronic disease and food. I appreciated the break in Monday lectures to break up and long lecture, but it was nevertheless difficult to focus for the whole period of time. I felt that three lectures on food and cancer may have been rather excessive, although I do understand that this is the instructor's area of expertise. I would have liked the course to have had more of a policy focus. It felt like we learned a lot about specific studies and their null findings, when it would have been nice to think about ways to improve nutrition from this policy standpoint. I liked doing a the homeworks in general, it was good to be forced to do certain readings. What was frustrating was some of the questions were too broad or felt redundant.",
    "I really enjoyed this class and the material that I learned.",
    "Great class! Recommended for any CDE majors! The material and instructor are the course's greatest strengths. THe homeworks can be a little bit like busy work.",
    "I really enjoyed the class and learned a lot. The class was pretty long and dragged at times but the professor gave us a 5 minute break half way through which was needed. She incorporated exercises during class which required us to work with classmates and they were a nice break from the general lecture style.",
    "I think that this is a great course, but nutrition is so important, and an underlooked aspect of health. Everyone really should take this class to be a more educated human being.",
    "The diversity of topics covered, amount of content, and organization of this course were all very well done.",
    "I enjoyed the class and feel like I learned a lot. I especially liked the classes where there was a lot of discussion."

    "Instructor: Leah McArthur Ferrucci \u00a0Very accessible and wants her students to succeed",
    "Instructor: Leah McArthur Ferrucci \u00a0She was great!",
    "Instructor: Leah McArthur Ferrucci \u00a0Dr. Ferrucci is very nice, but teaching style could be changed so that she's not just reading off the powerpoints.",
    "Instructor: Leah McArthur Ferrucci \u00a0Leah was great! She was very helpful, knew her stuff, and was a helpful Professor.",
    "Instructor: Leah McArthur Ferrucci \u00a0Amazing!! I was worried at first because Susan Mayne had always taught this class. Leah was fantastic. So interested in our learning, stays up to date, and changed the course format to be more interactive",
    "Instructor: Leah McArthur Ferrucci \u00a0Very prepared for class, good powerpoints, some of the figures could have been more visually more concise. Could have been less tonally monotonous at times. I would have liked to have seen more engaging in class\/lecture activities than using our laptops to look for articles on pubmed. The better activities we did were examining websites like the Global Energy Balance.",
    "Instructor: Leah McArthur Ferrucci \u00a0Dr. Ferrucci was a great professor and lecturer. I learned a lot in her class.",
    "Instructor: Leah McArthur Ferrucci \u00a0Great instructor and very knowledgeable. Gives fair and constructive feedback.",
    "Instructor: Leah McArthur Ferrucci \u00a0This was her first time teaching the class and I think she did a fairly good job. Although she often read off the slides, she had a strong handle on the material and really worked to make the class fairly engaging.",
    "Instructor: Leah McArthur Ferrucci \u00a0Prof. Ferrucci is great. She knows a lot, the lectures are well prepared, and she really cares for the class and the material. I sometimes wish the class went beyond just facts and the research to talk more about the politics behind why progress has been so slow. We did that at the end, but I hoped for more.",
    "Instructor: Leah McArthur Ferrucci \u00a0Excellent lectures-- a good amount of information included on slides, clarity on which parts of the content were most important to focus on, and well-selected studies to represent each teaching point. Also a good balance of interactive exercises and lecture time-- especially toward the end of the course, after student feedback.",
    "Instructor: Leah McArthur Ferrucci \u00a0She presented the material very clearly, the slides are very helpful!"

    "I would recommend this course if you want to understand the relationship and research conducted on nutrition and chronic disease",
    "Recommended to all CDE students or anyone who wants to understand the importance of nutrition in disease",
    "I would recommend the course to a fellow student interested in this topic. Takes a largely evidence based approach to nutrition and disease and covers a number of different relevant topics. Interesting associations are discussed and coursework often thought provoking.",
    "I would recommend this class to another student.",
    "Great class! Will learn a ton about nutrition and epidemiological research.",
    "If you're interested in the topic you will learn a ton!",
    "I do recommend this. It's great information, and it's well-taught.",
    "A great overview of nutrition research methods, nutrition policy, and what is currently suggested or inconclusive in the current research. Probably good to take at least one semester of Epidemiology before taking this course, in order to easily understand some of the studies and figures used in lectures and homework.",
    "It presents the current state of nutritional research in regards to major chronic diseases."
