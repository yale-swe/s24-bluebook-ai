    "You get to read a book called the Golden Ass about weird witches and people turning into donkeys in the best dead language, where could you go wrong?",
    "Well worth your time -- a good way to satisfy language requirements.",
    "i would definitely recommend Latin 131. It is a good change of pace from L1 and L2 latin and translating is much more enjoyable. The reading is interesting, and although there is a lot of it, it's not overwhelming. Overall, this is a really good course.",
    "For those of you who began in L1, this is the final step for you, so you should take the class regardless of what anyone else says.The class is not difficult, but if you want to do well it will take time and effort if you started Latin in L1, because those who started Latin at Yale do not have an adequate vocabulary to read at the class's pace (Apuleius, although funny and fun to read if you knew the vocab, is difficult to read because the vocab is drastically different from what you have studied before). This will cause frustration and headache, but you will pull through it just like you did in L2. This is essentially L2 repeated over again.",
    "I definitely recommend this class, even if you don't need it to fulfill a language requirement. The reading is fun and frequently hilarious, and it's not very difficult to keep up with.",
    "Apuleus is amazing- you must take this class!"
