   "comments": [
    "Yes, you will learn a lot and gain greater appreciation for music.",
    "If you've played music for a while but haven't learned much theory and want to start, this is probably the right class for you. The class covers a lot more than is tested in the placement exam to get into Music 210, so if you don't know voice leading, the harmonic functions of chords, and basic counterpoint, it is definitely worth it to take this class before moving onto Music 210.If you took Music Theory AP in high school, you're probably better off in Music 210\/211.",
    "Yes, if you're interested in music theory\/want to learn more about music in the tonal tradition. Beware of twice a week homework assignments though; they start off easy and then get hard pretty quickly and take up a good amount of time each week. The nice thing though, is that homework counts for 60% of your grade so if you've been doing well on the homework, there's less pressure when it comes to exam time.",
    "Took this because it was required for lessons for credit. Pretty harmless course overall, but homework counts for a lot so you can't blow it off. Starts with a lot of review of pretty basic stuff (scales, intervals), but is more interesting once it actually gets out of review.",
    "Designed for people who can read music but who don't have much theory background otherwise, this course is well organized and well taught. I'd definitely recommend it if you're looking to further your understanding or appreciation of music.",
    "If you want to learn music theory, this is a great class. While it stresses theory applied to classical music, I feel that I can take some of what I learned and apply it to my own music.",
    "good composition class. the description says you will do fine if you play an instrument, but if that instrument is anything other than piano, that description is probably a stretch.",
    "This course is a great music theory course if you know the basics and want to learn more about the foundations of music theory--counterpoint, four part harmony writing, chorale style, etc. There's an ear training component and a lot of harmony analysis. I really enjoyed this course. Kara is a really great instructor--really kind and helpful, explains things really well, keeps the class interesting.",
    "This class quickly reviews the rudiments that you learn in 110, or that you may know from study of your instrument, then moves on to writing a simple melody, writing counterpoint to that melody, and finally writing and dictating in chorale-style four-part harmony. There is also study of simple musical structures and form in tonal music. It's an interesting class, and a great stepping stone to more advanced studies in composition."
