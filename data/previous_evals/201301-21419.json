    "I would definitely recommend this class to anyone interested in clinical psychology, but it was actually very helpful to keep this course restricted to those of us for whom it is required for our studies.",

   "comments": [
    "Without this course I would feel thoroughly unprepared to administer psychotherapy. We all still have a lot to learn, but this was a very useful introduction. Our program of study includes both clinical practice and research, but more of our time is spent learning about the latter. The instructor for this course helped us remember that seeing patients is a huge responsibility and that, even though our program is more oriented toward research, we cannot go in blind or unprepared to therapy.",
    "I think that the increased knowledge fit in well with our increased clinical work this semester and exposed us to a broad array of treatment interventions in a relatively short amount of time."
