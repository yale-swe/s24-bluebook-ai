    "This is a really, really great course. Madame Vysosias teaches the material very well, and the organization of the class really emerges you in the language. You learn so much in one semester. The work load is a lot, but it is well worth it in the end. It's really the only way to pick up a language like this.",
    "Difficult. The tests were very hard week in and week out!",
    "It is an intense course for someone who does not have a previous experience with the language but it is very effective. In my case I can say that now I can understand it very well when I read it."
