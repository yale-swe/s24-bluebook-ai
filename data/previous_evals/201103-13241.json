    "It's really different from most other courses at YSPH. I wish there had been a more international focus. I also wish, instead of so much emphasis on the specifics of logistics and planning, etc. we had more case studies. I loved hearing Joanne's stories about disaster situations she had to deal with, and those real-life examples would have been fun to learn about.",
    "Ok",
    "Strengths: Provided good foundation with the FEMA coursesWeakness: Could use more table top exercises to apply learned information.",
    "Great introduction. Unique experience with simulations and decision-developing games.",
    "Strengths- real world applicability. Opportunity to work with well-informed and experienced people.Weaknesses- Any assignments that didn't require us to apply knowledge (e.g. getting certificates w\/o doing much with that information)",
    "More structured lectures, less guest lectures (or more structured ones), more critical analysis (not just memorization of facts), and better readings (analysis of policies and practices, not just the policies and manuals themselves)",
    "Strengths: great instructors (open, supportive, with an excellent breadth of experience and knowledge), tabletop exercises and the VMOC were excellent ways to apply what we learned, FEMA certifications"

    "Instructor: Sandy Bogucki \u00a0Instructors were both great; I would have liked to hear more directly from each. They were better than most of the guest speakers. I also would have like if they facilitated more critical discussion.",
    "Instructor: Sandy Bogucki \u00a0Sandy was an excellent professor. Her input\/advice\/insight during tabletop exercises and lectures were so helpful. I definitely learned a lot from Sandy and from Joanne as well. Both were so open and accommodating of our interests and requests. I really appreciated both instructors and learned a lot about the practical side of emergency planning from listening to their insights, personal experiences and perspectives."

    "A great intro into what it takes to prepare and manage emergency situations. I would recommend it for those with a strong interest in pursuing a career in this field, but it doesn't apply as much to other areas of public health.",
    "Ok",
    "Great course for introduction to disasters and planning. Course load appropriate.",
    "Totally different aspect of Public Health and Health Care in general. Would recommend to people involved in global health, international relationship and Health Care planning. Brings whole new perspective to the field.",
    "\"How to plan for and\/or during an emergency event\"Yes.",
    "I would strongly recommend this course for a fellow student. This course is very in interactive, all the course content is explored deeply and consistently, the instructors are great and it really opens up a new perspective of public health preparedness.",
    "I would highly recommend this class. Basically, we begin with doing FEMA certifications and basic lectures. The class gets especially exciting and practical as we do tabletop exercises\/scenarios and the virtual medical operations center (for our class it was for the Thailand flooding). One will walk away learning a lot about how emergencies are planned for and managed on the ground. Excellent course!!"
