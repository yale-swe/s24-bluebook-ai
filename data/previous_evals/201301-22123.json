    "A fairly horrible experience with Professor Qian. Econ classes like this are supposed to be hard, I get it, but this one was gratuitously painful. It really seemed like Nancy put minimal effort into teaching this class: slides were not her own and she read verbatim off them, almost every problem set had serious typos in them that TAs had to send out last minute fixes to, midterm had a set of ridiculous, irrelevant, riddle-like \"challenge\" questions that were worth a large percentage of the overall score. Never before have I taken a class that a TA recommended actually not attending because what the professor said was more confusing than just learning it from a book on your own.All that being said, the regression project was a pretty good exercise in learning how to use STATA, and from what I heard, was much less outrageously difficult than the assignment from the fall class.",
    "So you are an Econ major, I presume? Well, then you are taking Econ 131. It's a big lecture...probably in Davies...but it is not a painful part of the Econ core. If you like stats and\/or have some background, you will find it intuitive. The midterm is difficult.",
    "it is a fundamental course and it is very useful for Econ majors",
    "If you aren't an econ major, take a real stats\/probability class. Otherwise, swallow the sweet gummy bear.",
    "Econ 131 seems to have a poor track record as far as teachers go. If you are considering taking it, it is probably because you need it for the econ major, and you have no choice. If you don't need to take it, I would recommend avoiding it.",
    "Very easy class. If you know basic probabilities you will ace the first midterm. The final is on regressions which are also very easy. Do not worry about this class.",
    "WOW what a weird class. Nancy is crazy and the midterm was essentially brain teasers, but then the final was normal. The regression project is annoying but mildly informative. Lectures are useless and I really don't think I learned anything.",
    "If you have any background in statistics\/probability or if you're just decent at math, this class will be a complete waste of your time. There is a lot of rehashing of very simple probability concepts. The final Stata project was poorly written with lots of mistakes and confusing questions that the TAs didn't even understand.",
    "Have to take it so... take it dude.",
    "Don't ever take this class unless you have to. If you have to, don't take it with her.",
    "It's pretty basic stats and probability tied to Econ stuff. The biggest distinction is the courses emphasis on regressions.You will learn to use STATA (if only by necessity).",
    "Ehhh",
    "It's required; you have to take it.",
    "I would recommend this class if you need to take a statistics course for your major. Make sure that you take the time to learn STATA while in the course. You don't get much background on it in class, but it is a super useful program.",
    "I would recommend this class because the things you will learn are interesting and applicable to real life problems.",
    "Solid intro to econometrics",
    "Very necessary course for social science research!",
    "Basically AP Statistics with some new information the last three weeks.",
    "I think Professor Qian teaches this course very well. If you are thinking about taking metrics, it might be worth it to wait and take it with Professor Qian. It's not too much work and can actually be interesting, especially since the methods you learn are applicable in many fields.",
    "Pretty basic intro econometrics class - do the problem sets, study for the final. Midterm kind of out of left field, final super straightforward. Not good but not bad.",
    "Nancy was not an effective teacher. She'd often confuse herself, with the catchphrase \"Words are just so confusing!\". This class was the exact same as AP Stats that I took in high school, except I understood the material better in high school. Also, the fact that we are expected to learn Stata entirely by ourselves for the regression assignment is sort of ridiculous. Take it if you have to, but know that it is not well taught at all.",
    "If you are an Econ major and have to take it, either take it with another professor or with a group of friends.",
    "terrible class",
    "You won't be taking it unless you have to, so you might as well. Not too difficult overall.",
    "Nancy was incredibly nice and approachable. On the first day she wanted everyone to introduce themselves. Although everyone groaned and left, she did try to learn everyone's name throughout the semester, which is a very nice thing compared to all the impersonal lectures that depend 100% on your TA's that are common at Yale. That said, it was difficult to learn the material and the midterm was nuts. Most years it has been much easier than the final, but that surely changed. There were no practice exams available and we had no idea what to expect. Nobody really finished, and the questions were tough. The final was better, and Nancy offered extra credit at times. Who knows what it counts for, but still it was there. Six p-sets, a project, midterm, final. Core econ, so you have to take it anyway.",
    "It's a good way to fulfill the Econometrics requirement.",
    "Not really. I would say only take it if you absolutely have to. I didn't enjoy it, especially having no background in stats, I felt at a disadvantage for the first half of the course.",
    "Prof. Qian is clearly intelligent and cares about students and helping them understand the material, and for that, I was grateful. This was her first time teaching the class, and with more experience, improvements will likely be made in going through the lectures\/class material more quickly and efficiently (it was rather slow at times this term). Exams were VERY fair and not simply repetition of p-sets - more conceptual and designed to make sure you actual were able to articulate the core material in words and solution design. P-sets were time-consuming, but actually enjoyable since you felt accomplished when you solved them correctly. The regression assignment at the end was very time-consuming, and in the future, hopefully they will do a better job teaching students STATA. Overall, I found this class better than theother econometrics classes I've shopped in the past. I definitely recommend Prof. Qian.",
    "Take it only if required for the econ major. Horrendous.",
    "Good approach less emphasis on math and proofs.",
    "I do not at all recommend this class. I strongly, strongly advise against it. This class was the worst one I have taken at Yale, by far. Not only were lectures poorly handled in that Nancy struggled with words and often said incorrect\/misleading\/confusing things, as pointed out later by the TFs, but she also never posted lecture slides online before class, then proceeded to fly through them in lecture, leaving everyone frustrated and unable to keep up. Lecture was completely not worth going to. If you have to take it, that sucks. If you don't, DON'T. No strengths, besides maybe that the TFs at least knew what they were talking about and were helpful. Weaknesses: everything else.",
    "Take the class if it's necessary for your major.",
    "Obviously only take it if you're an Econ major. And even then, I would really recommend not taking it with Nancy. I got close to nothing out of the class. Nobody showed up to lectures because they were tedious and boring, and the midterm was written with bad questions and lots of mistakes. Not a good class.",
    "Definitely don't take this class unless you have to. If you have to take it, it's not that tough if you go to section and do some of the reading; the lectures will put you to sleep and won't help you with the problem sets.",
    "Econ 131 is a required class that is kind of boring but not as bad as people make it seem. Read the book and pay attention in class. It won't be hard if you put time into it. Don't wait till the last minute to study. Nancy Qian is a good teacher and Lauren Hoedeman is the best TA at Yale.",
    "Definitely. Econometrics and statistics in general is so important for the social sciences. I also liked how Professor Qian brought us from the realm of pure math to the realm of trying to model human behavior, where there aren't mathematical truths, but we try to apply mathematical methods to aid us in research.",
    "No.",
    "Do not take Econometrics unless you absolutely have to (or really love statistics). The presentation in class is very confusing, and the exams and problem sets are hard. Professor Qian, though very charismatic and probably very good in a specified seminar, was probably not the best choice for an introductory Econometrics lecture class.",
    "The skills from this class are really important if you're an econ major.",
    "It is a requirement for the major and is such is an inevitable part of the curriculum. However the course does provide a basic overview of econometric techniques that may serve useful in any form of statistical analysis. However, if you aren't an econ major, a data analysis class may be more useful",
    "It was by no means a mindblowing class, but the material presented is very useful. In general I feel frustrated by the low quality of teaching in core Econ classes, which is really disappointing. Especially in Econometrics, which is moremath\/statistics-based, I feel like a more Math-120-like setup, with smaller classes led by TA's, would be more effectively taught than in a lecture setting. This class wasn't terrible though, and I felt like the material and psets were way more manageable and way easier than the likes of Intermediate Micro or Game Theory. So you have to take this if you're an Econ major, but it's not terrible.",
    "Econometrics 131 is a pretty good class if you are interested in learning about statistics and specifically how to use stata. Take it if you major in econ, and it might be useful if you major in a social science... but otherwise I would not take it.",
    "Basic econometrics, pretty accessible with Professor Qian but make sure you know people in the class and go to section.",
    "Considering that people say this class was surprisingly easy in previous years, this year's taught by Professor Qian was surely harder. There are more applied concepts that I heard only appear in ECON 132 or 136. But you do get a lot of them, and it's especially nice now that you could somehow read easy econometrics papers with what you've learned. I personally feel this class made me interested in the subject and I want to take 132 or 136 now. Problem sets are okay,midterm was not easy and final was medium. Make sure you go to TAs if you have any questions: they are all very helpful.",
    "Yes, but don't expect it to be a gut. ECON131 is different from previous semesters with Nancy Qian. Not a force to be reckoned with - go to lecture, do the psets seriously, actually go to section, study hard for the exams, etc. Many people started the semester thinking otherwise and ended up dropping it after the midterm. It can be a great course, and you can learn a lot if you do this right.",
    "Absolutely the way to go for a econometrics class\/ statistics class. Overviews the useful material of basic statistics, but allows for a much easier swallow with lots of real life applications.",
    "Its not a difficult class, but Nancy is not the best Professor. It wasn't well-organized, we had random tests throughout the class, and the problem sets were uselessly long. Take it in the fall rather than the spring. I've heard that's much better.",
    "This class sucks. Seriously. Only take it if it's required.She made the midterm really really really hard so all the cr\/d kids mostly kept it cr\/d, and then made the final a 100000% joke. Not sure how I feel about that, but that's probably something you should know.",
    "Sure. It's not a tough class and you learn enough statics and probability to realize how poorly done most studies broadcasted on news networks are.",
    "No, don't take it.",
    "if you have to take it.. take it.. obviously"
