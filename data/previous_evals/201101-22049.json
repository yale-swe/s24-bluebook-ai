   "comments": [
    "Definitely recommend it 100%",
    "Yes! Prof. Lee is amazing and you will learn enough Korean to carry a decent conversation!",
    "I would absolutely reccommend Korean to another student. You get to learn not only the language, but the food, the culture, and the Korean-American experience in the class. I was really interested in how Korean popular culture has spread throughout Asia and even into the States. However, I'm really disappointed that the East Asian Studies major doesn't allow for a concentration in Korea, because it would have been something I wanted to do.",
    "Yes! However, you need to be prepared to study it for the whole year in order to get the most of out it- also, a strong interest in Korean culture and language would be helpful.",
    "YES! It's fun - take it if you have a desire to learn Korean!",
    "Awesome class. A hidden gem that I would highly recommend for students to learn and interact in Korean.",
    "Korean 120 is a continuation of Korean 110, so unless you don't want to get the credit from the first term, you'll have to take this one. Otherwise, perhaps you'll be placed in this level on your exam. Lee ssnm is perhaps one of the kindest professors I've had, and she's very willing to help students if they are having particular troubles or want to go beyond the course requirements a bit. Our class got together once to cook Korean food as well with Lee ssnm and our TAs. The workload is a bit more this semester, though nothing too crazy.",
    "If you want to learn Korean in a friendly, chill environment, YES. That doesn't mean there isn't time-consuming work once in a while, but overall, not too overwhelming.Vocabulary and grammatical structures are not drilled into your head as intensely as, say, the beginners' Chinese class at Yale, so your mastery is even more dependent how much time you decide to put into it, but you do learn quite a variety of grammatical structures that is pretty useful.The best part of the class is probably Professor Lee-Smith. She's enthusiastic, funny and motherly, and makes this class so enjoyable that I actually looked forward to it every morning.",
    "Yes, if you want to learn Korean, I think this is great. Of course, as all Yale courses, you are being graded so expect some work.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this class to another student because I learned a lot and it was a lot of fun.",
    "I whole-heartedly recommend Korean 120; if you started with Korean 110, it is definitely worth it to continue! Professor Lee-Smith is the best, and this was honestly my favorite course of the semester. The pace of the class is definitely manageable, and the TA sessions can be really helpful.",
    "I would definitely recommend Korean to anyone interested in Korean culture and to anyone interested in languages in general. I personally believe that people learn a lot about other cultures most when they learn other cultures languages."
