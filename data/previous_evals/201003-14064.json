    "Be forewarned that this course has a heavy workload. There is an assigned novel along with a 2 page reading response due each week. There is also a final exam and a 15-20 page paper due at the end of the course. That said, I would definitely recommend the course for anyone who has even the slightest interest in the Caribbean! As the title suggests, it provides great insight into the lives of Caribbean people. The readings were very interesting and the discussions were always very lively and invigorating. There was also an opportunity to taste authentic Caribbean food during the course. Overall, it was a very enjoyable experience!",
    "I don't think I would recommend it based on how much work it was and how me (and my friends) felt like I was torturing myself.",
    "A difficult but extremely rewarding class to take. The material is fascinating. The books we read are great. Don't be scared off in the beginning. This class is great.",
    "This course is a good survey course on post-colonialism in the Caribbean and the socio-economic conditions of the different islands. I would recommend it to someone seeking a broad base of knowledge about West Indian life."
