    "In this class, I learned about morally relevant factors and different moral frameworks. My ability to write clearly and persuasively increased. I also developed and improved my argumentation style.",

    "I learned some main concepts in ethics, I learned a lot about how to spell out and defend an argument, and to make clear my thoughts.",
    "A strong foundation in the field of normative ethics and the (wide) range of theories adopted and advocated by contemporary moral philosophers; a new approach to academic writing that focuses on making strong, clear arguments while also examining (and responding to) as many possible counterarguments.",

   "comments": [
    "Textbook and discussion were excellented. There were really no weaknesses to this class, except that the graduate students would (on rare occasions) over complicate discussions or condescend certain undergrads.",
    "I thought this was a good class as it was structured. I thought class discussions could be a little messy, when everyone wanted to talk at once, and philosophy\/epe majors tend to be on the more talkative side. I'm not sure I agree with the method of just interjecting.",
    "Strengths: - Great course material - Great professor - Lively enough seminar discussions - A good pacing of writing assignments Weaknesses: - Sometimes I felt the quality of seminar contributions lacked a little bit; one problem, for example, being when people wouldn't quite respond to what people before them had said---perhaps they didn't quite understand what had been said. Somehow I wish Shelly would call people out for doing this a little more, earlier on in the class, so that seminar discussions would be a little more focused and cohesive. Having since read a bit of Shelly's work on Normative Ethics, I feel our class discussions were simply on a different level (i.e. much much worse) in terms of sophistication. I get that we shouldn't expect so much from a mainly undergraduate seminar, but I wish Shelly (and of course we ourselves) had pushed us harder in that regard (as he certainly did in response to papers).",
    "The strengths of this course were twofold. First, the seminar itself was one of the most highly engaging and challenging academic settings I have experienced at Yale - every week I knew I needed to come extremely prepared and ready to jump in. Second, this class (with Shelly's extreme dedication) helped me to become a much stronger writer, and forced me to think deeply about my own positions and to find ways to articulate them clearly. If there was a weakness of the course, it would be that the seminar discussion - at times - was a bit too student-directed (no hand-raising), such that those who spoke more frequently (and those willing to interrupt) were able to set the course of the conversation. Shelly, however, was good about being willing to cut certain conversations off and transition to different topics.",
    "The seminar. I found the nature of the seminar discussions to be frustrating. The discussion were intense arguments along certain parameters with people jumping in and interrupting each other. It is an engaging mode and many people were involved in the discussions. Comments rarely were constructive. People often jumped in just to hear themselves speak. It rarely felt like the seminar was collaborating to arrive at better answers to the question at hand. Sometimes, Prof. Kagan would intervene to help us collaborate on a difficult issue. The best example was when he drew a diagram of a moral dilemma and allowed the seminar to put our heads together to grasp the full thrust of the challenge. Unfortunately, that experience was an exception, not the rule. I believe that Prof. Kagans stylistic choices influence the gender makeup of the class: by the end of shopping period, there were only two undergraduate women left in the entire seminar. I saw the interruptive model favor men who often had few little to say and embolden them to lob a counterargument against someone elses point. The gender (and racial) disparity in philosophy classes is a problem that extends beyond Kagans class, so it would be wrong to place too much blame on him. At the same time, the makeup of an individual class does not change incrementally it changes all at once, when the appropriate stylistic changes have been made. Normative ethics could easily be a class with a 50\/50 breakdown of men\/women within two years, if appropriate changes were made. I think such an expectation is entirely reasonable, and Prof. Kagan should try his best to make that happen. Part of that will mean rethinking the competitive vibe that was ushered in from the very first seminar: the performative decision-making about who is in and who is out. It continued throughout the seminar. Too often, it did not favor robust thinking but instead favored a certain attitudinal posture that allowed some men to leverage their confidence and gain an unnecessary leg up. Office hours and feedback. Prof. Kagan gives incredible written feedback on all three essays. The amount of attention he gives to student writing cannot be overstated. The same goes for office hours. The systematic way that he talked through issues in person and in his written feedback modeled for me the type of work that was required to succeed in the class. He always provided several paths forward that I could take in an essay, while also giving me clarity on what each task would require. The attention that he devoted to my work has significantly improved my own ability to think philosophically."

   "comments": [
    "Here are three points that you should bear in mind: one positive, two negative. (1) Prof. Kagan gave me more detailed, careful comments on my papers than any other professor I've had in four years at Yale. His comments are usually almost as long as the paper itself, and it's not just that: he reads your paper carefully, and he genuinely thinks about the argument you are making, whether it is successful (he will say that it isn't) and how it can be improved. Sure, your grade will probably be lousy, but he will take you seriously in a way that is unusual for a Yale professor. Also the conversations after class were extremely helpful, if you have time to go to them. (2) Prof. Kagan is a destructive thinker. He is extremely good at tearing down arguments, but does not do much to build them up. Both in class and when you read his textbook (which is all that is talked about in class - don't take this if you want a literature survey), you will see that he refuses to really 'invest' in any given ethical theory. This isn't necessarily a bad thing for a professor; but it does mean that you need to bring your own ideas to the table. For me, this was not so easy. I find normative ethics to be a very unintuitive and slightly annoying way of thinking. There are a lot of methodological assumptions built into the class that we never really talked about, because that would be 'meta-ethics' rather than 'normative ethics'. And as someone who cares more about politics than trolley problems, this meant that I at times found it hard to take the class that seriously. It would have helped to have a teacher who is invested in showing why the class matters, and what it is possible to learn from it, rather than one who just plays devil's advocate all the time (and teaches you to do the same). (3) Seminar discussions were pretty low-quality. The class consists primarily of male members of the right of the yale political union with some kind of chip on their shoulder. And the situation was not helped by the fact that Prof. Kagan refused to call on people, but rather encouraged us all to 'jump in' when we had something to say. This meant that conversations were dominated primarily by loud, obnoxious people who interrupted one another constantly. Prof. Kagan seemed somehow to feed on the chaos. It was extremely difficult to find any kind of dialectic in the conversation, given that everyone felt like they had to start talking as soon as there was a moment's silence.",
    "I would be cautious to recommend this course to another student. But, first of all, Shelly is a fantastic seminar leader. He pays more attention than anyone else in seminar, and knows how to guide the discussion towards productive topics (usually). I would be cautious to recommend this course because the subject matter (normative ethics) is not very compelling to me. Every question remains unanswered, and the only thing I did definitely learn was that many intelligent people spend too long pondering unanswerable questions. I would rather all that collective intelligence be spent on something that produces tangible Good in the world rather than poking in the dark about what their version of the Good looks like. The normative ethicist might say that you cannot do Good until you answer the question \"what is good?\" Anyways, I learned that everything is relative and our intuition is the only real thing we have to guide us. That could have been learned in one TED talk. Writing papers and getting Shelly's feedback was productive. I probably express my ideas more clearly now than before. But at the end of the day, most classes felt like a waste of intellect.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. Put in the time to process the readings, participate in seminar, come to class prepared, meet with Shelly before each paper, and you will learn a lot.",
    "This class is really interesting, but only take it if you are prepared to participate a lot during class discussion.",
    "Shelly is absolutely fantastic as a professor and facilitator of class discussion. The level of student in this class is always really high, including a large number of grad students. Shelly is not screwing around when he says that he doesn't believe in grade inflation. You will do badly in this class, even if you work really hard unless you're super talented at philosophy from the start. That's ok though. You will learn a ton in this class, some of the most learning and specific knowledge I have gotten in any Yale class. But reminder that you should start it credit\/D and will almost definitely keep it that way. If you can get in, highly recommend this class.",
    "Amazing course. Shelly is hands down one of the best pedagogs I have ever encountered. His feedback is honest and thorough, and I can wholeheartedly say that he improved my writing and analytical skills",
    "A tough class but one that helps you think clearly about major ideas in ethics. This class covers everything from the importance of promises to foundational theories like consequentialism. You are forced to take positions, explain them very clearly, and defend them. Class is filled with a lot of people who like the sound of their own voice. Shelly is a brilliant if not severe teacher - his comments on all of my papers were longer than the papers themselves. Take credit d.",
    "I would recommend this course to everyone without reservation. I don't think I'll ever have a professor as sharp, knowledgeable and as committed to pedagogy as Shelly, nor take a class with a subject matter more important. I honestly wish I'd taken this class along with just one or two others this semester because it seems one just dives deeper into the material and gets much richer returns from it the more effort one puts in.",
    "Absolutely!",
    "If you are ready to engage with others in a highly intellectual (and fast-paced) environment, to spend weeks thinking about extremely difficult moral problems, and to be challenged to write (and think) as clearly as possible, then - without hesitation - take this class.",
    "You will be challenged to think systematically about ethics. Best reason to take the class: Prof. Kagan will give you tons of written feedback and attention in office hours. The papers are not like other philosophy papers: you come up with your own ethical argument (no secondary sources allowed). You wont come away with an in-depth understanding of Kantian ethics or religious ethics or Rawlsian justice or libertarianism etc. You will learn about commonsense ethics and survey some different theories. We spent seminars discussing our own intuitions and arguing about moral generalizations. Occasionally, Prof. Kagan would intervene and the class could work together to grasp some tough ethical questions. More often, it was two-hours of arguing (and interrupting each other) about, like, the Trolley Problem. The class did not make me a more ethical person."
