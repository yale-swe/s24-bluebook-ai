   "comments": [
    "I thought the lectures could be very disorganized and hard to follow; Dr. P. does not really give introductions to new material to help orient the class. The psets can be difficult, but there's a mandatory weekly HW session where he basically goes over as much of the pset as possible. The exams are easier than the psets, and more focused on understanding the theories and concepts. I wasn't a huge fan of the textbook, but I'm under the impression that there aren't many other good heat transfer textbooks out there. Dr. P is big on participation and very willing to set up meeting to go over material. Just beware, he answers every question with another question. The class ended up not being that bad, but it was a struggle in the beginning.",
    "This class is so hard. Make appointments with the prof and talk with him as much as possible, otherwise you won't even understand what the psets are asking you to do sometimes. On the plus side, the exams aren't as hard as the psets!",
    "This is a terrible course. Do not take it unless you have to. This is actually the worst class I've ever taken at Yale. The professor (1) mumbles into the board (2) doesn't respond to emails and (3) has multiple offices so is very hard to find in person. There are excessive amounts of homework that (1) were assigned at random times [usually Friday and then randomly additional ones were added] and (2) had due dates changed with no notice sent to the class at large. The grading on the exams was also confusing, as there were multiple times where my answers were marked correctly, but I lost points for an undeterminable reason. My friend literally dropped ABET because this class is that terrible. He tried to schedule an exam on the weekend, and on Valentine's Day no less. He also said 'I've been doing this for 25 years, I don't care about reviews,' which means there is no way to let him know how terrible this class is. On the plus side, the professor seems like a nice person as long as he's not teaching.",
    "Strongly recommend this class. If you put in the effort it will be worth it",
    "I felt as though I really learned and understood concepts in this class more than just understanding things enough to complete a problem set. I think the office hours were very helpful for this, but this class also had its challenges. It was sometimes very hard to understand the professor either because the board wasn't clear, he was talking quietly, or it just wasnt making sense to us. Overall though he cared a lot about the students which was really nice.",
    "Take it even if you are not ABET. I know there are much easier ways to finish BS12 but honestly, you learn so much in terms of how to deal with things in this class that I would strongly recommend it for every MechE student.",
    "You're only taking this course if you're ABET, so... Go to section. Go to section. GO TO SECTION. Wednesday, usually, because there's more people to absorb the professor's attention."
