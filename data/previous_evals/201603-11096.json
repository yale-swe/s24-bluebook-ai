   "comments": [
    "Learned a great deal about architecture's role in Islamic history that I never knew before!",
    "Good survey course of architecture in the history of Islam. I learned about different dynasties as well as how religion played a part in politics and social life. Architecture became a platform to learn about these things.",
    "Overview of the development in Islamic architecture and history of Islamic art",
    "Art and architecture of the Middle East was definitely something that my art historical education was lacking, so I was excited to see this course being offered. I learned a lot about not only the architectural history and styles of the Middle East\/North African\/South Asia, but also about the religious and political histories of Islam.",
    "i learned about how architectural monuments are representative of political power and history",
    "I learned a lot about visual analysis in this course, and I also got a little bit of a primer\/refresher on some Islamic history, although that part might have been harder to grasp if I didn't already have some background in that.",
    "It was my first architecture class, so I developed a basic vocabulary for describing parts of buildings and, more specifically, mosques. I also learned a decent amount about ancient history of the Middle East",
    "I learned a lot about the development of Islamic architecture and the way in which it is perceived and affected by western nations.",
    "This is one of the classes in which I learned the most at Yale.",
    "This was a great overview of Islamic Architecture.",
    "Refined knowledge on Islamic origins and history through the lens of art and architecture",
    "I learned how to identify buildings from their physical characteristics, placing them within geographical, cultural, and chronological contexts. I learned how to engage with secondary texts about architecture, which I used to find dry, but now know how to formulate some opinions about it. I learned a lot of the complexities and questions surrounding architecture in general, and specifically in Islamic settings."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "This course was an adequate introduction to the broad scope of Islamic architecture. However, it skipped around countries and time periods and it was difficult to see broad connections throughout the course. Additionally, it would be helpful to be provided the specific picture of the monuments that are on the exams. On the midterm, students often couldn't identify the picture on the board even though they knew the monument just because they had happened to study another picture that was shown in class.",
    "The survey course gives you little pieces of Islamic history and I definitely learned a lot. I did not know much about this region or religion before. Professor Rizvi does an excellent job of explaining the material and the history. If I had to pick a weakness I would say that the names of rulers \/ buildings were not clarified all the time. She definitely expected us to know a little bit about the material and I just had no background knowledge. It took some getting use to.",
    "I felt that the slides were confusing to look at, and I wish they were more clearly labelled. I also had trouble following the lectures sometimes, especially when terms were used that I didn't understand.",
    "The course was definitely a survey we weren't about to go into depth about a lot of things that would have been interesting to explore further. But I often forgot we were in a survey, since the lectures were very rich and I feel like I was able to gain a good understanding of many aspects of Islamic Architecture.",
    "The lectures were incredibly interesting, but they weren't organized as well as they could have been, and it was sometimes hard to tell which pictures corresponded to which buildings. However, there was lots of good information in the lectures, and the readings generally corresponded to what we were hearing about in lecture. Unfortunately, a lot of the readings were kind of dry and descriptive instead of analytical.",
    "I know this sounds whiny, but I thought this class was pretty hard, and probably shouldn't be listed as an \"Intro\" class! It definitely required an art history or architecture background, in my opinion, and while having to look up pictures of different buildings to make flash cards was helpful, it was also more stressful than it needed to be (for an intro level class).",
    "This course has very interesting material but is taught in a pretty disorganized manor that makes it diffocult to follow.",
    "An exceptional professor and teaching fellow who were both incredibly knowledgable. A little bit of disorganization around exams",
    "This class did a great job of teaching the main themes and periods of Islamic Architecture. I really liked the lectures and the trip to New York",
    "In depth knowledge on early Islamic history but skims large empires like Ottoman and Mughal",
    "I love that the class focuses on specific objects and analyzes them in depth, as case studies of larger trends. For a survey course that has to cover several centuries and continents, this is a challenge - but it's so important, because it's the best part of art history. I think the most successful lectures were the ones where we came away with a deep understanding of a handful of buildings that exemplified the concerns of a culture\/dynasty. Weaker lectures tried to brush too quickly over too many buildings, each of which came across as less significant and less complex. Also, I was glad that Professor Rizvi didn't \"dumb down\" the material for us, but I think there a lot of gaps in my knowledge about basic Islamic architecture and traditions in general. As someone who had never been exposed to the topic before, there were a lot of dynasties, names, and terms (both religious and architectural) that I was unfamiliar with. It would be helpful to have those defined (even on the daily lecture handouts). The fiction assignment was a little frustrating, because the assignment made it sound like we could craft as much or as little of a narrative as we wanted. Then the grading seemed to indicate that visual analysis was unimportant and the more fantastic the narrative the better. More clarity beforehand would have been nice."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "No, I would not recommend this course. I feel that I learned very little about Islamic architecture since most lectures we spent quickly skipping around the Islamic world from one random monument to another. Furthermore, the professor spent most of the lectures vaguely describing the aspects of each monument, and I feel that I learned very little about the significance of the monuments other than how to identify them. My google searches about the buildings were often more informative than the lectures.",
    "I would recommend this to students who do not have a lot of background with the region or religion. You will learn a lot about different time periods and how important these regions are in the context of world history. I now know so much more not just about architecture and aesthetic, but also about the religion and culture.",
    "Yes absolutely, Islamic Architecture is a subject not often covered in architectural history.",
    "Good survey course, it is just when it comes to exam, there are too much IDs to memorize",
    "Would highly recommenda wide-ranging and mind-expanding introduction to the Islamic world through its architecture and visual culture. Professor Rizvi is very engaging, knowledgeable, and eager to work with students.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course it's an important course for the art history major and would also be great for anyone with a general interest in architecture or the Middle East.",
    "if you are interested in studying about the Islamic world from an architectural and historical perspective, this is a great course! you will learn a lot about the intersection of art with religion and political power",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. It's super interesting and gives you insight into a part of the world that is historically understudied and grossly misunderstood. I think this would be a good first foray both into art history and into middle eastern studies.",
    "This class is wonderful, but be advised that it's harder than any other intro class I've taken. I was not familiar with Islam or ancient history of the Middle East before taking this class, and Professor Rizvi does an excellent job placing buildings in historical context. The museum visit was fun, and the papers were easy, but midterm\/final were pretty tough to study for, so just be prepared to put in a lot of work memorizing names.",
    "Absolutely!!! If you have any interest in Islamic culture then this is a great class, even if you think you don't love architecture!",
    "Take this class if you want to learn about Islamic Architecture and History.",
    "Definitely, it's an opportunity to learn about Islamic history from an incredibly accomplished and engaging professor",
    "This was one of the best art history courses I've taken at Yale, for the way it re-frames much of what we learn in other courses. For a survey\/intro-level course, it is by far the best, delving into the questions and complexities of art objects that other survey professors skim over. Professor Rizvi engages with the material in a deep and intellectual way that not many professors achieve (especially for a non-Western art history course). Besides that, she is one of the kindest professors you'll have."
