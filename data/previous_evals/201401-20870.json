    "I would definitely recommend this class! It is only one really interesting book per week and the final essay can be personal or critical, which is cool. Professor Stepto is the best and the reading is really interesting.",
    "laid back senior english seminar with a fun project.",
    "I'm so happy I took this course as my senior seminar. the texts were eye opening and engaging, and Professor Stepto was a wonderful mentor.",
    "Autobiography is a very relaxed senior seminar. The readings are interesting and you are allowed to write personal essays for two of your three papers. Stepto is so lovely; this is a low stress way to round out the English major.",
    "Great senior spring seminar. Take it.",
    "A great class to understand how autobiography works. You will analyze many strategies, such as photographs, \"education of\" narratives, personalized definitions of America and more. Prof. Stepto is brilliant. Every word he says is dripping with wisdom. You read one book a week. Some short, some long, all wonderful. Many students don't do the reading for this class, which is a shame, because these are some of the best books I've read in my entire time at Yale, and this course as a huge amount of depth to that reading. Highly recommended.",
    "Look at the syllabus and see if the autobiographies look interesting to you. If it's your thing then it's your thing. The course discussions could become a bit draggy, but if the books look interesting to you that shouldn't matter and you'll benefit from reading them. There are three essays, the first is a response to something you read in class, the next two essays you write can be autobiographical but you need to explain how your autobiographical writing was influenced by the style of something you read for class. All in all you'll write about 25-30 pages over the entire course. Professor Stepto is very laid back and smart so go speak to him if you have any issues or difficulties."
