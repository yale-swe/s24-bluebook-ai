    "The class has great potential as some really interesting topics are covered, however the way they are taught makes things pretty boring.",
    "If you care about the practicals of USAID, democracy development and foreign aid, then this is the class for you. With a relatively even blend of practical and theoretical, the course won't spend too long hung up on the unanswerable questions of sovereignty vs moral imperative to interfere, because it's not that kind of course. If you do, however, want to learn how USAID works, what civil society is or what order a country's institutions should be democratized, you'll find out in this course.Occasionally the practical nature of the course means being assigned multiple 300-page USAID reports to read in a week. This is another skill you'll get out of the class: learning how to read drawn-out, frequently boring bureaucratic reports. But the classroom discussion more than makes up for it.",
    "The course focuses a little too heavily on professor Blair's experience in USAID. There is some discussion of whether democracy is the best form of government for developing countries. The readings are a mixed bag, with some interesting ones and some very boring reports. Blair mainly promotes discussion which can sometimes be forced, but he does have some interesting experience.",
    "Introduction in democratization theory, plus critical look at USAID and other donor agency practices. Highly recommended for anyone interested in democracy promotion.",
    "The class is interesting, but only somewhat thought-provoking. I did enjoy it, but I wasn't blown away. I did learn about how USAID works and all the problems found in donors. It's a good basis if you are interested in working for the government in development, or for a contracting firm even. Even if you are not, it's a good basis for understanding how they work. Classes are guided by Prof Blair and some days are better than others, mostly dependent on the readings. Sometimes the readings are just questions to gain more insight on how things happen behind scenes, insight Prof Blair can provide, so it's not an argument\/discussion based course in that sense. He does try to make it more discussion-like, but the material itself (some of it being reports on USAID projects) doesn't encourage it.It's a rather easy course, in the sense that the readings are manageable and the workload is low.Professor Blair is genuinely interested in his students and I recommend going to his office hours and discussing the final paper early. He is willing to assist and guide and is very approachable. He gives feedback on all assignments leading up to final paper, which is actually rather unusual and shows how he takes the time to review your progress. The assignments are really well spaced throughout the semester. I enjoyed being in the class with him as Professor. He is an expert in the field, having done the work himself, and a great resource in this sense."
