    "This was one of the most fantastic courses I've taken at Yale! I had no idea how much I did not know about superconductivity. The course was well structured, starting with a basic overview of the phenomena of superconductivity, moving to Ginzberg-Landau theory to solve some simple problems, learning about the theory and applications of Josephson junctions, and finally ending with BCS theory and some great guest lectures. Professor Prober really knows this subject and is a fantastic physics lecturer with a very intuitive style.",
