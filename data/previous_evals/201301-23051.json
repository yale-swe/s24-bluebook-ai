    "Take it for the reading list and for the discussions you'll have in section. Don't take it for the lecture.",
    "It's great for seniors. Reading a whole range of English and American authors, in addition to a few French and German writers, from the 16th to 21st centuries, is a great finale to a Yale undergraduate education. It was a terrific opportunity to read important people and works that you might have skipped over during the first 3.5 years at Yale.",
    "If its taught again, definitely shop it and see if its your style of lecture and discussion. Bromwich is one of the most intelligent professors at Yale and he chooses every word with a purpose during his lectures.",
    "Probably not relevant because this was the DeVane lecture and thus won't be offered again in the same form, but I enjoyed it. I think you'll get more out of it if you're an upperclassman with a strong literature background."
