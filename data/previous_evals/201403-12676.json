   "comments": [
    "Excellent course. Highly recommended, especially if the topics are of interest but even perhaps if not.",
    "This is an incredible course, the readings are great but Kapustin is really the main draw -- if you are interested in political philosophy you must take a course with him. Professor Kapustin is both brilliant and encouraging. This course is not a lot of work but you will get so much out of it!",
    "If you are interested in how morality and politics intersect, and enjoy political philosophy, it's a great class! Kapustin is a legend, and a remarkable thinker and seminar leader. It is also really rewarding because you learn a lot, and read important works, but are graded VERY fairly, and are not overwhelmed with readings\/assignments. Great 5th class.",
    "The stories are true - Kapustin is one of the best professors at Yale, and hearing him teach about morality, ethics in politics, and the views of various philosophers is a rare privilege. The reading list is strong, the concepts you'll reckon with are exciting and complex, and the class experience is unique. Stop thinking and just sign up for the class - there's no way you'll regret it.",
    "I would recommend it to another student because it is class that is worth his time.",
    "I think it's kind of a mixed bag, but overall I would take it again. I would recommend it just because Kapustin is so amazing. He is an incredible lecturer and professor and educator, and I was really happy to be learning with him. He commands respect and he deserves it -- he is phenomenally smart, eloquent, knowledgable, and caring. He really cares about his students learning the material, and I think very highly of him. I loved the way he structured classes and the way he was in office hours. That being said, there was a decent amount of reading (if you want to do all of it- which I did because I wanted to come to class totally prepared) and the material was not that interesting in my opinion. It was pretty boring in fact, and I didn't really find myself thinking too hard about it or feeling challenged by it.",
    "Take this course if you can get in, it's wonderful!!! A very thorough reading of the most important thinkers and leaders in history, including Guevara, Havel, Gandhi, Socrates, Fanon, and Robespierre. Take it!",
    "ONLY take this class if you know you love philosophy and philosophical discussions. It's interesting and the reading is manageable, but some readings were definitely less interesting than others.",
    "Kapustin is a legend for a reason, absolutely take this. That being said, I found the course to be less 'mind blowing' than Critique of Political Violence; the focus is on revolutionary\/emancipatory movements in history, and the personal ethics espoused by their leaders.",
    "This is the best EPE political philosophy class out there. The subject matter can be a little dense, but the readings are very manageable and Boris is the best professor in the department. You should take this class even if you aren't particularly enthused by the topics - Boris is that good, and you'll learn a ton even if you don't participate much in seminar.",
    "It's a good seminar. You get more out of it when you do the reading before class.",
    "I highly recommend Moral Choices in Politics to anyone who has an interest in moral theory \/ political philosophy. This is a philosophy class but from the perspective of practitioners (i.e., people who had to develop a moral framework and then actually execute it, like Gandhi and Che Guevara) and not about pure theoretics. Given that, the class offers a really interesting (practical?) perspective on topics you may have studied elsewhere.",
    "Moral Choices is an incredible class - much like any other class with Prof. Kapustin, it strikes a wonderful balance between instructor participation and student-involved discussion. Prof. Kapustin is an incredible seminar leader, always building off student comments, but offering a wonderfully synthetic view of how any one theorist - Gandhi, Havel, Robespierre - interacts with the political philosophical justifications for their actions. One thing that made this course even more enjoyable for me than Classics of EP&E was that it was much more grounded in real-life events that had occurred. The individuals we studied about were not mere theorists, but actual practitioners of political violence. I would highly recommend anyone even fleetingly interested in the topic take the class if its offered again - Prof. Kapustin makes it worth it."
