    "History 700 is an introduction to various fields of US historiography, approached through reading important books by Yale American historians, interacting with these scholars, and discussing the arguments their books make and how these books fit into the literature in each field. The course also provides an introduction to scholarly work in US history through the writing of reviews and the formation of a community of peers.",
    "I recommend this course for the following reason:-It broadens students view by providing them chances to read and analyze various kinds of US histories as well as to talk with their authors, otherwise students rarely have such opportunities.",
    "I would recommend it - it's a good way to understand the work of Americanists in the history department and to get a feeling for the craft of history.",
    "As someone not in the general US history track, I would strongly recommend the course to any prospective student treating with US history. While in no sense a comprehensive survey of US historiography, if such a thing is even possible, this was a really great course.",
    "Introduction to US Historiography through the works of Yale Scholars\/Professors in very diverse fields of U.S. History. Outstanding introduction to the field and the craft of the historian. I would recommend the course to others, especially those that were new to the subject; great place to broadly investigate the subject and develop areas of special interest."

   "comments": [
    "The course helped introduce me to the scholarly literature in American history. More specifically, it grounded me in many of the scholarly debates on important historical problems (i.e. how have historians approached religion in American history?), which will help undergird my future research; helped me hone my reading skills to ask how scholars use evidence, present arguments, and address central questions in the field, which will help me with every future book I read and will especially help me when reading for orals; and gave me more general insights into how scholars go about doing their work, and move from research to dissertation to book to second book, which will help me in my future (hoped-for) scholarly path.",
    "The course gave me many chances to appreciate various fields of US history. In this sense, it helped me broaden my knowledge, and search and confirm my focus in US history.",
    "I have a better feeling for the different fault lines within history and for how historians practice their profession.",
    "This course allowed me to think about how my own work, which is connected to, but not directly engaged with US historiogrpahy, can and should move outside of its bounds. To that effect, I am glad that I took the class.",
    "Introduction to various established historians and their methods, writing styles, research techniques; ability to engage with them directly about their scholarship very helpful and eye-opening.I was introduced to several fields of history that will be fertile ground for future research."
