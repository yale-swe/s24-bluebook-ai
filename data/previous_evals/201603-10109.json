    "Instructor: Janna Kelly Gonwa \u00a0Able to function as both an authority and a participant in group discussions. Very conscious of how people may have been overwhelmed by material, both in terms of volume and content, and served as a very good point of support for those who needed a pastoral presence. Also, grasp of material (unsurprisingly), completely incredible.",
    "Instructor: Janna Kelly Gonwa \u00a0Janna has been great and encouraging. She has gone above and beyond in making arrangements to help students prepare for assignments, and her comments at those sessions were quite helpful.",
    "Instructor: Janna Kelly Gonwa \u00a0Janna helped to bring clarity at a number of points in the class, which was helpful in understanding both course material and assignments. Her written responses were also helpful in pushing us to think more deeply about the material.",
    "Instructor: Janna Kelly Gonwa \u00a0Although I recognize that the case study format takes a significant amount of time to grade, I thought feedback should have been provided much earlier in the semester. The case study format is not one that any in the class was used to writing, and it would have been helpful to have feedback for the final case study earlier than one week before it was due, particularly since the midterm was turned in at the beginning of November.",
    "Instructor: Janna Kelly Gonwa \u00a0Janna is awesome. She gave great insight on the blog posts and was very helpful with planning for the case studies and the book review (which was valuable given that these were slightly unusual assignments).",
    "Instructor: Janna Kelly Gonwa \u00a0Janna is absolutely fantastic. Incredibly attentive, available and brilliant. She shows amazing intuitions for the different strengths of her students. She was the backbone of this course.n",
    "Instructor: Janna Kelly Gonwa \u00a0She was helpful in one-on-one discussions. However, papers were returned very late.",
    "Instructor: Janna Kelly Gonwa \u00a0Janna is wonderful. She went out of her way to help students this semester by voluntarily organizing study groups for each of our assignments. Her comments on my written work were thoughtful, constructive, and thorough.",
    "Instructor: Janna Kelly Gonwa \u00a0Janna Gonwa is a rock star. I began this class on decidedly rocky footing-- I was struggling to figure out how to fully engage the material in a way that aligned with my learning style. Janna truly went out of her way to pull me aside and: 1.) Check in on me to see how I was personally doing; 2.) Gain a better understanding of what my learning style and challenges entailed, 3.) Put together a constructive plan that mapped out how I could bring my full self to the table in engaging the material; and 4.) Checking BACK in whenever deviations from the plan were made to ensure that I stayed on track. Janna is a God-send... Over the course of the semester, I came to know her intimately well because of the way she proactively worked to ensure that learning accommodations were made for me, in concert with the Resource Office on Disabilities. All of my assignments and exams were delivered orally to Janna. I really can't thank her enough for her incredibly thoughtful presence and the leading role she took on in facilitating our class.",
    "Instructor: Janna Kelly Gonwa \u00a0Janna was fantastic. On our midterm she gave probably 2-3 pages of thoughtful feedback. I went to liberal arts school that prized this kind of feedback and Janna gave me more than I've ever received. She also did a great job making herself available outside of class for discussion meetings.",
    "Instructor: Janna Kelly Gonwa \u00a0Janna is incredibly helpful and supportive. She also gave us very elaborate comments on our assignments and offered brainstorming sessions for us. She's wonderful.",
    "Instructor: Janna Kelly Gonwa \u00a0As with the students, I think Janna was also adapting to Dr. Jennings' uniquely formatted coursework, which may have lead to some mismatched expectations. The first grade we received was a week before our final papers were due. This makes it hard to gauge where we should be focusing for improvement.",
    "Instructor: Janna Kelly Gonwa \u00a0Janna was helpful in always providing additional time outside of class to talk through our assignments. Her comments on the midterm were helpful in writing the final as well.",
    "Instructor: Janna Kelly Gonwa \u00a0Janna was very responsive, gave thorough and really challenging (in a great way) feedback on written work that showed a real engagement with me. I appreciated that a lot. I did not attend any of the optional study groups because of external commitments, but I trust they were also well facilitated. I was also grateful for all of the extra support through a difficult personal situation."
