    "Not really unless you are thrilled by the material. It's more of a political philosophy class than econ. Interesting topic and very nice professor, but the class was very disorganized and difficult to follow. It made for a very unstructured course. I took it because I needed an econ seminar for the major, but I definitely think there are better ones out there",
    "Yes, if you are interested in theories.",
    "Impersonal rules, how they come about and how they work, How Hobbes' Leviathan wasn't entirely true. More coordination and mutual benefitting than simply coercive, violence enforced power.",
    "Yes, it was a good opportunity to see part of the process of writing a book while discussing interesting topics in legal and economic philosophy."
