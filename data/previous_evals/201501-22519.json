    "HEBR 158 is an excellent course to improve one's Hebrew (spoken and written) while learning more about Israeli society and culture. It is a well balanced course in terms of amount and type of workload, and was taught excellently by Professor Shiri Goren.",
    "A good way to keep up your hebrew and improve it. Entertaining.",
    "This is a fantastic course for anyone interested in looking at society through the lens of film or just interested in Israeli film. Shiri is a fantastic teacher and always available to talk about the material and make sure students feel engaged and comfortable in class. Highly recommend this class."
