   "comments": [
    "Take it! A really fabulous class that shows there is so much more to \"Environmental History\" than one might expect. It's a self critical field that covers a ton of turf from religion and spirituality to law and social justice.",
    "This is a great course for a student who is well-versed in environmental history or one who is just curious. I would highly recommend it to anyone who wants to broaden their methods beyond typical document-based historical research.",
    "I would absolutely recommend Environmental History to a fellow historian or scholar in the environmental sciences. This class provided a broad and thorough overview of current scholarship in the field of Environmental History. Prof. Sabin fostered a dynamic, conversational atmosphere in his class that encouraged participation and engagement on a diverse set of topics. For folks looking to go into academia in the field of History, it introduced a dynamic new lens through which to engage a period or community. For folks going into environmental services or management, it provided historical context to the work in which those students will soon engage.",
    "It's just a really well designed and executed class overall. A real pleasure!",
    "This is an introduction to current (and some classic) scholarship in environmental history organized along various categories (climate, animals, commodities, etc.) I would definitely recommend this course to anyone interested in environmental issues, whether or not they are an historian-in-training. For those who are not historians, but future policy-makers, the class demonstrates the value of historical knowledge in crafting policy. For those who are historians in other fields, it demonstrates the influence of the environment on military, migratory, political and economic decisions. Since the end of the term, reminders of readings and discussion continue to pop up and I wish I had a forum by which to share them with the other members of the class."

   "comments": [
    "This class provided me with the tools necessary to refine the focus of my Masters degree. I feel prepared now to take the methods discussed in Environmental History and apply them in my future courses.",
    "I'm in the midst of figuring out whether I want to stay in history or leave and pursue a non-academic career. This course showed me some of the ways I can use academic history to contribute to real-life, political goals. Professor Sabin is also a great role model for people interested in politically meaningful academic work.",
    "Paul's broad definition of what constitutes environmental history (and that of the authors we read) allowed me to integrate several different aspects of history into my paper even as the paper went in a somewhat different direction from my original intention. That, in and of itself, was a useful learning. And, while this particular topic may remain a fallow field for the immediate future, the secondary readings both assigned and as part of the paper, have generated a great deal of cogitation in other areas. Paul's teaching style and his Socratic approach to seminar discussion was also highly useful as a model (even the one weakness noted in the first section taught me a lesson about the implicit promise within a syllabus)."
