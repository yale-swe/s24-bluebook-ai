    "Trace is fantastic and it was one of the more practical courses that I took at YSPH.",
    "Excellent course. You really learn a lot about the development of a program. It is a lot of work and the grading is tough, but you definitely learn a lot and gain some really useful skills. You learn to effectively work with a group. The lectures are really chill. Most of the hard work takes place outside the classroom. There is a lot of space to discuss your individual projects during lectures though.My one piece of negative feedback about the course is that I did not find the student feedback particularly helpful. Other than that, I think it's a great class.",
    "This course was very helpful. I would suggest that groups be strongly encouraged to do groups of 3 or more to share the burden of the large workload. It's a lot of work, but I also learned a lot that is directly applicable to what I'd like to do, so it was definitely worth it. It would be helpful if info in lecture slides was cited because there were several things I would have liked to use\/cite in my final manual but couldn't find a citation for.",
    "For me this course was extremely important and interesting. It requires to read a lot, think a lot, write a lot, and learn on your own mistakes - all these are the strengths of this course.",
    "You learn a lot but it really is too demanding in my opinion. The stuff covered would be better if spread out over a year, not crammed into one semester. I also think it would helpful to have a TA.",
    "This class has been one of my favorite classes here at YSPH. While I was warned about the workload of this course, and was dreading taking it to be honest, I both underestimated the amount of work I would have to put into this course, and also overestimated how much I would enjoy doing it. The workload of the course is consistent throughout the semester (no breaks!) but I have learned SO MUCH about intervention design....this class is well worth it. The key is picking a hard-working group that also cares about producing good work... having a strong, dependable group is the key to this class not taking over your life.",
    "Strengths: small, intimate, based off of student response and feedbackNo major weaknesses.",
    "Great course! Really important to the SBS division, and definitely a set of skills we don't get elsewhere in the curriculum. I really enjoyed the assignments and the chance to walk through the development of an intervention -- it would be hard to learn those skills as well any other way. Designing all of the activities in the intervention was a bit tedious, doing a portion of them would have been just as effective with less busy work. Lectures were good, but I would like to see examples from a larger variety of existing interventions and the chance to see what other interventions do well or not as well.",
    "It's a great skills-based, practical course. Learned a lot by doing!I would change the lectures to once a week, and have half the time lecture and half the time working on group projects",
    "This is a very practical course. The lectures can be a little dry and or intuitive sometimes, but the discussion do a good job of tying it to your own interventions, so you can see how they can be applied in real life. Developing your own manual can be a pain, but I'm really glad I went through the process because you do learn a lot.",
    "The lectures were a little boring, especially the slides.",
    "It is important to have designed an intervention from start to finish... very applicable, good professional skill. It seemed unnecessary for the class to be a twice a week class- a lot of class time seemed repetitive and elementary. I also don't think I gained very much from creating the actual intervention activity materials. While it is important to theoretically design the activities, it seemed like busy work to be making the activity materials... attendance sheets, for examples. The real benefit comes from picking activities that address determinants and effect the desired change- creating the materials for these activities, however, did not seem like a valid use of time.",
    "good material, good practice at putting together a manual, one of few practice oriented classes at YSPH, lectures could be more engaging though",
    "It was really helpful to learn how to plan an intervention from a theoretical groundwork. The class really concentrates on the determinants and it's important to know you just can't do an intervention because it sounds cool.Some of the work we had to do was hard, but critical. Some just seemed tedious. For example, there was so much work in formatting section 2 (our activities). I spent so long trying to format them that my head was spinning. And I know other groups felt the same. There has to be some help in getting us to format things. Also, I'm not sure it's necessary to have us write out EVERY single activity we're going to do. At some point we get the point and it seems unnecessary. That being said, I thoroughly enjoyed the class."

    "Instructor: Trace Kershaw \u00a0Trace is wonderful. He has an incredible knowledge base and creates an atmosphere that is really enjoyable and conducive to learning.",
    "Instructor: Trace Kershaw \u00a0Trace is awesome!!! So engaging, fun, and chill. He is approachable, and cares about getting to know the students. He is great mentor to have. He is really responsive to student concerns and feedback. His grading is quite tough, but I don't know if this is necessarily a bad thing - he just wants to help us create the best possible product.",
    "Instructor: Trace Kershaw \u00a0Trace was very helpful and approachable. He was very understanding of students. Class was very interactive and not just lecture-based which was a definite plus.",
    "Instructor: Trace Kershaw \u00a0The instructor is very devoted to the course. He was always able to help: explain, recommend, give an idea. I liked the way he presented material: discussions stimulated thinking, although I personally almost haven't speak up in classroom.",
    "Instructor: Trace Kershaw \u00a0Trace is amazing and really cares about student learning.",
    "Instructor: Trace Kershaw \u00a0I can't say enough about how amazing Trace has been this semester. He clearly knows what he's talking about in terms of intervention design, and makes the students want to do well on the assignments. His laid-back personality is the complete opposite of his very intense course, and it works.Trace has also extended himself well beyond the classroom, offering thesis advice to students who were not his advisees, offering career advice to students who were not his advisees, and just being an overall great person. I think of all of my professors at YSPH, Trace is the person I would feel most comfortable approaching with any issue, and I know he would care as well.Trace is a superstar and deserves to be recognized for the amount of dedication he has to his class and to his students.",
    "Instructor: Trace Kershaw \u00a0Trace was very receptive to students' needs and I felt like he was available if I needed help. I really enjoyed having him as the instructor for this course.",

    "Instructor: Trace Kershaw \u00a0Trace is awesome.",
    "Instructor: Trace Kershaw \u00a0Trace is great instructor for this class. He does a good job of using examples or his own experiences drive in the concepts. He leads discussions well, and gets to the point. He's a pretty tough grader, but I appreciate that he spends a lot of time looking the manuals over and giving good feedback.",
    "Instructor: Trace Kershaw \u00a0Awesome. Really tries to help his students and want the final projects to be the best we can create",
    "Instructor: Trace Kershaw \u00a0Trace is fantastic. Very knowledgable about intervention design. His laid back attitude made the daunting intervention design less painful, yet he still maintained high expectations of us.",

   "comments": [
    "Great course - totally worth the heavy workload. Plus, I loved working with my group and getting to know them better.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course because you really get a lot of the practical side of public health, and you create something that could potentially be really useful to a program or an organization. Be prepared for a lot of work. My advice would be to pick your group wisely, because your group can really make or break the experience. Make sure you communicate with one another about your working styles, and about your goals and expectations. Establishing a positive group dynamic will make for a much better experience. And if there are problems, don't wait until the end to bring it up. Address them at the outset. If there are issues, you can always talk to Trace. You have the option to work individually, but it is a lot to take on. However, if that's what works best for you, go for it!",
    "This course was a lot of work, but I learned a lot about intervention development that will be helpful for working in any kind of health intervention. I don't think I could have learned this info from a book either. Trace is very accessible and approachable. Get in a larger group for the group project to divide up the workload.",
    "I would recommend this course if you really want to learn how to develop an intervention and have enough time to be fully involved in this process. It was a great and really valuable experience for me.",
    "My advice would be to hope you're in a good group. I think that makes all the difference.",
    "This class is everything you have heard and more.... a TON of work (seriously- it doesn't ever let up), but totally rewarding in the end. Make sure to pick a hardworking group you can depend on and this will be a truly great experience. I wish more students outside of SBS knew about this course, because it is an absolute MUST for anyone remotely interested in interventions.",
    "I enjoyed the course and I learned alot. I would definitely recommend it to other students because I feel like I gained very valuable skills.",
    "A good, practical course on designing a health intervention. It's a significant time commitment, but worth the effort! It is definitely a set of skills you don't find elsewhere in the YSPH curriculum. Overall, I would recommend it!",
    "it's a lot of work, but if you pick a topic you're interested in you can learn a lot from it. I recommend it to students interested in program planning",
    "This class is a lot of work, but it's very practical and I came out learning a lot. Developing a manual by yourself really lets you not only see, but experience all the issues that arise in developing, implementing, and evaluating an intervention. Recommend it.",
    "Good course, and very important for public health.",
    "great course to take, but be ready for a lot of work.",
    "It's a lot of work, but definitely worth it if you think you want to plan interventions in your career. You can walk away with a strong understanding of how to plan an intervention based on the literature and a manual, that hopefully, will be strong and a good resource in future work. You also get to know Trace who is great."
