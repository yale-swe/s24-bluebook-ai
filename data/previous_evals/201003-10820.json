    "Working through labs individually--covers computer programming, electronic circuitry, Raman spectrometry, and vacuum systems. I would recommend--builds independence in lab and working with materials not used often in previous Chemistry labs.",
    "Any student that wants a better understanding of physical chemistry and the tools used in the study thereof would benefit from taking this class. The class introduces students to computer coding,electronics, laser spectroscopy, and vacuums. Along with building code and circuit boards, one learns how to connect the theory pounded into us in other classrooms to physical experiments and observations. The only word of warning I have is that 560L is a huge time commitment."
