    "I've got to know many useful resources for the topic I am passionate about. I benefited a lot from our class discussions and from how Prof. McCreless combined the historical and analytical aspects to understand the specificity of Russian music.",
    "In this course, I learned a great deal about Russian music spanning 1830 to 1930. I also learned more about how to analyze and write about music in a way that is more precise and effective."

   "comments": [
    "Strengths: Music analysis assignments Engagement with music history and music theory concepts together Interesting course material",
    "This is a very broad course, so more details, such as spending on particlular composer and his pieces would be great. Maybe, stretching this course in two would be a good idea.",
    "The course was great and the music I learned in it was exceptional.",
    "Enjoyed dong hands-on analysis most weeks. The reading load was heavy, but some weeks certain readings were only suggested if we had time, so it was fine.",
    "Strengths: - Course materials and readings - Analysis combined both historical + musical-theoretical perspectives - Prof. McCreless's deep knowledge and involvement into the subject Weaknesses\/possible improvements: - From the analytical perspective I think it would be worthy to actually dedicate maybe a 1\/2 of a class to learning Russian\/Chaikovsky way of the treatment of Secondary Dominant. I think this is the case when the theory led the practice. - It would be beneficial if student presentations would be more diverse. I felt like frequently the presentations were focused on the analysis harmony in a rather generic\/obvious way. I'd love to hear more ideas connected to extra-musical\/performance\/historical\/or somewhat unexpected aspects\/points of view."

    "Yes, highly recommended. The professor is very good and the topic is fascinating."
