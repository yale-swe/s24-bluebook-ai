    "Yes, I'd recommend it warmly.",
    "Music and Psychoanalysis is an engrossing exploration of the relationship between these two fields, with content organized around Freud and Lacan and some of their contemporary musics, as well as recent music scholarship that applies psychoanalysis in various ways. I would recommend the course for the opportunity to work with Professor Brodsky and to learn about psychoanalysis not only in its relationship to music, but also on its own account."

    "I find this stuff fascinating.",
    "Most of the content of this course probably will not have a direct bearing on my research, but it was certainly helpful in suggesting how I might do innovative research. The course also demonstrated the importance of psychoanalysis to twentieth-century thought, allowing me to draw connections with topics I have studied in other courses."
