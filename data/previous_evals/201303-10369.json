   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend this class! It would probably be pretty challenging for students not already used to reading\/writing philosophy, though not completely inaccessible.",
    "This course is recommended, if the material interests you. Zoltan was a very clear lecturer and good at responding to questions and having discussion, since this was a small class.",
    "Great intro to an important and interesting philosophical topic. Prof. Szabo is great: you will learn a lot from him both because he is an expert on many of these topics and an impressive thinker.",
    "I would recommend this class to a philosophy major. It covers interesting material, and some of the ideas you learn will show up in other areas of philosophy. Plus, it is really the only way to learn the material at Yale. I'm not sure if I would recommend the course to a non-philosophy major. The readings end up being very specific and it is hard to why and how many of the ideas matter in the big picture. Definitely not a good first course in philosophy, unless for some reason you already knew you were interested in the material.",
    "Yes, but only as a credit d course because I think the weakness of the course was its apathy toward the individual undergraduates.",
    "LING 271 focuses on the philosophy of language; we spend about half the semester focusing on semantics and more formal definitions of 'meaning,' etc. The second half of the semester focuses on pragmatics and how language intersects with moral judgments (e.g. what is lying vs. misleading, etc.).",
    "A very important subject that pushes you to reconsider your assumptions at their very foundation: down to the very grammar of your thoughts. If inserted into a well thought schedule, this class will help you think critically about your side classes and will enrich your approach. And anyway a must if you want to do philosophy because of its introduction to the basis of analytical currents."
