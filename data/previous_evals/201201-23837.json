    "By far the worst course I've taken at YSPH. I had really high expectations coming into this course because I always wanted to take a Betsy Bradley class. FALSE ADVERTISING to the extreme. Betsy taught ONLY five course sessions and the information is so basic, it was almost insulting. If you are a graduate student, take my advice and resist the temptation to take this course because you will learn absolutely nothing. And don't even get me started on the fact that this course is cross listed as a100 level course -- if this isn't a red flag, I don't know what is. This course contains 80% undergraduate students who's understanding of global health or public health is so minimal, their answers and questions will frustrate you all semester. Then, you will have to work with them for a huge presentation where you will never be able to find a common time for anyone to meet because MPH students and undergrads have NO common meeting times -- except on weekends and late evenings. There was also a completely useless and unnecessary section taught by a TA. Finally, there were many, many guest lecturers that were really terrible despite great credentials. In contrast, Barbara Bush (daughter of G.W. Bush) came and spoke and the instructors worshiped her as if she was actually qualified beyond her last name. PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE DO NOT TAKE THIS COURSE AT ANY EXPENSE IF YOU ARE AN MPH STUDENT.",
    "A good class. Somewhat disorganized in structure. The policy presentation was a TON of work, but not worth a comparable amount of the grade. This should be changed. The presentation was the biggest assignment of the class but worth only a small amount. Also, the presentation was in between the writing of the paper. Made you forget about the paper entirely, and then had to go back and complete it. Would be better to have the WHOLE paper due before the presentation with ONE final version due at the end, or the WHOLE paper due after the presentations.Also, discussion sections were not useful and exercises were super juvenile. However, Rhobhi was a wonderful TA. Would be MUCH better to eliminate discussion section, but implement TA office hours in place.",
    "I want a bit more global health so it doesn't just feel like a class on giving a good powerpoint.",
    "Just a few suggestions:- the expectations of the course assignment were sometimes unclear- the section outside of class was a total waste of time for many students, and became a burden to attend. This aspect needs to be restructured in a way that is more meaningful and efficient.",
    "I think the undergrads had the opportunity to learn a lot from the mixed classroom but that it was much less beneficial for grad students. Would have enjoyed the opportunity to scale work in the course.",
    "Strength: interdisciplinary, guest speakers, strategic thinking",
    "The strength of this class was definitely in the experience of the instructors. Each of them brought a different set of skills to the class, and that was useful in different ways.The in-class presentation was a very useful exercise as well, really making us think about the mechanics of presentation and coping under pressure.I would argue that the relative weights the presentation and final brief received in terms of the class grade did not represent proportionate amounts of work required. The demands of the presentation were higher than one could really justify for something worth such a small proportion of the overall grade.The class could be improved by tying the principles learned more closely to some of the in-class activities. Costing was a particular example of this, in which I never felt we really got to grips with how to do this properly, and so costing was something of a guessing game for both the final presentation and the brief.There was definitely some structural tension between the class wanting to be a seminar, with discussion, and also wanting to be a lecture course. I think this was one of the reasons why reading apparently wasn't always completed by allstudents."
