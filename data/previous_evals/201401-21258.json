    "The Evolution of Human Uniqueness is an unusual class. There are no exams, only weekly readings\/class discussions, three short \"critique\" papers and a final research paper. In my experience, most of the time in class was taken up by Professor Watts lecturing, which is a good thing if, like me, you're very interested in human evolution and our great ape cousins. But I wouldn't so much recommend taking this class just to get a social science credit or taking it on a total whim - if you don't have a considerable interest in things like the evolution of human cooperation, natural selection for social intelligence, why the Neanderthals went extinct, etc. then you will probably find this class boring. But if those things sound cool to you, then by all means take this class!",
    "Absolutely. Do the readings and you will learn a lot.",
    "If you are already know you are interested in Anthropology, this is a great class. Otherwise, don't take it as a filler or just because you want to take a seminar- it can get boring if the material doesn't interest you.",
    "I would only recommend this class to someone interesting in studying primates or developmental psychology. This class would not appeal the majority of students.",
    "This course will make you question what it means to be human, as well as what differentiates us from other primates and extinct hominin relatives. While the discussion we had was driven more by Professor Watts than students, I still found this course to be rewarding.",
    "I would summarize the class as a seminar-style, in-depth look at human evolutionary theory and at ideas of chimpanzee cognition. I would recommend this class to another student if they were interested either of these topics.",
    "Anth 040 is a great freshmen seminar. If you're interested in Psychology, Anthropology, and animal cognition then you should definitely take this seminar!",
    "If you are interested in evolution of humans and primate, this class will introduce you to some good books and resources to get you thinking more about it. Although the reading is good, it is very easy to get away with not keeping up with the reading.",
    "Anth 040 is a fairly laid back course that gives you what you put into it: if you participate in class and do some of the readings\/watch some videos, you will enjoy your time. If you do not participate in class, you might find yourself falling asleep"
