    "GREK 110 is definitely not for everybody. If you are looking for an easy language credit, this is not your course. If you are looking for a practical language that you can use while traveling, this is not the course for you (unless you have a time machine, of course!) However, if you are interested in the classics, Ancient Greece, or even just linguistics, GREK 110 will be intellectually stimulating. My class was only seven students, so it is an intimate learning environment where you are expected and encouraged to ask questions and engage deeply with the complex and fascinating language that is Ancient Greek. Expect 2 to 3 quizzes a week, usually 2 vocab quizzes and one grammar quiz per unit. I found the vocab quizzes to be generally easy, as long as you dedicate the time to make flashcards and memorize the principal parts of verbs and the accents on nouns (Quizlet is your friend!) The grammar quizzes were more difficult, but once again your performance is primarily a function of how much time you spend reviewing.",
    "This is of course the only way to start learning Greek, so if you want to learn ancient Greek this is the way to do it. This is a difficult language that is better for people who like languages than people looking for cultural experience, since it's a closed corpus, there isn't much speaking, and the class is all grammar and vocab. A lot of memorization, but it's satisfying work in a small class.",
    "I highly recommend this course to any student looking for an intense and rewarding study of language. The course is unique in providing the opportunity to learn a language through its grammatical structure.",
    "I would say that it is a rigorous but rewarding introduction to a very interesting ancient language. I would wholeheartedly recommend it to another student because I felt it was worth my time. The course instilled in me a true interest in Ancient Greek, and by the end, I was looking at certain passages on my own time in order to see if I could make sense of them. Thanks to the course, I could usually make an admirable start. Though it did demand a not-insignificant amount of work every week and daily meetings, I felt that the course made me feel as if I was accomplishing something through the work. I really enjoyed the course.",
    "strongly recommend this class"
