    "I learned some linear algebra with useful applications.",

    "This is a very foundational mathematics course. However, we did not learn as much as I would have liked.",
    "A pretty poor understanding of all things linear algebra. I know how to solve the problems you can throw at me by rote memorization of processes, but I don't have any clue what any of it means.",
    "!A: Yikes where to begin. THE PROFESSOR: Professor Babak Modami is a bumbling buffoon. He makes errors on the board regularly, shows up to the wrong final exam room and does not give us extra time due to his mistake. He assigns the wrong homework assignment questions and then messages us on canvas the night before its due saying that we had to do different problems. Hes unsympathetic, a rather cold-hearted person, but lacks the teaching skills to make up for it. A very poor new addition to Yales stem lecturing staff. I cant speak to the rest of the sections, but your lecturer does not matter, in fact. As awful as Modami was, just choose the most convenient time. LECTURES: youll never end up going. You skip every class because class is useless and Modami just confuses you more. Total waste. Learn through the textbook (which is amazing). HOW HARD IS IT? I actually found the material easier that math115, believe it or not. Maybe because I taught linear algebra myself through the wonderful textbook. And thats all you need. The first two midterms are very fair. The final exam was tough because he did not teach the projections\/orthogonality\/least squares material well and it was tacked on at the end. THE TEACHING ASSISTANT. Ethan Addicott is wonderful. He goes above and beyond to give you extra practice problems, solutions, and additional study resources. A serious gem. But the professor.read up on his reviews if you want more details: (http:\/\/www.ratemyprofessors.com\/ShowRatings.jsp?tid=1877941)",

    "It could go faster.",

    "We should not have spent the first half of the course covering the first chapter of the textbook. We could have afforded to move much more quickly in the beginning of the course so as to save time for more advanced concepts. I felt when the course ended that I did not receive a complete introduction to linear algebra.",

    "This course covered a good amount of material but the timing of it was a little strange. We spend the first month on very basic concepts, which felt like a waste of time. Then, when we approached much harder concepts, we sped through them.",
    "This class was fantastic in its pace and progressionI never felt overwhelmed or lost with the curriculum. I wish, however, it had covered more applications of linear algebra."

    "This course provides a good overview of linear algebra and it's applications. It doesn't delve too deep into the proofs, which for me was a little bit of a let down but for some it might be ideal. The problem sets were straightforward and the tests were adequately difficult given the material.",
    "Yesthis course was very well taught and provided me with skills that I will continue to use throughout my engineering education."
