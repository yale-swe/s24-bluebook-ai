   "comments": [
    "YES YES YES. Best class I've taken at Yale so far. Seriously, if you ever get the chance to do it, DO IT.",
    "I would certainly recommend this course, but come into it knowing that Italian food isn't central; italian LITERATURE is central to the course. That said, looking at literature through the lens of food is extremely interesting, and it leaves a lot of room for personal reflections about your own food habits. Plus, the books are interesting, and the moveis are thoroughly enjoyable!",
    "Yes, take this course! Using food as a way to look at films and literature is incredibly interesting (and fun!), but an approach that's rarely practiced at Yale. You won't need any background on Italy or Italian literature to do well, although it might be helpful if you know something about food. The workload is fair, but not light - be prepared to be researching and writing often. (Extra bonus: food is served at many class meetings, and our class had a final lunch at Skappo.)",
    "A great way to learn about Italian literature while paying attention to one of the most important parts of Italian culture (the food). Take it if you have ANY interest in Italy, food, or literature. The course name says it all.",
    "Yes!",
    "Yes. A good seminar if you are interested in food and want to learn more about Italian Lit.",
    "Great literature, great discussions, best class!",
    "This is one of the most enjoyable courses I've ever taken! I highly recommend it - all the readings are great, and the workload is affordable. Seniors - if you are looking for a little bit of something different to send you off, this is it!",
    "Yes, definitely take this course. You will be surrounded by intelligent and curious people and delving into neglected, revolutionary material and ideas.",
    "Take it! This was a really enjoyable class. The readings were very diverse but some of them are my new favorites. There are food movies which are also fun to watch. Overall, very enjoyable, and I learned something about Italian culture.",
    "Take this course! So fun and not too much work",
    "Take it...one of my favorite classes of my four years at Yale",
    "Highly recommended.",
    "An 800 year survey of Italian literature from a food perspective - it's a great concept and it's executed excellently."
