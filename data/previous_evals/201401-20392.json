   "comments": [
    "This class is basically a straight-forward language course, you will be surprised at the end by how much you have learned of the language. I would definitely recommend it to people who are interested in the Russian language or looking for an enjoyable language credit.",
    "Russian is a wonderful class because Professor Titus, the TFs, and the curriculum ensure that you not only come away with language speaking abilities, but also a much greater understanding of Russian culture. Would definitely recommend -- Russian is a very fun language, even if it is difficult at times.",
    "yahhhhhh",
    "If you're looking for a cool language to learn, pick something easier. If you're committed to learning Russian, take the intensive class. People aren't joking when they say Russian is harder than Romance or Germanic languages, and the book for this class is pretty frustrating. I don't know how much of this language I'll retain longterm.",
    "I had so much fun. Easy-going, stimulating, useful and intellectually challenging language class (in terms of Russian's case system, etc.) I definitely recommend it if you feel confident about language in general. Show up to class and do the homework and everything is really easy - don't make life hard for yourself at the exams by slacking off.",
    "I would recommend it -- only advice is for students to make sure they are committed. (see comments No.1)",
    "If you want to learn Russian quickly and can put in the effort this is a good way to do it."
