    "Important microeconomics tools",
    "A whirlwind tour of game theory and its applications. You begin to formalize game theoretic concepts in a rigorous manner, and analyze topics ranging from incomplete information to moral hazard. Almost certainly the most difficult class I've taken at Yale (although game theory is also a relative weakness of mine). Still, the range of topics covered - auctions to contracts - makes it worth it, if you're willing to put in the work.",
    "Principles of game theory and mechanism design, including analysis in problems such as auctions, public goods, nonlinear pricing, and moral hazard.",

    "I have learned how realistic social situations can be modeled and analyzed using game theory.",

   "comments": [
    "The first part was really badly organized.",
    "The lectures need to be improved. The use of slides makes more difficult to follow the lecture",
    "Good lectures, but would have preferred PDFs lecture notes during Dirk's portion of the class. (Makes following along easier.)",
    "The very beginning of the course didn't feel very well organized.",
    "Organizationally there were some challenges with this course. I think some of this has to do with trying to coordinate multiple different profs, but they should still be addressed. Students weren't made aware of when the midterm was -> Prof said \"We have a midterm next week\" and the TA had to point out that the syllabus only said \"Midterm: TBA\" TA section\/office hours could have been adjusted to better assist students with the assigned work. The course had the only scheduled office hours happening immediately AFTER the assignment was due, making them more or less worthless for asking questions about the problem sets.",
    "Strengths: Wide coverage of game theory Weaknesses: Slight disconnect between types of problems covered in class and one homework versus the exam. Doing even a few problems that resemble the exam questions would really help to nail down what is going on",
    "Strength: Problem sets are good complements of classes. We can strengthen our understanding by tackling problem sets every week.",
    "The marking scheme should be 40\/40\/20 like in micro 1. Having 50% of the mark be on the first 3 weeks of material that Ryota taught is very odd indeed (or at least have the final be 3 hours so questions on mechanism design and moral hazard aren't completely left out -seems to me that was the most important part of the class)",
    "Q3: Good broad overview of topics, repeated games were very well taught, but it seems we focused too much on basic Nash equilibrium and then sequential and trembling hand perfect were covered quickly at the end. Problem sets were sometimes so challenging that no one could get them, so maybe recalibrate. Q4: Fair exam, problem sets mostly reasonable, but class could be more engaging.",
    "Juuso and Dirk's part was underwhelming from an instructional point of view.",
    "too many instructors, too little continuity",
    "The strength of the course was that many notions were covered. The weakness was that there were three professors for one course, and this made things a little bit confusing.",
    "Just giving slightly more intuition and application of the concepts learned, and motivating some of the topics could have made a huge difference in interest and engagement."

    "Yes. The topic is really interesting and helps a lot to understand other topics",

Still, the range of topics covered - auctions to contracts - makes it worth it, if you're willing to put in the work. Do be aware that if you haven't taken game theory in the past, this class will be extremely challenging at times. I've taken game theory, and I still found it very challenging.",
    "Yes I would, if they were up to the level of math required to do well",
    "Economics students should take this course. It provides insights on how to model interactive situations in society.",
    "Yes. I learned lots of economic intuition.",
    "Yes, if you're an economist.",
    "Only other econ PhD students.",
    "Yes I would recommend it since it covers very important topics.",
    "Basically you have to take it to gain the fundamentals of econ, but I think that's a pity because it could be taught in a much more interesting and engaging way."
