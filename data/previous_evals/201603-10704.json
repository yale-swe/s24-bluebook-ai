    "I enjoyed the readings and discussions during class, and I thought it was helpful when we made lists and diagrams on the board to illustrate a certain point or idea. I thought the writing workshops were very helpful and allowed students other than the author of the paper to be engaged in the revision process. I also enjoyed the individual conferences and thought those were very helpful. Near the end of the course, we didn't follow the syllabus as strictly, so sometimes it was unclear what we had to do as readings until we received an email, which was a little stressful.",
    "i lied the size of the class and the student engagement and sharing ideas",
    "The small number of students in this class allowed for great discussions of the topics at hand. The four essays targeted different aspects of writing and helped me improve my skills in several different forms of writing."
