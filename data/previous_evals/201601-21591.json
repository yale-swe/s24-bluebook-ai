    "Take this class. Sallust has a very intriguing style, and should definitely be read and analysed if you are a Classics major.The work load is achievable. Professor Kraus is understanding and always amenable to your situation. There are 3 short papers, a midterm and a final. The course is language focused, so don't take it if you are looking for a thorough historical analysis of Sallust's era. If you love language, your going to love it!",
    "I would highly recommend Latin 433. Sallust is a difficult author, but Professor Kraus makes him much more accessible.",
    "This class is a difficult L5 Latin class. If you are super passionate about Latin, this is the class for you!",
    "If you want a course that will test your chops with a group that will most likely be composed of many grad students pursuing a PHD in this subject, then this if for you! Still, all boats raise with a rising tide!"
