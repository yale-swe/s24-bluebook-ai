    "I thought Shimi was a great teacher in that he was responsive and really cared about us learning. And boy, was he patience. However, I think he made unnecessary work for both himself and the students that did not add much to my learning. For example, writing a one page response paper every week became redundant and was useless for me. I found that if I stated my thesis as clearly as an obedient ninth grader, I would get a 9 or 10\/10. Personally, because I put in so much work studying for the quiz and getting the reading done, my responses were pretty terrible, and having read many of my classmates and listened during discussions, my classmates were pretty terrible. And poor Shimi had to read 35 of them every week. I also have issue with the final, 10 page (single spaced!) paper. This is a perfect example of how having academics teach at FES who often fail to grasp what skills will be valuable in the real world. I'm not opposed to working hard (ok, maybe a little bit), but it seems to me that there are few jobs where people are writing such large bodies of work individually. In terms of professional development, students may be better off writing a paper as a team, a series of briefing memos, or a more concise paper. In addition, I think that Shimi created more work for himself by having us turn in a half finished paper and give such extensive feedback. I think the quizzes are a useful tool in forcing students to actually read and review assignments. However, the clicker based tests were often confusing and felt like they had a \"gotchya\" component to them. It's frustrating to know the material and to get 50% on a quiz just because the questions were confusing. And as someone with learning disabilities, the multiple choice clicker based test were not ideal.",
    "Q7: Field trip to Jordan Cove is not necessary or helpful. Q3: The work isn't difficult, but is not very helpful. Too many little projects that didn't seem to join together very well. The amount of extra class time assigned (1 field trip and 8 hours during reading week) was unreasonable. Anything that can't be covered in 4 hours a week is too much, even for 4 credit hours.",
    "Need to make a decision about quizzing students on weekly content versus assigning response papers. These assignments felt more burdensome than possibly intended by the instructor. A good solution might be to shorten the response paper requirement to 3-4 two page or 1 page responses.",
    "no question",
    "This course was touted as a more advanced version of S2S but too often the speed and content of the course was designed for people with no background on the material at all. The class size needs to be trimmed and made more interesting for people with more invested backgrounds.",
    "Water resource management is a broad, complex topic. It is ambitious to try and cover everything in one semester. Shimi does a great job of complementing his scientific expertise and academic approach with guest speakers that are practitioners working in a number of different areas.",
    "My favorite class of the semester! This class provides the base knowledge needed to understand water management challenges around the world. Its a broad class, but your final project allows you to narrow in on issues especially important to you.",
    "Shimi is an excellent professor. I would have liked to have more exposures and discussion about the specific factors that need to be considered when managing water resources in developing and developed countries.",
    "Related to questions 1\/2\/3 - Shimi assigned some great readings that were very useful to supplement lectures. However, I think the class design was exceedingly onerous. A 4 hour lecture once a week is too much. On top of that we had many different small assignments, quizzes, discussion write-ups, and readings, which confused the course. It was hard to know when things were due and very easy to feel overloaded. I am not opposed to quizzes, but I think these quizzes could have been used more effectively. For instance, if the goal is to make sure students do the reading, then the quiz should be on the day the reading is due not the following week. It just seemed like Shimi was trying to fit too much material into one class period that was already excessively long. If he really wants to have all of these pieces, then consider having class meet twice a week. It was too much at times, which only encourage you to check out on some assignments.",
    "There were too many weekly response. After a few, it seemed like I was struggling to write anything new or different. I appreciated the mid-point deadline for the final paper, this was very helpful in getting the work done as well as redirecting my focus as needed. Shimi provides feedback on everything that is submitted, to every student. I was astounded at this fact. He cares enough to challenge the students to get better and is a resource to facilitate learning. I feel like the class would have been more discussion based if it was capped at 25. Discussion sessions in class were great to have with the same group of people, for continuities sake, but you also miss out on the ideas of people outside your group."

   "comments": [
    "By far, Shimi and the guest lecturers. For the most part, the people bought in were great and had interesting things to say. And it was good to hear from people who are working on these issues in the real world setting.",
    "Shimi is an excellent professor and knows the subject inside-out.",
    "Shimi is a great teacher and puts a lot of effort introducing variety into each class section and maximizing learning opportunities. The course leads off nicely from Science to Solutions and keeps some of the technical skills you may be learning in perspective. Students have varied interests and I think that benefits the course. The design of the course is such that each week focuses on a different topic in water management, so you may be a subject matter expert on one and know nothing regarding others. Discussion sections make this obvious and they ended up being an important place to trade perspectives.",
    "The instruction was wonderful; lectures were very engaging, and the guest speakers were all interesting.",
    "Shimi put a lot of effort into the lectures and structure of each class. He varied the activities, lectures and assessments in a way that helps cement what is being taught.",
    "Shimi's lectures are great - informative and clear. Guest lectures were also very helpful in getting different perspectives on some of the same issues.",
    "Very good class discussions (during lecture, not during student discussion). Great lectures. Very diverse topics and case studies that didn't just focus on instructor's interests or CT waterways.",
    "I really appreciated the chance to get a broad overview of water resources management, and Shimi's lectures were very comprehensive and engaging - I feel like I came away with a much stronger big-picture framework for the field.",
    "Shimi is a wonderful lecturerer; his lessons are always well though out and he clearly puts a lot of effort into helping students really understand the content of his material.",
    "Teacher, readings, and class discussion",
    "Lecturer engaged, provides a ton of feedback -- much more than the average professor at FES",
    "Shimi's knowledge on variety of subjects. Covered broad range of topics. Enjoyed guest speakers (most of them)",
    "I loved Shimi's book and the fact that we had weekly response papers and discussions. A very good way to learn from not on your instructor but also guest lecturers and classmates.",
    "No final with a final paper really allowed students to find their own interests.",
    "I really enjoyed the guest speakers and lectures. Also, through discussion groups and question\/answer periods, I enjoyed learning about my classmates- where they've worked, their perspectives, and areas of interest.",
    "Weekly discussions, final project, field trips, SHIMI!",
    "Shimi structured the class well, with a mix of outside speakers, lectures, and discussions.",
    "The breadth of the course was great -- it gave me a chance to look at several aspects of water management that I hadn't been exposed to before. I also really enjoyed hearing my classmates views during discussions. The final paper added depth to the course, which I thought was a nice compliment to the breadth of the topics covered.",
    "The guest lectures really grounded the course material. I also enjoyed writing the responses every week to help process my thoughts and opinions.",
    "Readings from the book Readings on India and regions outside of America. The inclusion of countries outside the US was well appreciated.",
    "Guest lectures that corresponded with the lecture topic of the week.",
    "Shimi course content",
    "Many of the speakers offered great real world experience that enhanced the material. Two field trips were great. Very different but perfectly in line with what we were learning about. 3 would be too may. 1 would be enough.",
    "Shimi is a remarkably dedicated professor who truly cares about student learning. To me, the best part of the course is trusting that Shimi has carefully prepared, evaluated, and pruned his materials to his discretion and knowing that he cares-- there's nothing superfluous about it, and plans will flex as appropriate. I also really appreciated being held to submitting weekly response papers; it seems fair to have to offer 600 coherent words to help digest the week's materials and field trips, and for me, really did help to synthesize and expand my takes on the materials presented. It felt like a genuine opportunity to hold a conversation with Shimi, which is a real privilege!"

   "question_text": "What aspects of this course need the most improvement?",
   "comments": [
    "The class is really meant for 20 people max. We had around 35, and that made for some difficulties. I would recommend capping the class at a more reasonable number the next time its taught. The four hour block class has its advantages, but I think they are outweighed by what students lose from this format. The material covered in this class was important for my career and simply interesting, yet it was hard to stay interested after hour three. I don't think material covered in the final hour was absorbed as effectively as material covered in the first three hours. I would seriously consider breaking up the class into more manageable sessions. Maybe 3 hours each week, with a separate second session scheduled for every other week.",
    "Level of material. A lot of commentary on how it would not be a \"back to basics\" class but it seemed to frequently be back to basics. I think it could work well as a part-guided reading class with a detailed read of 1-2 papers each week and a focused discussion just on the merits and issues in those papers. Obviously this requires a smaller class, which is the next point... Class size. Way too many people for a course such as this one. I understand how it ended up so large but it's simply too many bodies for concise and in depth discussion. Optimal size seems ~20.",
    "See above I think the discussions (and response papers) were a bit forced. It felt as if we were having the same conversation every week. Maybe we could have the discussions every other week or something. And the quizzes - they were hard. And because I spent so much time prepping for the quizzes, I rarely had time to read the current week's reading.",
    "The timing- this class is WAY too long. There is no way that I can sit and focus in a classroom for 4 hours. Any way to split it up or shorten it would be great. I do like having it once a week, but the timing is just too long. Also, scheduling so much during reading week (8ish hours), was quite problematic for getting work done for other classes.",
    "The four-hour format can feel overly long for some. Quizzes on old material are sometimes confusing.",
    "The course had students work on a paper throughout the semester on a water management topic of their choosing. I appreciated the leeway provided students on selecting a topic and the support Shimi provided during the semester. For the future, it would be interesting for Shimi to provide topics that could be students can complete for a client should a student want to work on a client-based assignment for the semester. Within FES some departments more than others provide students the opportunity to interface with clients for semester long projects (such as Industrial Ecology and Forestry). There are fewer opportunities for water classes.",
    "The material for each class was WAY too disjointed and didn't make sense. Having a guest lecture talk about one topic, finish a lecture on another, and quiz on something from 2 weeks ago was way too broad. I felt like we had to keep shifting gears instead of digging into material for a good chunk of time. The quizzes made no sense. The questions were oddly specific and from material that was covered weeks ago. The guest lectures didn't apply very well to the material for instructor lectures. It seemed like a parade of invitations that didn't really need to be there. Especially when most students when to their seminars outside of class.",
    "This may be beyond anyone's control, but the visiting speakers could be very hit or miss.",
    "I think it would have been nice to read more primary research on the content covered in the class; while this was a management course vs science, it would have been helpful to go more in depth into some topics.",
    "Assignments too prescribed. This is a graduate course not an undergraduate. Too many assignments felt like tasks which is not appropriate. Ultimately, I think the final case studies could be much stronger, but students spend too much time on response papers\/quiz prep. Quizzes questions are also very difficult. Especially problematic where the 8 answer long questions, which were confusing, tricky, and should be vetted before class.",
    "Better field trip design, engaging nearby corporations (industrial waste water) etc",
    "The classes were long - but I still enjoyed them. Would be better as a morning class.",
    "The course definitely became a lot about the California water crisis. As important as the matter is, there should be an effort to talk about other international water issues as well. Guest lectures got a little boring sometimes.",
    "More tailoring of guest speakers to student interests. Too often it was a lecture rather than a discussion.",
    "Less quizzes and response papers would be nice but I also believe these tools have their value and helped me learn the material. Also, as many water resource issues are not scientific problems but people problems, I would have liked to hear a speaker that has conducted a social science or anthropological study related to a water resource issue.",
    "I think the amount of hours we are in class can be reduced... especially during reading week.",
    "Despite how well Shimi structured the time, four hours of class is too much. I would consider breaking up the class sessions over two days.",
    "I thought the quizzes forced me to read the class readings more deeply, and helped to break up the class, but I think they should be a smaller proportion of our final grade.",
    "1. It should be made clear at the beginning of the class and perhaps during shopping period that this class is not a practical skills learning class. The name of the class suggests that one is going to learn how to manage water resources or at least be exposed to the tools needed to do this. 2. The final paper should be part of the class. People should have the time during class to discuss challenges arising in their case studies. 3. The final may be better as a group project where members can analyze or consciously used the various tools needed in water resources management. 4. There should be more inclusion of other countries 5. Care should be given to the perpetuation of some racial stereotypes. 6. There should be the inclusion of positive images from developing countries as well. Not just those that",
    "The lecture time and required field trips combined to exceed four hours of class time per week (or four credits). This combined with the large amount of work outside of class and the weekly quizzes made this an excessively demanding course.",
    "the organization of materials and assignments - too much, too varied, and inconsistent",
    "4 hours is tough, but given the design it seemed necessary.",
    "It's hard for many (myself included!) to sit still for 4 hours, but I strongly preferred the block schedule. It's also tricky to cover such a range of topics in 13 weeks, but there aren't too many ways around this."

    "It is a large time commitment, but also might be the best course you take this semester. Get started on your case study early.",
    "Definitely take it.",
    "Read the material. Work on your project paper early. Try to keep up with the disjointed nature of lectures and writeups.",
    "If you're interested in water, definitely recommended!",
    "Take it and expect to put in a lot of time.",
    "Take it! Shimi is the best.",
    "Make sure that you pick a challenging final project (something you haven't personally studied before) because that is where you are going to learn the most",
    "If you have any interest in water resource management, take this course. Just don't expect to go too deeply into any one water resource management issue but to get a broad overview of the complexity of many issues. Your final project does allow you to focus and go deeper on an area of interest. Also, be ready to dedicate some time and energy to this course as the workload is consistent.",
    "TAKE IT!",
    "Keep up on the weekly reflections papers and time the readings to the quizzes (as opposed to doing them one week in advance).",
    "This class should be taken by anyone who has an interest in water in almost any capacity.",
    "It is an excellent course to take if you want to be exposed to American policy, law and practice around water resources. It is not a course to take if you are expecting to gain a skill from it. It is not a course to take if you would like to be exposed to positive water management in other countries.",
    "If you have any interest in water at any level or location on the globe, build your schedule around this class.",
    "Though this course requires some discipline and student accountability ([somewhat] inescapable weekly reading\/writing\/quizzes\/discussion)... isn't that part of what we're here to hone? It's absolutely worth it. I sincerely appreciated Shimi's approach to the material, communication style, and commitment to individuals' learning. Thank you, Shimi!"
