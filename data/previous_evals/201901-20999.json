    "Good discussion and a good instructor. The textbook was frustrating at times and the grading harsh on occasion. The emails with a German student were also not useful at all and did not help me at all with learning better writing skills. I'd prefer reading a newspaper article and discussing it in class.",
    "Strengths: class takes place every day, instructors really care, small class sizes make for more practice Weaknesses: we kind of rush through the textbook to get everything done when we should probably just focus on the more important material and leave the unnecessary material out",
    "A strength of the course is that I learnt a lot about the German culture while also learning more about the German language. Other strengths of the course are that there were many extracurricular activities offered by the German department that allowed me to improve my grade and practice my German more outside class time. Weaknesses of the course is that sometimes the flow of assignments were a little too heavy."
