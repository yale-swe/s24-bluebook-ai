    "It's great because you get to work on your own project in biomedical engineering. You probably have to take it since the only reason you would be checking it out is if you are a BME major. It's a good way to determine if you want to pursue grad school after college.",
    "Yes, take it if you are interested in doing research. Pick a professor and lab that you are interested in though, because that determines how happy you will be..",
    "It is an independent research class."
