    "I learnt to read, write and speak elementary Spanish. I was exposed to Latin America culture.",

    "I gained a basic proficiency in speaking and reading spanish.",
    "I learned a lot of spanish. I definitely feel that my spanish background is solid.",
    "I gained an understanding of elementary grammar and intermediate sentence structure in Spanish. I also learned a fair amount of basic, useful vocabulary.",
    "Basics of Spanish",
    "I learned the basics of Spanish.",
    "By taking this course I learned how to participate in a small classroom setting, that you need to have the confidence to talk in front of your peers and not care what they think. I also, obviously, improved my Spanish skills.",
    "In this course you learn from the very basics of spanish up to learning extensive and varied vocabulary."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strength: very frequent Weakness: the novelita was too challenging for us and took us too much time to read through and understand",
    "I think more mandatory translations of readings would help ingrain the vocabulary better. Other than that, I thought the course was structured well.",
    "They could find better ways to help students learn the language rather than just memorize the material for one test.",
    "I think it would be better if we spoke more, as I think that speaking is undoubtedly the hardest part of learning a language.",
    "The strengths of this course were the ability to speak and hold conversation in class and meeting every day. One weakness was that we moved so quickly that we never really got to practice as much as we should in class on sentence formation day by day.",
    "The pace is too fast. Expectations were high. But that's why we are here I guess..",
    "Strengths: The material was well organized in terms of learning the grammar in a step-by-step setting. Weaknesses: The class was big for a language course. There was not much space to do speaking exercises. The placement was not done well, there were people who had Spanish classes their entire high school life yet they started in L1.",
    "It felt very cookie-cutter like, the whole \"everything is already planned\" was very different from what I imagined college courses to be like.",
    "A con is that this course moves very fast. It would be nice if we could spend more time on difficult concepts, but I understand that there isn't really time for that. However, a pro is that most professors have office hours which can be utilized to elaborate more on these concepts. Another pro is that we do activities outside of the textbook, such as listening to Spanish songs and learning about soccer player from latin American countries.",
    "There should be more in class speaking."

   "comments": [
    "Take this course if you want to learn Spanish.",
    "Yes. If you plan on making Spanish the language you want to extensively study in college, then this is a great starting point.",
    "Yes, but only if you plan on using Spanish.",
    "Yes. This is a great introductory course to becoming a polyglot! If that is your thing, of course.",
    "Yes I would recommend to anyone interested in beginning to learn Spanish.",
    "Only if they need the requirement or want to major in Spanish",
    "If you are interested in learning the language, this is a really good start. The curriculum is designed to make you study on a regular basis, but the work load is not unrealistic. The first few weeks are hard if you do not know any Spanish, because even though this is an L1 class there are people who come with prior knowledge (I guess the placement exams are not always working as expected). But once you realize you actually start understanding the language, it is really fun.",
    "Spanish is a very useful language. Ten out of ten, would recommend.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course. I thought the amount if work was appropriate for what level the class and I had fun in the class.",
    "Take the course if you want to start learning Spanish from the beginning, and be able to successfully carry on a meaningful conversation in Spanish by the end of the term."
