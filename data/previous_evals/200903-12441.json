   "comments": [
    "Great course. Certainly a thought-provoking class, and interesting. It started out slow, but quickly picked up as it went along. There were some guest lecturers who definitely are some of most interesting people I've ever met. Be prepared to read and write, if you are getting a writing credit. Don't be too scared though, the readings are usually not too bad, and the papers are fairly easy. I would recommend this course to any student who enjoys intelligent discussions and finds himself wondering what a genius really is.",
    "Study of Da Vinci, Shakespeare, Newton, Mozart, and also discussions about evolution of the word genius&what facilitates its development. Very little to do with music, though.Yes, it is a good introduction to important Western thinkers and good overview of neurological basis of intelligence&abnormalities like autism; also Craig Wright has helpful tips on writing",
    "Nature of Genius is a class that will give you a mental exercise, and not that many new insights. Be warned that Professor Wright (if he teaches the course) can rather inflexible with his views on the definition of genius, and grades accordingly. For a writing class, there isn't that much writing, but there is a lot of reading. The guest lecturers for the most part are very interesting, particularly the Shakespearean actor, the neuro-psychologist, and the business expert.",
    "Yes.If you're interested in the subject at all, take it.I really enjoyed reading\/learning\/discussing about da Vinci, Shakespeare, Newton and Mozart - the readings aren't like other readings, they're really interesting!",
    "I do not recommend this class.The material is interesting initially but the discussions are useless and go in circles. The novelty of reading about geniuses will have worn off within the first three weeks and the rest will drag on and on.Conclusion: Skip this course, it's just not worth it. You can benefit far greater just by taking out the two best books of the readings, \"Extraordinary Minds\" by Howard Gardner and \"Shakespeare: Invention of the Human\" by Harold Bloom. Good luck!",
    "it might be better to think about this class as a collection of biographies of famous geniuses instead of about genius itself. if that description interests you, then I would recommend this class. if you are looking for a definitive answer about the nature of genius, you will not find it here, though you will learn a lot about genius.",
    "I would highly recommend this course. It provides fascinating opportunities for studying both general theories about what defines genius and for exploring case studies of individuals ranging from Shakespeare to Newton to Mozart. We also had numerous guest speakers \u0097 experts in their various fields \u0097 come and talk to us, which was another highlight of the class. There was a lot of reading, but most of it was quite interesting and felt very worthwhile. The papers are also very manageable and most of them are on the shorter side.",
    "The course material is fascinating and the professor is good. The guest lecturers are, with maybe one or two notable exceptions, INTERESTING and entertaining. Some days can drag, but that may be because the students in my section were not particularly inspired. Do NOT take this class for a real answer about what the nature of genius is; it's more about the critical thinking involved in defining something as abstract as \"genius.\"",
    "This class is a interdisciplinary exploration of the nature of genius, just as its title suggests. By studying case studies of genius in diverse fields such as art, science, andplaywriting, we form our own personal definition of genius. If you agree with Professor Wright's idea of genius, it's a good class, but if not it can get a bit frustrating."
