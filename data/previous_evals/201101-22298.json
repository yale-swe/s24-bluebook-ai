    "I would recommend this class to another student. I think the strength is in the subject material and the Professor's familiarity with it. These two things really helped the class be more engaged. Another thing that was really helpful was that it was a lecture of only ~13 people. This made it easy to have impromptu discussions or do group work in class, while still maintaining a lecture format.However, I also feel like we didn't end the class having reached our goal, which was to learn AfAm Women's History up through present day. But, I still think it was worth it even if we didn't wind up where we originally planned.As for the workload, it wasn't too bad at all. The reading could be a bit much at times, but you only have to read one of the articles in order to write the weekly response. And you learn about the others through class discussion and seciton. It's still good to review them for the midterm, but it's not anything unmanageable. Get started on the final project early though. It's not something you want to be doing the night before it's due.",
    "Great class to take if you are at all interested in AMERICAN history.... it is important to understand this history in order to fully understand the bigger picture, and Prof Feimster does it in such an excellent way",
    "great intro class. everyone should take it, especially if you want a new vantage point on af-am history.",
    "This was an amazing course! Please take it!! Professor Feimster is a wonderful professor, definitely one of my top two fave profs over my four years at Yale. It was the perfect way to end my time here. It's a survey history course focusing on Black Women's History. Really makes you think about the ways that the historical oppression of Black women continues in the present day. Helps you think about the ways Black women's oppression relates and intersects with other oppression.",
    "I definitely recommend this class for any other student. It was great to get a narrowed African American history. I've taken other AfAm classes but this one spoke directly to me. The projects were pretty fun and the midterm was definitely doable. no sweat.",
    "Review of important movements in the history of African American Women. I would recommend this course. Crystal Feimster is brilliant, and her TA's work well to enhance what she says in class.",
    "African American Women's History is about the representations of African American women in the 18th and 19th centuries. The professor is very sweet, reading are not always interesting, and the course lacks structure and some direction."
