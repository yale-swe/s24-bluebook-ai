    "Wrapping up in a timely manner; with the very busy schedules that typify FES student life, it is frustrating to have to stay 20 minutes or more after each class, or be forced to walk out while the professor is still talking.",
    "More organization during the seminar. Some times we received the reading one night before the class. I would like to know with more time to prepare for the class.",
    "the course is often run by UN schedule. although that is understandable given the set up of the course, I think having a more structured outline of the course is useful.",
    "If started sooner (i.e., at the very beginning of the semester), students could get even more out of the internship placements. Getting these logistics sorted out could improve the classroom experience too, as it's much easier to understand UN protocol once you're sat in on a meeting."

    "Consider that some times the time devoting to the internship might be too much, compared to other courses work load.",
    "participate in class discussions actively.",
    "Try to get your internship started immediately, and put a lot into it. The more you put into it, the more you'll get out. Students who started with their Missions full time after finals let out (in the spring) got much more out of their overall experience."
