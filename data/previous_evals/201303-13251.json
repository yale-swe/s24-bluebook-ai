   "comments": [
    "I absolutely would recommend this course to anyone. The readings and papers were intriguing and extremely manageable, for one. I think it's important to have free time to simply marinate on readings and to think. Professor Mayhew's class made this a possibility. We would read a book or so each week and then discuss it after his brief introduction. I felt as though I got a great first glance into some aspects of American politics, especially APD, that I hadn't received previously. Moreover, the course was heavily geared towards recent work, which as a first-year-PhD student, was extremely useful.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to others, especially the first years in the department.",
    "Great introduction to major areas of American politics.",
    "I would highly recommend it for anyone interested in American politics. It is a course that provides a wide-ranging introduction to the field, and does so in an entertaining fashion.",
    "I would absolutely recommend it. This was an experience no one should miss out on (as evidenced by the number of people from fields other than American who took the course)."

    "I was able to place this course into contact with my other classes and concentrations. The discussion alone was extremely useful in establishing a voice for myself in classes.",
    "I think a larger percentage of the readings could have been ones that will appear on the American qualifying exam.",
    "As a political theorist, it is important and interesting to take courses in the other subfields in political science and this was an excellent course in American Politics.",
    "I especially appreciated the works in the field of American Political Development that we covered.",
    "The course gave me a first insight into the field of American politics and introduced me to some of the landmark books inthis area."
