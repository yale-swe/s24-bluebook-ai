    "Instructor: Timothy Michael Terway \u00a0Absolutely wonderful",
    "Instructor: Timothy Michael Terway \u00a0Tim was really well organized and integral to guiding the class along. He was also very accessible outside of class and I really liked speaking with him about concepts that I found very complex and needed help breaking them down.",
    "Instructor: Timothy Michael Terway \u00a0Strengths: thoughtfully and clearly translated Susan's remarks in a easy to understand way. Weakness: sometimes portrayed material in an exclusive way.",
    "Instructor: Timothy Michael Terway \u00a0Tim is straightforward, hilarious, perceptive, and brilliant. He kept our class on track. He has high expectations of students but is always kind and generous with his time, and endlessly receptive to questions. He really helped me learn how to maintain an actively open mind. Should he choose to pursue it, he will make a really wonderful professor someday.",
    "Instructor: Timothy Michael Terway \u00a0Tim was generally excellent. I appreciated his availability and willingness to discuss in depth concepts only lightly touched on in class. The comments below are intended to help him improve, given that he is already a very promising teacher. Tim could improve his teaching mostly in the class room setting (he is, as noted above, very helpful one-on-one). In the classroom, Tim has a tendency to dilute the core of his message by frequently alluding to its importance, sophistication, or erudition -- this gets in the way of actually teaching the core idea. Similarly, Tim can dominate classroom discussion by lecturing in a way that does not invite questions. This is a tricky concept because it is not tied to whether or not he solicits questions (which he makes a clear effort to do), but rather to the way that he comports himself as a speaker. In a nutshell, I think Tim is so eager to offer his own answers to student questions that the actual process of questioning on the student's end can be curtailed."

   "comments": [
    "Sometimes the teaching style was not conducive to learning (long, dry lectures with little discussion or case study examples), but I think that both Tim and Susan have been very receptive to student feedback regarding this. I also think Susan might help the class by listening more to students input and concerns...sometimes it feels like she talks over us.",
    "This class was the most important course I have taken at Yale FES. It helped me to understand what policy is... and how to understand the process in its entirety. I am excited to have this in my pocket as I move forward with my career. Much for the material seems like common sense... but has a way of being really hard to talk about.",
    "This course is extremely useful as a whole. The framework that it introduces is valuable, and Susan and Tim have done a very good job getting to the meat of it in a single semester such that students walk away with a complete skill set ready for application. No other course I have taken this semester does such a good job providing a thorough, actionable, foundation in a novel skill. Tim and Susan are both generally excellent teachers in my experience. I found both very willing to answer questions outside of class and provide the support and resources I needed to master the concepts being taught. Question 11: The greatest area for improvement here is in the tenor of the course. Susan and Tim both spend a lot of time promoting the importance and utility of their ideas... this is not necessary in my view--the quality of the content speaks for itself--and the frequent promotion detracts from the quality of their teaching."

    "Dr. Clark is responsible for an incredibly useful course that has no equivalent at FES and for allowing for a wonderfully communal and inclusive feeling in the classroom. However, she often cuts students off halfway through their questions in a way that seems really antithetical to the philosophy of respect and inclusion that she preaches.",
    "The classroom component of this course is its weakest. As mentioned earlier, I feel that the utility of the policy sciences is evident to students as they begin to master it. Relative to the case study, discussion groups, and homework exercises, I felt that the classroom sessions were relatively less useful, principally because of the amount of time spent promoting the ideas being covered rather than focusing solely on teaching them. Even so, the classroom component of this course still compares favorably to the classroom component of similar courses I took this semester."

Several of my other courses were quantitative, 'hard-skills' based, and I wanted to make sure my mind stayed open to different ways of thinking. I took the class during my first semester and I think it will provide a great base from which to approach future courses, projects, and environmental problems.",
