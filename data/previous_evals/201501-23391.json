   "comments": [
    "great topics generally would like to see more about health innovation and technology",
    "Extremely competent instructor. Easy to follow even for non health students Really looked forward to this class",
    "Strengths: Clearly outlined, well taught, many great outside resources, consistent Weakness: A bit long to concentrate fully, but I understand where Skolnik is coming from. He trains up from DC, so who am I to say it is too long?",
    "A very good introduction to global health. I wish we could go deeper into some of the topics, but I understand there isn't enough time in the semester to cover everything.",
    "Great seminar in global health. covers a lot of interesting topics",
    "The course provides a good overview of global health topics in a comprehensive way. Those who finish the course have a good understanding of working in a global health context, and an idea of the current issues affecting development. However, it was difficult at times to sit through the full 3 hours--this is not a fault of the class itself, but more the fact that it's hard to absorb that much information especially in the evening.",
    "I understand why the course was so broad, but it would have been nice to go a little more in depth. Covering accidents, mental health, and NTDs in one day is a little difficult.",
    "Critical issues in GH is a course I would recommend every student should take. All the topics covered were very valuable. I enjoyed the lectures by guest lecturers.",
    "Great overview of difficult big picture ideas",
    "The course is very helpful in understanding the most important issues in the area of Global Health. It helped me to become much more confident in this area.",
    "Really interesting subject matter and taught well. 3 hours in a row is a little long, though. Could have a longer break in the middle if able to do so without sacrificing content?",
    "Wonderful course in global health. Provides in depth information and highly relevant readings. It is imperative to do the readings to get the most out of the class. This has been my favorite class thus far at YSPH.",
    "This course was a great introduction to what it actually means to work in global health. Out of all of my courses, this course was the most critical in synthesizing what I've learned into unified practice. It was very effective in teaching useful frameworks and thought processes for looking at global health issues. I only wish that the level of professor-student interaction at the beginning of the semester carried through to the end. I found that as the semester went by, the class become more lecture-based and less discussion-based.",
    "Great way to \"dive in\" to global health - the language, the goals, and the strategies were made very clear. Guest speakers active in the field shed light on what global health work looks like on the ground, and presentation exercises in class helped us engage with the material.",
    "I do think the discussion-based set up of the class is a good way to teach the material. However, I found the cold-call questioning is stressful and I think there are times that the question could be better and more fully explained, with a couple of examples of the issue at hand, or potential example answers. There were several times that students were confused about what was asked, and didn't have time to think through an answer. I think more time is needed for the question to sink in before the class can begin rapid firing responses. Doesn't have to be long time, just pause and repeat the question, clear up any confusions, and then ask for responses. I liked the policy brief assignments, I think they are a good way to delve into a specific country, and writing in this format is a useful skill to have. Quicker feedback would be appreciated though.",
    "I think that there was a lot of breadth in this course but not a lot of depth. Many of the concepts had overlapped with things discussed in other classes such as Health Policy. I am not sure how much new information I got out of the course. Also, I think it would be cool if we could share policy briefs. I would have really liked to read some of the other briefs. Maybe you could select the five best briefs and share them or something to that effect.",
    "Strengths: comprehensive overview of several topics in global health; coverage of a decent level of depth in certain pressing topic areas; policy briefs provide the opportunity to explore three different countries in three different regions of the world in terms of their public health; interactive and interesting nature of the course itself Weaknesses: tons of readings that take a lot of time to get through (keeping in mind that there are other courses students are taking); the lectures, while structured in an appropriate way for 3 hours, are long (perhaps have two lectures in one week?) Suggestion: incorporation of \"comparative health systems\" into the curriculum\/as a more significant portion of the course?",
    "This course is quite interesting but would have liked us to do case studies and brainstorm how we would go about addressing these issues.",
    "Overall, I was severely disappointed with the quality of this course. Skolnik has a reputation for being a challenging, but rewarding, professor, but his class fell short of my expectations. His cold-call style of lecture is promising in theory, but was poorly executed. Skolnik values a students ability to memorize and regurgitate worthless statistics, which I personally do not think is indicative of a persons intelligence. None of the information presented in class was earth-shattering, and it was usually just common sense (i.e. malnourished children are more likely to get sick and die). Both the course as a whole and each individual lecture were poorly organized. He often used very specific, anecdotal examples that really wont prove useful to us in the long run. Rather than say such-and-such is something that you all should look into before graduating from YSPH, Id much rather he spend time in lecture discussing these monumental public health breakthroughs himself. In the end, I dont think this course contributed anything to my public health education at Yale.",
    "Writing policy briefs was very benefitial for my career. The lectures late a night seemed too long at times."

    "Instructor: Richard L Skolnik \u00a0Professor Skolnik is very resourceful, and will go out of his way to be helpful. He is always willing to meet outside of class to give career advice, or even just chat.The guest speakers he brings in are experts in their field, and offer a great perspective on things.",
    "Instructor: Richard L Skolnik \u00a0One of the best instructor in public health!",
    "Instructor: Richard L Skolnik \u00a0Professor Skolnik is a great professor and a great resource for working in global health settings. It is clear that he cares about his students and their future successes, which can be unusual at a research university. His insights after working in the field were also quite valuable.",
    "Instructor: Richard L Skolnik \u00a0Professor Skolnik was great at responding to emails. I did like how he asked questions to students in class.",
    "Instructor: Richard L Skolnik \u00a0Incredible lecturer, can come off as a bit self-righteous but in a way, it's merited; has great insight into the global health world and is more than happy to help you benefit from his knowledge and connections if you take the time to meet with him",
    "Instructor: Richard L Skolnik \u00a0Professor Skolnik has enormouse experience in the field, he taught in the very interactive manner which helped to digest the material. It was great to be in this class.",
    "Instructor: Richard L Skolnik \u00a0Really engaging lecturer and obviously very dedicated to his students.",

    "Instructor: Richard L Skolnik \u00a0great interactive class",
    "Instructor: Richard L Skolnik \u00a0Professor Skolnik genuinely cares that each of his students progresses throughout the semester. His willingness to go above and beyond in meeting with students, providing advice, and facilitating connections is extremely commendable.",
    "Instructor: Richard L Skolnik \u00a0Professor Skolnik is very engaging and enthusiastic and draws from his previous experience very well. Always clear about the goals of each assignment and take-home points from the readings. He also brought in a variety of amazing guest speakers. Outside of class, he made himself accessible and was very open to meeting with students. His feedback on our individual paths to working in global health was valuable, and he does seem very invested in his students.",
    "Instructor: Richard L Skolnik \u00a0Has a lot of general knowledge in the different aspects of global health, and often can bring someone in who is an expert in certain fields to speak to the class. I appreciate that he has practical experience in this field and is not purely an academic. Keeps your attention for three hours, and over dinner time, so I think that's the sign of a good professor.",
    "Instructor: Richard L Skolnik \u00a0Prof. Skolnik is truly a \"God\" of global health and it is just an honor and privilege to be given the opportunity to learn from someone this great. I enjoyed the fact that he was very engaging and made his lectures interactive, though at first that was a little scary. I believe that the fact that he enjoys teaching showed really well throughout the course.",
    "Instructor: Richard L Skolnik \u00a0Quite a knowledgeable professor and its nice to be able to hear his expertise on issues.",
    "Instructor: Richard L Skolnik \u00a0Take Charlie Sheens ego, scale it up and you have Floyd Mayweather's ego, scale it up again and you get Kanye West's ego, and finally scale it up again and you have Richard Skolnik's ego. The man may not have a PhD, but he sure is an expert in blowing his own horn. He spent a significant portion of each lecture bragging about his former life at the World Bank and name dropping the \"gods and goddesses\" of various global health fields as if they still exchange holiday cards. If I had a dollar for every time Skolnik mentioned a) his doctor son, b) his 3rd edition textbook, c) his World Bank friends, or d) a culturally\/racially\/sexually inappropriate comment, Id have enough money to feed all the starving, sick children of the world we should have actually been learning about. He is apparently completely oblivious to the fact that instructing his female guest lecturers to refer to him as Respected Sir while not extending the same courtesy to his male guests is extremely sexist, chauvinistic, and insulting. Whenever quoting his friends from around the world, he would put on his best African or Asian accent and\/or try to speak the given language in an attempt to awe us with his worldly knowledge. His butchered attempts to assimilate to other cultures are inappropriate coming from a moderately educated white male, and I am shocked that no one has pointed this out over his 65 years of privileged existence. I was dumbfounded when he spent weeks bragging about his dear friend Dr. Sadia Chowdhury, but when she actually came in to talk to our class, he frequently interrupted her, corrected her, and spoke over her. I didnt find many of his guest interviews particularly useful, but they were certainly a welcome break from listening to Skolnik boast about himself for 3 hours straight. Ironically, he once spent 30 minutes telling the class that after reading undergraduate cover letters, he realized that Yale students have overinflated egos and think too highly of themselves. He told us to recognize that we are not unique or valuable in any way, and that we should refrain from referring to ourselves as such when applying for jobs. Weve all also heard his lecture on Yalies reputation for tardiness numerous times, which was his rationale for a very strict 11:59pm due date. However, he failed to return these same papers within his set time frame, as within one week gradually turned into three weeks for all three papers. Overall, I found the mans ego insufferable and the class useless, and I am in awe that Yale has permitted him to carry on like this for so long.",
    "Instructor: Richard L Skolnik \u00a0Most inspiring instructor at ysph thus far."

    "A great course for understanding and conceptualizing health on a global scale.",
    "This class is a must for anyone interested in global health!",
    "The course covered health systems in different countries, access to health services (equity vs. equality), major causes of morbidity and mortality by region, maternal morbidity and mortality, under-five morbidity mortality, and other topics like malaria, tuberculosis, HIV, mental health and road traffic accidents. I am not sure if I would recommend this course to a fellow student.",
    "Take it- you won't be disappointed in the lecturing or the insight you will gain",
    "I would definitely recommend this course, i believe it should be mandatory for all students involved in public health and other cross-sectional disciplines.",
    "Highly recommend for anyone interested in global health. Provided a great foundation in global health with a leader in the field.",
    "great class highly recommend it",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. I think that if you're interested in working in global health, it is absolutely essential to take this course. And really, the issues that we're addressing as public health students are all globally relevant. I think the class is invaluable to anyone studying public health or medicine.",
    "A good survey of key issues in global health. Although most of us intuitively know what the issues are, its nice to be able to lay everything out and go through the steps of what problems arise, why they arise, and what solutions are available. The whole course assumes you are an advisor to policymakers which is a bit of a leap to make, but its a useful perspective to have. A lot of great speakers are brought in, and its helpful to hear about their experiences. The discussion based style, while stressful, is useful for this course. Recommend.",
    "This course should be taken by students planning on completing the global health concentration in their first year. It provides a great, broad overview of several topics that are crucial for the study of global health and in a sense is an expanded version of a \"Global Health 101\" course. The assignments are pretty straightforward: weekly readings and policy briefs. The amount of reading can be overwhelming but learning is enhanced for those doing the readings (learning to skim\/scan and read the summaries, etc.). The policy briefs provide an opportunity to sharpen writing skills and can seem challenging at first (because of space and the format that is expected).",
    "I would avoid this class at all costs. I only took it because it's required for the Global Health track.",
    "Eye opening and definitely recommended. It exposes you to various issues of global health, not just the area that you are interested in."
