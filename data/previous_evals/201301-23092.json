   "comments": [
    "This course is wonderful. It is a lot of work, but I would definitely take it again. It is one of the best classes I've taken at Yale.",
    "Yes.",
    "A nice overview of the history of dance. It is primarily ballet\/modern dance-focused (since that's Prof. Coates's training), but you do get a bit of tap, African dance, and tango thrown in as well. The class can feel like a lot of work, since there's ~75-100 pages of reading and ~1 hour of viewing per week, plus reading responses due before each class, but the readings and viewings are all really interesting. Prof. Coates is such a phenomenal dancer, and the times when she performs a bit of dance or talks about her past dance career are really inspirational.",
    "I'm a graduating senior, and I am so glad I got to take this class before I leave Yale, as it's simply one of the best I've taken here. It has opened me up to such a wealth of dance (way beyond my previously ballet-limited knowledge) from across the past century in America and further afield, and is far more than just a history of dance - it takes in so many more fields and areas of interest. Professor Coates is one of the best people working at Yale, with an incredibly dance career and knowledge, and a genuine love of bringing this to her students. TAKE IT NOW.",
    "If you're looking for a fun, informational class about the history of dance this is the right class. There is a (short) movement exercise each week so if you're looking for something that will get you on your feet often, perhaps look elsewhere. The exercises are fun but they are just a small portion of the class. The discussions are very informational and Coates facilitates well so everyone can get a chance to speak. The papers and projects are fun because they are on a topic to your liking, Coates will help you with the fine details. Overall, pretty good class; easy, fun, and changes the way you look at dance."
