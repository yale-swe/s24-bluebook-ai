   "comments": [
    "I would heartily recommend this class to a fellow student. There are certainly many conceptual holes in quantum mechanics, and I did not really understand the extent of them nor what their proposed solutions were until taking this. Professor Miller is a great class leader, and wants you and all of her students to understand the material well. It is a great environment in which to develop your philosophical thinking and communicating, and is also a good meeting point for philosophers and physicists who might not have considered the material in this way before. The readings are interesting and progress very well, and by the end of the course you have a pretty good idea of the current state of quantum mechanics and perhaps where to look next.",
    "PHIL 443 serves first as an introduction to the basic concepts of quantum mechanics, and then as an exploration of many of the ways physicists and philosophers have tried to clarify, make sense of, and revise them. While I imagine the course would be interesting to most philosophy students with an interest in metaphysics or philosophy of science, I would recommend it especially to physics students who want to develop a conceptual appreciation for quantum theory. (Every physics class I've taken has almost completely glossed over all the aspects of QM that make it such a radical--and clearly unfinished--theory.) Professor Miller, as well, is always extremely clear, encouraging, and helpful--one of the best professors I've had at Yale. There are also cookies.",
    "Excellent, engaging professor. Really cares about the students. Be prepared to be a little lost on occasion during seminar if you are not a physics genius, but everyone catches up in the end.",
    "Absolutely. It's good to have a physics background and a philosophy background, but it's really fascinating stuff.",
    "We examined the philosophical underpinnings and logical paradoxes of textbook quantum theory. You won't get definite answers from this course, but you will get an understanding of what is at at stake when formulating an interpretation of quantum theory. It would be useful to have taken both a philosophy class and a quantum physics class before taking this course. I was a physics undergrad when I took the course, was unprepared philosophically but previous physics classes helped."
