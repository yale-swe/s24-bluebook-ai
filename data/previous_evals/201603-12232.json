    "This course provided tools necessary for the study of agriculture and the societal impacts of agriculture across history.",
    "To see the process that how did agriculture change our daily life and our society, the important role it has played and consequences of human decisions are always interesting.",
    "I really enjoyed the course. For the most part, the readings were very interesting, the professors were extremely prepared and engaged. Overall it was a useful introduction to the major issues in the study of agrarian societies.",
    "The temporal span of this course was bigger than most courses. As such it allowed engagement with a range of debates which would not be accommodated in most courses. Some of its important and exciting contributions include - the relationship between grain and the history of the state -how human societies developed from hunter gatherer to settled societies and the fluidity with which they continued going back and forth - debates about whether human societies have become healthier, less violent, safer and more sustainable over time. - the impact of industrial revolution on our aesthetics, ideas about morality, health and sexuality, population etc. Methodologically, - the importance of considering big data when doing history and the limitations and challenges of that exercise. - the potential and promise of doing histories of the environment as well as of commodities - the value of interdisciplinary research especially conversations with climate scientists, archaeologists and evolutionary biologists."

   "comments": [
    "We had a 2- hour group discussion session each class on the readings of that week, which definitely contributed to pushing us to finish our reading task each week and inspiring new thoughts.",
    "I think the course could be improved by making the expectations clearer. I didn't receive much feedback on my response papers, so I didn't have a sense of whether my analyses were on the right track. It also wasn't clear to me whether we were actually graded on our presentations in the discussion sections. I spent significant time preparing for the presentations on the assumption that they were an important class expectation, but often there was not enough time for me to actually deliver my presentation and we jumped right ahead to discussion. That said, I appreciate the extensive feedback on the final papers.",
    "The scope of the course is its chief strength."

   "comments": [
    "Yes. This course is challenging in terms of a time commitment, but is well worth it.",
    "Yes. I would encourage people to challenge themselves by taking this course.",
    "Definitely--great readings, interesting lectures, and an emphasis on big, radical thinking rather than small contributions. Very different from the social sciences classes I've taken in the past.",
    "Yes, the course can give an opportunity to delve into debates which one usually does not. These macro-historical questions allow insight which can impact one's work, research and thinking in many interesting ways."
