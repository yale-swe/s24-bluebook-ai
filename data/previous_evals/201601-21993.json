    "Musi 460-463 is one of the main reasons I came to Yale, and it hasn't disappointed. It's fantastic to be able to spend a great deal of my time practicing and earn a grade and course credit for all that work I put in. Most liberal arts schools aren't willing to give grades for a non-academic subject, but I'm so glad that Yale is - it makes Yale one of the only schools in the country where liberal arts students can fully incorporate a part-time conservatory-level study of music into their curricula. Ultimately, it fosters a high level of artistry in the undergraduate community that would be simply infeasible otherwise.",
    "I would recommend the private instruction to every student who is interested in improving their instrumental musicianship."
