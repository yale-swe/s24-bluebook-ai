   "comments": [
    "If you have any interest in Latin America, Native American history, or the early southwest, this is for you. Professor Blackhawk is helpful and attentive. This is a very solid seminar.",
    "Indians and the Spanish Borderlands is an interesting look at an understudied portion of North American history. The readings examine the Spanish movements, mainly in the Southwestern US, but there is also information about the SE, California, Plains area, and even some about the Pacific Northwest.",
    "I would recommend this course to a student with a research interest in colonial New Mexico and its frontier regions. The research paper is a big focus of the course, not an assignment to cram in at the end, so students should enter the course ready to begin thinking about their paper from the beginning. Reading knowledge of Spanish is very helpful.",
    "Yes. Great course.",
    "It was a good class overall. Professor Blackhawk does a great job helping you structure your work on your final research paper, which is a HUGE focus of the class. This is actually nice, especially as a first semester class junior year, because you get a good feeling for what writing a big research paper is all about. The first 8 weeks or so, when we had all the readings and discussions and such, seemed sort of directionless at times, but overall it was a good class.",
    "This was an excellent course. The group was small and discussions were productive and wide-ranging; Professor Blackhawk was a natural and encouraging discussion leader; the reading was manageable and interesting; and having the class in the Beinecke was a treat. Discussions often drew not only on material, but also on students' backgrounds and even stories of Americana. The course had a good balance of material and research -- the research paper felt neither sudden nor overdone within the context of the class, and was well-supported by assignments, class presentations, and feedback from Professor Blackhawk and Mr. Miles. I also really enjoyed the early midterm paper on Alberquerque --both in terms of the assignment and the timing.",
    "This course is separated into two sections. The first half of the semester, we looked at the colonial history of the Southwest and California. The second half of the course focuses on researching techniques and working on individual research projects relating to the colonial period of the Southwest or California. This class is engaging because 1) Professor Blackhawk is incredibly affable and one of those teachers who actuallywants to engage his students and ensure that they are learning not only the material, but how to think critically as a historian 2) the material of the class gives you a new way to view colonial American, long before Jamestown or Plymouth and 3) the class meets in Beinecke and you get to actually see a lot of primary sources - documents, maps, and paintings - that you're reading about. So cool. That being said, I have two problems with the class. The first is that no matter how much of the reading I did, we never seemed to really cover it in class discussions. This was a disincentive for completing the reading and, I think as a result, discussions were not as engaging or informative as they could have been. The second is that in the second half of the term, we were assigned no course readings, the reasoning was that we were supposed to be conducting our own research. Some of the subsequent classes we talked about our projects, but many of them we simply sat around and discussed the process of researching or history in academia (definitely interesting, but not wholly related). This class, I felt, was more of an introduction to what it would be like to be a grad student in history."
