   "comments": [
    "There is a lot of reading but it's an extremely interesting course. You get to visit the Beinecke, the YUAG, and the Cushing Center since it's a collections-based class. Definitely take it!",
    "A great class to take if you are into photography, science, philosophy, or just imagery in general. The class really plays with the idea of the meaning of capturing images, and what that entails.",
    "very history focused. readings are a little dry, but if you have an interest in photography you will enjoy this course",
    "This class was amazing. Definitely my favorite HSHM seminar I have taken at Yale. I highly recommend it to any student, even if you don't think you are particularly interested in photography. It provides a really interesting frame work for learning about the history of science. For me, the class was a perfect intersection of my artistic interest in photography and my academic interests in the history of science. Prof. Ramalingam gives you a lot of freedom in the 2 research papers (one 5 page, one 8-10) and 2 reading responses (500 words) to explore your specific interests in scientific photography. I'd even recommend taking the class just for Professor Ramalingam. She is interested in new and innovated aspects of the history of science. I also enjoyed the mixture of undergraduate and graduate students. Reading is manageable.",
    "As a PSA, tell all your science major friends to get into this course and stick with it, even if they have doubts about history and the validity of humanities. They will learn so much from it. Anyway, I would highly recommend this course to other students. Photography and the Sciences covers the invention of photography and then delves right into the role of photography in science, and it really teaches you to ask questions, especially about the distinction between art and science and whether or not it's as definite as it seems. And I think being able to ask questions is important skill regardless of what field you're in. The readings in this class are interesting and not too overwhelming; there are some heavier and lighter weeks, the lighter weeks usually occurring when you visit various archives around campus, which is cool. There are two reading responses, a midterm paper, and a final paper, and, obviously, a participation grade. There are also grad students, but they are less intimidating than the assignments and contribute a lot of knowledge. Finally, Chitra is a great and caring instructor, and good seminar leader. She is super approachable and understands students well."
