   "comments": [
    "I learned all about plants and plant phylogeny from taking this course! I cured my plant blindness! I'm so happy to be able to see and appreciate plants now in a way I never did before!",
    "You will learn tons about plant evolution, plant phylogeny, plant morphology, etc.",
    "I learned so much through this course, I think in a nutshell I came away with a general knowledge of the plant phylogeny it it's breadth and the evolutionary steps and motivations.",
    "I learned a lot about plants, both in terms of their specific adaptations, habits, and characteristics, but also in terms of their general strategies and the unique challenges they face. I also learned a lot about phylogenetic \"tree thinking\", as well as a lot about how to approach analyzing evolutionary questions using both molecular data as well as the fossil record.",
    "I learned about the evolution of plants",
    "At the Beginning, Prof Donoghue says that you will learn to see the world around you in a new lens, and its totally true. I came home and cant stop thinking about all the ways in which plants are the best things ever.",
    "I learned mostly about the diversity of plants in terms of morphological characteristics, but also general concepts about plants such as pollination, dispersal, etc, and the evolution of plants.",
    "This class completely changed the way I look at the world, and the way I approach science and ecology. Professor Donoghue promised, at the very beginning of the semester, to wipe away our 'plant blindness'. That he did, instilling a natural curiosity and love for plants, infecting us all with his world and his passions. There is no comparison at Yale for what this class can reveal to you and the way it makes you start to think differently about the everyday world around you.",
    "Learned a ton about plants",
    "I learned so much about plants! I look at the world without plant blindness now!",
    "I learned about the beautiful and complexity of evolution through the lens of plants of all kinds. I learned about the extreme biodiversity of these plants now look at all plants differently. Having had no background in bio, that did not hold me back from appreciating Donoghue's lectures. I also began to learn the value of self driven studying. With no problems sets or quizzes or really any assignments other than a very short paper and two mid terms, I realized one really has to put in time on their own going over lecture slides and notes during the week to make sure they understand how everything connects.",
    "really the same responses I would give for the lab.",
    "Plant identification, understanding of plants' roles in ecology and evolution, passion for plant diversity",
    "Memorization, conceptual understanding of phylogenetics and taxonomy, and knowledge that plants are AMAZING!",
    "This course taught me a phylogenic approach to understanding plants. At the end of the course I was able to look at a plant and position it within its phylogeny. This course made me take a new look at the beauty of the natural world and gave me a new appreciation for botany and plants. On the practical side of things, this course helped me develop the ability to think critically about about why plants display the traits that they do. I also wrote a paper for the class which made me delve into primary research in the field. Donoghue made us botanists. Great course.",
    "I learned a lot more about plant phylogeny and also about how to be an observant botanist, reaffirmed my interest in plants, and learned a lot more about evolutionary history (especially biogeography).",
    "I learned about plant identification, how different plant families are related and a concrete example of evolution in action.",
    "Botanizing! Learned all about plant features, evolutionary strategies, reproduction, phylogeny, etc. Learned to no longer be blind to the amazing plants around me - truly lit up my world.",
    "As an E&EB major who is planning on going into field ecology and grad school, this course helped me develop so much knowledge about plants with regards to phylogeny and identification. I learned how to look at plants as a botanist, which made walks substantially more interesting. I came out of this course with a greater love and appreciation for plants than I expected, and it has in some way guided what I can see myself working on in grad school.",
    "I started out knowing nothing about plants but now I know quite a few things about plants! Additionally, I began to grasp some concepts in evolutionary biology that I didn't really get before."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "This course was perfect. By far the most perfect course I've taken at Yale, perhaps the most perfect course ever offered anywhere. It was well-taught, it was engaging, and it had a narrative arc (and a summative message!). I have no critiques of this course, and I could go on forever about what I loved about this course.",
    "I thought this class was amazing! It was very well taught and I cannot believe how much I learned. I would personally have liked to have a few more assignments along the way to take some of the pressure off of the exams.",
    "There are no obvious weaknesses to me, as with all lectures I would occasionally find it hard to focus but that's not really the lecture's fault. I think I did that less in this lecture than most others, because of the small size, engaging material and teaching, and the opportunity to ask questions. I learned sooo many cool things from this course and left really loving\/appreciating plants more so than before.",
    "I thought this class was overall very strong, but the paper assignment was sort of odd in my opinion, or at least not as well explained as it could have been. I wonder if there may be a better way of framing the paper prompt that still gets at phylogenetic thinking, but that is more clear in its approachability.",
    "The strengths are the professor",
    "The lectures were set up extremely well, of course because Prof Donoghue is at the top of his field and has been teaching it for a while. I would not change anything.",
    "This class was very well taught, and the material was very interesting. The only thing that I can think of that could possibly improve this class is having some sort of assignment (that was worth not too many points or that was even optional) that could be graded to give back feedback on our understanding of the material before exams.",
    "Strengths: Our brilliant, plant loving professor; the TAs, who were beyond nice and worked hard to keep the course running super smoothly and to maximize our plant knowledge; the field trips, which were so generously offered and were tons of fun; the overlap between this course and the lab course, which are designed to compliment each other beautifully. Weaknesses: None, actually.",
    "Lectures became tedious at times. Intermediate problem sets may help.",
    "I think Donoghue went through the phylogenies of variously plants in a logical manner, but there was still just so much to know. I think this class should have been focused to just flowering plants so we could spent more time in depth with each family. I really tried to do this towards the end in studying for the final but simply ran out of time. I think more structured quizzes or assignments, while it would add to the workload, would help people like me work outside of class on the material. Requiring the lab be taken in conjunction with the lecture was a great idea but did not go far enough. More assignments would have also generated more feedback and helped my learning process. The field trips were fun, but I had trouble integrating them into the rest of the material we were learning in class. I'm not sure how this could be improved.",
    "No weaknesses -- an incredible course all around.",
    "This course was amazing! I loved it, and it completely cured my \"plant blindness.\" I never thought plants could be so exciting!",
    "This course was excellent, we went through so much material in such as short amount of time without it being overwhelming. I cannot think of a way to improve it.",
    "I loved every bit of it: Only one suggestion that maybe the lab can show a clearer list of to-do list for the day, because there are points where the tasks were not immediately obvious, but that is very minor.",
    "A lot of memorization and not a lot of practice to do so before the midterms. Perhaps problem sets would be helpful to encourage keeping pace with the amount of information we were learning. The midterms, although required a lot of knowledge of a lot of different material, were still very reasonable for the exam.",
    "There are two varieties of course material; the plant families and the plant concepts. Units were interspersed around both and the flow wasn't always the smoothest, but it made sense by the end of the course. I would have maybe liked a more thorough big picture lecture at the very beginning to visualize the arc of the class. The field trips were a great bonus for the course.",
    "Donoghue is one of the greats, in terms of not only knowledge and contribution to the field but in terms of accessibility, engagement, enthusiasm, and love for students. He makes the class amazing. I think this class might benefit from the addition of problem sets, just given the rhythm of the semester was no work for a while, cram for test, no work for a while, cram for test, etc. Having regular checkups on learning, however small, would perhaps alleviate that and even out the engagement, and maybe make the knowledge stick a bit more (especially because there's really no encouragement to do the course readings).",
    "At some point, it grew to be a bit repetitive to list and learn all of the features of each plant family, but I did appreciate that the exams did not require rote memorization and rather tested our understanding of phylogenetic relationships between plant families and the evolution of unique features. I wish more than one lecture was spent on plant evolutionary tactics, but I did like how the class covered a lot of major plant families. Michael is definitely a strength of the course, as his engaging teaching style and passion for plants and his students is remarkable.",
    "Great class!"

   "comments": [
    "PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE for your sake take this class! You will not regret it! Everything about this course is perfect. I am so happy and low-key honored to have been in this course this semester.",
    "Absolutely! It was one of the best classes I have taken at Yale by far!",
    "If you're an EEB major looking to fulfill the organismal bio class, I would highly recommend. Donoghue is an amazing professor (and straight up great guy) whose knowledge and love of plants is infectious. He is also really approachable and truly cares about his students. In terms of work load, it is very manageable. There are two midterms and one final, none of which is really cummulative, which is nice because it would be nearly impossible to learn a semester's worth of plant phylogenies! If you like plants and need a SC credit, you should take this class. You don't have to come in with much of a bio base knowledge, but you still learn a lot about plants and some basic bio concepts.",
    "I took this for a science credit. It wasn't easy; there's a lot of memorization involved. But it was still absolutely awesome and very rewarding to learn. I'm happy that I'll have this knowledge going forwards. Donoghue is an absolute legend, the midterms and final were completely fair.",
    "Absolutely.",
    "ABSOLUTELY 100% YES!",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class to anyone interested in plants, or even just interested in biology. It doesn't really demand a strong previous science background, the lectures are fascinating, and you really do learn a lot. It's oddly empowering to be able to look at a plant and know or infer things about it, and it's a skill that this class builds. Michael is amazing.",
    "Be very careful taking this course. I took it for my premed bio lab and had a rough semester due to it. It is a much harder course than you would expect. Just be very careful",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class to anyone who can take it. Probably limited to upperclassmen or EEB majors who need an organismal diversity class though.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. This class was amazing and Professor Donaghue is a fantastic professor.",
    "Best class I've taken. Michael is the man - his passion is so infection it's impossible to dislike the subject material no matter your background. The course is a ton of fun, and will reshape your worldview with a profound new appreciation of the details of those (mostly) green things you see day in, day out. Two thumbs up.",
    "Yes, but only if your interest in the class is genuine.",
    "Plants is such a good course! You learn about the different lineages and how they've all evolved. Lectures can be a bit dense, but it's so interesting!",
    "I recommend this course if you're interested in learning more about plants, their biodiversity and evolution. I had no AP or college level bio and was able to understand all the concepts of the most part. Donoghue cares a lot about his students and is always willing to meet and help you with the material, but you have to take initiative. I wish I had worked more and harder in this class.",
    "I would recommend this course to every student.",
    "This is a great class. 100% take it (given you have a bit of time to devote to it) and take it with the associated lab (which is probably the best class at Yale)",
    "Take it -- you won't regret it. Donaghue is one of the most engaging, interesting, knowledgeable and clear professors I've had in my seven semesters at Yale. You learn so much about plants and how they've evolved!!",
    "Absolutely amazing class. Take it if you're looking for a fun EEB bio course! The tests are definitely not easy, but everything you'll learn will be worth the work! You'll leave the class with an entirely new appreciation for plants. TAKE IT!",
    "YES! Take this course! The lab and the course may be a bit of a large time commitment but it is worth it! If you are a non-science person looking to fulfill a requirement this is a great course to do that. It may be a little harder than other science courses but that rigor is worth it because everything you learn helps build information you will find valuable if you care about plants. Don't slack on the first midterm either. Once you get the hang of the course you will come to see that it may be one of the most memorable courses you take at Yale.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to any student who loves plants, or even just want to know more about evolution and ecological conservation through plants. It is very engaging, the TFs are great and professor Donoghue is honestly one of the kindest and most knowledgeable people I know. This course is absolutely fantastic and I cannot recommend it enough.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. I took this course because I'm a bio major and needed a bio lab and you have to take the course in order to take the lab. The lab is AN ABSOLUTE GEM. There is not a single other lab at Yale that you will enjoy as much. Donoghue is a phenomenal professor who creates a really welcoming environment and is very encouraging.",
    "I would highly recommend taking Plants! It is well taught and the material is well presented. It is a fun course that challenges you to look around you more carefully and to appreciate the plants you see everyday and take for granted.",
    "Yes, I would. Take this class to understand evolution in the context of plants, which are abundant and everywhere. It's really cool to learn about something that we are always running into, but we never notice. As Professor Donoghue says, take this class to overcome plant blindness.",
    "YES! Donoghue is amazing - super knowledgeable, accomplished, engaging, and just an all around nice guy. He truly loves plants and wants students to love plants, and after this class I've come to love plants even more. I walk around with new eyes to plant morphology, flower morphology, plant ecology, everything. It's a fun, relatively easy, and life-changing course in that way. Plus, the lab is fun (just hanging out, eating snacks, and drawing plants for three hours a week).",
    "I can't recommend this class highly enough, to both science and non-science majors! It's a lot of material, but exams are fair and well-spaced out. If you engage in the course during the course, it's far easier to learn the material than if you cram the night before the exam. Michael is a spectacular professor - he truly cares about plants, teaching, and students, and he makes (what could be a harrowing ordeal of) learning tens of plant families enjoyable. Plus, you learn lots of fun facts about plants that you probably wouldn't have otherwise ever learned!",
    "Definitely! I am a non-major but took it Cr\/D, which I think was a great decision--I learned lots of cool stuff and was not stressed."
