   "comments": [
    "I think the readings and all the course materials were really great. The professor would often show videos relevant to the reading of the week. Additionally, each of the assignments built towards the final paper 20 page paper making it much more manageable. However, the discussion was most the most challenging part of the course. Even though we submitted questions, there were never shared with the class unless referenced in discussion. Also, discussion could be stilted and rarely focused on overarching themes.",
    "Very strong syllabus with fascinating readings. Some readings are very long (a few books each of which you are expected to read in a week) so skimming is necessary to get the full measure of the course.",
    "Strengths: This covered many different topics related to imperialism. Many of the readings were very engaging, and there was a good amount of primary source analysis and material. Weaknesses: Sometimes it felt as though we'd cover things one week and then the next week do something completely different and unrelated. I wish that there was more continuity and coming back to old material. Also, there was a lot of writing (a primary source analysis, a literature review, and a 20 page paper) especially for a class that did not give a writing credit."

   "comments": [
    "I think if you are really passionate about the topic of race, colonialism, and imperialism as well US history, it is the perfect course for you. However, if you are not, the material might be too niche and detailed for your taste.",
    "Yes. Anyone interested in the history of technology should take this course. Courses like this are key to understanding how information and power diffuses in a global context. There are readings that you won't find in any normal course on imperialism, or in any normal course on the history of medicine, and they are great.",
    "I would recommend this course for someone who is interested in history of science and medicine, but it was quite a bit of work and a lot of writing, so I wouldn't recommend it to someone who isn't super interested in history."
