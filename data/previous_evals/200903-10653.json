    "No, I do not think this course is very helpful. It takes too much time which otherwise could be used for our lab work. I do not think it is neccessary for every student to write summary for each paper. In real scientific world, nobody does it. People can choose to read paper in detail once they are really interested in it. The presentation itself alone is already good enough for the traing purpose of this course.",
    "I would summarize the class as writing 1 page summaries every week and sitting through presentations. I would not recommend it.",
    "its already required for the program. Its a practice presentation that will help you interact with faculty you might not have already. thats all it is.",
    "This required seminar class is helpful for improving your presentation skills, however it is not really a journal club because you don't discuss the papers you read."
