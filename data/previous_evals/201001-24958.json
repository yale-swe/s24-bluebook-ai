    "I think this is a great, great class even for non-science majors. I love biology but really dislike all other hard sciences so this class was PERFECT. We had such amazing discussions every class and I looked forward to every Monday afternoon. I would HIGHLY recommend this course to any incoming freshman.",
    "This is the best class I've ever taken and of there's any way you can take it, do. harvey will be the best professor you ever have and an invaluable resource. Your class will become like a cult and your friends won't be abel to eat their dinners anymore because you won't be able to help bringing up placentas and periods. This class changed my freshman year. Take it!!!",
    "Absolutely, take this course if you are thinking about it.",
    "I would definitely encourage people to take this course. A good background in biology would definitely help and make the class a lot more interesting. Taking this class would be like a roller coaster ride you would not want to miss.",
    "I would recommend this class in an instant. If you're interested in biology or development, this class is for you! It gets into the hardcore biology of reproduction in the second semester, and in the first semester you get an incredible overview that you don't want to miss. Take this class.",
    "Topics in Reproductive Biology was a great seminar course. You really get to know your fellow classmates and the professor while learning a lot about reproductive biology. I would recommend it to freshman interested in the subject or general biology.",
    "MCDB 060 is a year-long seminar based in discussions of various topics regarding reproduction. The work-load is low, but each semester requires a presentation, 1st semester ends in a final exam, and 2nd semester ends in a full research paper. Take this course if you're looking for a fun, relatively easy course that gets you thinking and introduces you to other interesting Yalies.",
    "This class is fantastic. Every Monday afternoon I would look forward to attending. The subject matter is fascinating and very relevant to everyday life, making it a worthwhile class for everyone, not just science majors. Take this class. If you don't, you will regret it.",
    "Take the class! It will greatly enhance your Freshman year experience.",
    "A must take for any freshmanThis course should be a prototype for all freshman seminars. Prof. Kliman (\"Harvey\") imparts key college skills to students in a relaxing yet informative manner replete with student projects and investigative learning. Students hone their presentation, writing, creativity, and critical thinking skills in a setting that serves as a training groujnd for conventional college activities. The course material itself is innovative and causes students to think in unique ways. If only more freshman seminars could be structured like this!Harvey is an incredible teacher, mentor, and person who cares deeply for his students as learners and especially as young adults. Ever-attuned to the needs and circumstances of undergrads, especially freshmen, Harvey engages students in discussion and critical thinking exercises that train them for other more rigorous curricular activities. The course material covers a variety of different fields and Harvey allows for students to dictate much of what is studied and discussed in the course. Harvey makes his class valuable, informative, and fun.",
    "Yes, I would recommend it because it's amazing!"
