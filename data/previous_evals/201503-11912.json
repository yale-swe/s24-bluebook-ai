   "comments": [
    "Absolutely, take it! Prof. Carlisle is the sweetest professor, and she obviously cares deeply about her students and the subject material. The books are fun (we read Sherlock Holmes, for goodness sake!) and the papers (only two of them!) are more interesting than those of your typical english class.",
    "Great class for English majors looking for a super interesting seminar that will really push you to be a better writer and reader especially in relation to secondary sources.",
    "Victorian Crime is an amalgamation of different media and topics relating to crime in Victorian Britain. We read four crime novels, but we also looked at artwork (such as etchings or photographs) and read newspaper articles. The course had a few faults, such as not really discussing the novels and sometimes proceeding with the assumption of more knowledge than Victorian times than we had, but overall it's an interesting approach to an unusual subject. It is definitely not a traditional or standard English class, which depending on your tastes could be good or bad. Also, the professor said she would address some of the difficulties we had in the class for next time.",
    "This course was quite a bit of work since many times we were expected to finish a novel for the class. However, I did learn quite a lot about a time period that I was not very familiar with to begin with. The Victorian Era is actually a lot more interesting and dramatic that I had guessed.",
    "Fun, eclectic, and a totally different approach to literature than in most Yale English courses. Much greater historical basis, and the final project entailed a fair amount of external resource poking around in old legal documents. Great reading list (putting \"Great Expectations\" alongside \"Lady Audley's Secret\", \"Jack Sheppard,\" \"The Moonstone,\" and \"The Hound of the Baskervilles.\" Prof. Carlisle is very good but very exacting in paper assessment - the course requires a different sort of reasoning in writing. 10\/10 would recommend."
