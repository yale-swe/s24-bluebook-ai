    "Good class but too heavy on the \"Why does qualitative matter\" debate. In the end I'm more interested in doing a really good research project. Not why large N studies are sometimes unnecessary.",
    "This is a class primarily geared towards grad students. The readings and discussions in class were quite boring at times, as they often included highly technical and philosophical dissection of qualitative field research of the sort one would expect in a graduate seminar.That having been said, the project was amazing. It's difficult to get started but it was very rewarding to be able to do real research.You create your own project, interview people, write up a report...It is a fairly time-consuming project, but I walked away with a much better appreciation of how to interview, plan a project and conduct qualitative research generally."
