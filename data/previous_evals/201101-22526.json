   "comments": [
    "Heavy reading, weekly reading responses, but pretty interesting stuff about how humans conceptualize cause and causal reasoning.",
    "I'd recommend it to other psychology students, absolutely.",
    "I really enjoyed this course! It's pretty low key, and only requires weekly reading responses, and a final poster and paper. The material is all pretty interesting, and Prof. Keil is awesome. If you're generally interested in psych, take it. That said, there's a lot of discussion on things that aren't known in the field, so if you want a class that just feeds you the answers, this class may not be for you.",
    "Most of what you get out of class comes from the papers you read. Class time is largely a summary of the papers you read (with the majority of the time spent listening to student presentations literally summarizing the papers). I think the class could be improved if it capitalized on the possibility of discussion in a seminar format; so that the class would be significantly more valuable than the sum of its assigned papers. But I do recommend it. The papers are interesting and Professor Keil is an engaging professor.",
    "Really good course if you have any interest in the title. Sometimes the material can be a little abstract, which can be frustrating, but Professor Keil does a great job filling more vague readings during class discussions. Pretty cool course. The readings may be a little tough in the beginning but they smooth out over the course of the semester and really arent that bad. Most of them are very interesting too."
