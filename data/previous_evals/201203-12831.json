    "You'll have to take L3 for the language requirement but be thorough when going through professors' evaluations. Profesora Tortora was not as effective of an instructor as I would have liked to see because she had a lot of difficulty managing the varied levels of Spanish skills in the class and as a result, tended to teach things at a more elevated level, leaving some students to fend for themselves.",

    "Fine course for fulfilling your language requirement. It's a straightforward language course with daily homework"
