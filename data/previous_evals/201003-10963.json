    "I would say it is a great introduction to the different research topics in biophysics. I enjoyed discussing a different topic with different professors every week, and would recommend the course.",
    "Sure. Take the class if you have a background in biophysics and computational methods or would like to strengthen that area of your expertise.",
    "A unique way to know about interdisciplinary research. It does not matter if the students and profs are from different backgrounds, because what really is being focused here is the logic and tools, the kinds of questions and research that can be asked and done to combine experiment, theory and computation.",
    "A work in progress, and a great way to expose students to other disciplines and other methods for approaching and thinking about biological problems."

   "comments": [
    "The course was great for introducing a wide variety of topics, and was especially useful for me as a first-year student still choosing rotations. I don't think the course would be as useful for students who have already chosen a lab and research topic, since the introduction to any one topic is brief.",
    "I learned a lot but I don't know how relevant it will be to my research.",
    "I would like to explore questions at the intersection of experiment, theory and computation. This is particularly suited to help me find out what sort of questions I ought to ask and the experiments I can devised and tools I can employ to answer those questions."
