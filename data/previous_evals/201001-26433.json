   "comments": [
    "It was a course that gave an introduction to the role of spatiotemporal scale in ecology - something that should never be overlooked and is often not given sufficient attention. The readings gave information on the historical and current topics in various sub-fields and also indicated how quantitative analysis is undertaken. We even had a brief workshop on using R in spatial analysis. In addition, the discussions, which were largely student-driven, but moderated by Dr. Jetz, were very interesting. I absolutely would recommend this course.",
    "If someone was really interested in questions of scale and wanted to read a lot of challenging papers, and had a good background in ecology, then yes. If this relates to your own research then yes definitely, you can learn a lot and Walter is a great contact and resource. If you just have a general interest in the topic than maybe not--it's pretty dense.",
    "Would recommend if interested in developing research projects, also that interested students interview with the Professor beforehand, and get ahead on the relevant background.",
    "EEB 713 is a graduate discussion course on the topic of space and scale in ecology and evolution. The main aim of the course is to have students read primary literature and lead discussions each week. You also write a paper or research proposal related to the course material and include a spatial analysis of your choosing. I definitely recommend this course to other students. Space and scale are not always considered in ecology and evolution but they can be really important drivers and also lenses to understanding of natural systems.",
    "I think it a great course that provide a base of knowledge necessary to understand the incorporation of scale in one's research. I would suggest this course to anyone studying ecology and evolution. It is extremely helpful for dissertation work and is essential knowledge."

   "comments": [
    "As I said before, I believe that this course added an extra layer of understanding to my concept of ecological analysis. It also did an excellent job of connecting evolutionary and ecological processes, both in the theoretical and the analytical\/practical. In every class, I kept regular notes and notes of ideas of how to use the concepts and tools in my own research. This was probably the most useful and enjoyable class that I have taken at Yale.",
    "I learned a lot, and some of it was very helpful to my ongoing research. Other sections were less relevant and more theoretical but were interesting abstractly. The math sections were pretty much over my head and I didn't get much out of them.",
    "Opened up a huge new field of potential research, and many new angles. May end up contributing significantly.",
    "The course played an integral role in shaping my first dissertation chapter and the research that I will conduct this summer. It was a great opportunity to deepen my knowledge of space and scale in community and population ecology. I was a little disappointed by the shallowness of our discussion of metacommunity theory, a major interest of mine. But I understand that we can't delve deeply into every topic and that other students might need more of an introduction of the ideas at hand.",
    "It was a great overview of metaecological and evolutionary principles and was extremely helpful in the development of part of my dissertation."
