    "Full Lab in Chemistry in a semester. Def recommended. Quick and painless. Just do the work, and you'll be fine.",
    "Chemistry 119 is a good supplement to be taken alongside Chemistry 118. However, I found it to be even more interesting, as the lab course involves carrying out experiments to find the same results, formulas and laws of chemistry that great scientists in the past did. Be prepared each week to dedicate yourself to a 4-hour lab period, in addition to studying for a pre-lab quiz and writing a reasonable lab report; it may be more work than the average 0.5 credit course, but it is definitely worth the work.",
    "Chemistry 119L was definitely a good lab and it works very well with Chemistry 118 in terms of parallel material. The lab was a fairly mild one in terms of workload and grading, so I think this makes a great first-semester-of-freshman-year lab, so yes I'd definitely recommend it.",
    "Chem119L was a great course. It is definitely useful to take it along with chem118.",
    "Definitely helps you understand some of the concepts from 118 better; also just a fun lab.",
    "This class is certainly doable. As with most labs, be expected to work as much as a full credit class. The quizzes are tough, but the lab reports will likely compensate for that, so be prepared for the quizzes.",
    "CHEM119L is your basic chem lab. I would take it to fulfill requirements, but understand that it is a great time commitment during class and before labs are due. DO NOT FAIL TO START LABS BEFORE THE DAY THEY ARE DUE. They really do take quite a bit of time and thinking especially if you haven't thought about it at all during the previous week. Take it if necessary. Having friends in your lab section is an excellent way to make the class fun.",
    "Overall, Chem119L is a needed course for premeds out there. Great overall course b\/c it is so comprehensive (labs range from spectroscopy to acid\/base titration). Also, I have heard that in Chem 114\/115 lab, there is a stressful lab final. In Chem 119, there is no final lab practical! Another reason to take this course...I must warn you though that the grading for the labs is strict.",
    "If you need a general chemistry lab, I suppose you kind of have to take it. May as well just get it over with.",
    "It was my highest grade of the semester; it's definitely better than the other chem labs from what I've heard from my friends. It's really great that you rarely have to do full lab reports - we only had to do 2 or 3 full reports, whereas most of the other lab classes have you do full write-ups every week. Also, studying for the lab quizzes, even for 10 minutes before class, definitely helps your grade; that said, I think the quizzes count for too much of your grade. 4 questions asked before a lab shouldn't be worth more than 10% of your grade. Take 119L!",
    "Yes.",
    "It's a required course, so if you need to take it you obviously should. If you don't need it but are really interested in chemistry and learning laboratory techniques, take this class. Otherwise, not worth it.",
    "As far as labs go, it's really not too bad. Professor Parr takes some getting used to, and he's really never \"warm and friendly,\" but he's bearable, and the class is alright. Especially towards the end, some of the labs were very interesting.",
    "If this is your first lab class: be warned. Work heavy and tedious for a half-credit course. There was some great satisfaction in working through a bunch of numbers I was sure were wrong only to find that I got the right answer, but that was never really enough to make me enjoy the class or the work I was doing. Take it only if you need to.",
    "Chem 119L is the companion to chem 118, odds are you'll take them together. While the actual laboratory time can be grueling (4 hours a week with Dr. Parr), the class wont require too much effort and will pay off in experience and some pretty interesting experiments.",
    "Chemistry 119L was a really great experience for me. It is definitely the best class I have ever taken at Yale. Initially, all I wanted was a good grade from this class. I got way more than I had bargained for. I really learnt a lot, and this class convinced me that I wanted to major in science after all.",
    "It is a helpful course to take with Chemistry 118.",
    "As an upperclassman who had to take this course to fulfill prereqs, I found this class incredibly easy. On that note, it is a very good introductory class for freshmen who aren't quite used to college-level work yet. I actually learned quite a lot in the class. The labs were very informative, and a lot of them were fun and interesting. A lot of the lab reports were more like problem sets because you only needed the results\/calculations sections. The full lab reports were pretty easy if you had experience writing them. I even recommend this class to non-science majors.",
    "CHEM 119L is everything you'd expect from a general chemistry lab course, and don't worry, you almost never use the entire four hours or have to write a full-length lab report. Dr. Parr is certainly off-putting to some, but I quite enjoyed his sense of humor!",
    "Reasonable lab. worth a half credit (most lab reports are not full ones). don't get on Dr. Parr's bad side.",
    "Only take Chemistry 119L if you need it for your major. Otherwise, it's not a must.",
    "Dr. Parr is a wonderful professor to have, and he provides interesting experiments for you to do.",
    "It was a really great lab experience. The labs were all fairly straight forward and generally took much less time than the four hours allotted.",
    "It's a good lab to take. You will always get out early.",
    "The class was a great introductory lab course. If you are taking Chem 118 or 332, it is a great addition, especially for those looking to major in the field.",
    "This class in not light in its amount of work. You spend 5 hours in the lab and spend a sufficient amount of time on the lab report. I would suggest you take it if you plan on taking future lab courses for a particular major. Otherwise, you may not find this as beneficial.",
    "A good introductory chem lab. I might not recommend it if you don't need it for requirements, but it's actually kind of enjoyable if you have to take it. Watch out for the lab reports; they can take forever sometimes, and one mistake in calculations can result in an hour of fixing graphs and tables.",
    "Chem 119 is an introductory lab that assumes more knowledge than the lab for Chem 114\/115, but it is still a very manageable class. The lab environment and pre-lab quizzes take a little bit to adjust to, but the class is not particularly hard. If you need to take a lab, this one is a good choice.",
    "CHEM 119L is pretty necessary to take with CHEM 118. Although the labs are okay, the lab quizzes are annoying because it requires you to study the lab beforehand. The actual lab reports are not bad and the TA's grade easily.",
    "Its the lab required for 118. Parr can be a bit harsh, but overall a decent class.",
    "Chemistry 119 is a good intro chem lab. The labs are manageable if you come prepared haivng read through the procedure. You only have to write a few full lab reports, however the pre-lab quizzes are a bit difficult and so you need to study for them. Getting a good T.A. is paramount. I had Wambui Mutoru so I had a good experience, but friends with other T.A.'s did not have as good an experience.",
    "It was surprisingly enjoyable, and that's coming from someone who wasn't expecting to like chem lab or chemistry at all. Also, Jonathan Parr and the TAs are great about teaching you how to use equipment if you didn't have a strong lab background from high school. For the most part you could always count on the course manual to be a good description of what labwould be like that day. It was a joy hearing Jonathan Parr give the pre-lab lectures. He always seemed so jolly and just that he genuinely loved chemistry. And he was surprisingly helpful and easy to approach for help or advice in the lab as well. He was like a European rock star turned brilliant chemist. His sarcastic comments sometimes were a little on the snarky side but were amusing once you realized he meant them jokingly--for the most part. The experiments, though tedious, were interesting if you have somewhat of a nerdy side to appreciate them. Lab reports are also tedious--definitely start them early if possible (they get harder as the year goes on, don't be fooled!). But overall I would recommend Chem 199L, and recommend that you take it at the same time as Chem 118. It may seem like a bigger time commitment that way, but Chem 119L definitely solidified my understanding of concepts taught in Chem 118 (but not taught thoroughly enough for the Chem 118's tests, where I relied on my knowledge from lab).",
    "Take it only if you have to for pre-med requirements. The teaching schedule of 119 in terms of chemistry concepts is slightly ahead of Chem 118 so sometimes it was helpful to learn some of the Chem 118 material ahead of time but besides that slight advantage, this lab is quite tedious, boring, and slow.",
    "I would recommend Chemistry 119L to another student because it's a great first lab course for Yale. It has a much smaller workload than other lab courses (although it will still be a lot) while still teaching the fundamentals one needs for the upper-science labs.",
    "This is a great lab to take with CHEM 118. It's definitely doable, but expect to devote an afternoon of your weekend working on the lab report. Prelab quizzes can sometimes be super specific and unreasonable (what does EDTA stand for? and name 15 safety procedures), but are on the whole pretty fair. Studying for Parr's quiz certainly helped own the acid\/base section in the lecture class. You really do learn some interesting concepts for chemistry beyond the labs you would have done in just AP chem, and many of the labs also are useful in a worldly sense, for example: measuring the purity of water and constructing solar cells. If you are premed, you'll need a inorganic lab credit, so just take this and get it out of the way.",
    "Yes. You learn a lot of basic lab techniques that are very useful.",
    "It's a lot of work for 0.5 credit, but overall, it's not that bad. The quizzes are hard and don't expect to be able to finish the later lab reports the night before, but a pretty solid course.",
    "yeah, it's fine!very little work",
    "CHEM 119L accompanies the format of CHEM 118 fairly well, and I would recommend this lab not only if you take CHEM 118 but also if you want to practice lab skills you did not have much experience with in high school.",
    "Good accompaniment to Chem 118. You might as well take it if you're taking 118 so that you have the lab requirement out of the way. Some labs take longer than others, so make sure that you're not starting the labs the night before they're due.",
    "The lab is very hard but also interesting and fun. You should take it if you want to pursue a career in science, but get ready for a lot of work.",
    "Chem 119 isn't that bad, few full writeups and the labs aren't too bad, you won't have to stay until 5:00. Not too much work for 1st semester.",
    "Try taking a lab session earlier in the week, not on Friday (finishing at 5 is not fun, people). Also, Dr Parr gets a bit cranky as the week goes on. Even though it's just half a credit, there's a TON of stuff that goes on for the lab reports. Ties in quite nicely with Chem 118a. The experiments were usually enjoyable, make sure you are well-prepared for the pre-lab quizes! I would recommend the lab, and found that taking it with the lecture at the same time was helpful.",
    "Look, if you're a freshman premed or sciency-person what am I going to say that will dissuade or persuade you to take Chem 119 Lab? That's right, nothing. This class is required for nearly everything. That said, if you're deciding between Chem Labs definitely take this one. It's better in that it's only one semester of Lab. Fewer labs=less pain.",
    "I would recommend Chem 119L to a fellow student just because it's fairly straightforward. But do read carefully the lab manual. Some of the quizzes are tedious details that can be easily overlooked.",
    "Yes I would recommend this course to another student if they have a decent understanding of chemistry before beginning this class. I think that it is definitely a course for a more advanced chemistry student, but it also takes into account that all of the students have different lab backgrounds. Overall, I think I gained some important skills from this class and I found it pretty rewarding.",
    "If you REALLY want to learn about advanced general chemistry laboratory take this class. If you also want to spend several hours a week on reports and studying for quizzes, take this class. Otherwise, take it if you have to finish a requirement.",
    "I would recommend that anyone taking Chem 118 also take this lab course. The two courses work well together and the lab provides a chance to see the application of many topics and formulas covered by the lecture. Additionally, although the lab is scheduled in a four hour time slot, often the experiments took under 3 hours. Also, only two full lab reports (out of 12 experiments) were required and there was no final exam.",
    "A lab covering more advanced topics and concepts in chemistry. I would recommend this lab over any of the other intro chemistry labs because it is less work and the concepts are at a higher level. It is challenging without being unnecessarily tedious.",
    "Exactly what you would expect from a lab course. If this is your first college level lab course, it will prove very informative and Dr. Parr will prove very helpful along the way. Definitely take it.",
    "You have to take this class if you are pre-med to fulfill your credit. It is not too painful, but some labs take a ridiculous amount of time. There are lab quizzes every week that count for a significant percentage of your final grade, so make sure you come to class prepared.",
    "Chemistry 119L 01 was a good way to introduce basic laboratory concepts and equipment to someone who hasn't done much lab work at all. I would recommend it to students who are looking for a somewhat challenging and work-intensive but interesting general chemistry lab course. I would advise students who are thinking of taking this course to have already taken AP Chemistry or the equivalent,as the background material will be helpful if not essential.",
    "The reviews don't lie. For many people, Chem 119 is the worst part of the week. However, if you have a really positive perspective\/mindset coming in, it can be fine. The quizzes are random and sometimes unfair, memorize minute and useless details. The TAs vary in quality and style, although I think all of them were fine overall. The lecture was a disaster this semester so the lab seems fine in retrospect, but you probably won't enjoy it too much. Think twice about why you want to take this. Freshmen, be warned: there's no need to 'prove' your abilities to take Gen Chem or fulfill it as a prerequisite for something you don't want to pursue in the end.",
    "I would not recommend taking it at the end of the week when you're burned out unless you don't have much going on in your Friday schedule. Other than that, its not bad but the full lab reports are very time-consuming.",
    "I learned more in the lab than in the course, though that doesn't say much. The lab is always at least a week ahead of the class. Don't freak out too much about the lab reports - they're graded very nicely. Do, however, study for the quizes. They're worth a lot, but if you read the lab for that day and go over the one from the week before, you'll probably be fine."
