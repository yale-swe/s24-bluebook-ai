    "Some of the tutorials and examples didn't help much - they seemed to focus on \"being cute\" rather than being instructive.",
    "In response to question 10: Some of the evaluation part of the assignments and course were confusing. I am still not sure whether I am being graded on something or not",
    "Question 10: Everyone raves about Professor Tomlin but I felt that the class format was dreadfully boring. He does know everything about GIS, but that doesn't help you if you don't even know what questions to ask. Also I found his lack of feedback on assignments to be quite frustrating.",
    "Ross was an amazing TA! He's one of the major reasons I'm considering taking raster next semester. He gave a huge amount of his time to all of us to ensure we made it through the assignments, and was super chill even when we were stressing out. He was willing to stop by the library even doing non-office hours to help us get through tough spots.",
    "1. The instructor is verbose. I think he can finish one course in half of the course time. 2. The instruction and the instructor's expectation are not clear.",
    "The only reason I gave Prof. Tomlin an average rating is because I do not think I learn effectively based on his teaching style, but that is not the same as Prof. Tomlin being a bad teacher. Perhaps he could be more adaptable to students' needs, though. It seems like he's been teaching the same material for a long time, and is set in his ways (or doesn't put much effort in changing things from year to year).",
    "Professor Tomlin is clearly a leading expert in his field, but for my learning style it would have helped me so much more to have been sitting in a lab, able to work through the GIS concepts he was discussing, because just watching him do it wasn't enough for me to really grasp what was going on. I have no background in GIS whatsoever, so even though I worked through his handouts and went to TA office hours every week, I still felt behind. Maybe I am just doomed to be bad at it.",
    "Question 10: The instructor covers a significant amount of material for a computer program that has many tools and operations. Lectures, tutorials, and readings\/ instructions were incredibly clear for learning the program and likely be a valuable resource in the future.",
    "GIS is a skill that is becoming very useful especially in its ability to show information visually and carrying out spatial analysis.",
    "This was a pretty good introductory skills-based course, but I don't think that I gained enough skills in it to be able to do any serious GIS projects. That being said, this course is what you make of it, and my goal was to just become familiar with GIS since I don't see myself being a GIS specialist in the future."

    "The professor.",
    "Great overview of the tools associated with the vector side of ArcGIS. Very early on you will learn the tools to draw your own maps or acquire data to map out your area of interest. That is followed by the learning of some analytical tools.",
    "Its a skill you learn versus just theory. The workload \/ assignment is every week so you are constantly practicing",
    "The instructor described the concepts of ArcGIS very clearly.",
    "I found a lot of value in discussing the organization and philosophical treatment of the field of spatial analysis, although I recognize that this is not well suited for all. Dana's handouts are invaluable and the style of presenting the agendas to learn new sets of weekly tools was helpful.",
    "Creativity-invoking projects, responsive online help forum, incredibly good notes on GIS created by the professor that I will keep permanently.",
    "HW and final project gave opportunity to learn GIS with a project that I was excited about",
    "it's a skills-based course, and I feel like I'm walking away with a really useful tool.",
    "This course was exceptionally well - designed. The weekly tutorials and homework assignments were an efficient and productive way to explore the concepts and tools covered in lecture each week. I appreciated how well the final project built on the homework and that it was flexible enough to allow us to target our final product to serve our own educational and professional goals. I also appreciated that the course handouts were free, thorough, and easily searchable - I'm sure I'll continue to use those handouts throughout my coursework and into my professional work. Professor Tomlin and Ross were also very accessible for help and feedback.",
    "Working on the weekly homework assignments. It really made me learn how to use the tools on my own.",
    "Seeing the other projects the rest of the classmates came up with was great. Also, having the tutorials and homework every week really helped understand each tool.",
    "Encourage the students to explore and use the tools in their own pojects.",
    "The freedom that students have to mold their projects over the course of the semester. Each week we have to option to work with our own data as it builds to a final project. We were given sufficient direction along with this freedom, which facilitated guided self-discovery of learning new concepts.",
    "I wanted to learn how to use the ArcGIS software, and I came away with a good understanding of various tools, although there is so much more to know. It was great to have Ross as a TA as he was very dedicated in helping students by holding weekly office hours.",
    "I learned a great deal of each weekly homework. though I could never figure out how anything was graded. I would be useful to provide some sort of framework for grading and evaluation.",
    "The final project.",
    "The ability to work with GIS is a valuable skill to have. I started the class with no experience (I had barely opened the program before), and I finished the class with the ability to comfortably work with the program.",
    "I mastered new skills in map-making and spatial analysis through GIS. The final project enabled us to use our new knowledge on a topic that was relevant to our interests.",
    "Enjoyed having a better understanding of the program\/software and its capabilities - incredibly valuable!",
    "The final project was fun to work on.",
    "Review of the topic in weekly assignments.",

    "Tutorials and explanations.",
    "Instead of the final project, I would prefer being graded on a weekly basis.",
    "It might be beneficial to add an optional lab session, where both instructor and TA will be there and answer questions.",
    "Probably not feasible, but a lab component of this course would really hammer home the ideas. Working in a group environment would also be ideal (although perhaps impossible for scheduling).",
    "Feedback. Throughout the course I never received comments or advice on my work. The one mechanism for feedback--a rating system where the best projects in the class were sorted into \"stronger\" and \"strongest\" folders--was only used occasionally and without consistency. I did like being able to see other classmates' work and learning from them in that manner, but I would have also liked the professor's input. Perhaps it is still to come in individualized reflections on the semester's work, but this has not been suggested. I appreciate the self-reflection and personal motivation inspired by this course, but it's unfortunate to go through an entire semester with such a renown instructor and never receive advice from which to improve.",
    "Sitting in an auditorium watching someone work a computer program for 3 hours is not an especially great way to learn. Perhaps this would be a good candidate for a \"flipped\" course format. Getting instructor feedback on assignments would be extremely helpful.",
    "Lack of clarity on what project components will be needed farther in advance",
    "There's really tough, steep learning curve. I think it would have been helpful to have the class in the computer lab, or to at least split the time between 1\/2 lecture and 1\/2 workshop. Watching someone else use a tool, and hearing them describe it, is very very different from doing it yourself.",
    "Evaluation criteria for the homework assignments and final project could be more explicitly laid out in the syllabus.",
    "It would be more helpful to have this class as a lab based class instead of a lecture style. It's difficult to learn a computer program by watching someone else do the steps.",
    "It would be better if the whole class could work together on the tutorial, at the same time the professor is showing how to do it.",
    "To the instructor: Please be concise. Please be clear about your expectation.",
    "Early in the semester I was frustrated with the pace the material was taught. Things seemed to be sluggish, as if 3 hours of time could have been condensed into 1.5 or 2. It would be nice to see Prof. Tomlin show off a bit more in class. That would help the students get some extra inspiration for their own work. ArcGIS has such a wide assortment of tools that simply knowing or seeing what is possible could be a big help, even in understanding the principles of the software.",
    "I just don't think I benefit from Prof. Tomlin's teaching style, I'm not sure how else I can explain it. I didn't get as much out of the weekly (3hr) class lectures as I'm sure I was supposed to, and as a result, pretty much learned everything on my own time outside of class (and by seeking out from Ross the TA, Stacey Maples, and Prof. Tomlin was also available for questions via email). Also, this class should be taught in a computer lab, in front of computers!! I can't believe it isn't taught that way.",
    "It needs to clarified how each student's work is evaluated and graded. i still can't figure out how anything was evaluated, its all a mystery.",
    "I think more emphasis could have been placed on the final project from the beginning. Dana did a pretty good job of this, but if homework assignments had been more explicitly tailored to our final projects, I think I would have been able to dig deeper into my project.",
    "Sometimes I thought that instructor expectations were a bit unclear. Also, during the class presentations, we were asked to rank other student presentations from best to worst. I thought that this type of ranking system was unproductive and not reflective of the work that went into some of the project presentations. In the future, rating student presentations on a scale of 1-10 without ranking presentations against one another might make for a better peer grading system.",
    "It would be very helpful to have brief examples or case studies each week of how the GIS tools have been applied to solve different types of problems for professional or research work. There is a lot of material to cover in the course, so I can see where this would be a challenge to incorporate. But seeing higher caliber work of how the program can be applied (beyond past student work in the course) would be very beneficial.",
    "Choosing a project topic is a challenge. Especially when a student is trying its application in a new field. Hence the project could prove to be of advantage to a student who is doing a project topic where data is available and GIS application is very obvious. Where as if a student is trying to mix the concepts of different topics into the project, it sometimes could be challenging, hence project might prove to be of disadvantage. But considering students come from various backgrounds and fields, hence each one may try applying it to their own field but GIS application (considering only the portions covered in one semester) may be limited. Hence, projects could be of advantage for few students and disadvantage for others. This issue probably needs to be addressed.",
    "It was very difficult to translate classroom learning into being able to understand the material when I was sitting in front of a computer. While the handouts were helpful, it would have been immeasurably more helpful to have held this class in a computer lab.",
    "Tutor session.",
    "I wish we had a bit more feedback aside from the final project - the \"strongest\" and \"stronger\" submissions folders that appeared in the earlier assignments would have been really helpful through the later part of the course as well. I also wonder if there's any interest or way to flip part of this course. Dana's in-class instructions are helpful, but what's really valuable is hearing him and the TA and other students trouble-shoot problems. Having us play around with and read handouts ahead of class, to devote more time to working through how to combine tools and get more of a sense of their nuances, might be one way to tap into this part of their expertise.",
    "I think that the venue is not conducive for the course as the tables were too small to put our laptops and follow through and still take notes. Bowers with the tables is a more appropriate space for the lectures.",
    "We never received any feedback about our work throughout the course. Although the professor highlighted certain hw submissions that he thought were better, I really would have liked to receive some comments specific to the work that I did, even if it were just from TAs. At the end, it was difficult for me to judge my performance on the final project and in the class in general."

This would put the theoretical lectures and practical assignments. Additionally, the many times I showed up to work with the TA in office hours, he either didn't know what tools we needed to use that week or said it didn't matter - that i didn't need to learn them (e.g. geo-coding), yet they were required in the assignment for the week.

I now know enough of the tools and techniques that would allow me to work with people who posses a higher level of expertise in this software. I don't want to be the \"GIS guy\" where ever I end up working, but I want to be able to leverage the abilities of whoever that guy\/girl is.

Beware if you are a perfectionist or categorically overzealous in your pursuit of mastery-- this course will eat up your life. That said, the benefit of walking away with a very useful, tangible skill is invaluable, and you get out what you put in.",
    "Take it if you will ever need GIS, which you likely will. Be prepared to dedicate long hours to it (be you a novice or a practitioner), and definitely go to office hours.",
    "Do it if you expect to use GIS for your chosen career\/field. And if you have at least 6 hours a week to devote to the assignments.",
    "There's a steep and painful learning curve, but stick with it. Do your homework at the same time as your classmates so you can help each other.",
    "I would definitely recommend that other students take this course. I'd also advise other students to define their final project topic early on and then to use their homework assignments to build toward that as much as possible. I'd also recommend reading all of the handouts identified in each lecture's agenda every week if possible. On a more practical note, I'd also recommend that students decide on a labeling and organization system for their GIS - related files early on and stick with it.",
    "Definitely worth taking the time to struggle through GIS. The work load is much heavier than other courses, but it is worth it.",
    "You could probably learn what is taught here on your own, but the pace of the course forces you to work constantly on each tool and thus really learn how to use it.",
    "Take it.",
    "Even if you have never used a computer before, this class is not too advanced for you. If you have spent time working in GIS prior, this class will not be too basic for you. All skill levels have the opportunity to grow and improve at your own pace. Each student will make marked improvement over what they could have achieved prior. If you want to know GIS and be able to make pretty maps that are technically sound and actually can portray valuable information to users, this class will provide you that opportunity. You can choose to spend as little or as much time on projects as you'd like, and perfectionists may become frustrated often (and spend dozens of hours a week on homework and projects). The amount of time your spend and the mastery you achieve should\/will be demonstrated in your final project. It will be something you'll want to share with your grand kids.",
    "If you're unsure - just take and get the experience under your belt, even if it will be quite painful or intimidating at times.",
    "Be prepared to dedicate most of your free time in the week to accomplish the necessarily weekly assignments and the final product.",
    "I would advise to take it if you want an introduction to GIS. You might not want to take it if you have past experience with GIS.",
    "Just know it's not interactive learning in the classroom, like if you were to do one of Stacy Maples' workshops- you just sit there and watch him do things on the screen and if you blink you might make some crucial step. I had trouble staying focused watching him do this for three-hour blocks of time every week. Reading his handouts, doing his tutorials, and going to TA office hours is the best thing you can do to actually learn how to use the program.",
    "Use the homework assignments as an opportunity to contribute to your final project each week (as suggested by the instructor).",
    "This course is challenging and requires you to be patient in learning a new software program. It is very rewarding and I recommend taking it. The weekly commitment is about an additional 6 hours of work outside of class.",
    "I would definitely recommend the course to anyone who wishes to learn how to use ArcGIS.",
    "Very useful course - I would definitely recommend taking this before raster, if you're considering them both, and if you're trying to chose between the two, raster was (to me) the more engaging and unique set of tools.",
    "This course is time consuming and require alot of self learning. However the skills that you ripe from it would be something that will be very valuable.",
    "If you really want to learn GIS, you have to put in the time. This course is what you make of it."
