   "comments": [
    "The course provides a few interesting perspectives on leadership. The reading list is wonderful and the discussions are very interesting. Professor Baldwin is also a very dedicated and caring instructor. He really cares about making the course as enriching as possible. All in all, the workload is very reasonable and refreshingly different from other Yale courses. Accordingly, if the material seems interesting to you, I'd definitely recommend that you apply for a spot.",
    "FANTASTIC course. I love seminars like this one, precisely because we actually get to know our classmates and the professor. The readings were so interesting, the discussions were always so enthralling, and the practicums were highly educational. I loved that the professor put in a lot of effort to incorporate student feedback at regular intervals.Sherman really inspired me to do something impactful with my life, which is probably the best takeaway I can ask for from any course. Also, the fact that he was willing to take us out to pizza after seminar every week was great.",
    "A cool class. More on leadership than on innovation. Prof. Baldwin is interesting and has lead a really incredible life, so there's a lot to learn from him. Syllabus is pretty white-male-heavy. Papers are open ended and they're what you make of them. Prof. Baldwin also invites the class out for pizza afterwards if people want to keep talking, which was really nice.",
    "I would not recommend it to a fellow student. The discussion was very one-dimensional and felt like a game of \"please the instructor by mimicking his viewpoint,\" a viewpoint whose conservatism and un-progressiveness is reflected in the class syllabus, which entirely excluded American leaders of color and American women.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student!",
    "It's a good fifth class with interesting readings and a fun class dynamic, but maybe not worth taking over a class with more serious academic content\/with a more diverse syllabus. Also, the Thursday night timing is honestly kind of rough -- if you haven't taken an evening seminar before, tread carefully.",
    "I would recommend this course to other students. It was a reasonable amount of work, Baldwin and guest speakers were engaging, and the topic was interesting but a little military heavy for my tastes. I would take the course again.",
    "I enjoyed it a lot would recommend.",
    "The class was an enjoyable and informative experience. However, the class's ambiguous title parallels its ambiguous material. It consists of reading about and discussing mostly white, male leaders in industry and the military and only lightly touches the leadership experiences of other demographics. The course also has no well-defined curriculum and both the midterm and final papers have vague prompts. I would recommend the course to another student who is looking for an interesting course that will force you to develop your ability to stand out in a group discussion, but suggest taking it C\/D\/F.",
    "No words can do justice to describing this class. Best summed up with: youtube.com\/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ",
    "Very great one-of-a-kind introduction to some of the greatest leaders in history. Professor is very experienced leader himself and approachable lecturer"
