   "comments": [
    "The instructor is amazing. The material is really interesting if you are a health care provider or interested in environmental health. Otherwise, I think it would be sort of technical for people. There is very little work outside of class except for the two papers and studying for the (very fair) midterm and final.",
    "Great!",
    "Having a background in this area, I found the course to be really amazing. It came highly recommended from other PH students, and Dr. Borak really lived up to expectation. The design of the course content really facilitates the learning- the first half covers concepts, vocabulary and mechanisms (with many anecdotal tie-ins for medicine and science) and then the second half covers specific areas- focusing on specific toxicants and the policy implications. I especially liked the guest lecturer from DEP (Brad Robinson) who gave an excellent talk on how toxicology fits into the pesticide regulation at the DEP.",
    "Strengths: good introduction to tox that really emphasizes the mechanisms and principles as opposed to pure memorization;Weakness: as I was studying for the final, I found inconsistencies or unexplained information in the lecture slides. sometimes it seemed we were expected to understand chemistry that we had not been taught.",
    "I thought the final was incredibly hard, especially in relation to the midterm. There needs to be a clearer way to pick out the important concepts out of the hundreds of slides given to students.",
    "Toxicology was one of my favorite classes. Good, fairly well organized lectures and useful assignments.",
    "Very informative and diverse subject matter.",
    "Strengths:Instructors, their expertise, their academic and real-world knowledge, and the oh-so-current materials that they provide.Weaknesses: Beware! Don't let the lack of assignments in the first 5 weeks keep you from reading the Casarett and Doull's. Dig in and follow along aggressively, or you'll be sorry when the assignments and midterm comes.",
    "The strengths of the course were the minimal workload and the lectures, themselves, which were extremely engaging, interesting, and informational.",
    "Strengths: explain the basic concepts of toxicology, how to do a toxicology analysis, uses specific examples to illustrate basic concepts.Weakness: too dense...",
    "I thoroughly enjoyed the course. Out of the intro-level courses that I took that are part of the core MPH 1st year curriculum, I would have to say that Tox was the course which I took the most away from. It was thematic, had real-world applicability and Borak is a charasmastic professor. I would improve upon the course by probably spending a little less time on the case study examples (TCE, Hg, Percholorate) - note, i wouldn't eliminate them, just a little less time, and do more mechanistic work.",
    "This is a great course as an introduction to the concepts and vocabulary of toxicology. The course helps students develop an understanding of the dose-response relationship and the fundamentals of exposure to toxic compounds, which are practical skills for many fields in public health.",
    "The first half of this course is a great introduction to toxicology. The course is necessarily broad, given the wide variety of student backgrounds. If you were a biochem major in college, this might seem pretty basic, but otherwise it's a manageable balance between general concepts and details. The second half of the course focuses on applying toxicology principles to specific chemicals. I personally found this section of the class less satisfying.",
    "The class is really great, but very difficult. I think there should be no problem for at least the final to be open notes...we are required to memorize a great deal of information and then apply it.",
    "final questions were not indicative of major concepts we covered. for example, first and second half of the semester was dedicated to 1st and 2nd order of elimination but the final asked for zero order elimination, a concept we did not cover. The mid-term was fair and asked directly on topics we discussed in depth.",
    "This was a pretty interesting course, definately outside my comfort zone academically, but I was still able to get something out of it.",
    "first half was great but final half with case studies was confusing and failed to complement the knowledge gained in the first half",
    "The course disappointed me. I was hoping for something with more substance, and it ended up being a basic review of a lot of general chemistry, biochemistry and organic chemistry material from undergrad. 60% of the semester's lectures were spent \"getting everyone on the same page\" with all this background information. I do not know why this class is offered to everyone, including those students without any biology or chemistry background because it is so focused on these subjects.Also, I found the two written assignments lacked direction and the expectations were not clear.",
    "The course was great; I've never taken a toxicology course before so this was a terrific introduction. Both Prof. Borak and Cheryl know their fields extremely well. Though I wouldn't mind if there were more homeworks\/if they counted for a grade. Also it bothered me that I didn't know how my grade was going to be calculated...",
    "One of my favorite courses. The professor was engaging, the assignments and exams were fair.",
    "Course can be better structured and made less rigorous.A lot of material that turned out not to be needed for the course was given.Tons of lecture slides were given and then innocuous questions were asked on the slides.",
    "Great, Prof. Borak is a very engaging speaker, I found myself getting excited to come to class simply to hear the man speak, and Cheryl's superb as well.The class had two papers, both of which should be well-researched, so don't put them off, and be sure to communicate with Cheryl and Prof. Borak, they both are very eager to help and genuinely great people outside of class as well.There were two tests, which were kind of hit and miss, in terms of what you studied, I suppose the idea being that you study it all well. Certain slides are disproportionately used for testing info more than others, and if you don't realize which ones these are, you find yourself studying to rote dozens of slides that won't show up on the test at all. Of course this fact reminds me of how much I learned in this course, and how much material there was. It is a really great class, not terrible with work in the beginning, but very end of semester heavy, so watch for that. Don't let anything I wrote here discourage you from taking the class however, for me, the class was a great opportunity to learn so much in a fascinating subject that gets far too little airtime in other classes. Wonderfully taught by teachers that care (and know, a lot), and a solid class.",
    "it's okay for those who are really interested in the course. not so good for those who are just exploring. I don't feel like I learned many new things and I didn't enjoy being in class.",
    "I wish there were more toxicology courses offered. Especially if it was by this instructor.",
    "This was a very interesting course to take. The instructor tries to provide a brief overview of a very broad field."

    "Instructor: Jonathan Borak \u00a0Dr. Borak was enthusiastic, articular, and totally compelling to listen to. He told great anecdotes and made the class really interesting and fun. He is s stickler for detail, but this also means that he expects the best from everyone. I have an incredible amount of respect for him and also think he was quite entertaining.",

    "Instructor: Jonathan Borak \u00a0Good lecturer",
    "Instructor: Jonathan Borak \u00a0Dr. Borak could probably read from a phone book and find a way to make it interesting. He is an outstanding lecturer. Of equal importance was his interest in leaving students of the course with practical applications and appreciations for the material as opposed to testing rote memorization.",
    "Instructor: Jonathan Borak \u00a0Extremely interesting lecturer. Could make anything seem interesting! Pleasure to be in his class.",
    "Instructor: Jonathan Borak \u00a0Dr. Borak is a very engaging lecturer. He is good at explaining difficult concepts and always has entertaining examples. After a couple lectures you will not be surprised to learn that he consults for industry clients - he has a somewhat conservative view on regulation, precaution, and new toxicology findings in general.Cheryl Fields, who works for Dr. Borak's consulting firm, also gives a good number of the lectures. Cheryl is very nice and not a bad lecturer, but she clearly does not have the same level of expertise as Dr. Borak.",
    "Instructor: Jonathan Borak \u00a0Humorous, engaging, and commanding. Maintains your interest throughout class.",
    "Instructor: Jonathan Borak \u00a0Dr Borak is a faculty leader who cares immensely about the science, the theory, and the field in which he lectures, writes, and operates a leading toxicology consultancy. Moreover, he is a teacher who cares immensely about the students' opportunities to get a foundation in toxicology and in toxicological\/ecological risk assessment.Masterfully weaves a compelling, science-based, policy-laden narrative out of complex and subtle science -- and teaches you toxicology, so that you leave the class feeling prepared to think through the mechanisms of toxicology in any given circumstance.",
    "Instructor: Jonathan Borak \u00a0Dr. Borak was the reason I initially chose to take the course (ultimately, the reason for my enjoying the course become toxicology, itself; but this was, of course, a product of Dr. Borak and his engaging method of teaching the material).",
    "Instructor: Jonathan Borak \u00a0I enjoyed Prof. Borak's animated lecture, his stories and his passion for toxicology. He makes toxicology fun.",
    "Instructor: Jonathan Borak \u00a0He made this course so interesting,",
    "Instructor: Jonathan Borak \u00a0Prof Borak was great, I always enjoyed his lectures. He was excellent at making sure we understood the big picture.",
    "Instructor: Jonathan Borak \u00a0The instructor is a very dynamic and charismatic lecturer, which made classes both interesting and enjoyable. The instructor did a good job organizing the course, presenting the fundamentals during the first half and then applying these concepts to specific examples.",
    "Instructor: Jonathan Borak \u00a0Very knowledgeable and a great lecturer.",
    "Instructor: Jonathan Borak \u00a0Dr. Borak is a good lecturer, albeit a bit self-satisfied. He explains things clearly, but I didn't find him to be terribly approachable. Chery's lectures seemed to be all over the place, and my notes from her lectures in class did not match the material in the slides. It was hard to understand the main points, but easy to prepare for the exams because they came primarily from the slides.",
    "Instructor: Jonathan Borak \u00a0Dr. Borak does a great job of explaining complex ideas in a simplified manner. However, there seems to be a bit of an attitude that this stuff is just easy and it's not a difficult class. THere is a great amount of information we are to retain. It IS difficult.",

    "Instructor: Jonathan Borak \u00a0Dr Borak is a good instructor but I feel there was a gap in passing the knowledge across to the students.Classes were too complicated and could have been simplified.Cheryl Fields: Good instructor although not very confident when addressing the class.",
    "Instructor: Jonathan Borak \u00a0Great, Prof. Borak is a very engaging speaker, I found myself getting excited to come to class simply to hear the man speak. Cheryl's manner of treating differents subjects had me excited for her presentations as well. Both are very generous with their time, dispite the work they do. Each of them really reaches out to the students, especially if you don't understand or do badly. Both of them are very knowledgeable and are easily able to synthesize from their thoughts simple, yet fitting explenations of the subject matter. An hour with either of them is worth a much longer time reading a text, simply due to their ability to state facts and summarize general trends and concepts: a rarity in teachers I've run into thus far in my academic career. Both of them should keep up the good work.",
    "Instructor: Jonathan Borak \u00a0wasn't there half the time. good lecturer. not very cohesive material.",
    "Instructor: Jonathan Borak \u00a0Dr. Borak is one of the best instructors I have ever had. He is a motivated professor. He has a great understanding of the students needs and has a strong desire to meet these needs.",

    "If you are interested in how different compounds do damage to the human body (like how carcinogens cause cancer on a cellular level) this is the course for you. It is very detail-oriented and looks at mechanisms of action and concepts of pharmacology. It is fascinating for those who find these topics fascinating, which I happen to.",
    "Great",
    "The course covers the basic concepts of toxicology, focusing on exposures, ADME and mechanisms of toxicity. A lot of the material is very molecular so having a background in molecular or cell biology is a great help. The instructor is one of the best I have had as a teacher, and while not relevant to everyone's interest\/future direction, it gives a good idea of how environmental factors can become public health concerns. There is also significant connection with policy and regulation.",
    "A good option for the EHS requirement if you have had some chemistry",
    "I would recommend it over other environmental classes, as it is interesting, but very difficult subject matter.",
    "The first half of the course covers the basic principles of toxicology and the second half is focused on case studies as applications of these principles. There are 2 quick math sets, 2 short writing assignments, a midterm, and a final exam. Reading is not necessary, but the text book is very good. If you get the big version of the book you will never have time to sit down and actually read the chapters, but it makes for an excellent reference book.",
    "A very basic introduction to the subject matter. A more technical class could be offered through the medical school.",
    "Toxicology is a loadstone for any fundamental research in medical science,environmental science, and public health.Take this course.",
    "A great course to gain a basic understanding of toxicology and it relates to you on a daily basis. I would definitely recommend it to another student because of the instructor, the interesting material (particularly if you enjoy biochemistry), and the course load.",
    "Yes. Interesting course..",
    "This course is about the mechanisms by which toxins and toxicants are absorbed, metabolized and excreted from the body. Yes, I would 100% recommend the course to another student, given that I truly learned and retained a great deal. The professor was engaging and funny, easy to learn from.",

    "Toxicology is a rough ride if you aren't a chemistry person. I wish I had been warned...",
    "Not a great course. If you have experience in biochemistry, you won't gain too much from this course.",
    "I really enjoyed the course, though I must admit it was the toughest of my course schedule this semester.",
    "Good course although i feel that introduction to toxicology can be better structured.Two problem sets were assigned and we were not told until completing the problem sets that they would not be included in our final grades.Innocuous and obscure questions were asked after studying tons of material.The grading for the papers and exams was very tough and not well explained.Recommended only if you love toxicology\/environmental health sciences with a passion.",
