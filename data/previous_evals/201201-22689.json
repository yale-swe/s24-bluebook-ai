   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend this class, as it forces everyone to talk every class period and really ensures people practice their conversational Spanish.",
    "YES! I loved Spanish 150. I hadn't take spanish in over a year (I took L4 fall of freshman year), and this class was very manageable. The readings are interesting, not that many written homeworks, the debates were engaging. Take this class if you want to keep up your spanish speaking skills (not that much work on grammar).",
    "It is a great course because the material is interesting and the workload is manageable if you stay in top of it. Sonia Valle is a really good professor and she helped my skills a lot. Take it!",
    "Good class that will help your Spanish speech! Unfortunately lots of little home works you won't enjoy very much. Take it though! You'll thank yourself when it's over.",
    "If you want to improve your Spanish speaking and comprehension skills take this course.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to my fellow students, especially if they are looking for the opportunity to extensively practice their oral skills, which are sometimes the most difficult to master.",
    "Spanish 150 is a good way to ease into L5 Spanish courses, but I wouldn't consider it the best way to \"cap off\" your Spanish career. The syllabus is a little nebulous, and it can hard to discern the course's direction at times. Reading the novela (\"Cr\u00f3nica de una muerte anunciada\" by M\u00e1rquez) was probably the best part of the course in that it gave it more coherence from class to class. On the whole, I would recommend the course to students who plan on taking other L5 courses in the future but want to first refine their skills in a more skill-focused setting.",
    "If you want to improve your speaking skills this class is great. The workload is minimal (one short reading per night) and class is usually engaging. There are a few short, easy writing assignments and two oral exams, but compared to L1-L4 this class has practically no work. At the same time I feel like I developed my skills more in the speaking based part of this class than in L2-L4. Absolutely take it with Sonia Valle she is incredible!",
    "Spanish 150 was a very good way to get more comfortable speaking spanish about a variety of different topics. I learned a great deal of vocab without having to sit and study it a lot which I never like to do and feels more real because you learn it by using it rather than studying it. I liked the style of the class a lot because you get to know the people in your class and your teacher really well through just sitting and talking three times a week. I will feel much more comfortable studying abroad in Ecuador next semester having taken this class. The work load is fairly light - just reading for every class and an occasional quiz on the material. The oral exams are annoying because they take a lot of time to prepare for but that's about the only required work that takes a lot of time.",
    "I would recommend it to another student who has an interest in learning the language. Typically the class does not allow native speakers (although I suppose it depends on the Professor) which takes a lot of pressure off of the learning process. Professor Valle enjoys teaching, which made her a great instructor!"
