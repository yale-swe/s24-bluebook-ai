    "Yes - incredible reading list. Grappling with these works will really stimulate your mind. If more discussion is integrated, it will be even better. Now I think having only lectures misses the opportunity to have great discussions.But no if you're more concerned with logic and arguments. This is cross-listed in German Studies, Humanities, Literature - it's literary analysis. Our assignments were close readings of 1-2 pages of text. I loved it, but not everyone will.",
    "A survey course of the important thoughts of intellectual figures of Germany. I think the course should be renamed as German Critical Theory or German Intellectual History. Henry is a nice guy but this course is not that organized. People need to have some foundations of basic cultural and literary theory to get more from this course. Otherwise, it is completely easy to get loss. This course does not live up to my high expectations overall. Not a very solid course. If you do want to learn, I suggest you talk to Anna. She is sweet and helpful! Henry is also a very nice person but I suggest you take a course with him when you already know some Nietzsche, Brecht, Derrida. I would also suggest you read the Oxford short introductions of Nietzsche, Marx, Freud, Hegel, Derrida while taking this course. They are super helpful for me as a novice. Otherwise, the course is a bit too much for beginners.",
    "Hmm. Maybe? Depends on what you're looking for. The reading list is phenomenal. Class time sometimes seems like a waste.",
    "As I took the class to fulfill a requirement for the German major, I would say take it only if you are seriously interested in German ideology.",
    "Depends. You have to like reading and working in the rhetoric of specific philosophers. You have to like taking time on the reading, and you must like thinking about what you read.",
    "Yes, I would like to force others to take this class so that world peace can be finally achieved.",
    "This course was really great. I would recommend it even to someone who already feels familiar with the authors we study. We learned a lot of different techniques of approaching crucial texts of Marx, Freud, Brecht and Nietzsche. We focused mainly on a single author's different voices and his development through texts.",
    "Absolutely. it's material that's really worth absorbing."
