   "comments": [
    "I have already recommended this course to fellow students. While the reading load is heavy, it is all relevant and very interesting. The world-wide scope of the course guarantees that there will be subjects which will be new to students of any regional or functional speciality in history, political science or international relations.",
    "History 980 provides a comprehensive introduction to historical genocides, from antiquity to very recent occurrences. Seminar sessions are supplemented by guest speakers. I would not hesitate to recommend this course to a fellow student - Professor Kiernan is a very talented seminar leader, and a very open and patient instructor. It might be helpful in making a decision to note that this course is not so heavy on theory - either historiographical or legal - and much more an opportunity for exposure to narratives of past (and present) genocides.",
    "If you are interested in studying genocide beyond acknowledging the fact that it is bad, this is a great course. It examines different patterns and elements of genocide through weekly case studies.",
    "Fantastic: take it; the material is challenging and provocative - it really makes you think!",
    "This is one of the few courses you can take that stretches from antiquity to the present. It's like a greatest hits of world history! The class considers many of the most interesting events and processes from the early modern era to the present, providing a connective line that you wouldn't see without genocide as a lens. I would recommend this class to anyone in history, political science, sociology, EP&E, IR, or even biology. It's particularly useful for students interested in human rights, nationalism, the study of race, colonialism, the rise of modernity, or even political and military history.",
    "Yes - I learned a lot and possibly the main thing I took away was how important it is to spread information about genocides through history so that we don't fall into the same pitfalls... basically, yes I would recommend it.",
    "Yes, because it diversifies one's knowledge outside a specialist area."

   "comments": [
    "This course was useful in giving me some exposure to international law and the relationship between law and history, which will be helpful in my future work.",
    "It gave me a great support of comparative knowledge for my studies of 20th century European war&society.",
    "I gained a new way of looking at history. I was able to integrate my view of things that had seemed separate or disconnected before taking the course. I also experienced how to look at things in an inter-disciplinary way, making use of the methods of history, political science, and sociology. Many of the ideas presented in Blood and Soil and in the discussions, such as the agrarian myth, have opened up new doors for me intellectually. I began to learn and explore some underlying and fundamental themes that were totally new to me and will keep me thinking for a long time to come.",
    "It seriously opened my eyes to a lot of things that have gone on in the world and has given me a fresh angle from which to approach my studies, my area of focus. That's vague, I know. To a great extent it will contribute to my future research."
