   "comments": [
    "I would summarize it as learning about the basics of statistical mechanics and understanding how to derive other things using them. I would recommend it.",
    "I would highly recommend this class to other students, because it really helps in future research and is very enjoyable to learn. And the instructor is great.",
    "I recommend to take this course, however, it takes lot of time. So plan to take this course with many classes will not be a good choice.",
    "This class focuses on how to incorporate statistics of a large sample to the quantum mechanical systems. The class starts with an introduction of general statistical calculations and derivations then investigates many simple systems using these tools. I would recommend this class to a student if he\/she were interested discovering how to derive properties of a many particle system, because it is not easy but very interesting and useful.",
    "No -- Batista is absolutely terrible, so take it with someone else if you can. The material is pretty interesting though.",
    "Its good",
    "A very difficult course that will require a lot of you if you are true to finishing all the assignments. The course was very insightful and mind opening in many ways and yet for me personally it was often difficult to move beyond memorizing the examples given and applying the principles to broader concepts."

    "It successfully connects what we've learn into one piece: quantum mechanics and classical mechanics. I think it deepens my knowledge of my discipline and would have an essential impact on my future research. It is a very good starting point and I really appreciate it.",
    "Going through lecture notes with derivations deepen my knowledge.",
    "I now have a much better grasp on many different calculations and derivations as well as writing code for simulations.",
    "It was awsum",
    "This course gave me a greater understanding of what is occuring in the background of molecular dynamics simulations and their short comings."
