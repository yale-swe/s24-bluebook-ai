    "You learn a lot of Greek! If you're good at inflected languages, it's entirely doable. It's a shame Professor Fisher won't be teaching it again, since that means it won't be as laid back as it was this term, but I still recommend the class--and the language--most highly if the intensive course is offered again.",
    "It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s difficult tosay much meaningful about this class without Jay, who shaped pretty much everything about our experience in the course. That said, if it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s offered again it will definitely be a lot of work--expect anywhere from one to three hours a night for coursework in addition to the class time, and there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s very little time to stop and breathe. It also just takes up a lot of time in virtue of being two hours a day, five days a week (which is actually surprisingly easy to get used to--compared to some of my seminars, sitting through Greek every day was a breeze). It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pretty much guaranteed to become a more significant part of your life than a normal class, which is for the most part a good thing, just be prepared for it. And if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re serious (or just impatient) about learning Greek, this may be the best and is definitely the fastest way to do it. We finished both the entire textbook and Plato\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Apology, along with a few shorter readings, by the end of the course. Greek is a joy to read, and the Apology is really wonderful, whether you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve read it in translation before or not. The class is difficult, but very rewarding and absolutely worth it--it can be tough to always feel on the edge of your ability, but at the end you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be surprised by how much you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve learned. Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be scared off by the \u00e2\u0080\u009cintensive\u00e2\u0080\u009d in the title; I was terrified at the beginning of the semester and so happy I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d taken it by the end. If you want to do it, you can.",
    "This class was exactly as described: intensive. It takes a big commitment in terms of both time and effort, but with that being said, it was absolutely fantastic.This class did a wonderful job of covering the grammatical aspects of Greek, while still spending a significant part of the semester simply reading Greek. I never imagined that I would be able to read Ancient Greek in its original form with such comfort after only a single semester, but with the class, I read the whole of Plato's Apology as well as parts of other works.If your goal is to learn the language, this is definitely the course for you. If you are willing to put int the work, the reward is well worth it.",
    "This course was absolutely amazing. We got from not even knowing the Greek alphabet in many cases to reading two entire original texts (Xenophon and Plato's Apologies). It was a lot of hard work, and we moved through the grammar so fast that it was as if we didn't have time to realize how much we were learning. We really bonded as a class- it's the type of class you would only take if you already loved dead languages and were really interested in committing to learning one, but that commitment paid off 110%. Do know, however, that a lot of what made this class so wonderful depended on the professor, who won't be returning. ABSOLUTELY shop this class if it's still offered, because chances are someone amazing will be teaching it, but make sure you mesh well with the professor's teaching style, because otherwise you will be in for a very long, very rough semester.",
    "Ancient Greek was the defining course of my semester, and it's no cakewalk. You will definitely spend 2 credits' worth of time and effort on theclass, but it's also immensely rewarding to watch your ability progress every day. In what other setting could you start with learning the alphabet in January and finish Plato's Apology by May? It's a great foundation for further study of Greek, and I definitely encourage anyone interested in language, Classics, religion, or philosophy to take the course."
