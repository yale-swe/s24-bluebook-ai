    "This is always a great way to sharpen performance skills. I highly recommend it for someone interested in performing musical theater.",
    "This class changes depending on the teacher. I've loved it with other teachers but Nancy's version was a lot of talking, some singing and not a lot of learning...",
    "I guess I would recommend it. If it had a different teacher, absolutely.",
    "depends a lot on who is teaching. nancy was the best. she was very vocally technical. annette was completely different. she was very acty.",
    "I would absolutely recommend the class--it's a ton a fun to sing and perform, and you learn a good deal, especially if the teacher is a good one.",
    "Yes... from what I have heard, each instructor really goes his or her own way with the course, so I can only speak of the course with Nancy. Just be prepared for an unstructured course and a lot of talking. But if you want to go into Musical Theatre, Nancy really is a great resource and will be honest about where you stand as a performer and what you need to do to improve."
