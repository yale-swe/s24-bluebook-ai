   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend this class! The course is very fun; it could have been more organized, but Professor Lalli is knowledgeable, caring, and an all-around fantastic teacher. He assigns some great rep, also. Ultimately, I think the class is what you make of it. I learned around 10 songs (7 French, 3 American) for my recital in conjunction with the class, and Sara Kohane's coaching was absolutely invaluable to that. If I hadn't been preparing for a recital, though, it might have been harder to focus and use the class to its fullest extent.",
    "I would recommend the class strongly to students who are interested in perfecting their public singing abilities.",
    "Take this class. No matter what your level of seriousness about vocal music is, this class will help you. In the past, people of all levels have enrolled and have all found that it helped their singing and understanding of the voice immeasurably.",
    "A very relaxed class that i would highly recommend to get into artsong more in a friendly environment and expand one's repertoire",
    "If you want to sing classical music, you should take every single opportunity to learn repertoire and sing in front of your peers. It is invaluable. The class can move a little slowly, but hearing other people is also so useful for learning new repertoire. I highly recommend it."
