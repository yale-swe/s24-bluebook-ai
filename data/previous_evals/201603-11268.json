   "comments": [
    "You learn a lot about structures and beams and how they react to different forces and torques applied onto them.",
    "analytical skills",
    "Learned about statics and mechanics",
    "With this class, you learn how to apply physics problems to real life. If you've taken Mechanical Design (MENG 180), it's kind of a repeat and extension of that course.",
    "I learned a ton of practical MechE knowledge in this class: a lot more than in any of the other MechE classes I have taken (and I'm taking this as a Senior, hahaha). Failure from axial loads, torsion, bending, buckling, etc... as well as stress concentrations, which can be really useful because a part with a circular hole in it will be a lot weaker than you expect!",
    "As a prospective Mechanical Engineering student, I wanted to take this intro level engineering course. The material covered in class was actually interesting. You learn about everything that is in equilibrium, basically everything that is not moving, which is always good because you can actually solve for a lot of things. The course also lets you see if this type of engineering is actually what you are looking for. You learn to use engineer's tables and different properties of material types you have not heard in your life.",
    "This course taught me invaluable problem-solving skills by challenging me to understand how\/when\/why to apply certain formulae to assess certain static structures- I always felt like this course was about process and not an exact 'answer,' which created a healthy environment of multifaceted discovery and inquiry. We began by building a toolkit- understanding concepts like shear and normal stress, material properties, and how applied loadings affect resultant internal stress distributions in beams, for instance- and later used these tools in tandem to solve general design problems.",
    "This course has given me an understanding of how and why materials fail. It has given me a toolkit for evaluating structural integrity. The same principles can also be used for design. Additionally, we learned how to use the machine shop in an extra credit assignment.",
    "ME 280 helps you develop a working knowledge of the relevant considerations to take into account when dealing with simple static situations (like columns, beams, pressure vessels, etc.).",
    "The skills to interpret physical systems given different conditions and basic engineering skills.",
    "We learned methods of failure in mechanical systems, which was basically a more in-depth and applied version of introductory physics. We learned how to analyze systems, utilize resources that are used in real-life engineering, and solve new types of problems.",
    "I learned so much! I began walking around looking at structures differently and thinking about how they were built to achieve equilibrium. I definitely improved in drawing Free Body Diagrams and determining which equations had to applied in which situations.",
    "The ability to evaluate strength and potential failure of structural materials, familiarity with basic mechanical engineering concepts when it comes to designing.",
    "I learned how to analyze the stresses on members of structures, trusses, beams, etc. I learned about different types of stresses, and various modes of failure",
    "This class is foundational to the Mechanical Engineering discipline. It helps solidify an understanding of physics and ensures that you understand the mechanics behind materials and how they can deform.",
    "I gained knowledge about engineering structures and how they react under certain loads.Also gained training in the machine shop.",
    "Nice introduction to the practical reasoning that surrounds engineering problems. Interesting class!",
    "Advanced physics, failure via bending, buckling, torsion, etc, some material science",
    "I learned a lot of information about the failure due to various loads and how to appropriately design an object so as to be able to withstand the necessary loads that it will be subjected to. A very good course that serves as a backbone for all Mechanical Engineering.",
    "definitely needed for anyone studying engineering. learned about how physical things react and work pretty cool",
    "I learned how the world works a little bit better",
    "Learned valuable engineering skills to apply to building structures, as a civil or mechanical engineer would do. These concepts were vital for an engineer to understand structures and materials.",
    "Knowledge about various engineering stresses and how various physical systems utilize and mitigate these stresses. Skills in analyzing and computing stresses when idealized as point or distributed loads. Insight about how real engineering from this foundational class.",
    "Great look into how materials fail and where. I had fun in this course",
    "Throughout this course, I gained new insights into the application of physics knowledge to the design of structures and objects. It was a new experience to put test problems to practice, and to gain a new understanding in how the concepts learned in previous classes can be applied in real-world scenarios.",
    "I learned how to analyze how different forces can affect the integrity of structures and beams.",
    "I learned how to analyze mechanical systems such as trusses and beam loadings.",
    "This course covers the first set of basic things to know for mechanical engineering."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Very fast-paced course. We only did one lecture a week, with an additional problem solving session in place of the second lecture. I didn't like this format, and would have much rather had two lectures a week to clarify the material and go over it more thoroughly.",
    "Very good first engineering class. Not too intense but you definitely learn a lot.",
    "He taught it as a flipped class, so we had one lecture a week and one problem session a week. It allows you to practice problems beyond homework, which is helpful for both doing the homework and the exams.",
    "I love how every other class period is devoted to solving problems! However, my main difficulty with this class was that sometimes the assigned problems for homework do not directly follow from the examples in the book or in class, which makes it difficult to proceed. I think it would be better if the most complicated variant we would be expected to complete on a pset would be covered in the problem session, instead of just the easiest examples. I think less time could be spent on easy problems in the problem session, and more time on the hard ones. In the same line of reasoning, it would also be better if the more difficult situations were talked about in lecture more. And finally, it would be helpful if more time was spent trying to tie all the material together. I got fairly good at each principle in isolation, but when I tried to put things together sometimes I got contradictory results.",
    "I think this is a really important course considering it is the first real engineering course for mechanical engineering students. However, I did not like how the course was structured. It is a flipped classroom, although I understand that there have been studies proving this is a good thing, I do not agree. I would prefer if this course was more lecture intensive. The lectures in the class covered really few material and more time were spent on problem sessions, however, even during the problem sessions only 3 problems per 75 minutes were solved and I do not think that is an effective method of learning. I would like to see more theory and explanation of the formulae. Problem sessions could still exist but it could be made optional once a week maybe during office hours, but t have it in class reduces the already limited amount of lecture time to really few and I feel like I spent more time learning from the textbook than I did in class.",
    "I loved that towards the end of the course, we were asked to tackle real-world design problems! It was so exciting, satisfying, and challenging to apply the sum total of the skills we learned, integrating concepts from the entire text and all lectures to essentially answer- \"what will structurally fail?\".",
    "The lectures introducing the material were usually very good, as were the in-class problems. The p-sets could be tedious; I wished there were more open-ended design-type problems.",
    "I thought Prof. Brown did a good job with the lectures, though I wish we could have worked a few basic, conceptual example problems into the lectures. The problem sessions were helpful but felt a little poorly run (we spent a long time waiting on problems where if we didn't know how to do them we would just sit and wait for the solution. I think the problem sessions would work better if we walked through the problems step-by-step with pauses to try individual pieces for ourselves\/guess the next step. I thought the exams were fair but I wish we had spent time in the leadup to the final (which was designed to simulate real engineering scenarios by requiring you to check for a variety of potential failure conditions) going over the relevant things to check when approaching different kinds of problems. It felt weird going into the final knowing that we had not had a chance to practice any of this new kind of problem. In that vein, it would have been very helpful if practice exams had been distributed.",
    "The teachings skills of the professor were very low and teaching assistants were very excluded. In my experience the they were unhelpful and often left me more confused than informed. The professor tried to teach the class in a \"backwards fashion\" where we would do practice problems in class, but most of the time was filled with awkward silence and I was better off reading the textbook by myself and learning through online videos.",
    "I really liked the structure of the course with the problem sessions and lectures. I would have liked more organization and structure to the lectures as it felt like I had to spend more time learning new material outside of class. Equations were sometimes haphazardly introduced as a \"oh yeah, you need this\" afterthought.",
    "This is a great course for teaching the beginnings of what it means to be a mechanical engineer. I wish there had been some sort of final project or real application of our knowledge.",
    "This course was very well organized and there was always help available. The textbook was very good and the lectures, psets, and tests aligned perfectly and were very fair. Additionally, the class was very enjoyable and the material was very interesting and applies easily to the real world.",
    "This class is semi-flipped in a sense that there is a problem session each week to fully understand the concepts taught in a previous class. This could be very helpful, though sometimes the lecture could be quite confusing in that certain things would have to wait until the problem session to become clear.",
    "I didn't think there was very good feedback, and I got absolutely murdered on the homeworks because of it. Everyone else was just getting answers off the internet, but since I don't have a chegg account I was having to try to figure it out on my own and apparently not getting there. My athletic schedule made it impossible for me to come to office hours and prevented me from even attempting the extra credit assignment so that was just icing on the cake. I really felt like I fell through the cracks of this course. I don't know how any of those things would be remedied, or even if they need to be addressed since my situation is so rare. I was probably not smart enough to be here anyway so it's actually probably fine the way it is",
    "The course was pretty standard in terms of STEM courses at Yale in that it had weekly problem sets, two midterms and a final. The professor and TFs did try their best to be available and engage students during lecture, but I think it didn't always work. The fact that problem set deadlines shifted twice during the semester from Tuesdays to Thursdays along with the office hour schedule made it difficult to balance with prior commitments. It was also taught in a half lecture, half problem session manner which was helpful in the sense that a lot of students often complain that STEM courses don't teach you how to actually apply what you learn to problems but unhelpful in the sense that the material for a chapter or sometimes more than a chapter was crammed into 75 minutes. The thought was that there would be outside work done to understand the concepts fully, but I don't believe many students actually did that. I think if perhaps a mandatory study hall instead to learn how problems are applied or to spend time discussing with TFs were implemented (kind of like the PHYS 180\/181 sequence), that may have been more useful.",
    "Good course Good textbook Good problem sets Good exams",
    "The structure of somewhat of a flipped classroom\/lecture was good.",
    "The material itself was dry, but professor was good!",
    "The course was set up well, where each week comprised of 2 lectures, one on new material, and the other focused on solving problems pertaining to the upcoming problem set. The lecture was pretty interactive for a MENG course and structured well. However, there didn't ever seem to be a big picture to summarize the intent of the course.",
    "very good course",
    "It is a pretty good class in all respects",
    "Everything about the course was geared towards helping us learn. There was no fluff or busy work, though there was a lot of work.",
    "The course felt quite scattered as there were a variety of different sources for each chapter. A single more comprehensive material would have been nice.",
    "A day of notes and a day of practice problems suited this class very well, however outside of this the course material (as in all the videos and readings) was overwhelming and not super organized. It took until the first midterm to figure out how to best prepare for this class under the time constraints of college.",
    "I thought it was fantastic until the final, which was ridiculously hard",
    "This class had a lot of opportunities for extra help, and Professor Brown clearly cared that everyone was learning and understanding real-world applications, which was great, but the class itself suffered from being very low energy and uninspiring.",
    "The course covers a wide range of statics problems, and it takes a let of time in each topic. That said, the lectures are not engaging and half the course periods consist of problem sessions. Overall the class was disorganized, with different information coming from lecture, textbook, and video lectures from another professor.",
    "I enjoyed the structure of the course in that half of the classes were lecture-style, and half of them were problem sessions, meaning that we were both able to understand the concepts and the problems which we were expected to complete for homework and exams. However, I wish that the class would allow for greater application, such as through the originally-intended design project slated for the end of the semester which was cut. I was excited to have that opportunity, but disappointed that it was no longer an option.",
    "I wish there were more discussion of conceptual questions, like those qualitative problems given in the textbook (I would find these very useful in my life, where I might have to make analyses on the fly). I like the collaborative atmosphere, and I hope that is kept up.",
    "I liked how the class was semi-flipped, so we did lecture one class and problems the next. I think however the classes could have been taught in a more engaging way. Also, I agree with the premise of the final, that in engineering you often don't know exactly what failure mode you're looking for, but I would have been really informative, interesting, and helpful to have done a few problems like that in class.",
    "The lectures were pretty boring because the material was, although sometimes difficult, very straightforward.",
    "To be honest, this course was pretty boring. I suppose that is something that may be hard to avoid for an intro level course. I thought the pacing was too slow; every class seemed to stretch on for far longer than 75 minutes even though in reality it didn't. I didn't think much information was covered each class, and that covered was very easy to understand. On in-class-problems days, we only would get through 2-3 problems, and those were not too difficult either. I wish there was an advanced version of this course, where we could learn more related content. That would speed up the pace and keep me engaged. The parts I found most helpful to my understanding were the homework problems. I think I learned most of this course through using the equations through practice."

   "comments": [
    "I didn't really enjoy this class. It could have been taught better, and didn't need to be as fast-paced. Be prepared to put in a lot of work on your own to understand the material.",
    "Yes! Wonderful professor and TAs, relaxed class structure with only one lecture a week and then a problem session during the other class period to practice applying what we learned.",
    "I would recommend this course because it's interactive and allows you to understand real life problems. Both TAs and Eric were great at answering questions, and they really want you to do well, so they'll make sure to help you.",
    "Probably the best bang for your buck of any MechE class in terms of teaching you what you really need to know to design things! Definitely take this class with Professor Brown if you can. I am really glad I didn't take it last year, because Professor Brown did such a terrific job.",
    "This is a required class for mech e majors, so it doesn't really matter if I recommend it or not. I hope the structure of it changes though.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course! While at first it seems like a very typical STEM course, learning general skills about material statics & mechanics, by the end you are able to understand (to an extent) a structure in its totality- all of its internal resultant loadings, why and where failure will likely occur. It was very satisfying to take a course that taught you sequentially towards a culminating end: understanding how to assess a static structure given specific parameters or a design goal.",
    "I would recommend this course to any student who is interested in engineering and wants to get a taste of the discipline. However, if engineering does not intrigue you then you should stay away.",
    "You're probably taking it because you have to, but the material is genuinely pretty interesting and feels very \"real\" in that we discuss practical considerations for designing bridges, airplanes, etc.",
    "Yes, it's a great course to take. It's practically mandatory for any MENG major, but it is also a very detailed and important class for other types of engineering.",
    "YES! I loved this course and really enjoyed applying math and physics in the engineering context. The class helped me to better understand what engineering is exactly and how mechanical engineers conduct their work. I learned so much throughout this course and it reinforced my decision to pursue engineering.",
    "Eric Brown is an awesome instructor and the class taught by him is very engaging overall. He is willing to get close to students and answer questions to great details. It's a wonderful class for introduction.",
    "If you're taking it, it's probably because it's required. Just buy a chegg account from day one, get full credit for all the homework assignments, and then because you know you're doing the homework problems correctly you'll probably do better on the tests, whereas I was just totally lost. It also helps to not be an idiot, another reason I should have maybe steered clear of this one",
    "Nearly everyone in this course is an engineering major, so there is likely no need to recommend this course as you'll probably end up having to take it. I believe that the course does provide you with good material and the textbook utilized (Hiebbler, 4th ed.) is fantastic. There should be no surprises with this course, given that it is structured similarly to the rest of the engineering curriculum at Yale.",
    "Yes. Good material and good professor",
    "Take this class of you're an engineer.",
    "Don't take it if you don't have to",
    "If you want to take a mechanical engineering course, this is a pretty good one to take. The material is based on basic principles of physics and is pretty palatable. The applications can be quite difficult, but that is something to be said about all engineering courses. I would recommend this course if you are interested in learning a bit about engineering without wanting to worry about learning some of the more advanced, less intuitive principles.",
    "yes, definitely needed for anyone studying engineering. learned about how physical things react and work pretty cool...wish i had gone to class more",
    "I recommend this course",
    "This course is super important to learn fundamental engineering concepts regarding building structures with specific materials. It is very applicable to the work you would do as an engineer. That being said, it is a challenging course with a large workload.",
    "If a student has any desire to understand the foundations of why physical systems are built the way that they are (besides aesthetics) this is a good class to take. The work is fair and probably the best tool to understand the material.",
    "I loved the material in this course and Eric Brown is a great instructor. All the TAs were dynamite too.",
    "As we all know it's required for the major, wouldn't take it otherwise. Take it with Brown rather than Dr. P if possible. Prof Brown cares a lot about your learning, and you should definitely go to him for help if you need it. The textbook is good and some of the material interesting, but I did not find the course inspiring at all.",
    "I would recommend the course to a prospective engineering student as it is interesting to see physics concepts become tangible, even if the teaching style doesn't bring them to life. In that sense, I would almost treat it like another prerequisite class, and therefore would not advise it to non-majors.",
    "I took this course as an architecture major looking for a more rigorous alternative to the \"Structures\" class offered within the department. I got what I went looking for: I feel like I learned usable, real-world mechanics. I was very satisfied with the openness of the professor, and the flipped-classroom element (though I honestly didn't watch any of the lectures outside of class) gave great opportunities for learning through group problem-solving. It's nothing fancy, but if you are in a situation like mine it could be ideal.",
    "It made me sure that I like mechanical engineering.",
    "I would recommend this course to Mechanical Engineering majors, however, it does not seem to have much relevance to students of other majors.",
    "If you are a Mechanical Engineering major, this course is required, so there is not much choice. Although it is a fairly easy course (except for the final exam), it was poorly taught. The class sessions did not prep me well for the problem sets; in class we only went over the most basic of equations and concepts whereas some homework problems asked us to apply them in complicated and often unusual ways.",
    "Since this course is required for mechanical engineering students, I don't think I can say much. If this course isn't required, I would not recommend taking it \"for fun.\""
