   "comments": [
    "If you're BME, you have to take this class. If you aren't BME, there are better classes you can take. That said, the fault here is not on the teacher, Levene, who is a great teacher that you should definitely take a class with, but on the curriculum, which is based on tedious lab techniques that don't actually aid in understanding.",
    "It's the continuation of BENG 355L, so if you took that, then you have to take this. The class is okay, less LabView intensive, which is great. All of the 2 week labs in this class actually took 2 weeks though, which was a bit annoying.",
    "A required lab, but pretty interesting labs to do. Even if they don't directly relate to your track, they are topics that will come up in many other classes. All the labs are two weeks, so a report is only due every other week.",
    "Not exactly 'fun' so I wouldn't take it if you aren't BME. Then again you probably aren't allowed to take it if you aren't majoring in BME so this question is kind of useless. If you take the class its basically 6 labs throughout the semester (most are two week labs). Levene is a tough grader but the TA's seem to be more fair. MAKE SURE YOU HAVE A GOOD LAB GROUP.",
    "Professor Levene was a wonderful lab professor and very interactive! He answered all my questions and I really felt like I learned the material. Highly recommended!",
    "This lab is manageable, especially now that they've made a few changes to each lab. Work hard on the lab reports and understand the labs. You'll need to know theories and concepts for the lab final!",
    "You have to take this lab for BME. Some of the labs are interesting, but some of them don't really apply to anything else you'll see in the major. It's still more work than a half credit lab should be.",
    "Required lab for bme. It's basically the same as Beng 355L, just with a focus more on signals and systems. It's nice because this semester's lab matches up better with Beng352 than 355 and 351 match up. About the same amount of work as last semester's lab.",
    "It's an ok lab, but needs a lot of work. It is required so there is no point in recommending it.",
    "The labs aren't particularly interesting but aren't that painful either. Lab reports are only due every other week, and most days you won't end up working until 5 so it's better that most other labs."
