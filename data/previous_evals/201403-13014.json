    "This capstone course was an amazing experience, and why I chose to be a Global Affairs Major. I thought the topic was a synthesis of concepts and ideas presented in previous classes but a new field I had little exposure to previously. Working in a group allowed me to accomplish more than I would have been able to solo and it was rewarding to see the final product. Working with such a large organization was also a very unique experience and opportunity.",
    "Ugh. This capstone. Just to preface, we probably had the worst capstone experience out of all of the groups. We consulted for UNICEF on public private partnerships in early childhood education in the developing world, which sounds fascinating, but unfortunately turned out to be nothing of the sort. To make a long story short, our client changed objectives on us multiple times, which made it hard to make any real progress. All of the work took place in the last 3 weeks, and that involved interviewing experts over skype and regurgitating their thoughts in a 70+ page report. There was little critical thought involved and I'm sure UNICEF could have just as easily done this themselves (was there any point in our work?) There was no support from Jackson during all of this, but more unfortunate is that this capstone is supposed to be the culmination of your time at Yale. But, when I look at some of the senior theses my friends are writing, and then look at my senior capstone, I feel...unaccomplished, and I really feel like this is something I'll regret. On the bright side, the capstone group was wonderful and we all got along well.",
    "Choose a capstone that has been well-defined. We didn't have an instructor to begin with, which should have been a red flag. But the material itself was very interesting. Just make sure you and the client are on the same page starting on day one.",
    "This course was a let-down. I had chosen Global Affairs as my major for the prospect of doing a capstone project with a real organization, doing work that would create some sort of tangible, useful product. In reality, however, this project felt very scattered and certainly not like the culmination of my major, which is what thesis-type work is supposed to be. It felt like just another course, except consisting entirely of a loosely organized group project with diluted responsibility and little accountability. Perhaps it was different for the other capstones, but for the UNICEF group, it felt that the work we produced by the end was not very substantial and did not add anything to UNICEF's operations or even to the body of knowledge about Early Childhood Education. It was difficult working on a project that theoretically aimed to examine the ECE landscape in developing countries, when we were sitting in Yale classrooms so far removed from the object of our study, and unable to really do anything besides some Skype calls, which were interesting but not terribly revealing or rigorous sources of evidence to generalize any themes. UNICEF was not helpful as a client. They did not give us much instruction, and we had very limited contact with them throughout, meaning for much of the semester we were left relatively clueless about what exactly they wanted from us. The project they gave us was incredibly vague and broad, whereas an assignment with a more narrow focus may have led to better, more interesting, useful outcomes. It felt like we did a 90-page report that was summarizing things UNICEF certainly already knows, and adding nothing particularly special. Sure, they were nice and told us good work, but of course they are going to say that. Even when we gave our presentation to the rest of the major at Horchow hall, we got a lot of negative feedback about how the presentation was not good, the focus was not clear, the project itself was not well-defined, and the whole thing was really just unfortunate compared to the other capstone projects. In the end, I feel that the lack of communication with the client and the incredibly broad assignment, plus the fact that there were 8 students per group, made for an incredibly less-than-ideal capstone experience. Even if the group had been 4 people instead of 8, that would have been much better, because each of us would have had to put in significantly more personal work and have fewer people to hold accountable and less diffusion of responsibility. I loved my group members, but I think we all agree that it would have felt more substantial had the group been smaller. I envy my peers who are doing theses that they feel incredibly passionate about, and that they are proud of at the end because of all the hard work they invested. Plus, our advisor was not particularly knowledgeable about UNICEF or ECE in developing countries. Our weekly meetings were tedious. It just didn't feel like I got the experience I had signed up for. Again, it seems that some groups did have a great experience and really fascinating results that they can be proud of, so perhaps the UNICEF group was just the unfortunate outlier to an otherwise good idea. The capstone project is incredibly unique to circumstances beyond your control, so go into it with a positive attitude, beware of the possibility that it will not live up to your expectations, and if that's the case DO something to change it so that by the end you will not feel like it was kind of a waste of time. Or do a thesis for something else if you want that feeling of pride and culmination of all your studies at Yale, because this was not it."
