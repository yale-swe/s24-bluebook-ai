    "It was very interesting.",
    "I initially was intimidated at the detail in which we evaluated discussion papers. I am a public health student and haven't really critically analyzed laboratory based papers to the level we did in this class.Coming in I felt that this course was a little out of my league, but I really learned that with enough time I could understand the principles and rationale behind a laboratory experiment. It was to the point where I felt as an active participant in the discussions that Immunology PhD students were having. The selected papers were always challenging but I noticed that after spring break these papers were manageable and I wouldn't be stressed about learning lab techniques I never heard of before.The guest lecturers were interesting but the strength of this class were the discussions lead by my peers."

    "Instructor: Diane McMahon-Pratt \u00a0She was very knowledgeable and presented the material well.",
    "Instructor: Diane McMahon-Pratt \u00a0Dr. McMahon-Pratt did a good job selecting speakers. I've had a few courses that had a substantial portion of guest speakers, I would rank this course as having some of the most interesting lectures.I particularly enjoyed Dr. Capello, Dr. Ruddle, the Game Theory lecture, the HPV lecture, and the nanotechnology talk. I believe that Diane had the proper balance of contributing to the lectures when appropriate.The discussions as I stated earlier were really enjoyable. I think that she did a good job facilitating during these sessions. Though it was a lot of work, I wouldn't mind having even more discussions."
