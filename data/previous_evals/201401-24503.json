   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this class. I think it's important for humanities students to engage with the underlying theories of the work they are doing. I hope that in future iterations, though, the readings will be streamlined and the discussions will be more robust.",
    "HIST 129J is a challenging, strenuous course that will take patience and an open-mind to tackle. The readings are dense and require re-reading. Many of the topics are also difficult to grasp (especially if you aren't knowledgeable about LGBT philosophy and history). Overall, I would recommend it, however, because it is a rewarding course that teaches one very important concepts in history and theory of history.",
    "This class is challenging but extremely rewarding. Many of the texts are ones that influence how American Studies is taught and thought of as a discipline, so it is extremely helpful to take it as an American Studies major. Professor LaFleur is an amazing professor who deeply cares about her students and will always take the time to help you through these theoretical works.",
    "Yes!"
