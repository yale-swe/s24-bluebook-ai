   "comments": [
    "This course offers a linearly conceived progression of art history that helps to emphasize the interconnectivity of different cultures which otherwise might be obscured by the apparent disparities between them. It also helps in the development of techniques of visual analysis through frequent trips to the art gallery, and in depth analysis in lectures.",
    "I developed a better understanding of art from Prehistoric up to the Renaissance. Despite it being such a large time frame, I learned specifics from each large era that we discussed in class.",
    "I learned how to visually analyze artwork, in addition to more specific details about the history of art.",
    "A greater understanding of the broad scope of the history of Western Art. Practice at visual analysis.",
    "This class improved my analysis and understanding of a variety different periods of art. I usually enjoy seeing more modern art, but now I have an appreciation of ancient and medieval art, which I consider an invaluable thing to have. I believe that I have a wealth of understanding and knowledge that I did not before, which is the one thing that one seek out of a class instead of a grade or distributional requirement.",
    "Honestly, not much. 98% of this course is memorization, plus 2% of visual analysis. For those who are not going to major in HSAR, the information we memorized are not going to be very useful.",
    "The course allowed students to develop their visual analysis skills as it applies to works of art throughout the range of civilizations and times covered in the course. It also elucidated the social, political, historical and artistic significance of various works of art.",
    "Learned how to distinguish Gothic vs Romanesque style, characteristics of Middle Eastern Art, Ancient Roman art, Ancient Greek art, influences etc.",
    "I practiced visual analysis, learning to observe with awareness of the intellectual framework of the work of art. I memorized basic information about seminal works of Western art until the beginning of the Renaissance.",
    "I learned to memorize quickly and to continually store information about artworks to use for thematic and continuity essays.",
    "I can differentiate between different modes of architecture, painting, statuary and etc. I can identify\/speculate approximately which time period\/culture an item belongs to based on the customs\/modes it follows.",
    "If you're someone with 0 knowledge of art this class will at the very least let you go through an art gallery without feeling too much like a moron. Definitely introduces you to early western art and the foundations that it laid for the future",
    "I definitely learned how to visually analyse art, rather than to simply understand works from their historical context. In terms of knowledge the course was very comprehensive in tracing the development of art from prehistory to the Renaissance.",
    "I learned a lot about art and history, as well as themes that have transcended time.",
    "I learned how to distinguish and appreciate sculptures, architectures and paintings of this period of art.",
    "I really enjoyed my first art history class, because it taught me so much about art, which I had never really considered. I also learned to write much more concisely."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The course is taught very well and is incredibly interesting- content wise, it could not be improved. However, sometimes the way in which supplementary materials were presented (image lists, slides from class, the classesv2 site) were difficult to access, which makes it harder to study.",
    "The course was very appealing and interesting to me. The lectures were great because Professor Jung taught them like a story rather than just facts. This kept the course very engaging throughout the entire semester.",
    "The lectures were quite interesting and my section was one of the highlights of my week. Major concepts were emphasized and works of art selected appropriately.",
    "Rote memorization of art objects is an ineffective teaching tool.",
    "The problem with this class is that you cover so much material so fast (which you have to because it is a survey); therefore, you are the expert of nothing and things sometimes seem cursory.",
    "Weakness: The lecture has too many technical problems. The auditorium isn't the best place for this class, since only 30+ people are taking it, and the whole auditorium is so empty. The professor has very little engagement\/ interaction with students in this class, compare to many other classes that I was taking. It almost appear to me that she doesn't really care about how students are doing. Her lectures offer no more insights than what's already in the textbook. Strengths: section with Selin is great. Being inside YUAG and many other places on campus really helped me applying some of the skills that I gained in class.",
    "The lectures could be a little more organized and unifying themes more emphasized. Otherwise, Professor Jung was an excellent lecturer, and the discussion sections help solidify and expand on what was taught during lecture.",
    "More detailed slides with a mention of the most significant aspects of the artpieces.",
    "Memorization of dates should be less emphasized. While I find having an idea of the chronology of the works fundamental, knowing the exact begin and end dates of every work was not very useful.",
    "Strengths: Everything! Weaknesses: The exam seats are very uncomfortable. Necks hurt for several hours after the final.",
    "There are a lot of materials to memorize which makes it almost impossible for anyone to get a decent grade. Also towards the end of the term the stuff we studied became less and less differentiable which made me question whether or not it was fair to expect students to identify a cathedral by looking at a single ambiguous shot of its interiors.",
    "Some areas and arts aren't covered but a lot is covered in a short time",
    "There was a lot of reading that was unnecessary.",
    "Strengths: The fast speed of class. I love the way that there is no waste time in this class. Weaknesses: 1. Some of the images used in class were not identified with their information, which was a little confusing. 2. The exam questions (identification) are too difficult for students taking Credit\/D\/Fail. You are required to remember all the information, like name\/location\/date even if it might not be your initial purpose."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "I would highly recommend this course- as an overview of art history, which is something everyone should take- it is an excellent class. Interesting, useful, and engaging, this class is absolutely worth taking.",
    "I would recommend this class because it is very interesting. There is a lot of reading that comes along with this course, however if you enjoy history and art then it does not feel like a burden.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student because art history is fascinating and more applicable to real life than most realize. From the architecture around us to the religion we practice, art history is relevant to a broad range people and situations.",
    "Yes, if they are interested in art history.",
    "Yes. If you don't want to worry about the workload, take this class credit d. We often value other periods of art over the ones that we learn about in this course, and now I feel like I have a much more multi-dimensional understanding of art history.",
    "No. I don't think this course is very worthy of taking.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. As someone who didn't have any background knowledge of art history, I really gained a lot from this course and can appreciate ancient artwork much more.",
    "This course provided me with a framework with which I could approach older works art. You learn useful information and skills that can enhance your experience with art. However, the course requires serious memorization, as specific details on a wide range of works and civilizations are required to do well.",
    "One of the works we discussed at length was this portal from the Church of St. Lazare, which shows this fantastical sculptural scene of the Last Judgement. Angels lead the elect to their eternal perches at Christ's right while grinning demons pluck the damned and dump them into their spots in Hell. The whole thing serves as a warning, terrifying medieval minds of the horrors they can expect if they don't heed the liturgy inside. And, in some ways, I wish Yale classes had a similar warning. If only above the doors of Woolsey was a tableau of students. I imagine the elect, well-slept and well-learned, on the right side of a mandorla-ensconced Peter Salovey. They took Barringer's HSAR 115 (which everyone should take, regardless of whether you've taken 112), or perhaps a cool humanities seminar. On the left though, are the ones who chose the path of the damned. Computer Science students type on flaming keyboards, and CHNS 110 scholars recite with full onions stuffed in their mouths. And tucked into a corner of this tympanum is a small but horrifying bunch: the students of Jacqueline Jung's Fall 2016 History of Art 112 Class. One student is forced to come up with 100000 synonyms for \"dazzling\" to describe a stained-glass window, and another is intimidated into drinking a case of V8 before an exam because they've been tricked into thinking it's some sort of Gothic Art elixir. There's even one terrified student who has to sit through a full class period of Prof. Jung not being able to work the lights in the YUAG Auditorium (I shudder at that thought), and still another who has to endure an eternal string of leading questions by the TFs. And below everything is this inscription: \"May this terror terrify those whom course selection error binds for the horror of the images here in this manner truly depicts what will be in HSAR 112\"",
    "Best class to take for credit D. You learn so much about art but because of that it is also very challenging to ace the tests. Lectures are amazing, a real break from dry and boring other lectures at Yale.",
    "I recommend it to prospective majors who are interested in a broad survey course. I would not recommend it as someone's first approach to art history.",
    "Yes, of course. It was intellectually stimulating and a fantastic course! I came to class excited every time.",
    "I would but only if they're willing to spend a lot of time trying to memorize dates and names.",
    "Definitely take it. 2 papers 1 'midterm 1 final. A bit of work but totally doable if you pace yourself",
    "I would recommend this course to any student who wants to understand the works seen in museums.",
    "I loved learning about all the art pieces -- it makes for great conversation and increased my historical knowledge as well.",
    "Yes. I think survey classes are really important before taking in depth art history classes. This class was a great base for any further study."
