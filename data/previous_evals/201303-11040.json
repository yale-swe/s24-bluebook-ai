   "comments": [
    "Only if you have to. Definitely not an easy class",
    "The material is interesting but the class itself could use significant improvement in terms of organization and teaching style",
    "Absolutely take this course. It is really, really, challenging and the midterms\/finals are super tough but the amount that you will learn is worth it. Also, if you want to learn neuroscience, you have to take this class.",
    "I really loved this class. Sometimes it felt a little disjointed, especially with Dr. Keshishian's lectures, but at the end of the semester, I felt that i had gotten a good understanding of some of the major parts of the nervous system. Because neurobiology is such a huge topic, you obviously don't get to learn about every system in detail, but the class gives you the tools and foundations to continue learning about the brain in more depth.",
    "Don't take this class unless you need to. The first half of the course is pretty straightforward, but the second half becomes really disjointed. The topics seem to jump from one area to another with little connection. Your grade is only based on two midterms and a final. If you do well on the final, it can count for your whole grade. There are no review sessions offered for the exams. The exams are really hard and test really specific obscure facts. The class is also half full of neurobiology graduate students who take the same exams.",
    "This was good. Every once in a while you'll have a really mind blowing lecture. Even the ones that aren't are still engaging. No pests but that can be a minus because you don't get much help with what's on the test. Remembering some physics circuits is a good idea for the first part at least. I haven't taken physio or cell bio and took biochem concurrently. IT was fine but those would all help.",
    "This class is amazing. You will learn so much about the brain. That being said, the material is very challenging. If you don't have any physics background, don't worry about it (I didn't). It's only useful in the beginning and even then only peripherally. The only work is the tests. The tests are hard, but fair. Study a lot for them and you can do well on them. There are a ton of readings (most of which I didn't do), which are very helpful if you're confused, but unnecessary otherwise. Take this class if you care about the material and you will get a lot out of it.",
    "This class is a good starting point for learning about many different fields within neuroscience. The first half of the class is a really thorough introduction to electrophysiology which I found really enjoyable and useful. The second part of the class is trickier because it mixes cell bio and developmental material with \"higher-level\" cognitive neuroscience stuff. The result is that it's a little hard to follow and less thorough than it could have been. It's also a lot of work, especially because there is a ton of assigned reading. But if you have the time to devote to it and pay close attention in class, you'll be fine and get a lot out of it.",
    "Lots of work (especially if you read the 1000+ page Kandel textbook). Lots of info being thrown at you. Still, all of it is presented well by two\/three great professors. I would definitely recommend it!",
    "As a cognitive science major who is also premed - my courses were neuroscience heavy courses in the psych department and MCDB 120 - going in to the course, the course was very accessible. The professors are great and the grade is based off of just two midterms a final, which makes for minimal work, but be warned that the midterms require a lot of studying and effort. Take the class, even if you don't have to for your major, if you have any interest in the brain - this is the best class you'll find for that anywhere.",
    "This class is hard. You don't have problem sets\/any weekly sort of work, so it's easy to forget that this class requires work. You need to stay on top of material\/review often\/try to connect across lectures. Somewhat of a gamble though because tests focus on minutiae and once you grasp the big picture, the test is the next day..That said, the material is super interesting.",
    "Ah, I don't even know where to start. First off, this is a fantastic course. You will learn so much about the human brain. We started from the ionic basis of the resting membrane potential and slowly zoomed out to the mechanics of electrotonic spread, then to full-cell considerations, then to cell-cell interactions, and finally to actual circuits that occur in invertebrates and humans. The lab is a great supplement to the course and I highly recommend that you take it. Second off, this is a fantastic course that could use some SERIOUS restructuring. Currently, it's a 50 minute, MWF lecture. This has got to change. I don't know if the 75 minute, TTh or MW lectures just don't work for the professors or what, but the reviews have been saying this for years. The lectures always go over by 5-7 minutes, which is annoying if you have to run to another class. More importantly, it makes the last 10 minutes of class really rushed. There's a fair amount of dense reading, not too bad though. My biggest frustration with this class is that you come out feeling like you know SO MUCH but it will most likely not be reflected in your grade. Take it Credit\/D if you can. I'm not sure if I was just not studying the right way compared to everyone else, but I always come out of studying feeling like I really know the material, and then get stuck on the questions on the exams. Furthermore,the questions on the exams (3 questions for the first, 4 for the second, 8 for the final) are all hit-or-miss questions, where if you weren't sure about whatever protein or toxin they were talking about, you couldn't answer the entire question. That being said: study the toxins. You are responsible for every toxin ever mentioned in lecture.tl;dr Take the class if you want to come out with a whole lot of knowledge about the nervous system and how it works. Don't expect an A without making the class your #1 priority, over every other class you're taking that semester. Take it Credit\/D if you can. Know the toxins.",
    "I would recommend it if the student is passionate about neurobiology, but if they are only dabbling in it I would say take a psychology class or something easier. This course does not focus on the cognitive or pathological aspects of neuroscience that many people are interested in.",
    "Despite being a no-homework science course, I can't say I fully recommend neurobiology. Obviously, since it is taught in the MCDB department, this course focuses on the MICRO level, not the macro... be prepared for lots of electrophysiology before you even get to stuff about specific neurons or the brain as a whole, and don't expect any talk about integrated feedback systems until much later. (And despite how interesting a lot of these systems are, there are many of them and they could be terribly difficult to memorize). The most interesting topics weren't covered until the very end of the semester. Take it if you're prepared for the struggle.",
    "Difficult class, but you won't get this material in any other class at Yale. I would recommend it to any science major, especially an MCDB major."
