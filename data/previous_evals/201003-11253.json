    "This class took the place of a seminar called the Student Research In Progressseminar. Apparently, the talks were not good nor well-attended, so we all had to take a mandatory remedial class.This class is mandatory, but if I could get out of it I would.",
    "Research In Progress Talks. Yes. Its an important part of grad school.",
    "-It's just like MCDB research in progress except now the meetings are mandatory for all graduate students. Post-docs and outside speakers should be allowed to present, and more people should be allowed to attend the meetings so that I can recommend the class to others.",
    "Yes, I think this class is crucial to becoming a better graduate student and scientist.",
    "Summary: The department forces all its grad students to give RIP talks weekly. While good for the presenter, it's pretty annoying for the attendees (mostly because of the mandatory attendance). The food is okay, but does not mitigate having to plan experiments around a one-hour immovable block in the middle of the day.No I would not recommend it to my fellow students. (Not that they have a choice in the matter.) My reasons should be clear in the evaluation and the summary above.",
    "It is like the former RIPs, but annually and mandatory. It is a good practice for communicating your research to others.As it is a mandatory class, you can or cannot recommend it really.",
    "Since it is an obligatory class for graduate students, I feel that this question is superfluous.",
    "I would say overall this course is waste of time. Stay in lab."

   "comments": [
    "We saw two practice job talks that made me much more confident that I am a strong competitor for an academic job.",
    "This course hasbeen very helpful for seeing how I will need to present my research as an older graduate student; I really appreciate input from other graduate students.",
    "It is interesting to see the projects of the MCDB students and great practice in learning how to present results in a productive and informative way.",
    "It added a little bit of breadth to my knowledge of the department and what is going on, though only a very little bit. It didn't really help my research at all. (The chance for presenting my work is a marginal help, but I've had several other opportunities for that--ones where the audience was much familiar with the general topic and thus more capable of providing research-based feedback--so it didn't add much there.)",
    "It helps me to practice talks before going to a meeting and presenting it. It gives a chance to increase our knowledge about other fields in biology than our own.",
    "Having never had an actual developmental biology class in the past, I found this class to be informative. However, I personally would probably never use that information in the future.",
    "I do not feel this course has deepened my knowledge of MCDB or will help me during my dissertation in the future."
