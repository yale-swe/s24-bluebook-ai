    "Interesting policy class, one of the more unique classes at Yale. Workload is manageable, and guest speakers are amazing. Take it.",
    "DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS. You learn almost nothing and the lectures are boring and repetitive. I was looking forward to the guest lecturers, but for the most part, they are terrible speakers. The class was so boring that almost nobody showed up for lecture until attendance became graded. Professor Fleming seems to hate the students in her class. The grades are completely unfair and there is no constructive criticism. On many occasions, people lost points because the grader misread their paper and Prof. Fleming was not genuine in reviewing the complaints. You might think that this class is a good chance to get a writing credit and learn about science. I thought that. I was wrong",
    "Yessss. Light on work, interesting",
    "Not a really good class. The memo grades are random, and it is difficult to succeed. The TAs have no idea what they are doing, and mark everything wrong with your memo. It really sucks.",
    "This class is a good choice for science majors to get a writing requirement done. With that said, it isn't terribly interesting. Writing the final paper is fun because you get to pick a topic you are passionate about, but other than that, the assignments are rather boring and the lectures can be dry.",
    "It's a great writing credit.",
    "Eh...ok. Useful topic to be informed about, and covers a lot of important issues for any future politician, policy maker, or scientist. Lectures have nothing to do with anything you will be graded on except maybe your final project (but they take attendence). Overall pretty low stress way to get a writing curve. But they grade on a physics curve (aka, a NORMAL curve), rather than the super generous, over-inflated humanities curves you might see in humanities classes. Lots of guest speakers. some of the speakers were interesting, and many are from relatively high-ranking positions in science policy.",
    "This class was a good class that examined the cross-talk between science and legislation and how administrative decisions affect science in the US. We were able to get a good sense of how science funding and policy affected education and research.",
    "The class ends up being more work than one might realize. The policy memos are graded rather harshly, but if the topic interests you, take it.",
    "Be prepared for very harsh grading on the policy memos. I took the course and enjoyed it, but I already have lots of writing experience at Yale. A freshman who is taking it for a writing credit, and has not written many essays at Yale already, would probably find it difficult.",
    "IT's a really disjointed, poorly put together class on a cool subject. It is a WR credit and it may get better next time, but I can't recommend this class right now. It's just too disjointed, and I didn't really learn anything at all from lecture. You're not at Yale to waste your time.",
    "A really great WR for science majors. An interesting class. The guest lecturers are hit or miss, but they are all very acclaimed people in their field, and some of their lectures are amazing. The information discussed in this class is very applicable.",
    "I would not recommend this class to a fellow student. Section was very disorganized, and the TAs provided poor guidance to students on assignments. They effectively changed the requirements for the final paper two days before it was due. Some of the guest speakers were extremely interesting, but others were really dull. Grading was fairly arbitrary, and grades did not seem to coincide with effort, writing style, or understanding of the issues.",
    "You learn everything you're going to learn in the first month of classes. The rest of the class is mostly just guest speakers ( some of them are great, others were kind of duds). The policy memos and the final paper weren't too hard - it was a little unclear what they were asking for originally but that got sorted out quickly.",
    "I enjoyed this class because it was a good writing credit for a science major who is not, in general, a fan of papers. There were some very inspiring guest lecturers but some of them were a little dry and overly on-script. The details of how science policy is made are overwhelming at times because there are A LOT of players in science policy. Thankfully, there are no tests (and only one reading quiz) and the policy memos and final paper do not require us to understand how science policy is made. I enjoyed writing the short 1-2 page memos - the page length really forced us to write to the point - and researching for them made me more aware of current science news, which every science major should keep up with. I recommend doing the final paper over Thanksgiving break. It can be a continuation of your third policy memo so you already have some of the research and writing done, and getting ahead will save you a lot of grief during reading week. How you do on these papers really depends on your TA. But work with them to improve! This isn't a traditional writing class where you learn to develop your arguments. It is policy memo writing: short, concise, and to the point.",
    "I would not recommend taking PHYS 320. Most of the guest speakers are boring, the class lectures soon become repetitive and meaningless, and the grading for assignments is highly arbitrary and contradictory. The science\/policy intersection is a very useful subject to become familiar with, but you will be much better served, in my opinion, by reading the Economist or the NY Times. Dr. Fleming also mandated class attendance, which reveals the extent to which students were turned off from the content of the lectures.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to students interested in policy, especially science majors. It will give you a good overview of science issues in the U.S., something that you won't necessarily learn in your science-intensive courses. There are three memos and a final paper, and they really teach you how to structure your paper and convey your ideas concisely.",
    "If you're looking for a writing credit with a pretty low workload, you probably can't do much better. However, the trade-off is having to sit through a boring course.",
    "If you're looking for a writing credit that only has a small amount of writing, this is the class for you. That being said, it is almost difficult to only write the 2 pages allowed for each of the memos, because the topics that are given really require much longer responses.",
    "It's cool to have so many guest lecturers in the class but it kind of disrupts the flow. The topics didn't always seem to connect to each other though they were considered science policy and often times the guest lecturers were incredibly boring. However, writing policy memos was a great experience. It feels like one of the more practical skills I've learned in an academic environment.",
    "not too many assignments, and lectures didn't require notes. pretty boring lectures though, and eventually, nobody showed up to class so the prof required attendance.",
    "I would not recommend this class unless you are very interested in public policy. A couple of the guest lecturers are cool, but other than that, lecture is really boring and the same material is taught for weeks.",
    "I liked this class not because of the lectures, but because of the policy memos we wrote for the class. We had to write 3 1-2 page policy memos and one final 10-20 page policy memo. The lectures in class were not related to the policy memos and I didn't get much out of them. However, writing the policy memos gave me an opportunity to learn in depth about topics that I was interested in. Leah Butler is a fantastic TF and provides excellent feedback. Only take this class if you are interested policy memo. Don't expect to get out of the lectures-- the first few lectures also drive many people away from this class, but if you are interested in improving your policy memo writing, take this class! Take this class for the writing experience, not for the lectures.",
    "This course is a good, easy WR (three 2-page policy briefs and one 10-20 page final paper). The lecture content is kind of dull, but the guest speakers tend to be rather interesting. You also get a good feel for the internal workings of the government from this course, which I found interesting.",
    "Physics 320 was a great look at the underpinnings and effects of science policy, in various capacities and focuses, bolstered by a wide range of guest speakers and a series of writing projects that are based on real policy proposals. I wish to emphasize that this course would be great for many non-science majors (particularly in political science or related areas), and in no way is exclusive to those with science backgrounds.The course entailed two prompted policy memos, an open, unprompted policy memo, and a final culminating project. The memos were required to be under two pages -- though I consistently spent many more hours than might seem required for such a length, given the depth of research required to put together a promising memo. The final project was 10 - 20 pages, a large range that accommodated different desired end results. Overall, the course was a manageable and rewarding amount of work, that more than anything I consistently enjoyed putting work into. The course provided a great base of knowledge about the governmental and other influential mechanisms of science policy, as well as concrete examples of science policy's positive and negative impacts in both domestic and international affairs. I definitely recommend this course both to science majors who would like a different look at science's impacts on the world, and to non-science majors who wish to get an interesting look at a vitally important realm of policy with which they may be unfamiliar.",
    "Very, very low workload but not terribly fascinating unless you're interested in how to get research funding in physics. TAs made lectures necessary for the first time this year, which was annoying.",
    "Well, there's hardly any work (three 2pg papers and a 10pg final paper), but at least my TA was not very lenient on grading. The course isn't interesting, in part because the assignments do not have anything to do with the lecture at all - there's no need to attend or pay attention in lecture to do well on the assignments, which is unfortunate. Really, the most interesting part of the course is actually when the students take over and do presentations at the end. That was the part I found to be most interesting and most relevant.Overall, pretty easy 5th class.",
    "It's a pretty nice class and laid back. Just work hard of the assignments as there aren't too many of them. The grading sometimes felt arbitrary, as you didn't really know how you were doing in comparison to the other students.",
    "I would highly recommend Science andPublic Policy to anyone who is interested in current science topics and wants to learn how to write concisely and effectively. SPP is a great WR class because it's very interesting, and the workload is manageable - 3 2-page policy memos, and a 10-20 page final policy brief (basically a research paper). Basically, all of the work is self-directed after the 1st 2 memos (where you choose one of 2 possible topics), and you can choose your topic for the 3rd memo and paper. I learned more about California in my research than I ever had in 18 years of living there, and this class was a great forum for delving into a science policy topic that you've always wanted to explore.",
    "I wouldn't really recommend it. I mean, it was nice to get that easy WR credit but I kind of regret it.",
    "Take it. You'll love it. Ignore anyone who says otherwise. They are just upset that the sections and attendance were mandatory this year. (Gasp! You mean we are at Yale to learn?!)",
    "Take it for an easy writing credit. The workload is only 3 two-page policy memos and one research term paper. Lecture and readings are completely unrelated to the papers. The papers are interesting, class is less.",
    "I would recommend PHYS 320 to another student as a good WR credit for someone interested in science and taking action about the national politics regarding science.",
    "Yes, it is a very easy writing credit.",
    "this sounds awesome and a good class for premeds looking to take a fifth class, and this is reflected by just how many people initially take the class. the way half the class dropped through the semester also reflects how the class didn't really live up to expectations. the guest lectures ended up being boring to the point where it was embarrassing for prof. fleming and they had to start enforcing mandatory lectures (for a sudler hall lecture....). participation grade is not just section, but also for a sudler hall lecture as well...overall just not very impressed by the class. the workload is pretty light but put lots of effort into the policy memos...your grade will depend heavily on your TA (rebecca and evan were very nice). shop it and you'll find that it's really not that engaging...",
    "Everyone is a science major. 3 short memos, 1 20 pager. Memos were graded a bit harshly, so no clue what my grade will be. Which TA you get is very important. Readings were disorganized from the lectures (mostly guest lecturers) which were very disorganized from the actual stuff we were being graded on, so at first no one went to lecture, until it was made mandatory.",
    "While some of the guest lectures were outstanding, many more were pretty dry and the class as a whole was not too boring. Unfortunately, Professor Flemming made the lecture attendance mandatory, and so you were forced to sit through them all. However, there was not too much work except for the last paper.",
    "Pretty boring class. I would not recommend it. If you need to get a writing credit and dont really want to write that much volume though, its not too bad.You should know that attendance is mandatory.",
    "PHYS 320 is a good class only if you are interested in the material beforehand. Professor Fleming's lectures aren't riveting, but are very informative. She does repeat a lot of information throughout the semester which is helpful. The guest lecturers are GREAT. While all the Fleming lectures focus on policy from a the physics point of view, the guest lecturers come from more varied backgrounds (NPR reporter, war gamers, people from Fermi Lab etc...) The workload is pretty light. The 2-page policy memos do not take that much time to write and they are unrelated to the material discussed in class. Grading for the memos is a little arbitrary considering the graders for each memo are unknown and different each time. I do wish the assignments were more related to information in the lectures. Overall, decent class especially if you're doing research and want to know more about the policy\/funding side of things.",
    "Physics 320 is a course about the relationship between science and policy. It isn't too much work -- a few two-page papers and then one final research paper, along with lots of class participation -- so it's a gut as far as writing classes go, but if you're looking for a social science credit there are probably easier ones elsewhere.",
    "Absolutely fantastic class. It covers a substantial portion of the details of state and federal science policy in the United States, focusing on funding for scientific research, education, health, space, and environmental policy. In addition to covering U.S. domestic policy, Professor Fleming frequently shows how the approaches of the United States compare to those those of other science-intensive countries such as China, Japan, South Korea, and the European Union. International science policy through the United Nations and other organizations was also covered.Professor Fleming is extremely knowledgeable and usually a very engaging teacher. Her lectures are crisp and interesting, and she goes out of her way to make a big lecture class feel like a more intimate seminar. She frequently solicits responses and discussion from the audience and begins almost every lecture with volunteer students standing and giving a 30 second summaries of examples of \"Science Policy in the News.\" Professor Fleming is, personally, a high-energy physicist, so she sometimes has a slight bias towards examples and anecdotes from physics.The class contains an enormous number of guest speakers. Physics 320 featured a guest speaker roughly half of all lectures. (!!) The speakers were all people who held notable positions in their fields and were generally brilliant, well-spoken, insightful, and tremendously enjoyable. Examples of guest lecturers from just this year include a former director of Fermilab, a former president of one of the largest and most well respected hospitals in the United States, a science adviser to President Obama, a science correspondent for NPR (David Kestenbaum), and even Yale University President Richard Levin.The three regular assignments (Congressional Policy Memos, which are two-page research summaries of a real and pressing science issue and proposed solutions to that science issue) were both reasonable and enjoyable. The most difficult part of the assignments was fitting everything I wanted to say into the length maximum. The final assignment was a 20-page policy brief on a topic of your choice. Given you can write on any science policy topic you would like, 20 pages are *very* doable.Section was helpful for writing feedback and interesting discussion, but did not meet every week and ended up being a fairly minor part of the class.If you are interested in getting a comprehensive look at domestic and international science policy or being exposed to a fantastic array of guest speakers, take this class.",
    "Yes I would definitely recommend this class to all students, specially to those who are looking for a writing credit.",
    "I had mixed feelings about this class. On one hand it was pretty interesting to learn about how science public policy works in the US, and some of the guest lecturers were very knowledgeable and interesting, on the other hand lectures got really repetitive (basically the same message that science should have more funding) and were not really integral to your final grades, and grading was super arbitrary. Because of the last part it's definitely not a super easy writing class. If you do want to know more about science& public policy though, definitely take this class. I don't know of any other class that covers this topic, and while lectures were repetitive, they are informative."
