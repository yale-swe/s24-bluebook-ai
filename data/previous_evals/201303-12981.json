    "Highly recommended for someone seeking exciting intellectual challenges.",
    "This course is very challenging and the student learns a lot in class. I would recommend it to anybody willing to take a challenging class and reading a large quantity of scholarship each week. Since the instructor expects a lot from students, it is not for those looking for an easy class.",
    "From this class, you can not only get a basic sense of what is going on in the Tang, Song, and Yuan dynasties, but also get to know what aspects American historians are focusing on in this field.",
    "This course is perfect for anyone who is interest in Chinese history or pre-modern history. I would recommend this course, because I learned a great deal from it."

    "This course opened my eyes to scholarship in premodern Chinese history. Professor Hansen is now helping me to revise my course paper into a journal article for publication.",
    "This course helped familiarize myself with fundamental issues in Chinese history and historiography. The material is important to learning the historical context surrounding my dissertation topic.",
    "This course helps me build a historical background, and also offers me many useful methods to do historical research.",
    "This course deepened my knowledge of pre-modern China in many aspects, and helped me to understand pre-modern China systematically. This course helped me to gain a sound background knowledge for my dissertation, and I was very much inspired by this course."
