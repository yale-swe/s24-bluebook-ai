    "1) The readings for this course were well-curated and extremely interesting. I learned a lot from the readings themselves, and then a lot from class discussions about them. 8) Justin provides great insights on and explanations of foundational frameworks, and is also very skilled at facilitating discussion between students so that we can learn from each other. 10) Justin is awesome. He is thoughtful, insightful, and friendly. This makes him a professor who teaches his students a lot, as well as one who is good at encouraging students to take risks and learn in new ways from new data sources.",

    "The readings and discussions were very engaging. I learned so much with the reading\/ discussion framework of the class. Best course this semester.",
    "Our discussions were really helpful for understanding different facets of the American West.",
    "The class discussions, readings, and professor. It was great how the classes linked together and built on one another.",
    "The readings were incredibly interesting and though-provoking. Discussion was always very engaging as well. The professor's incorporation of films into the syllabus was also very useful.",
    "The course discussions were very productive. I learned from my classmates - they were amazing.",
    "The class discussions were phenomenal. The discussions were led by students who presented the weekly material, and were largely directed by only students. Most students participated strongly each week. Our discussions were allowed to drift to issues the class found most interesting."

    "Because the classes are discussions formatted by each student, the discussion is mostly based on what they decide. While all of my peers worked very hard this semester, it would have been great to have more input from Justin. Even having one of the topics completely taught by him would have been nice. This way we could get more of his experience and see how he would prefer discussions be led.",
    "I think it's kind of unfair how some people get much easier weekly topics to present upon, both with subject matter and amount of readings.",
    "Honestly, nothing comes to mind.",
    "Perhaps the presentation layout could be re-worked a bit. While helpful, sometimes it seemed like presenters focused on things that weren't the most relevant. Some more direction on what themes to cover would be useful.",
    "The course was mostly student-led discussions. More professor lecturing would be nice."

This course taught me about the history and current issues surrounding race, resource management, economy, moral structures and so much more in the West. I feel more equipped to take what I have learned in all my methods classes and apply it to the communities in the West I hope to someday be a part of.",

    "This course offers a theoretical component to my otherwise very applied curriculum here. It diversified my learning and reminded me of the human components of environmentalism.",

    "I chose this course because I felt it would be an interesting and important addition to my curriculum. There are not a lot of courses in which in depth case study and discussion are combined in such a well formatted way at my school. It has better equipped me to live and work in the American West.",
    "To learn more about the factors influencing the west, which I don't think most American history books do justice.",
    "I wasn't sure how relevant this course would be to my professional development, but I had heard good things from students who took it last year and was interested in the topics, so I took it anyway. In the end, this course provided me with new insights and ways of framing issues that I think will stay with me for a long time and directly influence work I do in any field.",
    "I wanted to gain a better understanding of the west as a physical and conceptual landscape.",
    "It met a curriculum requirement. Once in the course, I was very pleasantly surprised by the interesting and relevant material. I'm glad I fit it into my schedule."

Also, do not read for the week more than a couple of days in advance--it's hard to remember specifics if you read too ahead of time.",

Its best to start thinking about your final projects earlier rather than later, because it gets more difficult to settle upon and execute an idea later in the semester. Take advantage of sharing your ideas with the teaching fellow and professor who are there to help!",
