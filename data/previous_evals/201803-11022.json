    "I learned a great deal about what it takes to make a civilization successful, as well as the factors that shape civilization.",
    "nothing",
    "The beginnings of mankind and their impact on the environment was the focus of the course.",
    "Most importantly, I learned that I am surplus. This class covers global environmental history from the origin of the human species to the present. The lens of environmental impacts that Professor Weiss uses to analyze global history is a unique perspective.",
    "I developed a skill of analysing ID style question through the midterm and final. I learned about mesopotamian agricultural history and population collapses throughout the world.",
    "I learned a lot about global environmental history, and Professor Weiss's research is especially interesting.",
    "Learnt about how the environment affects societal trajectories (e.g. collapse of civilizations) particularly in the case of Mesopotamia",
    "This course examines the relationship between civilizational outcome and mega droughts. It was fairly interesting and provides a good understanding of how the environment can shape a society.",
    "I learned how to contextualize sociopolitical events in the context of the environment. As well as how climatological data is collected and evaluated, and how this data has been used to interpret global history.",
    "This course was a great insight to environmental history",
    "I learned that we are all surplus, except for the farmers and others cultivating food to feed the rest of the world. In addition to that, I learned that environmental factors have played significant roles in shaping the ancient world, especially in what is now called the Middle East\/West Asia. Furthermore, I also gained insight to how the interplay of humankind environmental factors changed and effected each other throughout time.",
    "I learned a very general, very Eurocentric view of global environmental history.",
    "None. This was the worst class I have ever taken at Yale, and needs some serious work going forward.",
    "A much clearer idea to how the world has become what it is today.",
    "Vast knowledge about global climate change and its affect on the environment",
    "I learned about the fascinating history of human impact on the environment and environmental impact on human development.",
    "I learned about paleoclimate histories in relationship to civilizations and collapse",
    "I learned a lot about civilizational drought and collapse.",
    "I learned a lot in this class about the path of the environmental history throughout time and the effects the environment has on the major world events",
    "I learned a lot about the development of agriculture, many civilizations and their collapses, and the intricacies of society and the environment. I really came to appreciate how weve become the society and people we are today.",
    "This course is a very good survey of environmental history and the history of how human populations have adapted to climate changes in the past millennia. With a focus on ultimately getting to the present moment, students develop an acute understanding of the major intellectual debates on human adaptation to change.",

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The course is immensely interesting, especially the way that Professor Weiss lectures. It could be improved by linking the readings to the lectures, or not assigning the readings that are not discussed at all.",
    "as the title suggests, i had assumed this class would be an overview of global environmental patterns, laws, movements, etc. throughout history. instead we talked about agriculture in ancient mesopotamia for the entire semester.",
    "The class was not well organized. It would have been beneficial if we had received more material. A strength would be the passion of the Professor who did everything in his power to show us the importance of the subject.",
    "This class is a real grab bag. Certain lectures are clear and relate well to the materials, while others follow from nowhere and don't relate to the overall narrative of the course (specifically the transition from feudalism to capitalism). When the lectures are on topic, the course is fun and engaging.",
    "Dr Weiss is a very good and knowledgeable lecture and a lot can be learned from him. However, this class was not about global environmental history and should not be a core course of the environmental studies major. It was about mesopotamian agricultural history and various societal collapses due to megadrought, which seems to mirror Weiss' other courses.",
    "Kind of a weird class but it was sort of interesting by the end. Professor Weiss has a funky way of lecturing that involves him just asking a ton of rhetorical questions. I would say the essence of the class is that there was a drought, farming failed, and people habitat tracked.",
    "Strengths: assessments are relatively straightforward and the workload is low - a lecture with no sections and readings completely optional (I never did any and still did well for all my exams and assignments just by going to lecture). Prof Weiss is a nice guy who is really passionate about his work and the class and can be quite funny. Weaknesses: I found the material to be really disorganized especially towards the end of semester. It was alright for the first half of the class before the midterm because Prof Weiss really knows the content well, but the second half of the class was so confusing. Topics seemed disjointed (e.g. one lecture would have slides jumping from medieval climate anomaly to the intensification of agriculture to the transition from feudalism to capitalism?) and Prof Weiss didnt smoothly connect between topics, making lecture + studying for the final really confusing (and yes I paid attention during lecture, wasnt using my phone or anything!) Everything also wasnt in chronological order so even doubly hard to follow. Furthermore, he just chucks a bunch of words up to the powerpoint (entire paragraphs copied and pasted from journal articles) which makes it hard to study because you dont know which are the key points, and this is from someone who goes to lecture. Didnt really make me excited to go to class at 9am up on science hill.",
    "Could be better organized, especially when giving directions",
    "The first half of the semester was very interesting. The second half of the course got a little confusing and shifted mainly to bashing on capitalism and many of the arguments the professor presented were very unsubstantiated and highly controversial.",
    "It was a very straightforward class, and I think that made it excellent in achieving its goal.",
    "The strength of this course was that it was very thorough and powerpoint presentations were made accessible to students.",
    "This course had a lot of potential--heck, it's the history of the world!--but it really, really fell flat. Weiss spent far too much time on ancient Mesopotamia and his own archaeological findings, and not enough time on other parts of the world. I think a world map appeared a total of six times throughout the semester. The lectures were highly unorganized and were mostly tangents that Weiss went on about the synchronicity of societal collapse with environmental change. Don't get me wrong, that is important, but it would have been so much more interesting had we had compared the transition of feudalism to capitalism in Europe to say, China. But no, we only talked about Europe and the 19th century theories behind our concepts.",
    "There were no strengths. The course was extremely disorganized, confusing, and badly run. The first half revolved around one small time period in ancient Mesopotamia, but the second half jumped around obscurely to random time periods such as WWI. It was so bizarre. There were 6 parts of the world identified as having importantly early civilizations, but we only talked about Egypt and Mesopotamia, and barely touched on Latin America. It was easily the worst course I've taken at Yale. This was confounded by having the absolute worst TA I have ever had in my time at Yale. Vivian was extraordinarily condescending, unhelpful, and made it exceedingly difficult to ask questions or schedule office hours with her. She also put out instructions that consistently contradicted those of Prof Weiss, which made assignments extraordinarily confusing.",
    "Covers a large time period without being too overwhelming. Focuses on what was important.",
    "One strength is Weisss expertise and mastery in the material. A weakness is the low class attendance by many students on a regular basis.",
    "This course was extremely unorganized and lectures were hard to follow",
    "Vivian Breckenridge, the Teaching Fellow, was by far the worst teaching fellow I have ever had. She made this class almost unbearable.",
    "Very good class overall. Great teacher, maybe more notes",
    "Lecture could be a bit boring, especially since it was a trek up to Kroon at 9 am, but it took me until the end of the course to realize how everything he taught tied in together. Essentially you just have to know that megadroughts led to collapses, and the strength of the course is all the tidbits of knowledge you gain that you can interject into conversation or help in other courses.",
    "I loved the term project."

    "I would recommend this course to anyone who is interested in the development of civilizations. Very accessible to non-humanities majors as well.",
    "no, waste of time",
    "This class is amazing. The lectures are amazing. There is only a midterm, an easy essay, and a final. The exams are all easy IDs. Take this class!!!!!! It's the perfect 5th credit. Professor Weiss is an amazing lecturer.",
    "No, I would not recommend this course to another student as you do not get the knowledge you expect from this class, if you want to learn about societal collapse, take a different Weiss course, and if you want to learn about environmental history take a different class.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. It is a wonderful mix of interesting and not stressful. It makes for a wonderful fifth class for a semester.",
    "*Shrugs* If you have to take it as an EVST major, I would say it is an alright 5th class, especially since the assessments are relatively straightforward and the workload is low. Prof Weiss is a nice guy who is really passionate about his work and the class and is quite funny. However, I found the material to be really boring especially towards the end of semester. It was alright for the first half of the class before the midterm because Prof Weiss really knows the content well, but the second half of the class was so disorganized. As a result, I found class so hard to follow and therefore really boring. Topics seemed disjointed (e.g. one lecture would have slides jumping from medieval climate anomaly to the intensification of agriculture to the transition from feudalism to capitalism?) and Prof Weiss didnt smoothly connect between topics, making lecture + studying for the final really confusing (and yes I paid attention during lecture, wasnt using my phone or anything!)

Didnt really make me excited to go to class at 9am up on science hill. Honestly, I think there are many other better courses out there, unless you are completely riveted by the topic, then by all means go for it. I probably wouldnt have done it if I didnt have to for my major.",
    "Environmental history and climate change is so important, so one should definitely take this course",
    "I recommend this course to anyone interested in studying the relationship between environmental conditions and civilizational outcomes. However, that many of the arguments presented in this course seem very hand-wavy and are very controversial (for example Professor Weiss agrees with Mike Davis' argument that imperialism caused the late Victorian holocausts).",
    "Yes.",
    "Yes because it really gives you insight about how climate and the environment has shaped human history (if you're intrigued or fascinated by these kinds of things, I recommend you take it). Also because realizing that you are nothing more than surplus keeps things real and can be quite humbling.",
    "Please do not take this class. I'm sorry to all of the EVST majors who might have to take it for a Group A requirement, and it doesn't have much of a workload at least, but for me it didn't even feel worth it to take a gut class like this because the content was so skewed.",
    "Absolutely not. This was the worst course I've taken at Yale. Incredibly disorganized, bizarre material.",
    "Yes, a good way to develop a new insight to the world we live in.",
    "Yes. It is a fascinating subject with a tremendous instructor.",
    "Yes",
    "No - the material is interesting but lectures make it really difficult to understand and follow the correct trajectory of knowledge",
    "I would not recommend this course. Professor Weiss is very kind, but after the midterm the material goes from normal archaeology to world systems theory, and you spend nine or ten lectures listening to really odd rants.",
    "Absolutely, learned a lot from a great teacher",
    "Yes, because its not a ton of work and in the end youll realize youve learned a lot of interesting information. During the semester assignments are few and far between so its difficult to stay sharp, but Id recommend it just for the archaeosim project where you play around with a societys features.",
    "Yes! Understanding how human societies have adapted to climate changes is very important as we move into the 21st century, and this class provides that in a format\/workload that is easy to deal with as a 5th class. Apart from the midterm, final, and a short written assignment, the workload throughout the semester is essentially just going to class, since the main arguments in the readings will be covered in lecture.",
    "yes! very easy class yet still very interesting!"
