    "Anyone who wants or needs to take French will want to take this class.",
    "I wouldn't recommend it; the french department is somewhat ridiculous in their schedules (weekly tests, meeting during reading week, etc.) and I didn't learn as much as I would have liked for how much time I put into it.",
    "Mme Grantham is an excellent instructor who knows her material well. She ably engages the class and interacts well with students. In my experience, she readily provides extra help and answers all questions. Her grading is fair and informative, and her supplementary practice quizzes and worksheets are very helpful. Overall, Mme Grantham is an excellent teacher."
