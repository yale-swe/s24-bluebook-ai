    "PHYS 515 is a seminar in which department professors give talks about their work for first-years. It requires no work on the student's part besides showing up and paying attention, and it's very educational. I enjoyed it a lot.",
    "Yes definitely. It let us know what kind of researches were going on different groups and gave us chances to explore which topics were particularly appealing.",
    "Even if you're already associated with a lab and aren't looking for an advisor, this was a nice break from traditional classes to just hear what others in the department are doing.",
    "This course gave students a great overview of the research available in the physics department. I highly recommend attending all of the sessions because even the most obscure of subjects surprised me with how interesting they were. Plus, there's pizza!"

   "comments": [
    "I broadened my knowledge of the research being done in the Yale physics department and allied departments. Hopefully, this had made me a more informed and better connected member of the Yale physics community.",
    "This course gave us exposure to a broad range of fields. It also gave us the opportunity of trying to understand talks and ask questions without the pressure that comes from being in colloquia with experts in the field."
