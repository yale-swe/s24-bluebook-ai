    "We learned quite a bit of basic grammar and useful vocabulary in this class. The daily homework is to read a few pages in the textbook and do some exercises in the workbook, and sometimes also to do some online exercises. There are two in-class compositions (open book), three oral exams (3-5 minutes each, two of them are during reading period), three quizzes (they give us the entire class period to do them), and a final exam. You have to stay on top of things if you're going to do well in this class, but it's not all that intense, and in the end you'll be impressed at how much you've learned. Prof. Sab\u00e9-Colom was great - very enthusiastic, organized, and clear.",
