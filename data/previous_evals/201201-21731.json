    "Covered a large amount of material at a nice, relaxed pace.",
    "TAKE IT!! One of the best intro. Math classes at Yale!",
    "It's a followup to MATH 116 which teaches you about mathematical modeling. I highly recommend it to pre-med students and also to scientists interested in pursuing research as a career. It exposes you to mathematical modeling and well as differential equations which are vital in biology.",
    "I would recommend this course if you are looking for a relatively low commitment QR requirement, would like to be graced with Professor Frame as your teacher and have an interest in how Biology and Mathematics can interact. My main problem with the course is that I'm still not exactly sure what I learned or how I'll be able to use it again. We did learn some linear and some multivariable calculus, which was great, but they were short topics and very dispersed throughout the course. Much of the time I took notes on topics and models that I did not understand and still don't. Overall, if you want to have a challenge and really learn some math, take a different course. If you are interested in the topic, want Professor Frame and an easy course, take MATH 121.",
    "Good class to take if you want a low maintenance math class. Open book midterm and exam. Weekly problem sets which are shorter than any other math's sets, but sometimes hard. Overall is a fair class.",
    "Take it, for certain. You'll learn the important aspects of multi pretty painlessly and the biological applications are fascinating. Frame is wonderful, and he makes the class pretty enjoyable."
