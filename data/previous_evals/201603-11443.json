   "comments": [
    "improved philosophy paper writing skills and thinking skills",
    "I learned a lot about different philosophical views about how humans behave and think and how empirical evidence supports those claims.",
    "This class made me think about several things I had never before considered and made me much more curious about why we are the way that we are. I also left the class having new frameworks to interpret the world around me, such as dyadic completion and reciprocal altruism.",
    "I learned to evaluate claims regarding philosophical questions by analyzing empirical psychological evidence.",
    "Gained background knowledge about philosophical ideas, learned about methods of investigation in psychology, and applied this to recent developments in cognitive science. Challenged to question the ideas being presented and develop my own.",
    "This class really broadened my knowledge of philosophical perspectives regarding ethics, character, and religion, and the psychological studies helped me to put in context the concepts we covered in class. This was a rewarding course that allowed me to incorporate things I learned in class into my daily life.",
    "Incredibly insightful course. Learned all kinds of fascinating stuff about the mind, morality, and human nature. Changed my outlook on life.",
    "I got a broad and yet comprehensive understanding of philosophy and psychology that greatly increased my understanding of many aspects of the human mind.",
    "The knowledge and insights of this course were an introduction to philosophical concepts and psychological sciences and the connections between the two disciplines.",
    "I learned how to think critically and form my own opinions about philosophical ideas and how psychological studies can inform these ideas. I also developed the skills to write philosophy papers with strong counterarguments that I did not have before.",
    "Great intro to Cogsci, Knobe is the man.",
    "Greater appreciation of philosophical works and their influence on contemporary psychological studies.",
    "Learned a lot of new things about philosophy and modern psychology, also learned how to write philosophy and psychology papers.",
    "Amazing course. Learned how to combine psychology and philosophy.",
    "I learned how to approach a sociological article\/study I learned the different and similar ways of approaching philosophy and sociology",
    "Understanding of some interesting concepts regarding human nature.",
    "This course taught me the basics of how to read philosophy papers, as well as methods for probing different hypotheses in cognitive science. It also touched on experimental design and analysis, although that aspect was not especially new to me. As a STEM major, the course was useful in determining how to flesh out arguments, consider objections, and develop a specific thesis.",
    "I learned how to write philosophy papers I learned about different aspects of the human nature and the origins of some of our notions about religion, morality, ethics, happiness, and altruism. I learned that different disciplines can give different interpretations of the same concepts. I learned about cognitive science and psychology and how those disciplines conduct correlation and causation studies to study different aspects of the human mind.",
    "I got a survey course introducing me to philosophies and respective relevant cognitive\/psychological studies that make claims on human nature. I also gained a better understanding of how to write philosophy papers.",
    "Learned a lot of different philosophical theories on human nature and how they have been tested within psychological research.",
    "I came to understand a range of perspectives on how humans operate including philosophical and psychological accounts of complex behaviors.",
    "I learned about the philosophical and psychological\/scientific methods used to investigate human nature and the mind. I learned about some groundbreaking studies that straddle the border between psychology and philosophy, and the basics of designing and understanding empirical and correlational psychological studies.",
    "We looked at various works in basic psychology and philosophy, covering a lot of ground on topics like pain and suffering and the existence of God. It provided a good overview of many basic aspect of human nature.",
    "This has been one of the best courses that I've taken at Yale for the following reason: it forced me to reevaluate and critically question my own beliefs on morality and religion that I had taken for granted for as long as I can remember. In other words, this class will make you think about and explore your own value-systems. At first, I was a little unsure about the type of questions that we were discussing, but the Professor does a great job of welcoming everyone into the discussion. This class won't ask you to refute your own thoughts; it also doesn't ask you to approach the material through defensive means. It simply asks you to argue for whatever resonates most deeply with your own opinions, given the evidence that recent psychological studies have uncovered about our own cognitive tendencies. This class was a pleasant surprise, and I recommend that you take it! It'll broaden your perspective on life, and you'll grow intellectually because of it. :)",
    "I learned a number of interesting theories regarding how people think and behave, and my ability to think about and write about interesting philosophical arguments improved greatly.",
    "Various philosophical theories and how psychological evidence can support them. Generally speaking, how the worlds of psych and philosophy intertwine.",
    "Different perspectives on answering philosophical questions",
    "I learned different philosophical views on the themes covered in lectures (happiness, love, altruism, morality, religion, etc) and learned about social psychology experimental research testing out these views\/theories. I learned to write a philosophy paper and to critically read papers to focus on a single point to argue against.",
    "This class teaches you a lot about philosophy and psychology and their intersection in many interesting themes. You read a lot of famous thinkers including Plato, Aristotle, Nietzsche, etc. You learn to write philosophical papers. For someone who had never taken a philosophy class before, I found this very interesting.",
    "I used this course as a means of exploring my own identity and thoughts a little more",
    "In general, I learned about big ideas in this course. I learned more about how to conduct experiments and why certain types of studies are conducted over others because of moral implications. The units in this course were very interesting and the readings were enjoyable. The thing I enjoyed the most was the cross section between philosophy and psychology.",
    "How to engage philosophical and psychological texts in the same discussion.",
    "Broad survey of main psychological and philosophical questions.",
    "I learned how to compare philosophical and psychological perspectives. I also learned how to read philosophy texts.",
    "This course was a solid introductory survey course in Cognitive Science and Philosophy. As someone who had never previously taken a philosophy course, I feel as though I am leaving with a good understanding of some classic philosophical texts (The Republic, Nicomachean Ethics, etc.) and how they relate to the world around me (where the cognitive science aspect comes in).",
    "This class changed the way I thought about human nature, especially with regards to moral principles and altruism. This class is definitely a great overview of various aspects of philosophy.",
    "I learned how to use both psychology and philosophy as tools to explore different theories, and help answer questions about human nature and examined the ways in which both disciplines can complement, and sometimes contradict, with one another.",
    "This course exposed me to many different theories about how the human mind works. Through writing the papers, I improved my skills of philosophical argumentation but we didn't get much guidance on that. We learned about how to design a psychological study.",
    "I learned about how to analyze and think about the validity of philosophical or psychological claims",
    "The course was a great introduction to important philosophical and psychological texts. I learned about basic disputes in the two fields about human traits such as happiness, altruism and religiosity.",
    "How to write philosophy\/psych papers, psych experiment proposals. Lots of different psychological and philosophical theories, experiments, and just info in general.",
    "I feel like this course was not quite what I was expecting, but was a truly fantastic course through and through. I feel as though I gained some form of philosophy skill, something that I had none of from the start of this course, and I feel as though it taught me quite a bit on how philosophy and psychology can be so closely related and connected.",
    "Helped me to see psychology through philisophy lens",
    "I learned how various aspects of human nature such as happiness, religion and morality personally affect my own life."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "No weaknesses. It is a very well organized and interesting class.",
    "This course covers truly fascinating topics. With a good TF, it becomes really stimulating. If you get a bad TF then the class might feel like a somewhat shallow survey of a lot of topics without any really satisfying exploration.",
    "The subject matter was interesting and sections were very helpful. Studying was more difficult because slides were sparse. It was difficult to hear the instructor at times. Perhaps classes taught in this room or with the instructor (I don't know what caused the issue) could require the instructor to wear a special microphone so that the instructor's voice is picked up.",
    "Strengths: engaging material, well-organized and well-presented lectures, strong feedback throughout the course, high availability of resources for students, clear expectations about performance, appropriate workload and difficulty Improvements: opportunity to ask questions during lecture, though perhaps not feasible, would have been very useful to students. even 10 minutes following a lecture devoted to public question-and-answer would have been extremely helpful.",
    "This class is very interesting, is incredibly well structured, and provides a lot of fascinating material. It's definitely thought-provoking, especially because it requires section attendance, and provides an opportunity to think philosophically. I don't really think you could call this a cognitive science class, which was OK for me, but may be misleading to others. I can't really think of any issues that this class had.",
    "Strengths: The material is fascinating and the professor's excitement for the subject is contagious Weaknesses: It was often difficult to hear the professor and he sometimes went over the material too quickly",
    "The course is really good overall. I think it covers really relevant and important topics in just the right amount of detail to give the maximum impact possible. It is a very unique course and does its job very well. I think it could be improved by changing the style of sections so as to use them to allow the TFs to focus on explaining in greater detail the more complicated concepts explained in lecture.",
    "The strength of this course is the breadth of the subject matter and the synthesis between the two disciplines. I think that the readings of this course could be improved, the workload is not too overwhelming for the readings of the course to be expanded upon.",
    "The strengths of the course are how it integrates both philosophy and psychology in a fascinating way that really makes students think about pertinent topics dealing with human nature. It empowers you with studies and ideas to explain and add insight to everyday occurrences. I also thought a big strength was how manageable the readings were each week.",
    "Strengths: The readings were great. Weaknesses: Lectures could be somewhat confusing, and discussion section not always the most enlightening.",
    "Everything was a strength. Knobe should keep teaching it the exact same way!",
    "STRENGTHS Really interesting material Engaging lecture Not too much reading Open assignments WEAKNESSES The specific range of topics covered felt a bit narrow",
    "This class is probably the best class I have ever take at Yale (and I am not a freshman!). I think this says quite a lot!",
    "Strong professor, strong concepts.",
    "The course was extremely well-organized, the readings for each week flowed into each other very naturally, the content was interesting, and the professor was a good lecturer. My primary complaint is about the hand written notes policy while this might be more effective for memorization than typing, it was problematic because handwriting notes is still much slower than typing. The presentations are posted at the end, but this did not really resolve the issue, because the presentations included very few details (often just a set of cryptic pictures, a simple figure, or a bulleted list of concepts without any hint as to what they meant). In some cases, the pdfs of the presentations posted had the key result graphs covered with white boxes; this was very frustrating as well. Because of this, when studying, it was often extremely difficult to reconstruct what was going on in large chunks of the past lectures that had moved too quickly to take detailed notes; this was the experience of multiple students. For this reason, I would recommend that either the handwriting policy be made optional, or the posted presentations made to include more details (captions for the pictures, citations for noted outside experiments, complete figures, etc).",
    "I think the course was very well taught, and the material was definitely interesting. I think the sections could improve in the level of student engagement and discussions. Also during lectures, it would be nice if the professor left 10 minutes for answering questions because it would enable students to get more acquainted with the class material that is being taught at the moment and not just wait for section.",
    "The readings are riveting, and Professor Knobe is informative and helpful in his lectures. Sometimes lectures were hard to understand or fast-paced, and I often found myself wishing that we could spend more than one lecture and maybe half a section on some of the works, especially the denser philosophical works. However, I think that's just the nature of a survey course.",
    "The essays need a rubric.",
    "This class is wonderful, but the sections could be better incorporated into the main lecture. From talking with friends, my experience with section differed widely from theirs. While some diversity lets individual TAs teach to their strengths, some aspects (like who gets a practice exam and who doesn't) should be uniform.",
    "Some of the lectures repeated what was in the readings, while others did not explain confusing topics from the readings enough. There could have been more of a balance. Other than this, the course was excellent.",
    "It covers a lot of ground, as it is a sort of intro course. I think a strength is that it covers a lot of really interesting topics. However, there sometimes seems to be a lack of continuity.",
    "The largest weakness of the course was the fact that Professor Knobe was, at times, a little difficult to hear. He naturally has a very soft-spoken voice, so I made it point to sit in the front row everyday to make sure that I didn't miss anything. Another weakness of the course was that the lecture slides were virtually useless, regardless of whether or not you went to lecture, because they contained little to no text. This was particularly frustrating whenever I wanted to review for an exam, and despite having gone to lecture, I sometimes couldn't make out what it was that the professor had said for specific slides simply because he had brushed over the material (or I couldn't hear what it is that he had said) and the lecture slides would contain only a few words, or worse, a photo or two... Laslty, if you think that recording the material is your solution (trust me, I record all lectures that I attend), then be warned; the professor explicitly asks that you don't use laptops\/electronic devices. This is arguably also another weakness of the course, but for others, this wasn't a problem at all. Overall, as you'll see from the first response above about the course's skills\/insights, I still loved the course, but it wasn't perfect. Now you know why. Improvements: Let students use their laptops for faster note taking\/recording. Have the professor use a better speaker\/microphone system. Use slides that are more detailed\/structured.",
    "I thought it was an overall effective and enlightening course.",
    "Power points need to be better. Considering the fact that almost 50% of the midterm and the final are on concepts\/examples that were only covered in lecture, having power points that are pretty much only pictures makes it impossible to study for the final. While yes students should take notes, it is impossible to capture everything we go over in class and write down every word a professor says. Additionally, if you happen to miss a lecture (as I did because I was hospitalized) there is no way to review the lectures you missed, as the lecture slides provide little insight unless you were in the lecture.",
    "Strengths: the themes were really relevant and interesting (my favorite was religion), lectures were engaging and well organized, I think the two essays were actually my favorite because that made me really read and understand the papers I chose Weaknesses: not sure if section was really relevant because not a lot of people went consistently and the discussion wasn't that applicable I feel. It was also a bit hard to hear during lecture, but that took some getting used to. Also, the passage identification questions on the midterm and final weren't so helpful--I get that they're to make sure we did the readings, but application kind of questions and essays do a better job of seeing that we understood what we were reading. Lectures usually focused on a few key points from the readings, so if there were ID questions, it would make more sense that they were from what we covered.",
    "This class is very interesting and is not a lot of work. It was a decent class. It overlapped with Intro to Cog Sci, in terms of material, but for the most part it was separate information.",
    "I loved the material and the lectures were all super interesting, but I did wish there was some sort of comprehensive understanding\/questions that incorporated the philosophical and psychological texts (of the same topic) in the same discussion. I was penalized for attempting to do so in my first paper, but I wish we had tried to do that in section or on an exam of some sort.",
    "It is very interesting and well taught. However, a bit disorganize in the sense that we don't get timely feedback on our work.",
    "The readings are generally pretty interesting and realistic in terms of length. The course is also structured with a helpful weekly reading response requirement that gave me the opportunity to ask questions about material if I ever was confused. Section was also VERY important to me in terms of getting a firm grasp of the material (and I liked that the entire course was structured so that you always read the text before discussing it in class). One weakness of the course is the variation in different TFs' engagement. While I was very very very happy with my TF Juan, some other students mentioned to me that they felt like their class discussions with other TFs were not as illuminating. I also struggled to study from some of the TFs' guest lectures.",
    "Professor Knobe was a great professor, but he was sometimes hard to hear and went through the slides pretty quickly. Furthermore, the slides were sometimes confusing when studying for the exams.",
    "I really enjoyed that this course was interdisciplinary and it helped broaden my perspective on how to go about examining different facets of human nature.",
    "The lectures mostly just summarised the readings, which was necessary for the harder readings but didn't seem useful for the easier readings.",
    "I overall found the texts and lectures very interesting, but it was hard to really improve when I don't feel like I got much feedback. Because I only got one essay back and never got the midterm,any class participation update, final, or second essay, I really have no idea how I'm doing in this course or how I could improve.",
    "I felt the readings were very interesting and thought provoking and I really enjoyed the comparisons between philosophy and psychology. That being said, I felt the lectures sometimes didn't emphasize enough how the readings fit together. The readings were often categorized into dyadic conflicts (e.g. intuition vs. reason), which I often felt did not necessarily fully reflect what the readings were claiming. This sometimes made following lecture material more challenging. I also believe the lecture style of this class did not fit the content very well. The class would have been much better if it had been more discussion-based.",
    "Because the course is cross-listed in both psychology and philosophy, I believe that the discussion sections should focus on both of these fields. However, I had a philosophy graduate student as my TA, so we really only spoke about the philosophical aspects of each topic. It would be nice to have a TA well-versed in both psychology and philosophy in order to gain more from discussion sections.",
    "Professor Knobe is an amazing professor and the class is very fascinating, however, the mic was a big problem for the first few classes. The professor eventually made an effort to improve the audibility of his lecture but I think better mics for next time would save the professor a lot of energy!",
    "Strength: Joshua is a phenomenal professor and makes everything easy to understand and keeps the entirety of the class engaged from start to finish. The TA's were also incredible, doing everything they could to help students to fully understand the material and succeed. Weakness: Reading could be long and workload got a touch heavy at the end of the semester. Honestly, not too bad though.",
    "It was interesting material but went a little fast",
    "It is a very well-taught course. The midterms\/finals were extremely difficult though, and were then curved. In fact, they were so difficult that apparently some of the TAs didn't even know the answers."

   "comments": [
    "It is wonderful. If you have ever wondered about human nature, take this class. The format of reading a philosophical work, then reading empirical research that compliments it, was perfect.",
    "A great class that lets you explore philosophical implications of human nature while keeping the course grounded in tangible, bite size psychological studies. The workload is manageable and interesting.",
    "Yes! The class makes you consider questions about human nature and possible explanations thereof in ways you never have. The readings, while not super necessary, are usually very interesting. Professor Knobe can be tough to hear but he's great.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. It was far and away one of my favorite courses that I've taken at Yale. As a junior, it made me consider trying to fit in cognitive science as a double major. Josh is a wonderful professor and the class is really set up to allow students to learn as much as possible. It is a fairly heavy workload, but I learned a ton and all of the material was very interesting.",
    "This was a very interesting course that was manageable, even for someone with little background in psychology and philosophy.",
    "I would recommend this course to a student who is curious about the intersection of multiple fields. It required a bit more work than I anticipated, but I found the workload very manageable. That being said, a student expecting to skip lectures frequently should not take this course. I looked forward to lecture and section each week; I found the material very interesting. Overall, I really enjoyed it, and I'm glad I took it!",
    "This is a really interesting course, if you give it the time. If you make a point of going to lecture and try to engage with the topics and at least get the main point of the readings, you'll find that it's quite fascinating. Incredibly well structured - not a ton of work outside of studying for exams - professor is pleasant and easy to listen to. However, if you're taking it hoping for a low-stress, low-work good grade, keep looking. Exams have a lot of material and require a thorough understanding of the concepts covered. Best to take with at least one friend for studying purposes.",
    "Yes, for reasons previously stated",
    "Absolutely amazing and fascinating course. I would highly recommend it just based on the unique way it combines philosophy and psychology to provide valuable and insightful perspectives.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student. This course is an excellent introductory course to psychology, philosophy and cognitive science.",
    "I would 10\/10 recommend this course to anyone interested in the intersection between philosophy and psychology or wanting an introduction to both fields. I had never taken a class in either discipline before, and it was a great experience to get a taste of both and see them overlap. The lectures and readings are super engaging. Section is fun discussion. And overall I found the class often making me reflect deeply on aspects of my own human nature. The lectures and readings essentially empower you with studies and ideas to explain and add insight to everyday occurrences you may even experience on your own. Fantastic!",
    "Take this course if you have an interest in philosophy, psychology, and the intersection of two in contemporary experimental philosophy experiments. Professor Knobe is a founder of the field, and is a great lecturer. Get feedback on your papers, and read the material carefully -- passage ID's can be tough.",
    "Yes, especially for a non-psych or philosophy major -- it was a great general overview of different concepts in older philosophy and modern psychology.",
    "Yes. This was an amazing class.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. There wasn't too much reading, and the readings we had were quite engaging. I enjoyed the lectures a lot, and the material was stayed on my mind for a while after each lecture.",
    "Would recommend",
    "Please, take this class! I mean if you have the slimmest interest in big ideas of nature and human existence. I have to warn you, however: you won't find answers; you will just find more questions (which is very fun). If you think you like learning, take this class. You will either enjoy or discover that you actually don't like learning, at least not as much as you thought.",
    "Yes. Knobe is awesome, and the intersection between Philosophy, Psych, and CogSci is interesting.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student. It is very well organized, a reasonable workload (weekly reading responses and section, 2 papers, and 2 midterms), and the material is a very coherent mix of philosophy and psychology papers. Professor Knobe is enthusiastic and receptive to students requests, and his lectures are generally clear. As a STEM major, I appreciated that the philosophical and theoretical claims made about human nature were always followed by actual experiments, providing evidence for or against each point.",
    "This course is great if you are interested in understanding the reason behind our beliefs and judgments and also if you want an inter-disciplinary comparison and study of concepts pertaining to the human nature.",
    "Definitely! It's a fun interdisciplinary course that is engaging whether it pertains to your major or not. The workload is manageable and both Professor Knobe and the TAs want you to understand the material and succeed.",
    "Definitely would recommend this course. Incredibly interesting material pertinent to all lives.",
    "This class is delightful, Professor Knobe is a great lecturer and his slides are amazing. Make sure you keep up with readings, since both the midterm and the final have passage IDs.",
    "This course is perfect for anyone who is fascinated by philosophy and psychology, and wants to see how some of the more elusive concepts in both fields can be measured and tested scientifically.",
    "I would recommend this course to a student who is unfamiliar with basic philosophy and psychology, or to someone who wants to get a good overview of the field. However, the professor can sometimes be hard to hear and understand (Knobe)",
    "This was an interesting approach to learning philosophical concepts. For that I would recommend. If you are not someone interested in taking a philosophy class that is deep in philosophy and conceptualizing thought, but are interested in philosophical concepts I recommend this course. Not only is it easier to digest philosophical concepts when they have empirical support, but it is also interesting to see the support.",
    "Yes!!!! -- see first response to \"What knowledge, skills, and insights did you develop by taking this course?\"",
    "I would likely recommend it to someone especially interested in the psychology of morality.",
    "Yes, the course was interesting, and discussion sections were very interesting.",
    "Yes--the themes covered are pretty universal ones, and the material is really interesting (lectures are also funny sometimes). I learned so much from all the empirical papers and from writing my own papers. This is a great great class if you're a psych major interested in philosophy that isn't too intense.",
    "Yes, one of the best courses ever",
    "I would recommend this class if you don't have a solid background in philosophy or psychology. I imagine if you've taken advanced courses, this class might seem redundant. If not, then this is a really good class and it counts for both the cog sci and psych majors.",
    "Honestly, if the subject matter interests you, take this course. It is a fairly interesting class, but if you're just looking for any philosophy class to take, I wouldn't necessarily say this is the one you need to. There are probably others that may be better.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student, especially one that wants to start diving into Philosophy but doesn't really know if that subject is necessarily right for them. The best thing about this course is that although some of the readings are tough, the connections between the readings and real life are interesting.",
    "Yes I would because I thought the subject was interesting and Professor Knobe is amazing.",
    "Yes",
    "Yes, it is interesting.",
    "Yes, take this class! It is really interesting material and Dr. Knobe is fantastic!",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to a student who is looking to take a philosophy-based class that also has psychological\/cogsci applications! This class is definitely not easy, but it is doable if you stay caught up with all of the readings and participate actively in class. Additionally, I was genuinely interested by nearly all of the lectures, so I felt motivated whenever I completed work for this course.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to any student interested in philosophy. It is a great overview of various aspects of human nature, and reviews many different authors.",
    "I would recommend this course to any student who is interesting in philosophy, psychology, or cognitive science. The material covered in this course is very applicable to everyone and is very interesting.",
    "Unfortunately, no I wouldn't. The material feels similar through the course since the first few lectures. The same modes of thinking are used throughout the course. The lectures are very hard to follow: you have to concentrate understanding the words of the professor rather than understanding the material itself. Even if the material is interesting, it always only scratches the surfaces of the topic. I was quite disappointed.",
    "This course does give you a lot to think about and will show you many different theories on human nature but ultimately will show how hard it is to prove any of them.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone somewhat interested in philosophy but who doesn't have a ton of prior experience or knowledge in it, otherwise I think it could be boring.",
    "The readings of the course are very fascinating and worth taking a look at. If you're looking for an intro into important philosophy\/psychology texts, this is a great course to take. The discussion of the different topics in lectures is often a bit shallow. On the whole, the workload is pretty manageable.",
    "Yes! It is very informative and though provoking. Professor Knobe is amazing and as long as you get a good TF, you'll have fun in section!",
    "A truly interesting course that links philosophy and psychology together. If either of these fields interest you, seriously consider taking this course. If both fields interest you, take the course asap, you will LOVE it.",
    "Hard to hear the instructor and even if you took notes on the slides, a combination of the slides having very little information and being unable to hear the professor a quarter of the time made it very difficult to learn the material",
    "Yes it was interesting but the papers were challenging especially for psych majors",
    "The curve was incredibly hard, and not geared towards succeeding. Would not recommend taking if simply curious about the course, but a relatively accurate introductory course for those interested in Cognitive Science.",
    "Yes",
    "It's very interesting. You learn about a multitude of aspects of human nature such as our ability to be happy after tragic events, the existence (or non-existence) of character traits, the socialization of babies, the nature of morality and religion, and more. In fact, this class helped me navigate and better cope with events in my social life; I could see what I learned in action everyday in other people and myself. So the content is interesting; I would take it! In terms of work, the only weekly assignments are reading responses for your section. There will be one midterm, two papers, and one final. There are mixed feelings on the difficulty of the midterm. For instance, I thought I did very well on it only to find out later I did significantly worse than I thought I had done. A good portion of the class did very well on it, though, so don't fret. And the midterm is curved significantly because the professor even tells us that it'll be super hard. ANYWAY you'll be fine. You'll either do really well or ride out that curve on your surfboard like it's a summer afternoon in Oahu. Now, about those papers. Make sure to talk to your TA. They are your best friend, will sit down with you and give you ideas and even outlines for your papers and will even vouch to grant your section extensions on these papers! They know what they're talking about and are the absolute best! The final is just like the midterm, so yeah. Anyway, this course was great. I'd totally recommend it. Just befriend your TA and stay on your game even though the work seems lax and you'll be great. OH, also Professor Knobe is absolutely wonderful and hilarious in class. You'll have a great time in lecture.",
    "Bulleted Points about CGSC 282: - Great class, Professor Knobe really knows what he's talking about and covered a surprisingly comprehensive range of topics. - He's an interesting, quirky lecturer, but once he gets his mic adjusted so you can hear him it's a fantastic time. Unfortunately the 1:30 class time coincided directly with my preferred naptime, so I did briefly lose consciousness to the soothing soing of Professor Knobe's voice. I would recommend enlisting the help of an astute friend who will sharply jab you to awaken you before you begin snoring. - Weekly responses could have been more structured, but there was not much in the way of weekly work apart from doing the readings. - The readings are kind of a lot so you should get on top of them before class. You'll need about a solid hour to digest it properly - the last 15 minutes before class is good but not for the type of analysis you'll have to do in the papers. - I can't speak much to the academic rigor of the course since I ended up taking the class as an accidental Credit D (oops!), but that final looked like a doosie so you should probably prepare for it. - Not a gut class. This is Yale University for God's sake. Who even suggested that there would be an easy class here. Wtf. - Speaking of God you'll have a great time discussing Old White Men and how they somehow proved\/disproved the existence of the supernatural through a lot of prose and introspection. Great stuff, and there are also modern perspectives (with a few women thrown in because it's about god-damned time!). You will enjoy the class if you do the reading. And you'll have a great time tagging your friends in memes about the agency of God, the moral dyad, etc. etc. etc. Happy shopping! ~3"
