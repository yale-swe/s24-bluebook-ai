   "comments": [
    "Electrical Engineering 202 is a survey course in Systems and Signals. Yes, I would recommend to another student because I thought the material was interesting and the class is well run.",
    "EE 202 is a good course, and it has a lot of interesting material. However, it's important to note that the class requires a lot more math than the descriptions make it seem. Students should have a basic understanding of probability and linear algebra in order to do well in this class.",
    "The course covers signals and systems and a bunch of other topics in electrical engineering. My only disappointment in the course was that the professor used far too much math than was necessary for the course. However, if you've taken linear algebra and are good with math topics like probability, the math should not be that big of a deal. Overall an interesting class to take. Not too much work load; problem sets due each week (take about 5-6 hrs a week) and a lab due every two weeks (each lab takes about 3-4 hrs). The midterm was easy but the final was hard. Sekhar is a lenient grader though.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. First of call, Sekhar and Alp are an exceptional professor\/TA combination. They both care a great deal about helping students and are always open to answering questions and taking suggestions from students. Sekhar's lectures were very well organized and he posted lecture notes and problem sets in a very organized and timely manner. In addition, if you go to office hours, Alp is extremely helpful with the problem sets. He really helped me understand all of the important concepts in this class. The material is challenging - especially at the end the lectures on Fourier series get very dry and it is hard to understand Fourier series and transforms on a conceptual level. But overall I think this course gives a great introduction to signals and systems and I would recommend it even if you aren't majoring in engineering. It is always cool to know how things work that you use everyday like the internet and radio.",
    "Interesting topics, but you don't go very in depth into any of them, and the brief introductions you get to them can be confusing at times. Definitely a good precursor for 310. Helps to know statistics.",
    "Great class, but not easy. The tests are really fair and reflect the problem sets with no tricky surprises. that being said, the material gets harder as the course goes on. This class is BETTER if you've had linear algebra only in the sense that you get a deeper understanding of the material, but it isnt required.",
    "This was a great class. If you are interested in the Signals and Systems side of EE, then take this class! There was a decent amount of Probability, but don't let the math scare you. This class was a lot of fun. Especially if you find a a couple of classmates to work on the problem set with. Take it!",
    "This is a great class, definitely take it. The material is interesting and not too difficult. The course is very math heavy, so be prepared, but dont be intimidated. The material is really straightforward if you take the time to wade through all the equations.",
    "Please do not be deceived by the MATH 115 prerequisite for this course. The whole course is all about the math behind signals processing and if you want a true understanding of the material you will need a strong background in probability, linear algebra and of course calculus. Do not take this course thinking the material is practical. The course is almost entirely composed of formulas and derivations that are difficult to interpret conceptually unless you have the necessary background. The professor labors to teach the concept but most of his lectures deal with derivation after derivation of formulas. I would not recommend this course unless you have necessary background and you're really into math.",
    "Great class with an awesome professor. Gives a wide introduction into signals and systems which is good because its such a broad field. Sekhar is very understanding and if Alp is still the TA I would definitely recommend going to see him early and often. The class is challenging but I'm happy I took the class and its a great introduction to electrical engineering",
    "This was a great course. Sekhar is a good teacher and it was fun to come to class. He tests are very reasonable and if you do the problem sets you will be fine. Definitely meet with Alp about the problem sets because he is very helpful. I would definitely recommend this class to a student who is interested in signals and systems and other computer concepts. I really liked this course.",
    "EE202 is a good introductory course that gives you the foundations for signals and systems and communication networks. The material is explained well, though it is really helpful to know a bit about statistics, linear algebra, and be on top of your calculus (no multivarible needed). It is a rigorous course, so be ready to work hard. There are a total of four lab assignments, which are done at home with MatLab. The problem sets are manageable and the textbook does a good job helping to figure out the material. However, the material for the second part of the course is not in the textbook and this is also when is gets a bit more abstract, so stay focused after the midterm. Make sure you work together with your peers on psets and labs, otherwise it's easy to get stuck somewhere. It's a good course overall!",
    "This course covers a ton of interesting subjects. The problem sets can take some time, and the grading is brutal when alp is grading. Exams are reasonable. Definitely a good introduction to info theory and a little bit of signal analysis. Don't bother buying the textbook.",
    "Yes. Definitely.",
    "A standard introduction into signals and systems - it covers many many topics ranging from Huffman and Shannon coding, RSA encryption, hypothesis testing, probabilities, Fourier analysis, etc. The class does not go into that much depth in any of these topics (except maybe the basics of Fourier near the end). You will see a lot of math and probabilities, but honestly you don't need to do even a quarter of the math proofs that are given in the lecture notes(which are very extensive: they are very helpful but also has way too much info at times). I found the labs more challenging than the regular work (but I had never worked on MATLAB before and had almost no programming experience). Shekhar is a very fun lecturer - given that the material can be a bit dry and mathy, his lectures and teaching style was still fun. The TA Alp is really nice with homework help - well, he grades the first few homeworks ferociously (i guess they call it motivational grading!), but the homeworks count very little towards the grade - they are good for exam prep and for grasping the basics, and this course rewards you if you thoroughly understand the basics. See if you like the math in the first week (and if you like coding, that's a plus) - if yes, it's a very good class for you, and definitely very interesting overall.",
    "Yes. You'll learn many interesting parts of the world around you."
