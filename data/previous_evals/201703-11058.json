   "comments": [
    "A broad overview of ekphrastic 'moves' or stances in relation to a swath of artistic and literary materials culled from a wide range of literary periods. The close-readings in class were excellent case-studies, while the recommended theoretical readings outside of class helped me to think about how each individual response might fit into a larger theoretical or historical framework.",
    "I developed familiarity with criticism and canonical texts in the ekphrastic tradition.",
    "This class was fantastic. I had never read quite a few items on the syllabus, and I am very glad I now have.",
    "a spectacularly broad personal canon of ekphrastic poetry is now open to me. Some of it I now know in something like depth.",
    "I came into this course with little to no prior understanding of the concerns of ekphrastic poetry and I now feel confident in the history of ekphrasis and the ways ekphrasis's past concerns may be further developed in contemporary poetry. The course offered a helpful set of keywords -- ekphrastic envy, indifference, etc which allowed us to think of ekphrastic literature as a world unto itself. This course, to me, was also a great example of course design, I thought its progression through various aspects of ekphrasis created a larger arc \/unified narrative about writing poetry and the ways painting's concerns with depth\/ surface, light \/ dark dovetail with poetry's concerns rather beautifully.",
    "This course provided me with a very large reserve of interrelated poems and paintings that I was not previously aware of. It developed my awareness of the breadth of poetry that is written in response to visual art (and vice versa), as well as my ability to analyze the various kinds of ways in which texts might be responding to each other. It also cultivated my ability to analyze visual texts.",
    "Covered a broad historic scope of poetry and art history; practiced in-depth discussion and interpretation; independent and assisted research; critical thinking and writing; philosophy and theory",
    "I greatly appreciated the opportunity to learn more about intermediality and the various ways in which different arts interact. My general impression is that, despite the fashionable notion of interdisciplinarity, the institutional agendas are currently forcing researchers in the humanities to overspecialize in their narrow fields, and the methodology of treating human culture as a whole, in the manner of structuralists and semioticians of the past century, has fallen from grace. My primary field is literature, and this course has helped me to gain confidence in analyzing visual art, which I consider to be a crucial skill for anyone in the humanities. I also appreciated references to film as yet another sister art, although not a focus of this particular class, made by Prof. Fry."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I really enjoyed this course. I particularly find it helpful to have a smaller amount of required reading and more time freed up for recommended readings that one can do on one's own time and according to individual interests (as this course was set up to do) -- it makes it much easier to manage one's workload week to week.",
    "No weaknesses, in my opinion. I had a fantastic time and learned a great deal.",
    "The only weakness if one can call it a weakness was Prof Fry's own enthusiasm; regularly we would not cover all the material assigned because we would discuss one poem in such depth. Also, for a class that relies frequently on images, the images were consistently in terrible resolution... if this was deliberate I can't imagine why.",
    "I mentioned the overall coherence of the class earlier. I would also mention that this was the only class in which we actually discussed the majority of the reading material in class; compared to many classes, this class didn't demand more time than was rewarding, and I appreciated Prof. Fry's effort to make all the reading relevant every week. I also, again, appreciated the clarity and consistency of this class's terminology. The availability of the course materials was very helpful.",
    "I thought the course consisted of a fascinating selection of poems, and I wish there had been more time to study each work. Nonetheless, I think the course benefitted greatly from the very large range of poems and paintings that it contained, and would not wish that any of the material be sacrificed for the sake of a closer stylistic study of individual works.",
    "I loved how wide ranging the course was, and the chronological approach to ekphrasis, which made a new topic much more coherent. Professor Fry was (unsurprisingly) a fantastically rich resource and struck a good balance between traditional, informative teaching and facilitating class discussion--the class was always a friendly and inviting one to be a part of, which helps maximise interesting contributions from different members."

   "comments": [
    "Absolutely (except, of course, that Prof Fry is retiring...alas...) -- I think the way the material spans such a wide timespan makes the course really helpful both as an overview and as a possible opportunity to stick with a time period you know well (for research, etc) but still have the opportunity to branch out a bit into less familiar material.",
    "Yes I would recommend this course to both undergraduate and graduate students.",
    "Definitely.",
    "I would turn to another student, a 'friend of man,' as it were, and say: When old age shall this generation waste Paul Fry remains, in midst of other woe A friend to man, to whom he says Beauty is truth, truth beauty, that is all Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know. yes I would very much recommend this class to anyone. Except it was Prof. Fry's last class so there you go. He is a genius and his retirement is a tragedy insofar as every English student needs what he has to offer criticism, wit, genius.",
    "I would recommend this class to other students, if only for the depth of knowledge that the lectures hold. However, I think any student who cares to think about poetry in new ways would benefit from this class. Also it is nearly multidisciplinary, as I felt like a learned a lot about painting and periods of painting that I did not know.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. I think it provided a wonderful grounding in poetry in general, and a very insightful and interesting look into the world of ekphrasis and visual art.",
    "Yes, if it pertained to their research\/broader academic interests! Professor Fry isn't teaching anymore though so this isn't a relevant question."
