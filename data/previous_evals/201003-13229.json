    "I would recommend this course, especially to another EP&E major who needs to fulfill a core requirement, but with the following disclaimers.Do be aware that game theory isn't so user-friendly if you're rusty on algebra, or just plain bad at it like I am. The problem sets, only six of them!, were major hassles andturned me off in successive weeks from: a) poker-playing, b) generals in mountain passes, c) anyone by the names of Karl, Ernesto, and Rosa (second-worst tree diagram of the semester). The textbooks were useless in getting us through the p-sets, and the course in general.The midterm and final were both fair, if a little heavy on variable manipulation and not with having us tie it back to the concepts. And the professor, while not the most dynamic to learn about a really, really dynamic subject from, is a self-deprecating and all-around sweet man.",
    "Recommend. Interesting, new approach to international relations.Strengths:-Very good organization of the course in general-Good structure-Interesting content-Having the lecture slides online helped a lot for studying& review.-Midterm, Finals and their solutions being posted was also very helpful.Weaknesses:-Syllabus might be a little too ambitious. It felt very challenging; finishing Osborne before the midterm seemed very fast.-Lecture notes were helpful, but sometimes could have a little more detail (e.g. the algebra portion of equations, etc)-Problem sets were very challenging. Took a very long time to do.",
    "A good class for someone who has never taken game theory. In some ways the class suffered because of how fast we went in the beginning. The first half of the semester is meant to cover all of the intro game theory material and the second half is meant to apply that knowledge to real world political conflicts. By the midterm point many people were lost. However shortly after taking the midterm people started to get a much better handle on the material. The second half of the semester was really interesting. It was great to see how we can apply game theory to real world situations. However the details of these interactions also often became confusing. I would say that by the end of the semester everyone very much understood the basic points of the class, but was a little shady on the details.",
    "The course material seemed very interesting, but the course was frustrating. Debs has clear mastery of the topics but does not do a great job transmitting that mastery. The course covers almost all the material that the Game Theory lecture covers\u0097in half the time. Then Debs launches into models with real-world applications. ____________________________________ The fast pace and complexity of the material left me feeling like I never really understood what was happening. The problem sets were extremely time consuming and the reading expectations are high in the second part of the course. Both the midterm and final exam were substantially more difficult than the practice exams he provided.",
    "EP&E 226 01 is very similar to other game theory classes. The concepts taught are largely the same. However, the variation comes from the application of these fundamental ideas and theories. In the popular class taught by Professor Polak, the game theoretic ideas are applied to economic situations. In this course however, the concepts are applied to war and the analysis of its rationality (or irrationality). For anyone interested in learning game theory and applying it to a somewhat uncommon topic, I recommend this class. In my own case, I wasn't that interested in war, but after taking this class my interest increased significantly and would take this class again if I could.",
    "Great course; I would definitely take this class over Professor Polak's class.One thing to note is that this course has a lot more work in the first half of the semester than the second half.",
    "I would only recommend this course over the Econ dept's game theory course if A) you're an EPE major or B) you're familiar with game theory and interested in the war-applications."
