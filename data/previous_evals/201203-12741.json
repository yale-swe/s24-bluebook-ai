    "The class gives a good overview of AI. Scaz is an engaging lecturer and he can be funny at times so that's nice. The reading is unnecessary and you get to bring in a sheet of notes to the Midterm and 2 to the Final so it's not bad, but make sure you know your stuff.",
    "Really struggled with some of the psets - not in that they were particularly difficult, but it was hard to determine what was being asked of us, so the grading sometimes didn't seem fair because we were marked off for things that weren't made clear in the assignment.I don't think it will be like that next year though, as the assignments were (I believe) written by the teaching fellow, who did not expect to have to TA for this class until partway through the semester.",
    "I didnt particularly enjoy this class, especially as an introduction to AI. Part of the problem was the impersonal nature of the class (big, lecture, not enough TAs).",
    "If you want a fun gut and are interested in AI - take it :) If you want to learn a lot of details - you've come to the wrong place.",
    "I didn't feel like it did a very good job of actually teaching anything. At the end of the class, you have a shallow understanding of AI, but the psets and the exams weren't great (hard to understand what would be covered on the exams, psets could either be really easy or really, really annoying).",
    "It's a solid survey of approaches in AI. Disappointingly, you won't actually apply much of the material. Also, the administrative problem of having only one TA to a lecture class of 70+ seriously detracted from the class experience; to facilitate grading, psets were overly short and superficial, making it harder to practice\/gauge understanding of the material.",
    "This was by far my greatest disappointment of the semester. That is not in any way a knock against the professor, but rather the department's complete inability to assign teaching staff. We didn't have a TA for the first month of the course, meaning the problem sets were made trivially easy so that Scaz could grade them all himself. When the TA assignments finally came through, we ended up with only 1 TA, which was completely insufficient for a class this size. This meant that getting anything graded required several weeks. Moreover, it was very clear that our TA didn't know the material that well, as he frequently gave out information that was 'provably incorrect'. This was very frustrating and made the course harder than it otherwise would have been. There was also a disappointing amount of material overlap (identical lectures) between this course and 'Intelligent Robotics'.",
    "I would recommend the class if it gets capped. As is, the material is interesting but the quality of the course really suffered because of its size.",
    "Good survey course. Not very programming intensive; just some Java, Matlab, and (optional) Scheme. Covers topics and main ideas of algorithms, but usually not in enough depth to implement.",
    "The material is very interesting. I really wanted to fall in love with it. It had so much potential. But it fell short\u00e2\u0080\u0094largely for bureaucratic reasons. The huge course only had one TF. That meant problem sets had to be dumbed down, which meant that everyone put this course on the back burner and everyone seemed ambivalent. It's sad, really. However, all of those things will probably be fixed next time around. And so I recommend taking it.",
    "470 was an OK class. It didn't have a ton of work and I learned a lot. The problem sets were pretty disappointing, in that they weren't very interesting. The psets were also very frustrating because they were not specified in detail. You will get infinitely more out of this class if you actually do the readings. I only did the readings right before the exams, but the book was great. Lectures with Scaz were good overall.",
    "AI is a very interesting field; this class inspires further inquiry, but can be quite disconcerting. Can you take this after CS201? Yes. Should you? Probably not. The class suffered from understaffing (one TF for 80 people, and he was not exactly the best), imbalance in problem set difficulty (for PS3, I had to pick up Java from scratch), and rapid pick-up in complexity. We pushed through, but it was not my favorite part of the semester.",
    "It's extremely interesting material, but doesn't necessarily teach you anything that artint.info can't. I wish we did more implementation, but since there was only 1 TF for 72 students (What?!?) there was just no manpower to grade assignments. Yale should be embarrassed.",
    "Don't take it unless Scaz PROMISES you at least two TAs. He's an awesome teacher, and the information is FASCINATING, but this class needs more help.",
    "Interesting from time to time. Psets became tougher as year went on (8-10 hours). Exams were fair",
    "This class was a bit strange. Scaz for some reason spends just as much time on obvious or easy topics as he does on difficult topics, which is sometimes misleading. Problem sets started out very easy and became very difficult by the end of the course. Tests were also challenging. In all, though, the class covers some interesting topics that I've found relevant to other ideas in computer science.",
    "It's interesting but if you're a senior or junior who's taken lots of cs classes you may find it a bit repetitive. Kinda fun though",
    "Broad survey course, so you don't go into a lot of depth on any topic. But the topics covered are interesting and applicable to other fields. Scaz is a good lecturer.",
    "Doubtful.",
    "DONT TAKE THIS CLASS. AI is an interesting topic and that's why I took this class, but this class will make you dislike it.",
    "We covered many different areas of AI to get a general exposure to the subject, coding some topics in the psets. Really interesting\/fun class overall.Strengths: awesome material, very useful to have such exposure, Scaz was enthusiastic about the subject and made it fun to learn especially by showing us videos of how the concepts are being used in the worldWeaknesses: slow start in terms of psets at firstMake sure to read through and understand the slides, they start adding up. Book was excellent for AI, but don't bother reading it for exams. Just look at the psets, then slides and you'll be set.",
    "Great class for an overview of Artificial Intelligence. Professor Scasellati is excellent.",
    "Fun overview of AI. Make sure it's not overbooked though! Be warned: not much coding, and assignments can be uneven."
