    "Instructor: Daniel Boyd Bohac \u00a0Dan is great, respectful, cheerful, knowledgeable and very prompt in getting work back. I thought he did a good job of helping us read the texts critically, and can't think of any way he could improve as a TA.",
    "Instructor: Daniel Boyd Bohac \u00a0Dan is an excellent instructor. Very engaging and knowledgeable! I have no concerns or points of feedback in terms of his teaching style, he just needs to keep doing what he's doing.",
    "Instructor: Daniel Boyd Bohac \u00a0Wow - energetic and smart. He is fantastic.",
    "Instructor: Daniel Boyd Bohac \u00a0Dan is the best TF I've ever had.",
    "Instructor: Daniel Boyd Bohac \u00a0I am a huge Dan fan. He is smart, funny, interesting, engaging, and really helpful in breaking open the text and the culture in a way that can't happen in the big lecture class.",
    "Instructor: Daniel Boyd Bohac \u00a0Very knowledge",
    "Instructor: Daniel Boyd Bohac \u00a0Dan was a great TF. He's eager to get people to talk about a text and uses the discussion well to teach. His enthusiasm for teaching and for ancient texts is really evident.",
    "Instructor: Daniel Boyd Bohac \u00a0Overall section was consistently well-organized and informative. I particularly enjoyed our discussion of pseudepigraphy. Some discussion of the readings and even more open-ended conversation would also be a good addition.",
    "Instructor: Daniel Boyd Bohac \u00a0Very friendly and well-versed in the material",
    "Instructor: Daniel Boyd Bohac \u00a0Dan was an excellent TF. I loved the sections because he was so well-prepared and so deeply engaged in the subject. Every discussion imparted essential information, generally new, even as it reviewed the lectures and reinforced the high points. Dan's familiarity with the material was truly exceptional--and I mean every book we covered! He also seems to know just where the class will struggle, and by consistently asking the right questions, he was able to guide the class to the necessary information while involving everyone in the group with fruitful discussion. Honestly, if a position for assistant professor were available, I would hire him in a heartbeat. He's not just highly proficient in his subject knowledge, but he is a really engaging presenter! I also very much appreciated his comments on my exams and papers, and I found him very willing to meet with any student who needed more guidance. I found his direction very helpful.",
    "Instructor: Daniel Boyd Bohac \u00a0Excellent facilitator",
    "Instructor: Daniel Boyd Bohac \u00a0Dan ranks up there as one of the two top TFs I have had the pleasure of working with during my two years at YDS. He has a brilliant grasp of the material. Dan is able to unwind complex theological themes (eg, Gods righteousness from Adam to end times in Romans) with clarity. He encouraged our section to find our way from A to Z on numerous sticky themes that enabled me, the slow learner in the room, to gain clarity. His detailed written comments on my written work added value and showed that he cared about my progress.",
    "Instructor: Daniel Boyd Bohac \u00a0Daniel Bohac was a truly FANTASTIC teaching fellow. He clearly has a strong command of the material, and is incredibly engaging in discussion. It was such a treat to finally have a TF like Daniel (almost all of my other TFs at YDS have been a disappointment). Daniel will make a wonderful prof when he gets there. He already is.",
    "Instructor: Edmond Zuckier \u00a0Shlomo was a terrific TF and, coming from a jewish background, provided a very interesting insight into the material.",
    "Instructor: Edmond Zuckier \u00a0He knew his information really well and brought a great perspective to it.",
    "Instructor: Edmond Zuckier \u00a0He cared about each of the students and was good at creating meaningful conversation.",
    "Instructor: Edmond Zuckier \u00a0My discussion section was well organized and respectfully led.",
    "Instructor: Edmond Zuckier \u00a0I enjoyed the group discussions, but would have appreciated a little more organized presentations during sections.",
    "Instructor: Edmond Zuckier \u00a0Shlomo did a good job of keeping conversation going in a constructive way and demanding some standard of understanding from us. This was helpful because sections can often be times for people to simply talk about things unrelated to the topics at hand.",
    "Instructor: Edmond Zuckier \u00a0I was thrilled to have Shlomo (\"Edmond\") as our section leader. It had been several years since I had engaged members of the Orthodox Jewish community in religious topics (after a long stretch of Muslim insights at Hartford Seminary!), and his perspectives were always sharply intellectual in their insights, personally engaging, and challenging in their demands for us to respond to tough questions and debate the issues raised in the materials. I felt very privileged to have him as a learning leader.",
    "Instructor: Edmond Zuckier \u00a0Edmond (Shlomo) Zuckier had both strengths and weaknesses as a TF. His top strength was his ability to relate the material to his knowledge base of the Old Testament and the Jewish tradition. However, this also was at times a weakness, as many of our discussions devolved into lectures on Midrash and sacrifice -- interesting topics, but not necessarily why I took a NT class. This part of his teaching could have used better balance. Another weakness of Shlomo was his availability. I emailed him a question or two before the exam and never heard back from him. I had friends who emailed similar questions to other TFs and heard back immediately, or at least before the exam. This is frustrating. Finally, on my final exegesis, I take some note with the grading of my paper. Many of the things I had questions on, I talked directly to Sholomo about, so that I could be sure to cover my tracks in my paper. Nevertheless, he still marked me down on these points which he himself helped shape. Overall, while I enjoyed Shlomo as a TF, I do think there should be considerable discernment on whether he should TF a New Testament course again. I am not sure this is the discipline for him, as his skills might be better utilized in other areas of academic rigor.",
    "Instructor: Edmond Zuckier \u00a0Shlomo was an engaging TF and he made a lot of connections with ancient Judaism that were interesting, though I think frustrating to some of my classmates, because it meant we didn't always focus on Christianity. I found Shlomo's grading on papers to be helpful and consistent, but grading on exams seemed pretty arbitrary (I say this based on my own grades as well as those of my peers in the class).",
    "Instructor: Scott David Davis \u00a0Scott did a great job of managing section. Everything was always super-focused. We were primarily dealing with primary sources, and occasionally brought in the secondary source(s) appointed for the day. Never did I get the sense that our conversation was sprawling in too many directions, but our conversation was always fruitful. He knew how to take on board all the comments being offered (even the ones that were less than helpful), and make them a valued part of the conversation. Section was always a great place to hash out issues in the text under Scott's leadership.",
    "Instructor: Scott David Davis \u00a0Scott was absolutely terrific. He was obviously engaged with and knowledgeable about the material, encouraged robust class discussion in which he pressed us on the points we made (to the benefit of all), and his generosity of spirit made the classroom a collegial space in which to discuss the sometimes sensitive topics (sexuality, etc) that were assigned for the section meetings.",
    "Instructor: Scott David Davis \u00a0Effective discussion facilitation and helpful feedback on assignments. In future sections I would find it helpful to focus more on primary sources.",
    "Instructor: Scott David Davis \u00a0Mr. Scott Davis was a very decent and generous individual to me that afforded me his time when I needed it.He is well versed in New Testament Studies and his insight to the readings help give meaning to the work. I could not have completed the semester without his help.",
    "Instructor: Scott David Davis \u00a0Strength: I found Scott to be an extremely knowledgeable and well-prepared TF. He seemed to genuinely enjoy the act of teaching and provided meaningful, descriptive feedback on my written work. Weaknesses:I honestly cannot think of any suggestions at this time.",
    "Instructor: Scott David Davis \u00a0Scott is a thoughtful and diligent teacher. His sessions were well rounded and allowed for uniform participation of all attendees. Scott's style was open, candid and welcoming of any type of beliefs or points of view. His general comments on test and papers were detailed and thorough. We especially appreciated his availability and support throughout the semester. One area for improvement could be to spend some dedicated time reviewing results of the mid term exam so as to help us to better prepare for the final. The materials on the Pauline epistles became a source of confusion for many students when confronted with a myriad of quotes, some of which were not felt to be typical at all of any one epistle, at least for the level of understanding of the class. If this mid term (or any other test) proved to be a challenge for a good proportion of the class, then spending time with a careful review of the correct answers would be of incredible help to consolidate the desired level of learning expected from the students. Overall, Scott was a pleasure to work with, and hopefully he will continue to develop his skills in the teaching space. His presence was an asset to this course."
