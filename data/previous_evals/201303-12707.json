    "I leaned a lot, but to any students thinking of taking this course, you will have to do a lot of independent learning (which is not necessarily a bad thing, but it is good to know that there is not a lot of guidance provided by the professor in guidelines for the paper, how to study for the exams, etc.)",
    "I highly recommend this course to any student who would like to learn more about the conceptual bases of modern phylogenetic biology. The ideas taught in this course are widely applicable across disciplines.",
    "The class was challenging and sometimes difficult to keep up with. If the student isn't interested extensively in phylogenetics, they shouldn't take it. If phylogenetics is relevant to their research even peripherally, this class is a must."

   "comments": [
    "Before I took this class, I wasn't sure if or how I would use phylogenetics in my research. Now, I feel like I can approach the questions I am interested in addressing from a phylogenetic perspective. That makes this course very useful.",
    "Before taking this course, I possessed very superficial knowledge of phylogenetic biology. I was more or less treating the building and analysis of phylogenetic trees as a task and not as a craft. This course deepened my knowledge and appreciation for phylogenetic biology.",
