   "question_id": "YC403",
   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I think that a strength was how every unit covered a history\/culture, vocab theme, and grammar section. So we were always working on all these skills. I also liked the structure of having a chapter test every two weeks instead of a larger test less often. One weakness is perhaps there was too much homework - German hw took up a LOT of time. Though in the long run it definitely had a positive impact on our German skills, it was hard to balance the homework along with everything else.",
    "More vocabulary games, and perhaps a little more lenience with english in class if it means making sure we understand what is being said a little bit."
