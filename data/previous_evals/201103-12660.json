   "comments": [
    "Take this class. I learned so much about the transatlantic slave trade. It's a good rest of world credit as well",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student. The material was interesting and overall the lectures were well done.",
    "Take it",
    "good survey. try to get in Nyasha's section if she's a TA",
    "This was a really good class if you want a 300 and need a pre-industrial. The readings are not that heavy, and the lectures are really interesting. I highly recommend it.",
    "If you are looking for a fairly easy history class, this is a good one to take. It is pretty easy and the workload consists of 2 map quizzes, a midterm, an 8-10 page paper, and a final. There is not too much information to memorize and it is all pretty interesting.",
    "Harms isn't the best lecturer in the world, but he does make lectures interesting and the material is fascinating. i would take it. not too much work, only 1 paper, a final, and a midterm.",
    "I strongly recommend that you do not take this course. If you are looking for a rest of the world credit, look elsewhere. The readings and lectures are not pretty boring and you will quickly get bogged down in obscure details without seeing the major trends of this period. The amount of reading is not that much for a history course, but it is very confusing because the cultures and societies are so different. This was the first year that there was a 10 page final paper and a final exam, so if you take it, its a lot of work during the end of year.",
    "Yes! Very interesting material, and some great themes came out of the class that will allow me to look at the slave trade in a new light. Annoying emphasis on primary sources (fun to read but useless for the exams) However, you have to go to class or else you wont be able to answer the exam questions... which are all \"compare this region with that region\". Grading was easy, I think.",
    "A surprisingly interesting lecture about the slave trade ERA (not so much slavery itself). We learned about pretty incredible things, and I feel like many misconceptions I had about Africa and slavery were corrected. Professor harms is very upbeat and funny, and really has a gift for lecturing. The workload is relaxed and as long as you take decent notes in lecture you will do well on the two exams, which are quite straightforward (a few one-paragraph IDs + a short essay question). Take it, you will not regret it.",
    "This was my favorite class I've taken so far at Yale! African history is really interesting. I am a science major and I definitely want to take more history because of this class. There isn't a ton of reading but it's really interesting. Take this class!",
    "This class covers Africa through the Era of the Slave Trade pre and post Atlantic Slave trade. Lectures are a bludgeoning of information and for success in this course I would advise GOING to section. Nyasha was extremely well-learned in the topics of this course and always available and accessible as a TA. There was a lot of reading for this course but the reading was never covered on the exams. The reading only came into play as far as commenting in section (which you will want to do for participation) and for the 10pg paper, which was really the only real work for this course, and new as of this year. I really enjoyed this course and from taking it have decided that I want to pursue a lot more courses in African studies.",
    "Pretty good course and interesting material. Does not focus at all on slavery in America which was surprising to me. Not terrible workload and the final was not cumulative.",
    "Africa in the Era of Slave Trade is good if you need to fulfill a ROW history credit and are looking for a course without too much work. If you attend lectures, you should be fine for the midterm and final, which are both pretty straightforward. Professor Harms can be hard to follow in lecture, and the material is not insanely engaging, but a 50 minute class is definitely bearable. I wouldn't take it just for kicks, but it's definitely a pain-free way to get a requirement done.",
    "Overall a standard history class. Lectures were informative but not particularly engaging, Professor was enthusiastic about the material, and I learned a lot from studying for the very fair midterm, final, and writing the paper. If you're not a history major, be prepared to be surrounded by a lot of bored history majors who just have to be there for the \"rest of world\" requirement.",
    "Very good introductory course to African history. The readings are a bit dry, but the slave narratives do liven things up a bit for their descriptions of the awful conditions of slavery and how some men returned to Africa in the end. There is not a great deal of reading compared to other courses, and the tests are straightforward enough.",
    "The course provides a good overview of Africa's role in the transatlantic slave trade, and isn't too much work. However, the course could be a bit more focused. Take it for distributional requirement, or as an intro to further african history study.",
    "This class is a quick look at the regions, kingdoms and empires of West Africa during the era of the slave trade. I would probably recommend this class only to someone who is particularly interested in African history or a history major who needs a \"rest of the world\" credit. It can be a little tough to get through sometimes, but if you're completely invested and interested in the material, it can be worth it."
