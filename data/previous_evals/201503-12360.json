    "Don't take it unless you have to.",
    "I would recommend the course to another student. All in all, there seemed to be a lot of resources available to students who might be having trouble. With office hours, instructors, the textbook, and the always accessible videos, there was a support system in play.",
    "I would definitely recommend Math 115. It is a rewarding class where the workload is manageable and you learn a lot.",
    "I would recommend Math 115 to students who are interested in learning calculus as prerequisites for majors for other courses and to really take advantage of shopping period to find a professor that works at a pace that they are comfortable with.",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone who is actually interested in moving forward and taking higher level math courses.",
    "It's a good class! I'm not a math major, so for someone who isn't looking at math (or STEM in general), it's a fine class to take, especially if you want to take care of the QR requirement.",
    "I would recommend Math 115 02 to a fellow student. It provided a concise review of AP Calculus BC material and introduced some more advanced calculus concepts. Furthermore, the information covered in this course was relevant to other classes I took this semester such as Econ 115."
