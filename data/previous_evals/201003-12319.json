    "Great intro spanish course. You learn a lot without working too hard. Very fun!",
    "To summarize the course I would say that it is a good beginner's course, even if you have never spoken a word before. It will require effort, but in the long run it is worth it!",
    "Spanish 110 is an excellent introduction to the Spanish language. You'll learn several tenses, more grammar, and a lot of vocab. You can communicate in basic ways by the end of the semester - it's exciting! Maripaz Garcia is a terrific teacher in particular. You also pick up some cultural knowledge too. Requires some studying, but not too difficult - a real winner!",
    "take it",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone genuinely interested in learning the language. If you're not interested in putting in the requisite effort to really learn the material, you won't get a lot out of this class, and going to class every day will be a huge drag. Be warned that the class follows the textbook very closely, so in class activities with a partner can at times be painful.All in all though, I was really pleased with the amount of Spanish we learned in just a semester. I'm taking this class as a senior (after taking L5 courses in two other languages), and I thought it was fun and not too stressful. The workload is consistent but very manageable, no more than 30 minutes per day. Do the online exercises early, as they do take more time!",
    "I would definitely recommend it for any student who really wants to learn spanish. It is a very good course.",
    "Spanish 110 is a great intro-level Spanish class. Although some students have had a bit of Spanish before, the majority have not had any exposure to the language. If you can, get Maripaz Garcia as your professor - she's incredible!"
