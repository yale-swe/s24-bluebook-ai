    "A penetrating and holistic survey of wisdom literature from BCE",
    "I learned how to conduct insightful comparisons between ancient texts in translation from both the Western (more familiar) and Eastern traditions.",
    "It was my first time in a class centered around comparing different works of literature (particularly from different traditions). I think the class helped me to observe not only the themes of the works but their structure.",
    "I learned about ancient wisdom and literary traditions from around the world coming mostly from between two hundred or so years BCE and two hundred or so years CE. I read Platonic, Aristotelian, Babylonian, Christian, Hindu, Buddhist, and Daoist texts, learning a little bit about the beliefs, styles, and notions of wisdom contained in each. Taking this course gave me insight into human naturejust what my liberal arts education is for, no? I learned to consider the audience and the conceit of a text, whether it was passed down orally, and if so who decided to write it down and when.",

   "comments": [
    "I think the course got better as the semester progressed. I remember that I didn't enjoy the first half of the semester as much as I did the last half, and I think the readings had to do a lot with that. Some of the readings were more biographical and had to do with people rather than their ideas. I didn't find those engaging, and I don't think I got much out of them. Once we moved on from those readings, the class got better. In general, there were too many readings. In a sense, that might have been necessary because we were dealing with a lot of different traditions, but it made it impossible to engage with and spend time understanding every reading we were assigned. Especially because these are texts we're unfamiliar with, I think depth over breadth would have been better. I usually ended up focusing on one or two of the readings assigned for that day, and I got a lot out of those. But some readings I had to either ignore or read superficially, and I don't remember much from those.",
    "Strengths: Great format of readings and responses, great professor, great syllabus* Weaknesses: Great syllabus but wasn't consistently engaging",
    "I think the course is really well organized already. Professor Hunter really knows the material and has a very commanding presence in class. Sometimes the texts are a little outside of his expertise and we feel a little lost, but they were still fun to explore together.",
    "More structured discussion questions to pair with the readings could be helpful. I also found the reading load to be very heavy during some weeks.",
    "The strength of the course is the breadth of the readings, covering so many different and interesting traditions of thought. The professor embraces the challenge of dealing with many traditions and brings enthusiasm to each one. The weakness of the course was the classroom experience. The professor could improve this by relinquishing control over the sequence of remarks. This would encourage students to respond more directly to one another's commentsto have a conversationrather than share individual remarks that only rarely build directly on previous contributions. A democratic seminar space is a beautiful thing, increasing class members' accountability to one another and eventually personal rapport with one another. Clearer expectations for writing style and argumentation methods would benefit a course which attracts student from a variety of academic backgrounds. There was too much reading. I could not thoroughly read everything assigned in the allotted time and found that as a result there would be moments when I had to back away from the conversation. Online forum posts grew stale. The prompt could vary from the (passage, comment, question) format. Students could be encouraged\/required to respond to one another. Students could take on different roles in the forum each week\/month\/other unit of time. Forum posts require creative attention.",
    "Professer Hunter admits from the beginning that this course is an experiement. The course ended up being a wonderful introduction to many different traditions of thought (Chinese, Greek, Babylonian, Indian, among others). And it taught valuable skills in cross cultural comparative thought, which is rare in Humanities departments today. Sometimes, I wish the class was a bit more philosophy oriented, but it often tended to be more literary. This is fine, but I was so inspired by the philosophical richness of some of the texts that I wanted to go farther. Hunter began the class with a piece of recent scholarship that attempted to classify wisdom--I didn't think this was particularly the best way to frame the class, but other students enjoyed it.",
    "This course is a great way to introduce students to important\/interesting texts from a lot of different traditions while also getting them to think critically about them in comparison. There were some times when I thought that discussions could have been a bit more focused on looking across texts rather than on different texts in succession, but on the other hand I also recognize the problems with being TOO comparative with these texts and in general the discussions were fine and incredibly engaging as they were."

    "Yes, this class is an outstanding and important curriculum at Yale. A unique perspective of ancient literature.",
    "If you are at all interested in how the famous texts of the Western Canon (Plato, Aristotle, Herodotus, Epictetus, the Bible, etc.) may compare with the famous texts of the Eastern tradition (Confucius, Zhuangzi, Upanishads, etc.), please take this class!! You learn so much about both traditions. Especially if you have a background in Western texts (from DS or your major), it is very interesting to reread those texts in the context of Eastern texts that explore the same topics (death, rhetoric, advising, wise women, etc.). There is only one midterm exercise (ours was a shorter paper) and final paper on a comparative topic of our choice. The rest of your grade comes from the biweekly reading responses and class participation. Professor Hunter is really amazing and very commanding in the classroom. I really enjoyed listening to his short intro talks each section and getting the chance to analyze the texts in class. Our class build pretty good rapport and a lot of us became good friends! 10\/10 would take again.",
    "Enjoyed the course but would say that the course would need to have a more reliable structure and workload before giving a strong endorsement.",
    "I don't know you, but if you're like me, a philosophy major looking to explore the world of thought outside the so-called Western canon, then this class might suit you. I learned about Buddhist, Daoist, Hindu, Greek, Babylonian, and Christian literary and philosophical traditions. The course material is fascinating, if a little bit jumbled, rushed, and unfamiliar. The assignments for this course will not surprise you and could use a little bit more life if you ask me.",
    "Most students in the class didn't have background in Eastern thought and many didn't have background in Greek thought either--regardless, the class still thrived and reached many interested points in discussion. I went into the class with a bit of background in both traditions, so at times I felt a little stifled in discussions. I would recommend the class more to someone with less background in the traditions. I ultimately did enjoy the class though, and it was very helpful to read texts again and challenge my previous (and often wrong) interpretations.",
    "This is a really wonderful and refreshing course for those interested in getting a cross-cultural introduction to ancient wisdom. It's pretty bad ass and Professor Hunter is really good at engaging everyone in the class through discussion and adapting the syllabus to meet the group's interest. I read almost everything in this class and enjoyed pretty much all of it. Reading and participating in this class feels wholesome and I couldn't recommend it enough.",
    "\"Sages\" is kind of a hard class to characterize. It's not, as the course labels would suggest, really an East Asian Languages and Lit class (it's really about examining various traditions across the ancient world) or a philosophy class (as Prof. Hunter himself will tell you -- you look at a lot of texts that you would likely call \"philosophical,\" but the way you examine and analyze them is not--or at least does not have to be--through a traditional philosophical mode). It's a cross-tradition look at \"wisdom,\" and exactly what \"wisdom\" entails; it allows for a lot of different modes of thinking, and as such is, in my opinion, a class that is very accessible for anyone who is interested to take (versus, say, just philosophy or humanities majors). It's definitely a great way to gain an exposure to a LOT of different ancient traditions in one semester; you definitely won't be an expert in any of them just from this course, but it's a nice gateway. The reading was fairly manageable in my opinion (though I know there were definitely some who disagreed with me on that). You really have to do most if not all of it to really get something out of the discussions, though. Prof. Hunter is amazing, and really helps this course reach its potential; he's very good at facilitating and adding to discussion, and very accessible and helpful outside of class. Overall, an awesome course that anyone who's interesting in ancient texts should consider taking."
