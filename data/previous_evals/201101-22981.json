    "A very hands on course that teaches how basics of astronomical instrumentation, how to prepare and run an observation, and after that reduce and analyze obtained data. Recommended to other students as well because it is well taught, with appropriate workload and covering topics which every astronomer, both observational and theoretical, should be familiar with."
