    "Having required seminars is a great way to stay engaged with the world of public health outside of YSPH.",
    "Loved the speaker series! Learning about how people in the \"real world\" utilize skills in chronic disease epidemiology was important for incoming students like us.",
    "It's great! I liked hearing about other people's research (especially on topics that I am personally not invested in or have experience in, because it gives me a fresh perspective). The food was good too, although it took a long time to settle down because of the lunch rush at the beginning of the semester.",
    "great visiting professors and lecturers",
    "Strengths: Introducing topics in CDE Provides lunch Weaknesses: ALWAYS STARTED LATE Topics are inconsistent and most of the time uninteresting - not tailored to student's interests",
    "I really enjoyed the selection of speakers throughout the semester. All of the content was engaging and fascinating.",
    "Some of the speakers were really boring, not much interesting content Would recommend having speakers who are doing a wider range of things in CDE",
    "I loved the seminar series. The people who were brought in were fascinating and extremely relevant to a lot of what I was learning in my classes.",
    "Good course in terms of exposing students with different scholars and academic trends.",
    "I absolutely loved all the lectures and guests! The topics were extremely interesting.",
    "lunch is really good compared to other department. Every week professor's speech was interesting and showed us latest knowledges.",
    "A good combination of talks on topics that cover recent advances in the field of epidemiology and delivered by inspiring people who are the best in their fields.",
    "Some seminars were great, but some were a bit boring\/not quite strongly related to CDE. Really enjoyed the CT public health commissioner",
    "There is nothing better than learning from someone in the field while enjoying good food during lunch. weakness: In the future, can the students have more leverage on what topic we are interested in? maybe this will provide more incentives for people from other majors to join us and benefit from the talks together.",
    "The course is excellent. Those lecture help me to build a general frame of the epi study.",
    "It is great because you can learn many latest research in this area.",
    "Interesting topics. I would add other topics such as career paths in academia and how to get to the professor level. Would also add a topic about publishing and the process. In general, I would include lectures that are applicable to career path and relevant for masters and phd students.",
    "The seminar was a good one and the guest speakers invited to give lectures were extremely interesting. I have no negative feedback to give.",
    "Excellent"

   "comments": [
    "Yes; a lot of the talks were very interesting.",
    "A weekly guest lecture series with free catered food each week, no homework, and no exams. AMAZING",
    "If you're free during lunch, you should come listen to someone speak! You get food and it's a bit more interesting than sitting in the lounge or library.",
    "great introduction to a variety of topics and research in CDE",
    "You go to the classroom - don't bother getting there early because it will start ten minutes late anyway, get food, and listen to a speaker for 50 minutes. No engaging or anything. I think there were readings before the class but they were never mentioned, so I didn't bother. Then you leave and forget about it until the next week.",
    "Mandatory for first-year CDE students Doesn't meet often Somewhat dull No work required",
    "Yes. Guest speakers and seminar topics are diverse and interesting",
    "I would definitely recommend this to another student. Its a nice way to spend your lunchtime. The speakers were all passionate and interesting and relevant to what we discuss in our courses.",
    "Good stress-free seminar style course. I would recommend it.",
    "Wonderful guest speakers with free food!",
    "yes. it is a good opportunity to get to know the professors in CDE and their research areas.",
    "Good job making attendance compulsory for this series. Students often times forget the larger picture of what they should learn about except the textbook materials.",
    "This is a requirement for CDE students. However, I hope students from other major can join us as well. It is good to learn from those who are more experienced than us.",
    "The course is great to let you know the latest research direction in this area.",
    "Interesting invited lecturers. The topics covered were engaging and relevant. I would recommend it to other students. Lunch was great always.",
    "Good seminar to start your freshman year, especially the introductory of professors at YSPH doing research. It helped jump start a few conversations and productive projects.",
    "Good seminars. Some lacked scientific strength"
