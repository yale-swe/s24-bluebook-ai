   "comments": [
    "A very interesting course, and a lot of work. As a physics major with no linguistics experience, I found the pace of this course a bit too fast, especially in the beginning where you have to learn IPA and everyone else seems to already know it! I found the articulatory analysis we did super interesting but didn't really care for all we did with IPA (which, as it turns out, is probably 80% of the class). I'm glad I have the knowledge about articulatory acoustics and physics that I do, but I probably would not take this class again due to the amount of homework on IPA that didn't interest me. All this being said, this course is a very science-y way to get a social science credit, so that's a big plus. Be warned, though--it's a lot of onerous work if the subject doesn't totally interest you!",
    "Take this class if you are into linguistics, or if you just want to learn about the sounds of human language, for some reason (like me). With no previous experience in Linguistics the first half of this class was pretty tough, as there are a lot of symbols and terminologies to learn but eventually it starts to make sense. Class is quite a bit of work, with readings and weekly assignments, midterm\/final and a final project. There's also listening quizzes that are difficult but thankfully curved quite generously. It's a lot to handle but Ryan is an excellent instructor who makes it all worth it.",
    "This class probably isn't the best way to start Linguistics. Take 110. This course is a lot of work. Your classmates will be grad students. A lot of learning will happen on your own. Good luck.",
    "I would recommend the class, but I would explain to any student that the course goes beyond just phonemes and sound production into areas such as waveform analysis and spectrograms, which weren't bad, but I didn't expect to focus so heavily on based on the course description",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class to a fellow student. It is obviously essential for linguistics students, but I think that many other students would also find it interesting and discover a new way of thinking about language and sound."
