    "The homework was almost always entertaining and its purpose was clear enough to make me consider the complexities of the class's topic in advance, which of course always made for a more engaging and high-level class discussion. The only assignments that felt less valuable than usual were the lengthy passages in Stage Writer's Handbook. While it was helpful to have a textbook that presented the topic in layman's terms, it was sometimes redundant when coupled with the court opinions and was rarely referenced in class.",
    "The syllabus was so thoughtfully planned out and the workload manageable. All of the assigned readings were engaging and worth reading.",
    "A lot of readings, but very informative and useful. I'm much more confident in reading legal documents and interpreting contracts after taking the class. Hope to have chance to take more law class on intercultural property."

    "Classes v2 was organized perfectly, with dates listed. A small touch that was very helpful. The class had no projects, but that makes sense for the topic, I think.",
    "I really appreciated that all of the course material was accessible on classesv2 and we didn't have to purchase any textbooks (aside from the handbook). All the units we covered were fascinating and presented in a logical order."

    "Joan clearly knows her stuff, and her enthusiasm for the material shines through. Her examples were always perfect illustrations for the topic at hand. She was always able to answer questions in a way that clarified the incredibly complex material, and the visual aid of her presentations was carefully laid out. This class could easily fall apart in the hands of a lesser instructor, but the detail and careful thought that went into the progression of the lessons made it entertaining and easy to grasp. I will share that I personally felt the class's energy dip a bit in a couple of the sessions on contracts - perhaps that is the nature of the beast, as there are less court cases with ridiculous scenarios to be entertained by; but the pacing of the class coupled with the decrease in visual aids made it a bit less engaging (though still clear, and the importance of those sessions was not lost on me).",
    "Joan was incredibly warm and welcoming to all her students. I always felt I could approach her with questions or just talk casually about intellectual property. Joan made every minute of class enjoyable with her sense of humor and deep knowledge of the material. Joan is a gift to the academic world, both in her experience in theater and in law, and is incredibly adept at teaching."

    "The topics discussed were a serious gap in my knowledge prior to the class. While I may not be able to retain all the complex nuances or details for the rest of my career, I am grateful to have been given the resources that I can reference in the future, as well as a framework for thinking about how to protect myself and my theater from the legal complications that can arise in the absence of careful planning.",
    "I am amazed by how much I learned in this class. By reading cases that are relevant and involve famous plaintiffs\/defendants, I will better retain the course material. When campus was erupting about the naming of Franklin College and how it should be in honor of Aretha Franklin, I couldn't help but think about Aretha Franklin's fear of flying and how that got her into legal trouble. I am confident that down the line, I will remember much of what I learned in this class.",
    "This class is very useful and informative. It was a good start for future learning of law and the arts."

    "I loved your powerpoints and how you presented the material. However, I think it may have been helpful to include some media in the presentations. I know you often showed us pictures related to certain cases, and you included all of the relevant media on classes v2, but it may have been helpful to, for example, hear the excerpt from 2 Chainz when we were talking about it in class. Additionally, I think that in preparation for the exams - either during class time or as a handout - it would have been helpful to have a few mock questions to prepare for the exams.",
