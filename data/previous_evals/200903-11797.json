   "comments": [
    "It's a great class. Marcus is a really great, and really interesting guy. And he often brings his own research into the discussion, which makes things really interesting.",
    "Yes, it's an interesting and pretty easy class for non-Western pre-industrial credit. Just make sure to write your paper about a non-Western event to get credit.",
    "This class is fairly easy and yet very interesting. I feel like I genuinely learned things, and other than reading \"A Short History of Jews,\" none of the reading is necessary.",
    "If you have any interest in Jewish history, take it. A great survey that answered a lot of my questions about why Judaism functions as both a culture and a religion in the present did and why certain Jewish rites are the way they are.",
    "I would recommend Jewish history to another student. There is not a heavy course load, the lectures are interesting, and Ivan Marcus is great!",
    "I really liked History of the Jews mostly because I was interested in the material, but as a class itself I'd say it was good, but not great. The whole class is just him talking. No powerpoints, he doesn't use the board, and he'll very rarely point to something on a map, but that's it. It's easy to get board and if you nod off you better find someone else's notes to look at cause that info isn't available anywhere else. I liked the way Professor Marcus challenged some of the common ideas people hold about Jewish history, and I really liked the intersection between the Bible analysis and historical sources. I wish there had been more context given at the beginning of each lecture to let us know what we were talking about. Sometimes he would explain the significance of a person, source etc. but I wouldn't even be sure what year or which diaspora we were talking about until halfway through the class. Take it if you want to learn the material cause it's not so hard, but if you're not interested you'll definitely get bored.",
    "an easy history class. take it with a friend and switch off every lecture taking notes. go to class because it is interesting but hard to stay focused for an hour and fifteen minutes.",
    "Great class. Definitely take it with Marcus",
    "This is a broad survey course spanning about 1000 years of Jewish history.I would recommend it. Ivan Marcus is one of the smartest professors I've had at Yale, and he is very accessible, so make use of his office hours too.While it has a gut reputation, this is not entirely true. There are two hour exams and one paper, which were all fairly difficult. The reading is unnecessary because he summarizes all he wants you to know about it in class.",
    "I would recommend History 219 to another student.",
    "The class is a straight up lecture--no section, no discussion. If you want a good background in Jewish history, fair grading, and a great deal of freedom in your term paper, go with it. I would certainly recommend a class with Professor Marcus, but maybe one where you get to know him better.",
    "A very interesting class for those wanting to more about Judaism, but also a very challenging course. Not for the faint of heart."
