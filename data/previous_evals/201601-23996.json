    "Standard. If you're doing wetwork, you probably started at least a semester ago. Makes things a lot less stressful. Presentation and final paper (10-15pp) at the end.",
    "Senior thesis so the experience will vary greatly. Overall, I feel like the BME thesis requirements are pretty lenient so if you just put in the effort you should be fine.",
    "senior BME project. required to graduate.",
    "The senior project is not something to stress about. If interested in doing an experimental project, prior lab experience (especially in the lab for which the senior project would be related) is desirable, since it can take time to learn techniques, and some experiments are slow. I also find that spending at least a summer in a lab before undertaking the senior project in that lab makes a difference. But a project can be done over senior year or even a bit more than a semester.",
    "Mandatory if you want to graduate! Don't stress over too much",
    "It's required for BME. But, it's also enjoyable to work on a project of your own. Be sure to allot more than the recommended 10 hours per week to complete your project.",
    "BENG474 is the required BME senior project and is what you make of it and largely dependent on how organized your PI is \/ how clear of an exploratory question you and your mentor establish at the outset. The strength of this course is that it is light in terms of assignments, allowing students to focus on their research. The weakness is that there's not a lot of accountability for the PI's - some PI's are very unresponsive, and that becomes a deterrent to the student's work. It's completely on you to reach out to an advisor if you have any problems, and they may or may not be able to help.",
    "This is the second semester senior project in BME. You should obtain a letter grade for this class. It's pretty low-key; there is just a midterm update, final paper, and final presentation. Essentially, you get out of it what you put into it.",
    "If you're a BME senior, you have to take this class. Don't worry about the presentation or the paper too much - they are both very low-key. Especially the presentation."
