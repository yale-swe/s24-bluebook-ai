   "comments": [
    "great in depth survey of human rights journalism and the perils and pleasures of the trade. would definitely recommend to another student.",
    "Survey into how journalists cover massive atrocities.",
    "This course is a survey of various human rights events as seen through the journalist's perspectives. The work load is high but the expectations and grading procedures are weak so you never really know where you stand, and you usually don't have to read to still follow the discussion.",
    "Take it if you want to read great pieces of journalism!",
    "Professor Dada is a brilliant journalist, with much experience at the intersection of journalism and human rights. He is a faithful personal mentor, and he makes a great effort to ensure every student is working to their potential. The seminars are very student-driven and engaging.",
    "This was an interesting course because Carlos has so many connections -- the readings were fascinating and it was cool to meet (via Skype) so many people involved in them. The class skewed more polisci than journalism, which was disappointing as someone interested in journalism,and it felt rather disorganized\/haphazard, but it was at least cool to engage the readings and writers. Carlos is extremely accomplished and impressive and interesting, and his connections are top-notch. That said, I don't know if he really knew what he was doing in a classroom setting, because it often felt like he was teaching us very very fundamental things\/underestimated the capabilities of people in the class. Had the class been Carlos talking about his career and own experiences, I think I would have enjoyed it much more and taken much more away -- he's a very, very kind, funny, accomplished man, but I didn't think he was great as a professor.",
    "I would recommend the class to those that are very into journalism. I am not completely into journalism and at times the class seemed a little distant to me but I would always catch up and figure it out so it is definitely not impossible if you're more like myself with little journalistic background."
