   "comments": [
    "An excellent class on an unusual subject, taught by one of the gems of the department. I've never seen a class that blends so many different things -- from detective fiction and noir to westerns to post-structuralist literary theory to computer science to historical criticism to sci-fi to philosophy of mind and language to the overall question of how the humanities can prove its claims -- and does it \/well\/. It's an excellent chance to study an underappreciated area of literary study and to be exposed to some of the most exciting new work coming out of the field. Not to be missed.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to other students: particularly those interested in theoretical questions about affect, those interested in genre, and those interested in the 20th century more broadly.",
    "Do it.",
    "I strongly recommend this course.",
    "The course is well-balanced between its theoretical focus and its attention to individual texts. Discussions during class are stimulating though perhaps they are at times confusing without a general structure to them. It is recommended for students with already a fairly strong background in 20th century literature or film studies, since it focuses on specific instances where the questions of meaning and affect may be further explored rather than a more general understanding of the topic.",
    "I would highly recommend this class to a student who wants to take a theory-based approach to classic 20th-century works of film and literature, both high and \"low.\" ENGL 985 explores the relationship between the semantic meaning of and affective (roughly: emotive) response to works of art, teaching new ways (and thinking) of interpretation. The blend of books, movies, and academic articles is excellent."

   "comments": [
    "This was definitely one of the most helpful courses I've taken in terms of thinking about potential dissertation topics. While my interest isn't in film in particular--and it was primarily through different filmic genres that we explored our theoretical questions--I do a lot of work on affect, and the course helped me think about affect in many different ways that I had not thought about it before.",
    "This course enhanced my knowledge of critical theory and taught me new ways to approach film in general. Because I'm not a graduate student, I took this course purely out of personal interest, and am glad I did."
