    "I couldn\u0092t have asked for a more clear structure for the course. All the required readings were available in advance, in PDF format, and given with an included synopsis of the upcoming lecture. Within each synopsis, the AOC included further readings and a series of questions to consider before coming to the lecture. FANTASTIC! The clarity and structure of this course should be used as a precedent during the creation of new electives.",
    "Yes. However, the library frequently did not have books available that I needed. Some books were checked out until the next year, so I was not able to reference it at all. It is no longer in circulation, so I was also unable to purchase it in time for my research.",
    "I think that all of the resources available were sufficient, although it would have been useful for the course to have its own course folder on the server, as we received most documents via email.",
    "Fine."
