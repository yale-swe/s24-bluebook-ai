   "comments": [
    "The topics may make you a bit squeamish, but if you don't mind some crazy kinky readings then this class is a must take. It's fascinating and makes a great 5th class without being a gut. The reading is fairly heavy, but the workload is fairly light: only three papers, all of which are actually really fun to write.",
    "Opened my eyes to things about sex I thought were normal or natural - they ain't!",
    "I really enjoyed it overall--essentially, you read two or three articles for each class about sex and sexuality, and then you talk about them after a brief lecture portion. Sometimes the work became a bit easy; I think the whole time the class was waiting for the concepts to get a little more complex or difficult. However, at the same time, this is a fascinating subject and simply having excited peers made discussions interesting and engaging. You'll come to see many different aspects of human sexuality in an entirely different light. I would recommend it if you have a free spot in your schedule: it's not too much work, but it's absolutely fascinating and you'll look forward to the readings as enjoyable breaks from your other crazier work. A good fifth credit that is enjoyable and fun.",
    "This course was really good. We take a different theme regarding sexuality each week (have a 30 min lecture about it) and then discuss it with the reading for the rest of class. The reading is definitely manageable and the assignments are not bad.",
    "It's all about sex, baby! I learned so much about sexuality in this class and didn't realize how lacking my knowledge was before this class. I would absolutely reccommend it.",
    "Definitely take it if you are interested in sexuality. However, do not be intimidated by the load of WGSS students in the course. It is anthropologically based.",
    "I would recommend this class to another student who's looking for a fun and not-too-stressful class. The material is fascinating and the workload isn't too bad. For someone who's been exposed to a lot of anthropology in the past this course will probably be a bit repetitive, but for someone who hasn't this is a great introduction to anthropology anda great way to explore a fun and relevant topic.",
    "highly recommended!",
    "I would very much recommend the course. It is a fun, interesting, engaging course. If you are at all interested in anthropology, gender studies, sexuality studies or simply in things that affect your everyday life you should take the course.",
    "Super interesting! Gives you a great vocabulary and theory, and some really fun case studies. also helps your ability to write different types of papers.",
    "I'd recommend it as a fifth class (one that's less intense) but i didn't really learn a lot from it. learned a lot of interesting pop culture news but the papers didn't help me be a better writer or push myself.",
    "It won't be offered again, so there's not a whole lot of point to this evaluation, but THIS COURSE WAS AWESOME."
