    "Through the three semesters that WGSS guides you through the Senior Essay, I have learned an incredible amount about how to conduct research, sustain my own personal stamina, hone an argument that holds together over dozens of pages, and, ultimately, write a 65-page essay. It has inspired me to eventually go back to grad school.",
    "I learned how to carry out long term research and how to utilize that research to write a lengthy essay",
    "Wrote an awesome senior essay!",
    "I think that the senior essay really forced me to see a big project through to completion. I had never really attempted anything as ambitious before, so I learned a ton about managing myself on projects, working ahead, and breaking things down into manageable chunks. I think this project was the most intellectually difficult things I've done at Yale, and definitely the most satisfying to complete."

   "comments": [
    "The strengths are the care and support that faculty provide in writing the essay. Joe fischels reminder emails and weekly writing boot camps were so helpful.",
    "Very self-driven",
    "I think the lack of a hard word limit was a strength! I felt like I had a lot of freedom to write what I thought the essay needed to say. One recommendation would be to add a short bibliographic essay at the end. Some of my friends in HSHM really enjoyed writing theirs, and I think it would be useful to future students to see how senior essays get put together."

    "The Senior Essay is required for WGSS majors so you don't really have a choice! WRITE EARLY AND OFTEN, use a citation manager, and stay calm. The senior essay is intimidating but you can do it!"
