    "Yes! if you have any interest in American Studies or Arab culture DO IT!",
    "This class is great. I learned a lot about the various levels of ingrained discrimination in our country against Muslims. This class can get really really sad, but it's a good way of becoming more aware. it was particularly enlightening to be in this class as the news of the NYPD case broke.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student, and I would summarize it as a survey course (with a lot of different topics covered on the Diaspora concept in general and on the Muslim Diaspora specifically) that allows the student to find something that interests them within the course readings\/ articles. This then allows the students to use the papers as a way to deepen their understanding of whatever interested them.",
    "It's a good course. There's a lot of reading and Professor Grewal is tough, but really fun and a great teacher."
