   "comments": [
    "If you did well in Econ 131, take this course to learn more about econometrics.",
    "Econ 132 taught me so much, and I feel like I've gained a lot of the skills necessary to conduct real-world research using econometrics. The course covers topics like hypothesis testing and other statistical inference, hedonic regression, how to handle heteroskedasticity, how to work with panel data, and how to work with time series, among other things. It's a thorough overview that includes reading and analyzing real-world economics papers, which I also found to be extremely useful. I would absolutely recommend this class to anyone who hopes to do research in economics in the future, or who wants to know more about these topics.",
    "A continuation of 131 with some new methods, some reading of economic literature, and some proofs of concepts from 131. Take it if you are interested in being able to read and interpret economics papers.",
    "Dry but useful material. Professor Altonji is super nice and funny.",
    "Yes, 100% recommend. If you are an Econ major, you must take this course.",
    "Econ 132 was a solid class. Professor Altonji is a very nice, friendly lecturer, and he's extremely knowledgeable about the material at hand. He presents subject matter in an organized, logical way that is quite clear to understand. The course presents a nice balance of theory and applications, and often brings in examples from economics literature. We used a lot of Stata, which I personally enjoyed. I found the course to be fairly challenging. We only had six problem sets throughout the year, but the material was relatively dense and took of mental energy to sort through. The class certainly emphasizes the math side of economics, and as someone who is less excited about math in and of itself, I found parts of the class to be somewhat dry. Additionally, although the class was fairly small, there wasn't much of a sense of community. Overall, I would recommend the class to anyone who really enjoys regression and the theory that accompanies it. Even though it was challenging and a little dry at times, I'm glad I took it.",
    "I highly recommend this class to anyone who has been even vaguely interested in running regressions and why they work. Even if you do not plan on writing a senior essay in Economics, I believe this class is very valuable not only in gaining an understanding of how journals work and what sort of reports are relevant in academics, but in learning something extremely valuable and useful: statistics are incredible! From predicting wine quality and prices in 20 yrs and looking at presidential elections, to evaluating institutions based on settler mortality and looking at wealth differences between blacks and whites. To me, this was a wonderfully stimulating semester and I hope that many more students will take this class with Prof. Altonji in the future! It's not as hard as people say - or rather, it is very rewarding.",
    "more practical course than 136",
    "Yes, if you want to learn serious econometrics, or gain serious understanding of economic research or even broader statistical\/social science research - then ECON 132 will give you lot of insights and analytical skills."
