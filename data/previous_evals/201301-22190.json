   "comments": [
    "The material until the midterm consists of a basic background in stellar properties and lives, light, and basic formulas and ideas. Aferward, we focused more on the universe on bigger scales: galaxies, black holes, the Big Bang era, etc. I would recommend it.",
    "Great Sc Credit! Very interesting and not super hard.",
    "It's a very interesting and quite fun class, speaking as someone who has never been particularly interested in the sciences. I would recommend it if one wants to enjoy their QR credit, and\/or has an interest in the basics of astronomy.",
    "Good math based science course for non-science majors. Good for any quantitative thinker not in the sciences.",
    "I would recommend Galaxies and the Universe if you need a QR\/SC credit and are interested in astronomy, or even if you are just interested in astronomy. This class is much more focused on galaxies and cosmology--you won't learn too much about our own solar system. The problem sets are manageable, but be careful because the exams are much harder.",
    "If you're looking for a gut science\/QR credit, look elsewhere. The material isn't necessarily HARD, but there's a lot to keep up with. There are reading quizzes before every class, problem sets every week, an observing session... It's all just not worth it if you're not actually interested in the content of the class. That being said, the curve is pretty generous (basically everything 90 and above is a straight up A) and it's not hard to do well if you put in the requisite time.",
    "I would absolutely recommend Astronomy 120 to another student because it is an interesting class that covers interesting topics with an engaging professor. It is not too difficult and not too easy.",
    "This class is not a gut by any stretch--it's really, really hard and a lot of work. The exams were incredibly difficult. If someone is interested in astronomy it's definitely an interesting class but for me it was just too much work for a science credit.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to any one in need of an interesting, useful science credit or who wants to learn the fundamentals of our universe. It helps if you are more quantitatively inclined, but there is plenty of assistance offered by both the professor and the TA's if you need it.",
    "I would definitely recommend Astro 120 to a student who is looking for an interesting, reasonable science credit. It's not a gutty class, as you do need to keep up with the reading\/p-sets. But it's very manageable as long as you put in some time and effort.",
    "If you want to learn about something cool, take this course! Professor Kenney will blow your mind away with his humor and live demonstrations!",
    "Pretty good science course, would not recommend for a \"gut\" science.",
    "This is a fun class. You must attend lecture and attendance is kept with clicker questions. There is a pset each week (9 in total I think) and they take anywhere from 1-5 hours (usually like 2.5 hours). The TAs will find every little error they can possibly think of to detract from your scores because if they didn't, everyone would get an A. Overall, this is a fun class that won't teach you anything life-changing.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone that's a non-science major and that has an interest in the subject matter.",
    "Professor Kenney is absolutely wonderful, he is funny and makes complicated concepts and readings incredibly easy to understand , and fascinating. Every day at galaxies and the yniverse I learn something wonderfully interesting, and taking this with Directed Studies was very manageable especially if you're only taking four classes. There are weekly reading quizzes and a Pset a week, but the reading quizzes at every manageable and pass fail. The psets are gone over every week in section, and it's easy to get high grades if you're careful with your work. Prof K is very fair with grading! I absolutely recommend this course, it'll open up all this new information and knowledge! Great for a non-gut, but manageable course for non-science majors.",
    "It's a good science credit to take- just for how well structured it is and how much work and passion the professor puts into it.",
    "Good class for those looking for a relatively relaxed science credit. You will still need to work to do well, however the topic material is not too challenging meaning you will do well if you put in the effort. Learn some interesting general knowledge stuff too!",
    "An interesting science credit that will give you a more macroscopic view of the Universe and will, literally, broaden your horizons.",
    "It's a great class! You learn about the universe and its evolution and about things that sound like science fiction but are actually true. It's not completely easy, but its extremely enjoyable and I loved everything we learned.",
    "An interesting class that you need to work in.",
    "I would recommend this class if you just want to know more about space, light, and how the universe formed. Be prepared to make the effort with homework and exams.",
    "This is a downright horrible class. Interesting subject matter, but horrible textbook, falsely advertised as a gut for non Sc\/QR people, and HORRIBLE professor. I don't have enough negative things to say about Jeffery Kenney. He's a horrible person, horrible professor, all around horrible. He should be fired from Yale. I learned nothing the whole semester from him, and he's ridiculously full of himself (thinks he's hilarious) (come on, you teach Astro 120, a joke class, get a grip on reality). I could go on and on, but I don't want to waste another second on this pathetic man.",
    "I would only recommend this class to a student that really enjoys astronomy. For everyone else, I would not recommend it. I took it because I needed a QR credit and the class IS NOT A GUT. The material is hard to wrap your mind around and the math is a little abstract. The tests are incredibly difficult and although I love Kenney as a professor, the information isstill unrelatable.",
    "Take it, good science credit. Easy and interesting.",
    "I would summarize Astronomy 120 as a great QR class to take since you learn material beyond the \"QR\" requirement and have the opportunity to hear Professor Kenney and make the trip to the observatory.",
    "Yep, take the class. It's not too hard (if you show up and study you'll do well) and is very interesting. Amazing professor who is fun to listen to and very approachable\/available. Good way to fulfill a science\/qr. SLIGHTLY easier sciences\/qrs exist in terms of work load -- I took one, at least, that was less work. But this one is genuinely interesting and, unlike the slightly easier ones, doesn't feel like a total joke.",
    "It's harder than you think it's going to be and really quant based, but I would recommend it!",
    "A good summary of the basic concepts of astronomy, with really interesting forays into topics like black holes and relativity.",
    "Definitely recommended to those who are seeking a legitimate but manageable SC credit",
    "Like many others taking this class, I took it as a gut to fulfill my science requirement. The math in the class is almost laughingly easy. The rest of it isn't hard, just annoying. Professor is very bad. His voice is irritating. He isn't a very good professor and for an introductory class, does not do a good job making the class seem interesting and engaging. The class is very much run like a sort of high school physics class. There are many very cool things about astronomy, but sadly, none were found in this class."
