    "Absolutely. This is a great way to learn about the Arab\/Islamic literary tradition.",
    "Prof. Gruendler is one of the most knowledgeable profs I have ever met. I think she might know everything. She is also very stylish. That said, she can sometimes be dry.The class itself is good. I am not a lit or Arabic person, so I found it a great way to delve into a new area without excessive work.Be warned that much of the class is poetry. Poetry loses more in translation than other literary forms, so if you don't speak Arabic the material will be visibly less cool.",
    "Literature 178 is a great introduction to classical Arabic literature. Professor Gruendler is extremely knowledgeable and more than willing to meet outside of class. I went into the course with little prior experience in either Arabic literature or Arabic history, and though I occasionally found myself getting lost, I really felt that I had learned a lot by the end of the semester."
