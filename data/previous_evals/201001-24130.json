    "This is a very interesting, relatively light class. It pretty much is exactly how it would seem from the shopping period lecture. I recommend it if you need a class that will expand your knowledge of primates and humans without making your brain explode or requiring heavy memorization.",
    "I would recommend this course if you are very interested in primates and evolution. At times it was a bit dry and probably should have been a seminar-style instead of a lecture, but the subject matter was interesting. You can get as much into the course as you want to - if you do not want to read any of the papers, you don't have to (besides a couple of reading responses). If you are interested in the subject, the course will be intriguing, but if not, it will be very boring.",
    "I liked it. As a science major, I thought the class brought enough biology (although without using biology terminology) to make me feel like this wasn't just an anthropology class.Apes and monkeys are fun to watch and Professor Watts shows a number of cool videos during class. Also, they are adorable.The workload: three short responses, a take-home midterm and a free final paper. Totally appropriate. The workload was very much \"give me an educated opinion and you will do well\". That worked for me, because if you attend class and think about the material you read you WILL form opinions about it. And the great thing is, you don't need to be a science major or a professor to form an intelligent opinion on these studies.",
    "really nice professor, dry humor. really boring class.",
    "If you are interested in primates' cognitive abilities, this class is great. If you are not very interested in that, this class might be boring, but it doesn't require very much work.",
    "Awesome",
    "This is a great class if you want an overview of the evolution of intelligence.",
    "Yeah, it is an interesting class, and the workload is not bad.",
    "I would recommend this class only if you're really interested in the material or just looking for a pretty easy anthro class. There were only 3 reading responses, a short midterm paper, and a longer term paper. And since the final paper was a research paper, it was not entirely necessary that you even do the vast majority of the readings.",
    "I would only recommend this class if you have a special interest in evolution and love talking about monkeys. I enjoyed the course greatly."
