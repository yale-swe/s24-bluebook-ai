    "Would recommend. I thought that it was awesome that we finally finished all the verb tenses in this course.",
    "Yes- Sebastian clearly cares so much about this course and his students. If you reach out to him he is sure to respond and help improve your Spanish as much as you are willing to put the effort in.",
    "If you want to really solidify your knowledge of Spanish grammar, Spanish 140 is the right course for you. It is more work that 130, but still very manageable. If you, like me, needed to take it to fulfill the language rec, it's not a bad choice--Sebastian is also a great professor! Highly recommend his section.",
    "Spanish L4 is a very challenging course - not in the difficulty of its material, but rather in the emotional endurance and mental fortitude it will require of you. It meets everyday, has homework on top of homework on top of homework, and requires that you shed a fortune for materials that are not economically used. It will truly test your sanity. If you're going to take this class, be prepared. That being said, if you do choose to take it, definitely, definitely take it with Sebastian. He is one of the best professors I have ever had in my life, and really cares about the well-being of his students. He is a gem in the Spanish department.",
    "Strong grammar foundation, I'd recommend."
