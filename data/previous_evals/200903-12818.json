   "comments": [
    "Fantastic course. You'll get out of it what you put in. The more you commit yourself to the material and participate in class debates the better it gets. Pinzka is helpful, engaging, and fun. A good introduction to university level French.",
    "This is a great course for those interested in learning about French culture (e.g. politics, education, family, immigration). Readings are usually short and very interesting. Professor Pinzka creates a dynamic, relaxing atmosphere in which you can express your ideas without the fear of making language mistakes. There is no doubt that your speaking and listening skills will improve, and that you will become much more knowledgeable about peculiar aspects of French society.",
    "I would wholeheartedly recommend FR160 to another student.",
    "I would definitely recommend it - Pinzka is great, the movies are hilarious, it isn't tooooo much work, and it keeps your french going.",
    "I would HIGHLY recommend this class. It is a lot of work, but if you are devoted to French and becoming fluent, this is the class to take!-The key to success is to consistently do the homework and to participate in class. The exams are not difficult. You need to have a sound basis in grammar before taking this class, because we do not directly do grammar exercises."
