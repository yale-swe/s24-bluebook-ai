    "I really enjoyed my time in this class and felt like I learned a lot but was also able to contribute much to class.",
    "This is a great class.",
    "This course is effectively a science for non-science majors. The majority of the classes are taught as lectures, though, not as seminars. It is hard to keep focused for 2 hours when the professor is not as engaging, specially because of a language barrier with the professor. The course is very interesting if you would like to know more about energy sources and need a very good excuse to make research. There were 4 papers, one of which is optional, an in class debate, and a final paper (13-16 pages). Super manageable given that you pick the topic of your paper. The big problem is that the 2 hours a week of seminar are extremely dry.",
    "If this class is ever offered again, which I imagine it won't be -- do not take it. There are other science credits available where you'll have an easier time, learn more science and be more engaged.",
    "Future Energy Choices provides a thorough but incomplete overview of the energy industry. While it looks at many conventional and renewable energy sources, it neglects a basic breakdown of US and world energy distributions, as well as unconventional resources and hydropower and geothermal. Otherwise, it's a great introduction to energy! If you have no exposure to science or energy but desire to be well versed in energy, take this course.",
    "Absolutely, I would recommend future energy to a fellow student. My experience in the course was positive. Students were able to explore the future energy challenges that most interested them individually, which was really exciting and very refreshing! Professor Yi put a lot of effort into striking a balance between lecturing and class discussion. He also consistently solicited student feedback and was responsive to the feedback he received.",
    "I would recommend this class if you do not know anything about energy and are motivated to engage and help shape the dynamics of the class."
