    "If you are interested in Sculpture, take it for the studio time. Just be sure to check the evaluations for whatever teacher is teaching the class that specific semester, because it will intensely affect the dynamic of the class.",
    "In the case of Jennifer Bornstein's class, was very independent, callowed students to pursue projects of interest within a guiding framework. We learned to work with wood and later, metal.",
    "Absolutely. If you can get in, take this class. You will meet amazingly interesting people, learn so much about yourself and your work, and have an amazing time. Sculpture is the most welcoming of art forms, because all it really takes is imagination and creativity - skill is a useful tool but never necessary.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to other students. Being an intermediate class, there was more focus on thought process and final product that specific skills, but this allowed people to individually explore there own mediums, which was very rewarding for the class as a whole. Also, there are a lot of resources for help with specific skills.",
    "Intermediate sculpture is an INTENSE course. As a newcomer to sculpture, I learned a ton from this class - both fundamentals but mostly beyond. But, I will admit that I was extremely intimated and scared by this class for the first half of the semester. There was a definite period of growth, and eventually you will gain some confidence. That being said - I am a very independent learner, so learning new materials and methods on my own was no problem, but could be for other students. The individual projects had both structure and leniency, which was exactly what I needed."
