   "comments": [
    "David Kastan is in fact Shakespeare himself.You will read Shakespeare differently as Kastan uses lectures to model various ways of reading, employing more and more tools as the semester wears on. Prepare to be entertained and enlightened.",
    "YES! its a bit challenging because the class is full of senior english majors but its a great course!!",
    "It is a broad overview of all of Shakespeare's Histories and Tragedies. Take it. Now.",
    "Take it. You will learn.",
    "I took this class because all of the reviews said, \"OMG TAKE THIS CLASS BEST CLASS EVER KASTAN IS AMAZING blah blah.\" Those statements are false. Unless you would label yourself a Shakespeare fan and\/or English major, avoid this class. Kastan's lectures were dry. Even my friend, a Shakespeare lover and English major, said, \"Wow. His lectures really are not out of the ordinary. I don't understand why he gets such great reviews.\" I know several people who simply did not attend class because 1) it is not necessary to do well in the course and 2) they are super boring. Section is key. Take care when picking your section, because a bad TA can make the class hell and be a picky grader.",
    "Just because you liked Shakespeare in high school or have read a couple of his plays, don't think you will love this course. It's not a bad class, covering about a play per week. The lectures are fairly interesting and section is fine, depending on your TA. There are 3 papers and a take-home final, but the papers are graded quite harshly. This course definitely disappointed me, and I learned less from it about Shakespeare and his plays than I thought.",
    "Yes but possibly take it Credit D. Very hard to get a good grade and read all the plays deeply in the time frame. Kastan is very easy to listen to.",
    "Yes, absolutely. The histories are a bit tough, but the tragedies are classic, and really enjoyable to read. Professor Kastan is awesome - make sure to go out to coffee with him, because he's a great guy as well as a great lecturer. The one thing about this class is that it's definitely a literature course, not a theater course - the papers you'll write are intensely technical and focused on small scenes and nuances of language as they relate to the play as a whole. It gets a little annoying, but it does make you a better reader.",
    "It is a very basic survey Shakespeare course. I would recommend the course to any student who is self-motivated and interested enough to keep up with the reading and make the most of the breath of the course. If a student does not feel that he or she would enjoy the class reading on their own, then i would not recommend this course.",
    "I would recommend this class.",
    "I would absolutely recommend it. If the student has even a passing interest in Shakespeare or English literature, he or she should take it. If the student does not, he or she should still take it.",
    "Interesting overview of histories and tragedies. Doesn't delve too deeply into any one play and it's not the most structured class. Take it if you really want to enjoy some Shakespeare every week.",
    "I would wholeheartedly recommend the course. Prof. Kastan is a very entertaining lecturer, and has some very intelligent, thought-provoking ideas about the plays, which come in handy especially when looking at more obscure (or less critically celebrated) ones. I loved hearing what he had to say and am grateful for his perspective (especially on what makes Shakespeare great--he is not so much a \"universalist\" like Bloom, but is rather very very smart and down-to-earth about what Shakespeare absorbs and reflects--better than any other English poet--about the world around him). Kastan's assignments were interesting, though his primary area of interest is contrasting different texts of plays, so he will often structure an entire essay about how a word changes from the first to second quarto--be prepared.",
    "This class is not very good. Prof. Kastan's lectures are boring and uninspiring. He tends to either examine very small details in isolation or broad themes very superficially. He's funny and charismatic and can make these older texts accessible to somebody who is not seriously enthusiastic about the humanities, but his lectures were just not particularly thought-provoking or insightful (certainly not at the standard of my better experiences in my years here). I can't really understand how this class has such a stellar reputation, but maybe this was a good class and it wasn't for me.",
    "TAKE IT!",
    "Want to read a buttload of Shakespeare in one semester? Good. Buckle up.",
    "A great fifth class and one of those classes you should take before you graduate.",
    "I thought that the class was very good but be wary of it because of the take home final. There were 6 essays on it this year with no specified length for topics so broad you could have written entire dissertations on them. In addition this being frustrating for someone who likes to be thorough, it was also very stressful.",
    "I would take this class if you haven't had much experience with Shakespeare and are interested in discussing the plays, but don't raise your hopes terribly high for the lectures. While interesting, they can tend to be incoherent and focus more on the historical aspect than the plays themselves.",
    "Great material. Hilarious professor who is a very good teacher when he teaches. I just wish he did more teaching and more close readings. This lecture may be frustrating for an English major who is looking for a course where the teacher always sticks close to the text. I was disappointed, but it's Shakespeare and the pros outweighed the cons from me in the end. It could have been so much better. Take it.",
    "TAKE IT! I loved it. You'll be glad you've read (most of) these plays and you will never get bored in lecture.",
    "YES!! The reading list is excellent, and the professor is awesome. Lecture was always fun, and the workload wasn't that bad. 1 play a week is really not that hard, and the papers were all interesting. Take-home final at the end instead of in class final. If you like reading plays or literature, then this is the class for you. If you're honestly not going to read and go to lecture, then well, probably best to look for something else.",
    "If you're looking for a broad survey of Shakespeare, this is the class to take. You'll read all the plays you probably wouldn't read on your own, and the lectures are very entertaining and for the most part, fun to listen to. If you're looking for a lot of textual analysis or explication, take a different Shakespeare class, but if you want to have a framework that will make you read the plays, and teach you about the genres of histories and tragedies as a whole, it doesn't get much better.",
    "Worth it for the lectures if you're interested in Shakespeare. Assignments are interesting and manageable if you read the plays well.",
    "Good class. You get through a lot of really great plays without feeling like you're rushing too much. You'll enjoy coming to lecture.",
    "Kastan has great reviews, but at a certain point, if you're not interested in Shakespeare, no professor can change that. I basicallyfell asleep or zoned out in every class. The paper topics are also frustratingly specific and don't leave space for a lot of creativity.",
    "I took this class to fulfill the pre-1800 req for the english major. I'm not that into Shakespeare, and I'm still not. Kastan is a interesting lecturer, but lecture content doesn't pertain to writing your papers, so I didn't find it necessary to go to lecture. But if you like Shakespeare, take this class.",
    "YES! This was exactly what I imagined the perfect Yale lecture class to be like. Witty, brilliant, slightly goofy nerd of a professor, unusual takes on classic material... It was borderline perfect. Lots of reading, but if you make time to engage with the material (at least passages if not entire plays), you will glean so much from Shakespeare in ways you haven't before.",
    "If you love Shakespeare, you must take this class!",
    "i'd recommend it... my only complaint would be that the take home final was a bit absurd: six essays with no maximum or minimum length. but apparently, he doesnt do that every year.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student. Kastan is incredible and the class exposes you to a ton of literature.",
    "this was a great class for English majors, but is also great for anyone with any interest in Shakespeare at all. i would definitely recommend it.",
    "Good lectures. Great plays. What's not to like?",
    "Take it; Kastan is a truly fantastic lecturer. But do make sure you actually have the time to do the reading carefully.",
    "Read lots of Shakespeare, become more familiar with its language and themes, and consider the works from really engaging angles that you might not have considered before. Professor Kastan really helps each play feel like it is completelyrelevant to your life. And he's incredibly funny and entertaining. Make sure you keep up with the readings though! Definitely recommend. Also, I loved the assignments we had. They were fun and unusual.",
    "Take it if you want to read Shakespeare's histories and tragedies! I feel like I understand and appreciate Shakespeare way more now than I used to. You don't have to be able to quote Shakespeare on the spot to enjoy this class, partly because there are people in it who do that and partly because it's just a good class.",
    "Take it if you're at all interested in Shakespeare. Kastan is really really great. Good enough that I would go see his lectures in my free time. this would probably be a good class to Cr\/D. The assignments are sort of strange and depending on your TA it might be hard to do really well.",
    "A great course-- take it!",
    "Eng 201 is for someone who really wants to study Shakespeare and wants to do it in a way that goes beyond what they did in high school. You will be forced to explore the meaning of not simply scenes or lines but also each individual word - and it may make you go crazy. Be prepared to put work in. It in large part depends on your TA, but I had to put a lot of work into my papers. Take this if you want to take a Shakespeare course and want to be amused. It will not, however, rock your world. BUT, Kastan has an amazing voice and is enjoyable to listen to.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this to anyone -- definitely to English majors (Shakespeare, Kastan, and a pre-1800: you'd be an idiot not to take this), but also to any Yale student who has any kind of interest in English, Shakespeare, or one of the best professors Yale has to offer. Seriously -- do not miss Kastanteaching this course.",
    "Words, words, words.",
    "This course provides an excellent survey of Shakespeare's histories and tragedies. Strengths: amazing course material, brilliant professor, knowledgeable and committed TAs. This is a lecture course, and sometimes I wished there was more time to discuss the plays, but this was fixed simply by going to office hours. Professor Kastan is a brilliant, funny, kind individual. I looked forward to every lecture and was always surprised (and usually sad) when class was over. He was always very gracious outside of class (I could not make regular office hours and so I would drop in to discuss plays). His essay prompts are fascinating; the final exam in particular was fun to think about. In addition, the study guides posted on Classesv2 provided good optional direction for reading or thinking about the plays. Workload is not light, but I found it enjoyable.",
    "fun, thought-provoking, testing, satisfying.",
    "Simply put, a don't miss.",
    "Kastan's Shakespeare course is a wonderful way to get acquainted with his histories \/ tragedies. You will honestly not find a better lecturer on campus. He's brilliant as well as hilarious. And the material he teaches is VERY MUCH worth learning. Do it.",
    "A great introduction to Shakespeare--take it for sure.",
    "If you really want to cover Shakespeare, go for it. If you are just looking for a 5th class to fill out your schedule and are open, look around.",
    "Very good class, take itcredit\/D if you're not a major. 1 short paper, 2 longer papers and a (hell of a) take-home final.",
    "This course was a fabulous chance to study the histories and tragedies, which are extremely difficult plays to read without the guidance of an experienced professor like Prof. Kastan. He is funny, dynamic, and makes coming to class each day exciting. The workload was also extremely manageable. While there are a lot of plays to read, I don't think most of the class read all of them, and three papers + a take-home final is definitely do-able. I would never have been able to understand these plays in such depth without Professor Kastan's analysis, and I feel very lucky to have had the chance to learn so much about Shakespeare's works.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course if you have any interest in Shakespeare. You'll learn a lot -- Kastan has a unique and brilliant way of tackling the texts.",
    "A review of the most difficult shakespeare plays, the histories, although the most enduringly important (the tragedies). There is no canon like shakespeare, so do yourself a favor and take this class WITH the intention to read all the plays.",
    "The material itself is great--you'll get to read all of those Shakespeare classics you've never had a chance to tackle. The class will be burdensome if you're taking other hard courses, though. I definitely wasn't able to keep up with the one-play-a-week pace in addition to my three problem sets each week. I wasn't terribly impressed with Kastan, but the class isn't bad overall. My one piece of advice is not to underestimate the amount of reading you'll be asked to do each week.",
    "Basically a play a week with three papers and a final. It's not a walk in the park. The papers take awhile and the take home final is rather time consuming. That said, the reading itself isn't bad. It's a lot but you don't have to do it all. I thought Histories& Tragedies would be more boring than Romances& Comedies (purely based on the title) but I was wrong. Really enjoyed this class.",
    "Great Shakespeare survey. Kastan is fun and engaging and his assignments really force you to think about Shakespeare in ways you probably haven't before.",
    "This class was really great! I would definitely recommend it for someone who, like me, was not been familiar with a lot of the history plays and more obscure tragedies. This class offered a really engaging way to read these works. Kastan is a passionate lecturer, and it was a delight to hear him speak. While one play a week was at times a difficult pace, it was manageable. Do your best to keep up-- while not strictly necessary, the class really depends on how much you put into it.",
    "Definitely take this course. Professor Kastan is probably the best lecturer I've had at Yale. He knows his stuff and is funny and engaging. You also read a lot of great plays. Even if you are very familiar with the histories and tragedies, Kastan will find something new and fascinating to say about each play. Do try to stay on top of the play a week reading though. It comes in handy at the end. Also, the final exam is insane. It's a take home but extremely long so be ready for that.",
    "Amazing reading list, amazing professor, excellent lectures. Take this class! It's a lot of reading, but it's all of Shakespeare's tragedies and histories, which are, of course, incredible.",
    "Absolutely. Shop the first class and you\u0092ll be hooked. So far, this is the only lecture course I\u0092ve never missed a day of. Lectures are fantastic, hilarious, insightful, delightful, quotable, moving, et cetera, et cetera. And obviously the readings couldn\u0092t be better. A warning though: the paper topics border on the sadistic, as they are extremely fruitful and often give no length suggestions. They are bad for your sleep schedule, but good for your brain. And they\u0092re actually kind of fun. Overall, the class is a must.",
    "Kastan is an engaging speaker and has interesting ideas. He constantly reminds students of his persona, which is entertaining to some and less ideal for others.",
    "TAKE IT but it's a lot of busy work. you learn a lot though",
    "I would definitely recommend this class! It is a lot of reading, but the lectures are really entertaining and the papers are interesting to write.",
    "Eng 201 is a great class; Professor Kastan is incredibly engaging. I would definitely recommend this class. However, the reading load is pretty heavy. If you don't have a background in Shakespeare, you will have to devote a good amount of time familiarizing yourself with the plays.",
    "Take this course if you want a comprehensive and interesting introduction to Shakespeare's histories and tragedies",
    "I highly recommend this class to any student with even the slightest interest in Shakespeare. David Kastan is incredible, and the workload is not frustrating in the least.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to anyone who is interested in Shakespeare (which you should be). Even if you didn't love reading Shakespeare in high school, you will probably still enjoy this class. If you put in the effort to read and understand the plays, you'll find Kastan's lectures fascinating. The work load isn't that bad, I recall writing three papers and doing a take-home final. The only problem with the papers is that you don't have a ton of time to do them, andthe final is kind of annoying and too long. Nevertheless, I thought the work load was justifiable, and I didn't find it too oppressive.",
    "This is a survey class. every history and tragedy you want to read. if you do the reading and go to lecture you will know these plays. take it because shakespeare was simply the rightest writer ever to consider the individual. according to bloom (different professor) shake \"invented the human\" in literature. or something like that.",
    "It is a good survey of some of Shakespeare's greats. The load is manageable but be warned that this is a completely lecture driven course, and if you do not have a good TA, your opinion of the class will suffer.",
    "Kastan is amazing.",
    "I feel like I was tricked by the previous years' evaluations. Kastan is not the most compelling lecturer, a play (or sometimes 2 plays) a week is both exhausting and superficial, and the final is killer. Only take this class if you're really interested by the material.",
    "This course is a solid introduction to Shakespeare's histories and tragedies. Professor Kastan's lectures are entertaining and insightful, though they do not always spend a huge amount of time engaging with the text. I would absolutely recommend this course.",
    "This was a great class! Professor Kastan spent a bit too much time in the first three weeks of the semester trying to win over his audience with jokes about pop culture and his two kids, but once that wrapped up he really hit his stride and delivered some brilliant lectures. I enjoyed all four of the assignments, all of which were different and helped me learn in different ways. And, of course, the best part -- the plays!I've taken eight or nine English classes at Yale, and this one was probably my favorite. I give it a strong recommendation.",
    "Take it if you want to read a bunch of Shakespeare plays with a bunch of your friends. Be forewarned, the essay topics are very specific and very stupid. And the final exam is incredibly annoying.",
    "Absolutely. Take the course. One of my favorites at Yale. I have always had a love for Shakespeare but I think the course is perfect even for those who have never read a single Shakespeare play and think they couldn't understand the language. Kastan just presents it in a way that can click with anyone",
    "I guess it's an ok intro to Shakespeare, so if you've never taken it before then I say go for it. If you have already read the bard, I would recommend Bloom's Shakespeare as it is much more in depth.",
    "This is a great introduction to the best Shakespeare plays. Don't take it if you aren't going to do the reading, but Professor Kastan is an amazing lecturer, and you'll get a lot out of the class if you do the work.",
    "Absolutely yes. This is Kastan's most well-known course for a reason. My roommate convinced me to take the class with her even though I didn't especially like Shakespeare. Lecture is engaging even after lunch and section discussion fruitful partially because, since students of all majors take the class, there is a greater diversity of experience than in most English classes. Watch out though-- my TA was great, but I heard some not-so-nice comments about some of the others. As for the work, I'd like to pretend that, as an English major, I don't struggle to read one measly Shakespeare play every week, but the amount of reading is actually pretty daunting if you've only read one or two of the plays before. The Henries especially will slow you down, so watch out for that. The take-home isn't actually that bad though, if you give yourself enough time. And for English majors, don't forget: it's pre-1800! So, just to bring it back in: the only reason to decide against this class is a schedule conflict with something you need to graduate.",
    "The material speaks for itself: Shakespeare's tragedies and histories. You read and study one play a week, you attend two lectures, and discuss it in a large discussion section (a little too large a section actually). I have a lot of reservations about Kastan as a professor. He has a very engaging manner of lecturing, but he tries too hard to be entertaining, and often I left the lectures feeling like I had learned very little from him. If you're more in it for the plays themselves and not for any sort of insightful interpretation from the professor, then you should have no reservations in taking this. If you're looking for deep interpretation, you might still want to take, but you should definitely buy Harold Bloom or Northrop Frye's books, because you're not going to get much deep insight from Kastan.",
    "This is an exceptional and thoroughly engaging course. The lectures give valuable information on Shakespeare's times, works, and significance. Each was flavored a little differently; all were worthwhile. Highly recommended."
