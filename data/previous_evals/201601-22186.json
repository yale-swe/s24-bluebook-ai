   "comments": [
    "Yes, I would highly recommend this class to another student. China-Africa Studies is not a new field, but no one really knows the \"real stuff\". This class is a great opportunity to have class instructors from both China and Africa fields, and they both know very well about their own field respectively. Aside from that, this class is not only an anthropology class, but rather takes an interdisciplinary perspective by combining historical, political science, economic, international development angles. After the semester, you will have a multi-perspective and comprehensive understanding of China-Africa engagement.",
    "An extremely comprehensive introduction to the field of China-Africa connections, and very interesting for anyone with experience in either field.",
    "A course exploring the China-Africa encounter as a process that develops beyond temporal or geographical boundaries. I would recommend it to those with expertise in China, Africa, or both, because of the fresh viewpoint."

   "comments": [
    "It helps me develop a deeper and better understanding of China's foreign relations with Africa, which serves as a window to see China's geopolitical and geoeconomic agendas. This course is not directly relevant to my research, but it's still rewarding to gain a deeper and more analytical understanding of China in general.",
    "Since I have experience in one field and not the other, it was very interesting to see scholars and theories from my field interact with the scholarship from the other."
