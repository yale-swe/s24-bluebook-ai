    "There is an incredible amount of work in this course. The readings are long and intense, however they are for the most part very interesting. I recommend this course if you are interested in consumerism and up for a challenge. there are bi-weekly essays that are relatively short, but alot is expected of them.",
    "Absolutely. I'm considering History or American Studies as a major, but even for someone not attracted to the humanities, I think it could really be enjoyed. Case in point, we had a number of students in the class who were known as the \"econ kids\". They were able to appreciate the economics of American consumer culture. Similar can be said for students interested in environmental science, and international students. Since we study so many different topics and disciplines, everyone can pull something they are interested in. There is a lot of reading, some of it boring (Standard of Living...silverware????), but its often that material that relates the most to the interesting things in the course. The workload is very, very manageable, even if the final paper is a little intimidating. (But no final, or tests!)",
    "The class is centred around readings.Tuesday: 500-word reflection essays on the readings due for half the students. Class is a discussion of first 2\/3 of reading.Also, immediately after class was his office hour. Convenient.Thursday: student-led discussion (usually for half the class) of whole reading. Short introduction of next week's reading.Weekends: next reading.There's also a 15-page synthesis final paper. Don't procrastinate or else you're going to be seriously stressed.",
    "This was easily my favorite class of the semester. The readings are all relevant and easy to connect with. Not only did I learn a great deal about the subject matter covered by the readings, I became a better thinker and writer by the end of the semester. The discussions were always engaging and I was surprised every class by the originality and depth of the professor's and my classmate's intellect. Through the shorter essays, I learned to be concise and to really pull apart an argument. This class is a lot of work, but it's totally worth it.",
    "Absolutely recommend the course to all freshmen.",
    "This class is awesome! It was a great way to start my freshman year. It allows you to get to know people in your classes and your professor. I would definitely recommend it because the information and readings were very interesting and it's a freshman seminar.",
    "I would recommend this class because of the wide variety that the subject matter entails. It is essentially a history lesson, but views it in a number of different views. Of course, the seminar structure of the class is good for discussion.",
    "This class is what you make of it. It will be an amazing class if you like the subject matter and the way of teaching: that is a book a week and sometimes the readings get dry and long discussions. The professor gives students a lot of flexibility and so the participation of your fellow students will play a huge role in determining your experience. If you like reading and analyzing how America developed into a consumer society, then this is a class for you. If the class description does not align with your interests that steer clear.",
    "This course is fascinating! Take it. Class discussion is interesting because everyone has so much to offer because you are studying a huge part of American culture.",
    "I did not expect to like this course, but it proved to be amazing, the ideal freshman seminar. Whether or not you consider American consumer culture one of your primary interests, you should consider taking this class. Professor Agnew is brilliant, engaging, and approachable. The readings (a book a week - a challenging but manageable pace) were fascinating and extremely relevant to today, and the course really ties together. An essay every two weeks, on top of the readings, sounds like a lot of work, and it is, but these 500 word papers were actually where I learned the most about my writing and my interests (American consumer culture is a broad and very interdisciplinary field, but the essays allow you to zero in on what interests you. I was surprised by the patterns that emerged in my essays and essay topics). Admittedly, the final 3500 word paper (about 12-15 pages) did feel like a killer, but I'm glad I got to experience writing a long paper for a class I really enjoyed, on a topic of my choice. A word of warning: when choosing weeks to lead the discussion, try not to choose a week where you are also writing one of those 500 word essays."
