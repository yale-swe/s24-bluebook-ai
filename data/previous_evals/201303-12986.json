   "comments": [
    "Everyone should have to take this class. It engages with the things, people, and technologies that define contemporary life. Highly recommended.",
    "I would say the class equipped me with the tools to think of my own research in an STS framework. But more importantly, it made me excited about the new ways of thinking that I developed over the course of the class. I was surprised at how much the ideas in the class influenced how I thought about my own research.",
    "Yes. You must take this class. Its a thoughtfully curated exploration of techniques in the history of knowledge, production, and culture in society. You must change your life.",
    "Yes, definitely. It's an overview of Science and Technology Studies, which is useful for anyone working on the history\/sociology of knowledge, technology, or media.",
    "This course covers the diverse methods of scholars in science studies, focusing on more recent academic work to gain familiarity with the field. I would recommend this course for historians of science and medicine, medical anthropologists, and anyone else interested in conducting research that is critically engaged with science and its interplay with society."

   "comments": [
    "It certainly contributed to my own research (see above). To the extent that it helped me prepfor orals, it was very helpful. My only reservation is that, professionally speaking, STS sometimes seems a bit distant from the traditional themes of Latin American history, although I hope that will change over time.",
    "I will now be forevermore researching the history of science. It changed not only my research but the path of my life.",
    "I wouldn't say I have a thorough and solid knowledge of the field at this point, but it did give me a great \"roadmap\" for analyzing different approaches and methods. Opened my eyes to many things.",
    "It was absolutely essential.",
    "I come from a completely different discipline, but this course was one of the most significant for the way I think about my work. A lot of it was merely our discussion of method. The methods discussed in history of science were, weirdly, not that different than the methods discussed in Film Studies and Art History, though I think that much of STS is more directly engaged in certain political questions that interest me in my work. In this seminar, our discussions about the decision-making that goes into researching and narrating history, or devising a theoretical framework, felt more to \"real\" to me than any of the discussions I've had in other courses. Maybe this has to do not so much with the content but with the culture of the class--really good and interesting people, and Joanna encouraged us to bond w one another.",
    "This course was very useful in preparing me for a career as a historian of medicine. My final project allowed me to explore more deeply a subject that interests me and that will develop into a larger research project. I feel that this course also broadened my knowledge of the profession, introducing me to a wide range of methodological approaches."
