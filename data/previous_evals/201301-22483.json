    "This class looks at Black British art in the post-colonial context. It's so interesting and engaging. I highly recommend taking this course. I took it being one of the only not art or history of art majors, and, at times felt like I couldn't contribute to the course but I now have learned a lot of the language to speak about art intelligently and articulately. That was my goal any way. Just shop the first session and you'll fall in love with the content. Beware, though, that Kobena's seminar is more of a lecture with a few questions thrown throughout it.",
    "Yes - professor Mercer is incredibly knowledgeable and interesting. Though he speaks a lot for a seminar the information he teaches is extremely interesting.",
    "I would recommend everyone at yale to take this class. V spexifc but awesome",
    "I absolutely recommend this class. Kobena Mercer is one of the best professors I have ever had. He leads class really well. He combines dense cultural studies theory with excellent visual analysis. He's really really intelligent. Also the artists we study in this class are just awesome. They make some of the most visually and conceptually interesting art you'll study at Yale. There is very little reading, but the readings assigned are always worth looking at closely, and so we always inform discussion. Take it"
