   "question_text": "Looking back on this course, what is your overall assessment of the course:  What are its strengths and weaknesses, and in what ways might it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths: Practical course, in which you apply all the different knowledge and skills you have learned from previous courses. It is an opportunity to do what you want, choose the topic you want, and go for it. Weaknesses: No weaknesses",
    "More guidance into the processes of how to complete various tasks would be much appreciated.",
    "Course is good introduction to intervention development and implementation, though the material is pretty intuitive especially for people with work experience in these settings. If the interventions could be developed for actual organisations or health departments then I think the class could be more applicable.",
    "The course description is very apt, we designed an intervention. The only thing that is missing is how\/if you were to actually implement the intervention.",
    "Really help me learn how to develop an intervention. But the workload is very big...",
    "One of the few courses that builds on practical skills. You're expected to produce a 100+ page intervention manual throughout the course of the semester. Because you're creating this intervention with a group, you spend a lot of time with them. Perhaps other opportunities to work with other classmates on in-class activities (similar to the HIV\/candy activity).",
    "This course takes up a lot of time. However, it is very fair. You get to select your project of interest and really develop an intervention targeted specifically towards it.",
    "This class is highly intensive but also a very rewarding and culminating course. It builds on everything we've learned as public health students and challenges us to design an intervention manual. The manual required some of the most work I've ever put into the class but I feel this was necessary to fully understand the intervention design process. After taking this course, I can feel confident with my skill and insight to intervention formulation!",
    "So incredibly useful and interesting, but a strong workload!",
    "Thought the class was useful, but sometimes the presentations had to be rushed. I wish there was a way to have enough time for everybody to get adequate feedback during the presentations. Also, I didn't find the peer feedback to be too helpful. Maybe if we were given the same kind of rubric that Trace graded us on, the peer feedback could be more structured and more useful.",
    "Overall a very useful course. Learned a lot about important concepts, and common challenges, in intervention design.",
    "This course was great, and it offered one of the few community-based courses to public health offered in SBS. Its strengths were that its objectives were clear. Trace provided sufficient examples of the final intervention manual that there were very few surprises about what to expect with our final project. The content was nice and real worldy, and it had plenty of sciencey stuff throughout. I preferred the real world stuff. Lectures were laid back and discussion-based, and Trace is a great professor. If there are any weaknesses it was that conversations about effect sizes and the like were dry. I don't know if there is a way to make that stuff interesting, but I found myself less engaged during those lectures. The group presentations were laid back and provided a great opportunity for honest feedback, and it was interesting being engaged in our classmates work."

    "Instructor: Trace Kershaw \u00a0He was one of the best teachers I had during my entire MPH. He is a great instructor, and a great person!! He has a great personality, and is open to help his students at all times!! He is an amazing instructor!!",
    "Instructor: Trace Kershaw \u00a0Trace does not give straight answers unless you force them out of him like you're pulling teeth. However, you will never find another professor who cares as much about his students and their projects as Trace. This project is extremely challenging, and Trace is willing to meet with you and help you as much as you need. He literally met with my group on a weekly basis in addition to the classes and the regularly scheduled meetings after each project was turned in. You have to work extremely hard in this class, but Trace works hard alongside with you.",
    "Instructor: Trace Kershaw \u00a0Instructor was very knowledgeable and provided good feedback on assignments. Also very accessible outside of class.",
    "Instructor: Trace Kershaw \u00a0He's a great instructor. Very funny, interesting, and responsive.",
    "Instructor: Trace Kershaw \u00a0Very laid back with high expectations.",
    "Instructor: Trace Kershaw \u00a0Trace was an excellent professor. He was always available for feedback and fostered a welcoming classroom environment.",
    "Instructor: Trace Kershaw \u00a0Strengths: Friendly, calm, relaxed, concerned about ensuring that all students are engaged and understand the material Weaknesses\/suggestions for improvement: Be more energetic, stand in the middle of the class so you can address the whole room",
    "Instructor: Trace Kershaw \u00a0Trace is a great professor and mentor. I really appreciated him taking the time to meet with each of the groups after each assignment was due. His feedback was really helpful. Very accessible.",
    "Instructor: Trace Kershaw \u00a0Prof Kershaw gave great feedback and knows a ton about intervention and evaluation.",
    "Instructor: Trace Kershaw \u00a0Trace was a great instructor, who is now world-renowned for being a \"chill\" dude. I can attest to his chillness, and his approach to instruction was a welcomed departure form some of the more uptight styles I have experienced. His feedback on all sections of the manual was very thorough and constructive. Trace is very approachable, and I believe almost everyone enjoyed learning from him."

   "comments": [
    "The intervention manual is divided intro three assignments, which are a lot of work. So when the assignments were due, I would work at least 20 hours per week the previous week. After turning in your assignment, I would have a break, until the next assignment. I really enjoyed this class. It is a practical class, in which you develop an intervention as if you would really going to do it. I think it is a great option for capstone. It is a lot of work, but not that much as I was told it was going to be. I really recommend taking this course!! You won't regret it! And Trace is an awesome instructor!! He is the best!!",
    "Laidback class. Learned a lot.",
    "This class is the class that separates the men from the boys. It is a real world experience where you interact with experts, communities, and the actual process. There are few things I have ever been as proud of as the intervention I developed in Trace's class. 150 (single-spaced) pages of intervention work is no small feat.",
    "Lot of work, but if you have a good team then you can get a lot out of it without feeling too overwhelmed with work. Pick a topic that youre interested in and it makes assingments more enjoyable.",
    "Very high workload! But you will learn what you expect.",
    "Good course if you want to do create interventions. Expect to put in a lot of work.",
    "This course will take up a large amount of your time. It is worth the investment, but it will be difficult.",
    "Some of the most work I've ever had to complete for a course, while simultaneously being the most important and rewarding piece of work I completed during my MPH. This course truly prepares us to be interventionists and SBS superstars!",
    "This course made me more interested in intervention development. You will gain practical skills that will make your more marketable to employers. I highly recommend this class, but be weary of the workload!!",
    "It's a decent bit of work, but it was, by far, my favorite class at YSPH. I definitely recommend it.",
    "It's a lot of work, but a great learning experience!",
    "Intervention is a lot of work, but the camaraderie, and knowing you're learning a lot, gets you through it. Pick your team wisely! Mine was great, but this course would have been incredibly frustrating if they weren't.",
    "This course is a great introduction to intervention design, implementation, and evaluation. For those interested in community health, it is a must, and there is plenty for the researchy-minded students as well. The course offers a great opportunity for teamwork is a very collaborative experience. You will enjoy learning from Trace!"
