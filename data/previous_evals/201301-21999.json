    "Def would take it, found it usefull to learn about Native history",
    "I would definitely recommend the course--it contributes a completely new angle to our understanding of American history and literature.",
    "Yes, it was a good course.",
    "American Studies 004 01 is an enlightening sociocultural and academic experience. It broadened my view of American history and made me question the implications of American Indian identity in our nation's history. I would recommend it to students who wish to learn more about diverse peoples and their contemporary and historical relevance to American culture. The course itself, though admittedly my most academically demanding course of the semester, really exposed me to a great deal of Yale's resources, something that can be a really helpful as a Yale student, and it prompted a great deal of interest for further research. I'd recommend it to students who are passionate about social activism and intensive academic research. In fact, I think that all Yale students should be exposed to some of the material that I had the privilege of reading and working with throughout this course."
