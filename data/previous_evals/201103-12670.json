   "comments": [
    "Definitely the sort of class where you only get what you put in. If you work hard on your performances and do all the readings and prepare extensively beforehand you will get much more out of the class.",
    "This class is what it says it is \u0096 Musical Theater Performance, which for me, was absolutely fantastic. While maintaining an academic facet (through the highly interesting and relevant readings, and through the technical analyses involved in the papers), this class centers on the practical aspects of putting musical theater repertoire into performance. I know I willbe taking it again, and I highly recommend it to anybody who is interested in performing or directing (or music directing \/ accompanying).",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to a fellow student. You will learn a lot and grow not only as a performer but also as a person.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student and think there should be several more like it.",
    "3 hours per week of conservatory-style training. Could have used more warm-ups before class as exercises and specific technique, but you do learn and improve. For actors and singers who plan on going into musical theater or acting, this is worthwhile.",
    "In Musical Theater Performance, students perform a series of songs, representing different eras throughout musical theater tradition, for critique in class. The clarity of expression we learn is applicable beyond musical theater. I would definitely recommend this for anyone who does theater of any kind.",
    "In this course, you'll prepare one piece every three weeks or so. The course is really what you bring to it\u2015if you get involved and prepare, you'll improve as a performer and theater critic.",
    "This is a great class to improve one's ability to deliver musical theater songs."
