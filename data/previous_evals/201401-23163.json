   "comments": [
    "This class is a great introduction to regression analyses. Relatively little background in statistics is needed (certainly anyone who's taken the intro grad stats class has sufficient background), and this class starts with the most basic aspects of regression analysis. If you are already comfortable with multiple regression, mediation analysis, and probing interactions, you may not get as much out of this course as a more advanced course (say, from the stats department), but there's an overview of more advanced topics in the last couple weeks (e.g., logistic regression, polynomial regression). The work load is entirely reasonable for a grad class-- we had three relatively short homework assignments, a take-home midterm, and a final paper (with a brief in-class presentation) which can be some analyses for a project you need to write up. Overall, I would recommend this class to anyone who isn't comfortable conducting andwriting up regression results at a moderately advanced level.",
    "I would summarize it as a course giving a detailed explanation and application of various regression statistics, and I would highly recommend it to anyone looking to improve their statistical know-how.",
    "This class teaches you about different types of regression analyses. Yes I would recommend this class to another student. I found it helpful. It was not overly burdensome.",
    "I have recommended the course already! I'd also like to take it again for credit. I think it's a very good opportunity to learn more about regression from someone who knows a lot about these methods and is good at teaching.",
    "See answer 1. I would recommend it now with some hesitation, and would definitely recommend it if the changes above were made (2 1 hour sessions per week, exercises during class).",
    "All grad students in the department should take this course. Absolutely. I will build a great folder of resources for them to check back in the future when doing regression work.",
    "Yes, if they had time to take it. It's unfortunate that the course does not fulfill any requirements and most graduate students are trying to reserve as much time as possible for research. So the incentives are set up in a way that makes it tough to take this class.",
    "I would strongly recommend Regression. I feel like these analyses are essential for any future researchers in psychology, and unless you have already been exposed and trained in these analyses, you should definitely take the course."

   "comments": [
    "This class will help me to critically evaluate results sections in academic articles, as well as to write up my own results. I've already used some of the tools from this class in journal manuscripts.",
    "While this class did not directly contribute to my research per se, the information learned in this class will apply to my work for the rest of my life. Regression analyses are something I will most likely do for the remainder of my career and will definitely do for the remainder of my academic career.",
    "This course helped me think about different ways to analyze my data.",
    "It has contributed to my data analytic chops, and that is apparent to me frequently!",
    "The course deepened and solidified my understanding of regression.",
    "Very useful to have this knowledge, no matter what content area you're working on.",
    "My answers to the previous questions make this one a bit redundant, but the analyses I learned in this course are now essential tools for research."
