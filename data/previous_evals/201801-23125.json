    "Yes! Loved this course because it was so fun and modern. Catered to many interests within music",

    "Yes, I learned a lot from it.",
    "Definitely! I really enjoyed this course! As a science person I was initially very hesitant about taking an English course, but this one was very enjoyable and I learned a lot!",
    "Yes. It will improve your writing and make you a better student.",
    "This is a really engaging course about music in society. No prior knowledge other than a general interest in listening to music is required. Professor Tazudeen is incredible at leading discussion and is always available to discuss paper ideas or class content further. I hate writing, but I loved this class."
