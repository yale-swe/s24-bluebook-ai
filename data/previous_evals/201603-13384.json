    "This course was a good opportunity to get to know the rest of my Ph.D. cohort well and learn from more senior scientists about how to navigate academia. Much of the advice was very helpful and has already prompted me to change some of my work habits for the better.",
    "It was great getting some behind-the-scenes insight into how the publication process works, how people found their way to their current positions, etc. Sometimes those things can seem frustratingly opaque at the beginning of one's career, so I really appreciated that information.",
    "Communication skills development and opportunity to discuss with experienced scholars",
    "I think Karen did a job of presenting this course to a group of very diverse scholars. In particular, I found the second half (i.e. about grant writing, for example) very useful and interesting. Karen has an incredible wealth of knowledge and I particularly enjoyed when she shared her own experiences and insights. Overall, she is a fantastic teacher and her knowledge and dedication to her research and to teaching was by far the best part of this course. She is very inspiring.",
    "The best aspect was that all PhD students were brought on the same platform, and very common matters, problems, future, etc., were brought to the limelight. This helped in both building confidence and thinking focused. A broad but clear idea about a doctoral program, things to be clear about, things to be anticipated, preparations, keeping a plan ready and running to meet desired goals, etc., were dealt in the class. This was very important for an incoming batch.",
    "Overall, I liked how this course was an informal introduction to academic careers and how to be a PhD student. Meeting with the Wednesday seminar speakers was helpful too, because we were able to get many different outside perspectives.",
    "Interaction with guest speakers"

  {
   "question_id": "FS0044",
   "question_text": "What aspects of this course need the most improvement?",
   "comments": [
    "At times the discussions with guests felt repetitive. In some cases, I would've liked to have focused on more specific aspects of their work and experiences.",
    "I loved the chance to hone my communication and \"pitching\" skills, but I do think that perhaps we would have gotten more out of that aspect of the class had we been even one semester further into our studies. I think that right now, many people are struggling to define what their research will even relate to, and more of an emphasis on actually developing research, pursuing new lines of inquiry, and collaborative problem-solving would have been appreciated. It might have been easier to get the most out of communication and pitching exercises had we felt more secure in our research topics.",
    "That said, Karen has a very particular strategy for approaching her work that I found did not necessarily work for me. As such, assignments such as asking us to record how we spend our time, for example, felt somewhat condescending and not very productive. I would have preferred instead to perhaps explore a range of time management strategies, and have an assignment in which we had to reflect on our current time management strategy and an idenfity areas that we find lacking. This would have allowed us to explore with more agency (and thus perhaps commitment) what types of alternative methods would work for us. Perhaps that would have spurred more useful dialogue in class and served as a better reflection and opportunity for improving our methods, rather than feeling like we were being monitored or told to fit one mold.",
    "This course needs more structure, at certain parts. For example, the course talks about time management and gave an awareness of how each of the students are managing or not managing time properly, but a professional help on how to better manage it could improve this course. Second, a detailed professional approach towards academic life and career could have been helpful. Readings in the class points at these, but one class each by the professor herself, or professionals in time management, writing, reading (fast), and improving productivity could help.",
    "I think that many of the topics we dealt with were valuable and helpful, but this information could have been even more helpful if presented to us at a later point in out PhD careers. A lot of what we as first year PhD students were dealing with was how to be students in our first semester, and sometimes I felt lost. Additionally, SO much of the focus is on students with an interdisciplinary focus, but there are some of us who are doing basic science. I felt like many of the policy-focused discussions did not apply to me at all."

I understand why it is first semester, and very much appreciated that we had the opportunity to get to know our peers, but I think many of us felt unprepared to be addressing some of the questions that Karen hoped us able to address. For me, I feel that this would have been more useful had I had more of a chance to orient myself in my project and at the school. I would have loved to have a more informal version of this course fall semester of first year and perhaps this course in the spring or even the fall semester of second year. A bit more structure would be welcomed! In addition, the focus on communicating our science was so valuable and important and I think it would fit very well later in our programs, perhaps after reaching candidacy.",
