    "You have to take it, but I wish we had the option not to!!! It was painful at times, seriously painful. I wish there had been some sort of colloquium or a meeting schedule with advisors, because my advisor wasn't very good.",
    "It's mandatory.",
    "Great!",
    "Well if you are a history major you have to take this so yes I would recommend it.",
    "gotta do it",
    "necessary for the history major. utilize your resources and you will be fine",
    "It's the history senior essay, so if you're reading this you're either already a history major (in which case you're going to be doing this no matter what) or you're thinking about being a history major(in which case the senior thesis seems so far off that you probably won't pay much attention to what we say anyway). As far as the thesis itself goes, I'll give the same advice that a lot of people give and yet hardly any of us ever seem to follow: 1) Start early\u0096\u0096start far earlier than you think you need to. You'll thank yourself later. 2) Finish your first draft BEFORE spring break. Many of us were here at Yale over spring break working on ours, and you don't want to have to do that. 3) Pick a good advisor. It's an extremely important aspect of your senior thesis experience; you need an advisor who not only is willing to talk with you and engage on the topic you choose, but who also will give you good feedback on your first draft. If you're still a sophomore or junior when you read this, try to pick an Undergraduate Seminar that deals with an area of history in which you're interested and is taught by someone with a reputation for giving good feedback\u0096\u0096that way, you can establish a relationship with the professor and try to get them as your advisor. 4) Pick a good topic. It sounds inane, but you really have to think about what you're going to spend a year exploring. The senior essay is a big commitment, but it's a rewarding experience.",
    "If you're a history major you're taking it. But yes, it is very rewarding and well worth it.",
    "I think that writing a senior essay is a very useful learning experience.",
    "A rewarding experience.",
    "Absolutely. It is an intense and grueling process, but you will not have an experience in researching and writing during your time at Yale that will rival it.",
    "You have to take it to complete the history major. A lot of the project rides on you own initiative, organizational skills, and scholastic abilities. It can be a very fulfilling capstone for your academic work at Yale. Treat it as such and not as a secondary activity. Pace yourself, and be prepared for a very work intensive February and March.",
    "You gotta do it if you're a history major, don't really have a choice.",
    "You must complete the history senior thesis to complete the history major. Strive to have a draft completed by spring break and a second draft for your adviser over a week prior to the April 2 deadline. Push adamantly to receive one of your preferred readers; a random reader can result in a pejorative and thoughtless assessment of your essay. It really is a shame that the adviser has absolutely no say in the final grade calculation, but that is the way the system works. Otherwise, I really did enjoy the research and writing process, and I can legitimately say that my personal fulfillment from completing the essay made up for the terrible administration of the evaluation process.",
    "Well, considering that you don't have a choice, there's not much of a recommendation to provide. It was a worthwhile experience, but make sure you know your own work habits. Some advisors will actually advise you, helping you chart your course. Others will be sounding boards, which is helpful, but will be pretty hands-off. There is no structured experience, so make one yourself. And please, for the love of God, actually do work first semester!",
    "A good way to wrap up your major. Choose something you care about and don't put it all off to the last minute.",
    "It may be too late by the time you read this, but finish the first term of the essay with ten pages, not an outline. You'll be 25% finished already, and you'll know exactly what research problems you still have. You do NOT want to hit the end of term two with gaping holes to fill.Similarly, agree on a rough draft due date with your advisor and stick to it. You will be so much better off getting feedback on the final product BEFORE it goes to the reader. Trust me on this one.Not that it matters that much, because if you're bothering to read the reviews for the Senior Essay's second semester, you're probably more meticulous than I was in the first place."
