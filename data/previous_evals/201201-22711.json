    "If you want\/need an L5 Spanish course take this one. I was probably better suited for L4 and so I struggled sometimes in the class, but I'm so glad I took it. Professor Seymour is amazing and the size and structure of the class mean you improve your listening, speaking, reading, and writing skills. I solidified my understanding of certain grammar points and actually finally learnt others. Plus, it's not just a straightforward, boring grammar class. There are opportunities to speak and improve your listening and writing. Definitely a lot more work than Advanced Conversational Spanish (2 exams, short presentation, homework for each class, 3 writing exercises with 1 and 2nd drafts), but I came out having actually improved my Spanish, whereas my impression is not everyone leaving conversational spanish did.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. The class is a lot of work, but it will definitely help you solidify your control of the language.",
    "Spanish 243 is a course meant to streghten a student's grasp of Spanish to a level close to a native speaker\/writer. The instructor will usually screen interested students at the beginning of the course to determine whether they are of the appropriate proficiency. I found this course, although it demanded alot of work, to be extremely rewarding. Uses of Spanish grammar which I had understood vaguely for many years came much clearer to me during the course.",
    "I highly recommend this class. It is a great way to learn grammar that you should have learned but didn't in your high school spanish class. There is a lot of busy work each night, but it's busywork, and the tests are very fair. The essays are not too long as well. It's about an hour of work each night, a bargain for what you get out of the class.",
    "This class is a pretty good one and will help you keep up your Spanish while going further in depth into certain grammatical concepts. Professor Seymour is also super nice. There is, however, a lot of busy work.",
    "If you are serious about Spanish and improving your fluency, absolutely. You will fix the mistakes you know you make and the ones you don\u00b4t know you make.",
    "If you feel that you are not quite secure in your Spanish or worry about making grammatical mistakes while speaking or writing, this is a very useful class. It does NOT address speaking and does not offer much practice in that area, but it offers extremely thorough coverage of many grammatical subjects.",
    "The class is a lot of work but it's worth it, you will become better at speaking Spanish with a greater command of the grammar.",
    "YES, definitely. Everybody who wants to learn the Spanish language should take this course! There is a fair amount of \"busy work,\" but it's really good for making sure that you are in total control of the material. It absolutely solidifies your Spanish abilities and is essential for really knowing the language. Plus, Terry Seymour is great."
