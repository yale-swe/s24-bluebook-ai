    "At least 10 hours per week. There was too much reading and homework in addition to other large projects. The workload was not reflective of a graduate level work and much of the work seemed frivolous. Having homework due very class is excessive especially at times when other papers were due in the same course. The time spent on homeworks was not reflected in the weighting of the grades."

   "comments": [
    "This course was good but not great. The core text was good and interesting, though quite nutrition-focused rather than policy or disease\/health focused. I am not quite sure what was missing from the class - perhaps the focus on nutrition, on field measurements and all sorts of research-related things rather than on the more 'global issues' was not what i was expecting\/hoping for.",
    "Waste of my time. This is one course that defines discount education at full price. If you really want to engage in a class about global nutrition, talking gorillas, blah blah blah boring. I'm not saying nothing new was learned, but I could have learned eerything she taught in a 20 slide powerpoint. Read a book you'll get more out of it.",
    "Strengths: discussion involvement, regular reading",
    "Interesting",
    "The course was extremely interesting and engaging. The information was applicable and the class sessions were extremely worthwhile. I liked how interactive everything was. I felt like a learned a lot throughout the semester.",
    "This course provided a good overview of the topic of global food insecurity, disease, poverty, etc. I learned a lot in this course and believe that the set-up of the class, in terms of at home quizzes to enhance understanding of the course without taking up too much class time was great.I would have appreciated more feedback from the instructor in terms of how these real life problems are being solved and better ways we can go about addressing them. Additionally, i would have liked to learn more about her research.",
    "the quizzes were terrible. did not learn much from them and was just time consuming.",
    "My main criticism of the course is that I did not like the worksheet format in which a lot of the learning was presented. I found it difficult to retain information in that manner, and I think it would be better if such information was presented in a power point format instead.",
    "The readings (for bookreview and \"My Ishmae\" were very interesting) were very interesting. Although I appreciate being assigned sections from the textbook to ensure a basic level of knowledge was established prior to classroom discussion, assignment of papers would have made the calss discussions more interesting. Although the Regional Nutritional Analysis was interesting the final project should not have been based on that work. Instead students should have been able to work on an individual project."

    "Instructor: Debbie Lee Humphries \u00a0She is knowledgeable and had interesting ideas regarding the role of pre-conceived notions in thought processes and challenging assumptions, but really didn't bring much of that to bear in class. She was also surprisingly uncomfortable with challenges to her statements in class - and i say surprisingly because of her clear statement at the beginning of the semester that she values discussion and challenges to preconceived notions, etc.",
    "Instructor: Debbie Lee Humphries \u00a0She's nice and all, little weird, I just don't like the course.",
    "Instructor: Debbie Lee Humphries \u00a0Needs to add alittle more umph to the lessons.",
    "Instructor: Debbie Lee Humphries \u00a0Very involved. She was very accommodating to the class, tailoring the the materials and presentation to the students. She obviously put a lot of work into teaching and it was well worth it.",
    "Instructor: Debbie Lee Humphries \u00a0Debbie was a great professor- she always took time to ask our opinions and answer our questions. It was also great to interact with her outside the classroom and share a meal at her house.I would have appreciated more sharing of her personal experiences and knowledge, rather than just case studies and text material.",
    "Instructor: Debbie Lee Humphries \u00a0The instructor was very good at giving prompt and helpful feedback to students.",
    "Instructor: Debbie Lee Humphries \u00a0Debbie brought a lot of her international experience to classroom discussions. She was always open to suggestions on assignments and classroom format. I felt that she always kept the students' interest in mind.",
    "Instructor: Debbie Lee Humphries \u00a0Could use a lecture component to focus the course. Discussions with only student input is not always helpful and tends to drag when only one or two students answer questions."

    "An introduction to how nutrition plays a role in global health. Looks individual diseases, policy, and possible interventions and remedies. Extremely interesting and engaging. I would definitely recommend this class to anyone interested in learning more about nutrition in the developing world.",

I would recommend this course to anyone who does not have a great understanding of the problems facing global food security or who would like to work on global health issues around the world.",
