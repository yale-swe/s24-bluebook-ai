   "comments": [
    "I was able to learn more about what parts of my culture and realize my experiences as a heritage speaker are common amongst my peers.",
    "I learned a lot about grammar and how to properly write Spanish. But I also learned a lot about the heritage of not only my own country but those of the other students in the class",
    "Heritage Spanish was an excellent course that provided the creative opportunities to explore the language in the ways that were meaningful to me. There were plenty of projects and writing assignments that allowed free-direction in what social or cultural topics I wanted to explore in Spanish, refining my vocabulary in the areas that I thought were the most important. The class also provided a very fun and comfortable environment to practice my communication and speaking skills in Spanish and provided me with a large boost in confidence and experience properly speaking with peers, who were as invested in the language as I was.",
    "Cultivated my understanding of the Spanish language and of Hispanic cultures throughout the world.",
    "I learned the faults in my seemingly fluent Spanish. I had a space to practice and grow with other heritage speakers.",
    "I was introduced to Spanish grammar for the first time and learned to appreciate its complexity. I learned how to use canvas a little better, too.",
    "I learned about Spanish grammar rules, including specific errors I make as a Heritage speaker, I learned about Spanish culture and history through readings and movies, I also learned about my own culture and heritage through the final project."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "We could have used a lot more grammar practice and time to review what knowledge we did have. A greater purview of Spanish literature would also have been appreciated. However, we did have great conversation practice.",
    "The largest strength of this course was the creative freedom it provided in making your understanding of Spanish very personal. Instead of having many grammar drills and specific routine tests, we learn grammar and then apply it to our lives and past understandings of the language and our heritage cultures. I cannot find any weaknesses within this course.",
    "The course heavily relied on canvas. I missed several HW credits for not understanding how to submit assignments. Students need a lesson on how to use it. Although it is intuitive, learning still happens through trial and error. I can't afford to learn how to use the system through error. It is not fair to me and it is not a good use of time.",
    "This course has many strengths. I enjoy the small size of the class and how it is geared towards Heritage speakers. It is setup in a way that helps Heritage speakers refine their Spanish without boring then with the basics.",
    "Course was well constructed but there was too much grade weight placed on grammar tests, which are usually the weakness of heritage speakers"

    "way easier than any language class. so if ur heritage 10\/10 would recommend",
    "Take this if you can! Professor Alexandrov is great at teaching and a really nice person. This was this best language class I've ever taken - you won't regret it",
    "This is a great course and Professor Alexandrov is incredible. Everything is catered for the students, so whatever level you're at you will learn a lot. If you want to improve your Spanish in any way - whether it be speaking, vocabulary, writing, grammar - then take this course. All aspects of your Spanish will improve and you'll learn things you didn't even know you didn't know.",
    "This is an excellent language course for heritage speakers that I would highly recommend for all students that are elegible. It has provided immense depth to my understanding and application of the Spanish language, made me much more confident in speaking eloquently and in an academic setting, while also allowing me to appreciate the history and diverse culture that comes along with the language.",
    "Take this class!",
    "If you are a heritage speaker. TAKE THIS CLASS! It truly was life changing. I learned so much and prof Alexandrov is the best. So supportive and gives great feedback. You will get so much out of it and I allows you to grow in your confidence as a speaker\/ writer \/ reader",
    "Yes, but I felt that there should be a distinction made even among heritage speakers. Many Hispanic students took Spanish in High School. They were already exposed to the grammar and felt unchallenged by the class work load in that regard. In my opinion, however, many of those same students could not speak well despite their heritage and previous academic exposure to the subject. They should be paired to improve each others weakness.",
    "I would most definitely recommend this course to any Heritage Spanish speaking student, especially if taught by the same professor. The class is a great way of fulfilling a distributional requirement and an overall enjoyable course. The workload is maneagable and none of the assignments are unreasonable, tedious, or unpleasant. I would honestly say this is one of the next courses I have taken at Yale thus far.",
    "Yes! Professor Alexandrov is wonderful and you will enjoy the course if you grew up speaking Spanish"
