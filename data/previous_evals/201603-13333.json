While I had concerns regarding the structure and content of the course this semester, none of this is a reflection on Jessica. She has a clear passion for the issues we were exploring this semester that goes beyond just a cursory understanding of the content. Her dedication to bringing in speakers from across the country enriched our classroom dialogue and truly made this a worthwhile course. I would be thrilled to have Jessica as a TA again during my time at Yale.",

    "13 Julie and Paul were such great instructors. They challenged my thinking, but they were also very receptive to student concerns or questions. They made themselves very available to meet and talk with students.",
    "Q12- I typically worked with Julie when I had any questions about assignments or the class overall so I don't have a good sense of how responsive Paul was or was not to students.",
    "I had high hopes for this class, and while there were some true bright spots during the course of the semester, there were also some missteps. I can say that it was clear both Professor Anastas and Zimmerman worked incredibly hard in making this a unique learning experience - which it was. I think the model and structure of this class is one that could inform how other FES courses are developed. That said, I did feel like the best part of the course came early on as we walked through the science and infrastructure relating to the Flint crisis. It is clear that both Julie and Paul are incredible scientists and engineers whose knowledge in these areas seem to have no bounds. Learning from them was really a gift for someone like myself who has little background in these areas. Unfortunately, once the subject matter shifted to more nuanced issues relating to social justice, race relations and urban decline it did feel like both professors were well outside of their comfort zone. This isn't to say that they didn't put in the hard work to learn and grow alongside students - in fact, they did just that. But I would suggest that moving forward the professors look to their students who have worked in these fields (or come in with more than just a 101 understanding of the root issues at play) for more guidance in shaping the discussion. I will say I think this had more to do with the subject matter than the professors themselves. In past years, I believe this course has looked at crises that stem more from infrastructure mishaps than systemic power imbalances within our country. Flint is a unique case in this way. While past courses would likely have attracted a more select group of students interested in water systems and resource management, this semester brought in a much more diverse group of students with varying backgrounds and strengths. For instance, most students I spoke with were well aware that the issues facing Flint were not solely rooted in just the antiquated piping of the city - it was why we were looking to take the course in the first place. It often felt like this fact was lost on our professors who may have been operating under the pretenses of past Science to Solutions courses.",
    "This course was terrific. It was great to practice addressing such a thorny environmental problem and making sense of knowledge gained in a messy way throughout the semester. I am confident the tools we learned in systems thinking and multi-criteria analysis will be invaluable going forward.",
    "3. The consecutive nature of the briefs was overwhelming 4. The beginning of the class, which involved building our toolkits, was too slow, while the speaker series\/policy brief\/final presentation section felt very rushed."

    "Guest speakers were amazing I loved the format and structure of the course",
    "The systems thinking\/problem statement components, the guest speakers",
    "This was probably one of the most useful classes I have ever taken in my life. It provided concepts and tools that are applicable and needed in the real world and opened alot of students up to a new way of thinking. Overall, it helped us understand the Flint crisis from several perspectives that many of us were lacking to some extent.",
    "The interdisciplinary approach and to learn how to write briefing papers",
    "Applying systems thinking. Good guest speakers.",
    "This is largely a comment on FES, and became apparent due to the strengths of this course. The only people of color and women guests that I heard from in classes all semester were in Science to Solutions. This is an unfortunate fact, as I truly believe there are many stories within environmentalism that should be shared from many backgrounds and cultures. I found this course to be challenging, but realistic. While I learned a lot and had to stretch myself in many instances to meet the expectations of my peers and instructors, I felt supported all the way.",
    "The ability to look at and examine an ongoing, dynamic issue facing a community in real time. I truly believe this model of learning and systems thinking could be transformative for FES and our staff\/student development moving forward. Additionally, learning from Julie and Paul - as well as the many speakers and guests they brought in - was fantastic.",
    "Several of the outside speakers were outstanding and learning how to interact with an expert in a fixed amount of time in order to write a policy brief is an incredibly useful skill. I also loved working with my group on the final project.",
    "Paul and Julie are incredible professors. The speakers were amazing and I'm so impressed we had all of them. The briefing papers and final paper were great exercises but should've been spaced out more.",
    "It provided a variety of viewpoints regarding the issue through the guest speakers, as opposed to the one or two viewpoints often provided in courses. It taught systems thinking, which was a really valuable tool in looking forward and at environmental problems holistically.",
    "The guest speakers were phenomenal and the causal loop tools were useful. The course was very timely. Systems thinking, and the inclusion of environmental justice and communication, should be included in all FES courses."

   "comments": [
    "I wish it could be longer! It would have been nice to get the community perspective earlier in the semester",
    "The grading on briefings felt incredibly random - as if there was no correlation between effort and grade. More clarity re: what criteria are used to evaluate grades would be really helpful!",
    "It was alot of work and at times, very fast paced. I think there was a misunderstanding of how much time and work was needed for each assignment. The order of the course could also be improved since we learned about systems thinking in the very beginning but then didn't use it until the very end of the semester.",
    "It needs more systems thinking theory back up: Some Maturana, Meadows, Luhmann.",
    "Heavy course load.",
    "The timing of the course is one of the areas needing the most improvement. I waited all semester to hear from Flint residents and activists, and they were the last two speakers of the semester. I believe more emphasis should be made on requesting the participation of activists and citizens who are directly engaged in these challenges, rather than academics and researchers. The briefing papers were helpful writing exercises, but oftentimes felt repetitive and we did not receive clear expectations for the assignments, so I truly believe my performance plateaued. I believe there should be another assignment that addresses these core issue areas during the semester (perhaps replacing a paper with an individual presentation). Our final presentation happened very late in the semester and I believe the writing exercise was too long and disjointed from our initial course perspective on writing. We spent the entire semester working to communicate issues in the most concise and specific manner, and worked to create a shared document with 20, single-spaced spaces. The expectations were not clearly communicated, and our group struggled as a result. Finally, I believe having the final presentation earlier in the semester would have kept my personal motivation going, as I became a bit discouraged by the end of the semester. It would have been great to present our best ideas and return to the drawing board to refine them and develop more specific proposals for solutions.",
    "While the guest speakers were wonderful, many of them clearly needed to have their presentations edited down to allow for Q&A or discussion. It might be better to either add an additional class time just for speakers, or to cut down on the number of speakers. I also would recommend spending a bit more time at the beginning of the course to lay the foundation for the specifics of the issue. Many of my colleagues were coming from outside the United States, so Flint was not as familiar to them at the start. The amount of time to develop our final policy recommendations was far too short, in my opinion. I would have loved more time to really consider outside case studies or potential policy solutions in my submission, but given the time - and the group structure of the project, that wasn't an option. I would also recommend that the final presentation class seemed unnecessary and didn't add anything to our learning or understanding of the issue.",
    "If possible, I think it would be helpful to prep the speakers a bit more on our baseline knowledge before they develop the content they'd like to present, and screen the questions we'd like to ask as a group beforehand to get the most out of the session time. I also felt that we were missing class time on public economics and urban development.",
    "Structure: there should be one class on what happened, then start the speakers\/briefing papers, and then do the MCA, CLD, etc at the end.",
    "The course organization could have been better. For example, we learned about causal loop diagrams and multi-criteria decision analyses, which were great and useful, but we didn't use them until much later in the course. The gap between learning and using made it more difficult to grasp the subjects immediately.",
    "This course attempted to tackle a huge topic, and the effort was valiant. While I am glad that this class exists, I cannot say that I enjoyed it. This is largely because the sociological conditions and implications of this case study did not get the nuanced analysis that it warranted. This is not necessarily the fault of the professors, but rather speaks to a larger problem FES has with procuring professors who specialize in environmental humanities. While it was interesting to witness the professors learning more about topics such as environmental justice as the class was learning, it was frustrating to not achieve any depth in those topics."

    "Advantages: Positive challenging experience. I don't believe I have ever worked in a group that was so focused on collaboration. Disadvantages: I had a very different working style than my classmates and struggled to manage the expectations of my peers. I also believe there was a lack of trust and emphasis on micromanaging work rather than working independently, which was frustrating for me. I would recommend a more comprehensive group matching process, as I do not believe I was a good fit for my group, although we did end up with a great final product.",
    "The group work in this course didn't seem to work since the nature of the project didn't lend itself to an equitable group work dynamic.",

I'm not sure what the process was for creating the groups but mine had a wonderful team dynamic.",
