    "I wouldn't recommend this class to another student. I wish I had taken another science class to get the credit out of the way, but no other class worked in my schedule so I was forced to. It's not a horrible class and I didn't actively dislike it, Ijust think that there are other more interesting science classes to take at Yale.",
    "It's a great class for non-science majors. Stay in the class after the first two weeks because at first it seems like you really have to know science but then you slowly realize that you can learn what's being taught by simply studying.",
    "I would recommend this course if and only if you need an easy science credit and are willing to put up with mindblowingly boring classes week after week. The professor was extraordinarily dull and uninspired - each class consisted of her reading from her lengthy PowerPoint slides, the content of which was taken verbatim from the textbook. The only reason I went to class was to hand in \"discussion questions\" (kind of a joke) at the end of class. The textbook was my teacher; I learned nothing new or interesting from the professor. The workload is light - textbook reading every night, supplementary readings (entirely unnecessary), one homework assignment every two weeks or so (on which doing well required copying the textbook), a very short term paper (5-8 pages... isthisreallife.jpg), and an easy midterm and final. The class might as well have been called \"Introduction to Science,\" as we spent much of the semester discussing such riveting questions as: \"What is an isotope?\" \"What is the difference between DNA and RNA?\" \"What are metamorphic rocks?\" Barely qualifies as \"astronomy.\" A great fifth class, I guess. Could even work as a sixth. Or a ninth.",
    "Only take it if you're interested in astrobiology, otherwise you may be bored out of your mind. The title is deceiving. You think it will be a cool exploration of aliens and stuff and then all the sudden you're looking at the chemical breakdown of the dust floating around some tiny planetesimal.",
    "its not that great, but if you really want to know how many life forms might be out there go for it",
    "great science credit - much easier than some of the bio classes I've taken\/shopped.",
    "Don't do it. Poor course. Nothing redeeming about it. Sneaky hard.",
    "Solid class. Fun to hear about the universe and astronomy without having to take a serious math based class. If youre looking for a good science credit take it.",
    "I would say it is a great science class to take as a non science major.",
    "If you are looking for a science credit, and are a non-science major, and also want to learn very interesting material then definitely take this class! The lectures can be a little long, especially because they are in the afternoon. But there are many opportunities to seek help with the TA's, at the optional review sessions, or even with Professor Fischer herself. The material is very interesting and makes you think differently about the world and what is around us today.",
    "It covers basic biology, geology and astronomy. Good course if you are a non-science major looking to get a credit in a science without putting in too much work.",
    "This class is amazing, everyone should take it!",
    "A lot of memorization, but overall a pretty straightforward course. Not a difficult SC credit",
    "I would recommend it to all the non-science majors looking for an easy class. It is graded on an absolute scale, meaning no curve but it is fairly easy stuff.",
    "A great way to fulfill the science requirement. Interesting, informative.",
    "Yes- great science credit for non majors. Very interesting too",
    "I would recommend this course for anyone who wants a basic understanding of astronomy, biology, physics, and geology. It isn't demanding, and the homework distribution allows for fair grading scales.",
    "Solid class. Paper, midterm, final and problem sets. Class is weighted towards problem sets - 35% - and are pretty easy. 16% of the grade is turning up to class and writing a question about what you didn't understand in the lecture. Material is basic and tests can be studied for by learning the lecture slides.",
    "Astro 130 is an easy science requirement. Take it if you want a science without a QR requirement.",
    "Though not terribly interesting, Life in the Universe wasn't really terribly boring either, and is a decent enough way to get a science credit. Straightforward problem sets (really more like reading response sets) once every two weeks, a midterm, a short paper, and a final, not too much work - and it is even possible to become interested in your paper.",
    "It is an interesting course but sometimes lectures were pretty boring. If you want to learn more about planets, stars, and how earth began, then take this course. It isn't too intensive.",
    "If you need a science credit, don't like math and haven't taken much science before, this is a great class to take.",
    "Talks about how life on Earth arose, what is needed for life on other planets, and where life might possibly exist in our solar system.",
    "A pretty interesting class. Very broad subject, which makes it difficult to focus in on the particulars you find interesting. I enjoyed it on the whole and learned some interesting stuff. If you're excited by the course description, take it.",
    "Fun class, learned a lot of interesting things i never would have known nor researched on my own if it was not for the science credit.",
    "Great class; take it, you won't regret it.",
    "It was a good class that that explored the possibility of life outside of our planet.",
    "Good survey astronomy class. I would recommend it to people who have a basic interest in astronomy and also to people who want to fulfill a science requirement without having to spend too much effort doing so. If you want to get a good grade, the problem sets may take a while, though.",
    "I would recommend this course. It is not a gut, and the problem sets are pretty hard, but the resources are available if you choose to seek help."
