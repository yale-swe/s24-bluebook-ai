   "comments": [
    "It's pretty easy, so long as you do the work. The professor is very nice.",
    "I would definitely recommend ARBC 110 01 to Yale students. It is an excellent introduction to the grammar and vocabulary of Modern Standard Arabic.",
    "I would definitely recommend the course, be prepared to invest a lot of time into learning and practicing.",
    "ABC 110 is a rigorous introduction to Modern Standard Arabic, and it is enjoyable, if you throw yourself into the experience. There is a lot of work, with daily online homework and many tests and assignments, but if you love languages and are curious about Arabic, I would definitely recommend taking it. Professor Elbousty is very enthusiastic and encouraging, although he sometimes has difficulty understanding questions posed to him about the material. Mostly, however, his influence motivates you to learn the material better. If you work hard from the beginning of the semester, it will be worth it. You will cover a lot of material in a short time.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class, with Professor Elbousty. Beyond learning the basics of Modern Standard Arabic, studying with Professor Elbousty will allow you to tap into aspects of culture and current events from Arabic-speaking regions that would normally be reserved for a higher level class. This is the most exciting L1 language course I can imagine.",
    "I would recommend this class to another student. It gives a solid foundation in basic Arabic; however, you only get as much as you put into the class. You can get by in class easily, but if you really want to learn you should put in the time to learn the vocab well and keep up with grammar.",
    "I would recommend the course to a fellow student, because although the course is challenging, I learned quite a bit, and the material is very interesting.",
    "I would recommend it, because it is a great intro level class that accomplishes its goal, but I would summarize it as requiring a lot of work and focus.",
    "I would highly recommend it to anyone who's interested. It's a great introduction to Arabic."
