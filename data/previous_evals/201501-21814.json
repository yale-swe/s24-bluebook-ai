    "Take it!!! Especially with Liu Laoshi; she makes it a lot more enjoyable!",
    "Take this class if you want to improve your chinese! However, this is a big time commitment - there's daily homework and mandatory attendance every day.",
    "This course is the straightforward continuation of CHNS 132. The course structure is identical to that of CHNS 132, but with more emphasis on formal Chinese grammar. In addition, the textbook focuses more on contemporary Chinese issues. This course is very effective for learning the Chinese language as well as Chinese culture.",
    "Take this class! You won't regret it at all. It's a great way to improve your Chinese. I never thought I'd be able to write essays in Chinese before, but now I'm actually able to. Liu Laoshi is the best, and while it can be a lot of work since there are daily quizzes and homework, it's definitely worth it.",
    "This class is great. The material is considerably harder than CHNS 132 and there are a lot more new formal words to learn. However, we no longer had to learn pinyin which was a lot better than last semester. We sometimes had movies to watch which was quite fun. Liu laoshi is chill and nice as usual. Overall I've improved my Chinese SO much my parents are so surprised.",
    "You're probably continuing from CHNS 132, so you know what it's like. Pace is slightly faster but still manageable. The class feels better because everyone already has a term to get to know each other, so knowing everyone from the start just lets things flow so much smoother."
