    "Take it for a course with interesting material and a light workload. One presentation and one final paper. why not?",
    "This class is very low-key in terms of workload and section discussion. However, I would only recommend this class if you're very interested in the material. Otherwise, you probably won't enjoy sitting through sections all semester or writing the final paper.",
    "Prof. Summers is absolutely amazing! Definitely take it!",
    "There is only one presentation and one final paper at the end of the course, and there are few readings. So you don't really know what your grade is until the end of the semester. It's a low-workload seminar, but it isn't as rewarding because of that. However, Professor Summers is a really nice guy and someone definitely worth getting to know.",
    "A good fifth class if you're interested in exploring Chinese science. Expect a low workload, subpar discussions and flexibility in choosing your own paper topic.",
    "Would definitely recommend. Started off a little slow but got progressively better.",
    "I would definitely recommend History of Chinese Science to other students. The course wasn't very stressful and the workload was easily manageable, but the material was interesting.",
    "This course isn't that hard, and is fairly interesting. If you pick an interesting topic for your final paper, it can be a lot of fun too. I'd recommend it if you need a writing credit.",
    "This is a really good class if you want to learn more about China's history. It is a bit niche, but it is easy to get into the material"
