   "comments": [
    "PHYS 401 was a pretty good class. It was disappointingly easy compared to PHYS 410. You learn far less than the people in PHYS 410 do. In PHYS 410, they covered a lot more special relativity and stuff like perturbation theory and chaos theory. We spent only like 3 or so lectures on special relativity, and only like one lecture on Hamiltonians. Moreover, the homework is pretty easy. In fact, I think this class may be easier than 200. We may even cover less material. I kind of feel disappointed that we didn't learn more in the class. However, Shankar is an excellent, excellent teacher. He's one of the first (possibly only) science teachers I've had who actually knows HOW to teach. It's hard to describe this quality in words. He simply really knows how to educate you on a complex topic. He's a really great teacher. Unfortunately, he was really inaccessible to us as he didn't have office hours and he would flee at the end of every class. So yeah, this class is pretty good, just a lot easier than I expected, and Shankar was a lot more aloof than I expected.",
    "Take Physics 401 if you're interested in learning from one of the best teachers in our time.",
    "If you've already taken Phys 260, you may want to pass on this class, as it pretty much rehashes parts of that class. It generally goes into the same depth or less depth as Phys 260, and has a few additional minor topics (thermodynamics, which you may have already seen in Chem 118 or PChem, Kepler's laws, and Hamiltonian dynamics). Otherwise, the class is very well-taught and goes into some interesting material. So I'd suggest this class for sure if you haven't taken Phys 260. If you have, you mightwant to pass.",
    "I would recommend taking this course if you are definitely interested in being some sort of physics major. The class goes fast and I found it very challenging, but if you put the time and effort into it I think it's worth it.",
    "Shankar is Shankar.",
    "Shankar is a great professor. If you took 170\/171 or 180\/181 and want to continue with physics, this is a wonderful class. Having taken 200\/201, this class often felt like I was taking 200 again. You do some new stuff \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Lagrangians are the main new thing, we went over Hamiltonians but never had to do any problems with them, and we talked about entropy quantitatively. But most of the thermo and special relativity problem sets we had were exactly the ones Shankar gave when he taught 200 (which are on Yale Open Courses). You can take 410 instead, but it's a lot more work\/harder, and that doesn't really solve the problem of being sick of mechanics.",
    "I would summarize Physics 401 as comprehensive physics course that is taught extremely well. In my opinion, the physics taught in this course is something that everyone would benefit from understanding.",
    "I would recommend this course, not only for Physics majors.",
    "Take it - Shankar is so great and the TA is awesome too. Don't miss out on a course that makes physics so clear&beautiful again.Don't miss out on Shankar as a physics major!",
    "I recommend this class if you are up for a challenge and want to learn a lot of physics. The midterm was okay but the final was extremely hard. The professor was really great though.",
    "Shankar is great. There is a lot of overlap with Phys 200 concepts, but towards the end (thermo) there's more. Not easy.",
    "I really enjoyed the class. Shankar is a great teacher, and always keeps the class entertained (and will be sure to call on whoever he thinks is not paying attention...). The problem sets can be somewhat difficult, but not absurdly so, and the tests are fair.",
    "This is a great (and not too difficult) physics course on somewhat more advanced topics in mechanics. It also intros you to special relativity and thermodynamics. It's a good class if you are interested in the material!",
    "Physics 401 is a pretty standard physics course. Professor Shankar is a good lecturer. If you are interested in physics, I would recommend the course.",
    "This course will give you a strong foundation in many branches of classical physics. Prof. Shankar is absolutely incredible as a lecturer-- he'll explain everything at a perfect pace and with great clarity, and when that's not the case, he really encourages all of his students to ask questions again and again until they fully understand the material. Exams and problem sets are generally fair, but beware of poorly worded questions that can throw you off or confuse you from time to time, even if you understand relevant course content. Also be aware that the TA, Arvin, can be helpful at times but generally has a lot of trouble answering questions efficiently and effectively when you need his help. Overall, though, this is a wonderful course, and the two negatives I mentioned shouldn't take away from the fact that Shankar is a superb teacher, and even other professors in the physics department will admit to that.",
    "Decent physics class. Not too hard.",
    "Great course. Perhaps a little too similar to PHYS 200 and PHYS 201. Shankar is a fantastic teacher. Definitely lives up to his name. My only two reservations are:the difficulty of the midterm and final. Both were disconcertingly hard and tested, I felt, rather niche topics of the course.I feel Shankar could've done a few more examples during lecture. That would have made the material more easily understandable.All in all though, a great course taught by an even greater professor!",
    "Repeat of Physics 200. Very very little additional material.",
    "I would definitely recommend the class - the lectures were fantastic and pretty well tailored to the level of students in the class.",
    "Professor Shankar is a boss. Don't miss out.The material was never easy, though nor was it ever exceptionally difficult; nonetheless, expect to be challenged by the testing. It is not enough to know the basic material, as you also must gain a deeper intuition so as to be able to master the tests. I feel this class helped me a great deal in developing that \"physics intuition\" that I had failed to discover in intro courses, and it's often quite fun. Don't fool yourself into thinking it'll be 'easy', but enjoy it nonetheless. Shankar, once again, is awesome."
