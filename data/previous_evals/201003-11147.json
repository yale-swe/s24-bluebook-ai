    "IBIO 530 was a broad overview of immunobiology. I think it is an appropriate introductory course for someone who is planning on or is doing research involving the immune system.",
    "It's a course that covers most aspects of immune biology.Yes.Because it's really good if you are interested in immune system.",
    "Yes, I'd recommend as a good introduction to immunology. The professors are great and are leaders in their fields.",
    "Brief survey of the immune system.Would definitely recommend this course to a fellow student - very interesting material and the exams were fair.",
    "Immunobiology is a course that teaches about all aspects of the immune system in a very comprehensive manner. I would definitely recommend Immunobiology 530 to another student that may have some interest in immunology.",
    "You'll learn a lot of information, probably the best immuno course i've taken. you'll learn a lot of mechanisms, which is great, but they really need to improve the 2nd half of the course."

    "I am doing research in nephrology and looking into the effects of the immune system on ischemia reperfusion. Though much of the course was not related specifically to what I am studying, I found it useful in broadening my understanding of how the immune system is regulated. I am hoping that what I have gained in this course will help shape my research\/dissertation in asking appropriate research questions in the immune response to kidney injury. I can understand that this course was meant to be primarily focused on pathogen-based immune response, though it would have helped me further if there was some discussion on the immune response in sterile injury.",
    "Greatly deepened knowledge of my discipline and will contribute to my research.",
    "This course was very beneficial for my future as an immunologist. I learned about parts of the immune system that I did not know much about before taking this class. Even though I may not do research in these topics, I will definitely be able to make connections between what I work on and the topics of immunology that are new to me. It also strengthened my understanding of how everything in the immune system works together.",
    "Definitely contributed to my knowledge of this area - knowing the mechanisms of lymphocyte development is very helpful.",
    "It was a great overview of the field which provided a great introduction to many topics which I can now further study.",
    "This course solidified the knowledge I gained in my undergrad immunology course. I already had a nuanced conceptual understanding of how the immune system was activated and regulated but I now can fill in many more of the specific details regarding the molecular biology."
