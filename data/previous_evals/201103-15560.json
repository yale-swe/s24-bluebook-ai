    "Amazing class, definitely take it. As a spanish language class it's pretty great, and gives you a combination of speaking\/reading\/writing assignments that help you work towards improvement of language skills. In terms of its content though, this class is unparalleled. I'm a history major, and this class covers issues\/facts about latin american political development that you can't learn through any of yale's history classes (which speaks both to the excellence of this class and to the lack of attention that the yale history department gives to latin american studies).",
    "I recommend the class to continue practicing Spanish but only if you are interested in Latin American politics. You'll learn a lot and the readings are appropriate, but you have to be interested in the material.",
    "If you are interested at all in politics and spanish, I would definitely recommend this course. It essentially involves daily discussions about various aspects of Latin American politics, generally moving country by country. Your grade is composed of minimal assignments, no tests, participation, and performance in \"simulations\" of council meetings on important issues.",
    "I wouldn't take this class if you've taken higher level Spanish classes (i.e. group C courses), but if you're looking for an interesting way to get an L5 Spanish credit I would definitely take this course over something like Advanced Conversational Spanish, for example.",
    "This is a fantastic class and Professor Carballal is truly a joy. It is, however, very much a Latin American Politics class, and though it will improve your Spanish immensely, do not take it unless your are interested in what's on the syllabus!",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class. It was interesting, relevant, and engaging, and the work was actually interesting. My Spanish got much, much better.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this class to another student... but make sure you are confident in your speaking abilities before you enroll, because you will have a much easier time.",
    "Fantastic introduction to politics and issues of 'Latin America' from 1940-present day. Although the course is survey-style, the selected topics appropriately cover the most important issues. Although a language course, this class could easily have been conducted in English and I would still have learned a lot. The course's evaluations mangage to test knowledge of subject material and spanish-speaking abilities while simultaneously enhancing that knowledge and ability. Would definitely recommend to any student interested in history or politics, period, as long as you're not afraid of a research paper or two.",
    "Yes! It's a lot harder than your average L5 (for example, Adv. Conversational Spanish), however. The level of speaking is a lot more advanced."
