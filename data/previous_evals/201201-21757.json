   "comments": [
    "The reading list for this class is great, but make sure that you are comfortable taking a themed class. The discussion is often constrained by the emphasis on the Apollonian\/Dionysian dichotomy. Also, because it was a Friday afternoon seminar, people often didn't do the reading, which resulted in disappointing class time. Syrimis is great.",
    "It's a survey of works that relate to Dionysus in Modernity. The syllabus is an accurate reflection--we go over a theme each week, and it's as cumulative as you make it. While that makes it difficult to miss a single class, it's also totally worth going to every single one.",
    "Absolutely. Anyone interested in modern continental philosophy or literature should take this class.",
    "This class is a good WR. The reading is manageable but interesting, class is always entertaining, and Syrimis is a good professor, always engaging and funny. He clearly cares a lot about the material. If you don't mind class being kind of all over the place and being unsure about what exactly you got out of it, take it. It's fun and you get to sort of creatively play with all the stuff you read and talk about.",
    "A nice course on an interesting literary theme. It draws connections to psychoanalysis, the grotesque, and modern and ancient Greek literature alike. A particular strong point about this class were the lively discussions we had. Sometimes it was a bit unclear what our assignments consisted in, but that's a minor point. Prof. Syrimis brought a certain quirkiness and interest to the conversations that made the class particularly enjoyable. By all means take the class!",
    "If you're interested in thinking about big philosophical questions (especially those concerning sex and society), take this course, it's great!",
    "Definitely go for it!",
    "It is a fun class to take, it is also about two important sides of ourselves: the Apollonian and the Dionysian.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class! I had a lot of fun and Syrimis is an amazing professor. You will learn a lot and have tons of fun. Don't just consider it if you want to learn about the Dionysian\/Apollonian dichotomy, the themes covered go way beyond that and include a lot of interesting poets and writers. Syrimis is closely engaged with students and helps you develop strong writing skills.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course. The subject matter is incredibly interesting and literally sexy, but that doesn't mean it isn't hard. I feel that the academic tasks for this course were rewarding.",
    "Take it if you have the chance. As a writing credit, it's not too intense. The readings are awesome, and Professor Syrimis really makes class discussions fun and enjoyable.",
    "YES take this class if you want to think\/read about something really different"
