   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend this class to anyone who likes calculus. I have learned a lot and loved what I learned.",
    "Well, you probably need to take this class as a prerequisite for all your science and engineering and math classes. Lauer's the guy to do it with. I kind of started talking like him after the class, literally picking up his rhetoric. He's Canadian - very good English speaker (something you won't find in all the 120 professors).",
    "A basic math course. I would recommend this course especially if it's taught by either Lauer or Frame - I've heard good things about them both. If it's not, be sure to go to problem-solving sections to get help doing the homework or clarifying basic concepts. They're held throughout the week by a few different professors\/ TAs.",
    "Take this course! Especially with Joe if you can. He's a great guy and a great teacher. There are only a few sections of Math 120 that have good teachers, and this is one of them. Joe takes the time to explain certain concepts, and is very helpful if you go during office hourse. Also, this is an inevitable introduction to calculus at Yale. Also, if you got a BC 5, you still need to take calculus if you're premed. Thus, take this course.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student. If you are interested in math or any science you will use this math for the rest of your career and it is fascinating to finally figure out how that AP physics math actually works. If you can get the class with Joe Lauer he is great although I don't really know about any of the other professors. The workload is very manageable and the two midterms and final are also reasonable.",
    "Don't be an idiot- if you can't do math, do not take this course, but if you do GET JOE LAURER. This is his last semester, so take advantage. You're odds of passing exponentially decrease if you don't get him or Frame (or maybe one of the other good TA's scattered around)",
    "It's pretty standard, I think. I would recommend it if you like calculus and haven't yet taken it... the end.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to anyone interested in higher math or physics classes. It's a really interesting subject with a lot of interesting applications. Expect the class to be pragmatic in scope, and not particularly discussion based (although students are encouraged to ask questions about things they don't understand). Good class.",
    "Take this class only if you have to.",
    "Problem sets are doable, and not particularly time consuming. Tests should not be underestimated, but there are no surprises. As with any math class, keep up with the concepts as they come, and you'll be fine.",
    "About what you'd expect for an introduction level college math course. Some very hard topics, some relatively easy ones, a single problem set due every week which could take as little as 1 1\/2 hours or as long as 6 hours to complete. The tests ranged from moderately easy to pretty hard. I'd recommend it if you want to learn math at a higher level, and if you need it for a major, it's definitely not an unbearable or unpleasant class.",
    "I believe Math 120 is the perfect next step after regular calculus. The applications of multivariable are so widespread that anyone and everyone should take the class.",
    "I would recommend the class to someone else - I thoroughly enjoy math, and I thought the concepts were interesting, and that it was taught very well. Homework reinforced things learned in class, though it was certainly necessary to read the book as well. In terms of preparing for midterms and the exam, office hours and the practice exams online were necessary since the exam questions definitely took more thinking than many of the straightforward homework problems. Overall, though, I think the class had pretty reasonable expectations of its students. For people who do not understand math easily, though, I think it would have taken a extremely significant amount of time to understand the material and perform well on the exams. Again, though, I really liked the concepts explored and taught in the course.",
    "Take this course if you like math and are interested in learning multivariable calculus before you proceed to more advanced fields. If you don't like math, you can still do well in the course, but it will drive you to dislike the subject even more. Personally, I would recommend it. I learned quite a bit and definitely strengthened my calculus ability. And if you're going to take it, do it with Lauer! Especially since Frame is leaving after this year.",
    "Take it only if you have a sincere interest in calculus or you have to for certain requirement. The material is very cumulative so make sure you understand each concept when it's taught. The course gets a lot harder after the first midterm so be prepared - know and understand your line integrals!!! Be sure to get help when you need to - you can go to any of the professor's office hours and there are also problem sessions that can help. It's possible to ace every problem set without really learning the concepts so watch out for that.",
    "Overall, it was an okay introductory course. The course is somewhat difficult because many people in this course already took some form of multi-variable calculus already. It's not the most stimulating course, but it does teach you the fundamentals of multi-variable calculus. Go to office hours if you need help. They are extremely helpful! Take this course only if you need too.",
    "Mathematics 120 01 is a challenging course, but it provides the last bit of useful higher-level Calculus for science majors. I would definitely recommend this class to anyone who is looking for a slightly difficult but valuable math class; even having taken the equivalent of Mathematics 120 01 in high school, taking the class at Yale gave me a much better understanding of the course material. I would suggest trying to get Joe Lauer as an instructor, and I've heard Michael Frame is good, as well.",
    "I would definitely recommend Math 120. There are 12 problem sets, 2 midterms, and 1 final exam. The course definitely gets harder throughout the semester. I would absolutely try to take the course with Joseph Lauer.",
    "Mathematics 120 is a natural progression from AP Calculus BC from high school. I would recommend the course to another student just because it teaches a lot of useful math that one will undoubtedly use if one wants to go into the upper sciences. Also, I always disliked math in high school and never found it interesting, but multivariable somehow managed to catch my attention and made me want to take more math courses in the future.",
    "It's a good course if you need to take multivariable. The quality of the instructor can vary drastically, but Joe Lauer is wonderful; he's a clear and funny lecturer. Definitely recommended.",
    "It's a good class, but it's tough. If you study for the tests, you'll probably be fine. If you don't, you won't.",
    "Yes, I enjoyed this course as a mathematics course.",
    "Mathematics 120 is kind of confusing if you have never taken it before, and it is very hard because you cover a lot of material very quickly (especially in the last two weeks) and the course does not fit together until you have learned all the material. I wouldn't recommend this course unless you needed it for a requirement, and even then it is interchangeable with ENAS 151 (but I do not know what that 151 is like).",
    "I would recommend this course only if it is required. I think it needs much improvement, but if you need to take it, take it with Lauer, he was fantastic.",
    "Math 120 is basically using vectors to do calculus in 3-D. You start out with basic vectors and then you get to partial differentiation and multiple integrals. Finally, all of these things are used in the last section on vector fields.",
    "Math 120 was very difficult, even after excelling in BC last year. Take it if you like math enough to spend time doing extra problems. The material is really interesting, but the class is made even more difficult by the few opportunities to show your understanding, i.e. two midterms and a final.",
    "If you haven't taken multivariable before or if, like me, you've taken it but didn't learn anything, this class is right for you. If you've taken and understood multivariable already, please don't take this class. The homework was difficult, but I think that's because I always did it the night before it was due. It would probably help to do the problems that you learned how to approach in class that same night. The midterms are hard, but if you study you can do well. Even if you don't you can replace your midterm grades with your final grade if it's better."
