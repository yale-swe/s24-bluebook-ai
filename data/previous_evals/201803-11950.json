   "comments": [
    "The course moved very quickly and seemed to take a lot of time to go over concepts that didn't need time while more complicated concepts were rushed.",
    "I really liked the course! Maria is a great teacher and I really appreciated how much time she put into helping her students--both inside class and during office hours.",
    "I think that the strengths were definitely having students practice responding in class in the language. I think we did a lot of practicing for the hearing and reading exams but we could do a lot more to help us prepare better but otherwise I really liked how it is structured.",
    "It is very rigorous course that moved very quickly.",
    "Strengths- Very immersive and brought me from having absolutely no Spanish ability to having a good set of basics to help me in the future. Weaknesses- A lot of homework which is nightly so can be hard to balance commitments and plan as you do not know how long it will take until the day before it is due.",
    "The strength of this course is that you have class every day so you cannot help but be engaged. The main weakness is the same thing - it takes up time every day and if you don't do the homework for the day or do some extra memorisation at various points, you will not know what is going on in class. I would have liked more guidance on how to practise\/memorise the material - for instance vocabulary sheets to fill out to practise. I would also have liked for there to be a compulsory opportunity to practise the oral assessment - we had not done anything like it in the course and compulsory practise would have been very helpful.",
    "I think more of the grammar rules should be explained in english. It was difficult to learn the grammar on top of the vocabulary so even as I picked up the vocab I then struggled to put together sentences. The online homework was not particularly helpful."

    "I would recommend this class to anyone who wants to learn Spanish; I feel able to understand some conversations in Spanish and I think that I could converse in Spanish to some extent.",
    "Yes because it really allows you to learn the language at a good pace.",
    "I would say its a good course but ready to be thrown right into Spanish.",
    "Yes, it was well taught and encouraged very fast learning if you wanted to do well in the class.",
    "If they want to learn Spanish, then yes I would.",
    "Yes, it is a good way to learn basic spanish."
