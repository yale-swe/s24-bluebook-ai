    "Moral Skepticism is the perfect Credit\/D extra class. The material is very interesting, but we move through it so quickly that it's hard to really grasp which topics are more or less important\/easily dismissed\/etc. That's fine for a survey course that isn't that serious, but it made me glad that philosophy wasn't my major. Grading verged on ridiculous. I didn't shut up during section and got an A- for that component; my friends who are slightly more reserved did far worse. Kagan is into grade deflation, which I think is silly, and as a consequence everyone Cr\/D's it. Still, a lot of fun - I would take it again in a heartbeat, and I might use more Cr\/Ds on kagan classes in the future.",
    "I don't really recommend Moral Skepticism. I just don't feel I got much out of debating whether or not there can be morality all semester.",
    "I recommend the course. Prof. Kagan has a sense of humor and lectures clearly. He sometimes belabors points, but that trait is not necessarily bad in philosophy courses. Good idea to take a meta-ethics course, especially if one is studying philosophy, though I don't think I would recommend this particular course to advanced philosophy students.",
    "This class sucked. If you're not a philosophy major, don't take it. And even then, I'm not sure you should take it. I've taken other philosophy classes with other professors at Yale and they were great. The professor is so concerned with grading harshly so that his class doesn't seem like a gut class but he's not concerned with making sure that his class is actually good. You don't have to grade unnecessarily harsh to make your students respect your class.",
    "This class was okay, not as good as Shelly's Intro to Ethics as some lectures dwelled on basic points that could be easily grasped from the readings. The material is challenging and worth thinking about.",
    "Shelly Kagan is an engaging lecturer who cares deeply about his class. I don't agree with his teaching philosophy (e.g. essentially grading participation on a curve; prohibiting TFs from playing an active role in sections), but he put together an excellent set of readings. At times the material got repetitive, but I'm sure future iterations of the class will only get better. I will note, parenthetically, that I am being far more generous than how Shelly (and his TFs) graded my work.",
    "dont take it",
    "It was the first time Shelly taught this class, so I've heard it doesn't quite stack up to Death \/ Life. However, I thought the class was engaging and covers the main positions in metaethics and their justifications very well. Oh, and take it CR\/D if you don't want to hate yourself",
    "Absolutely take it! Such a fascinating topic that people often think about but rarely dig deep into. You will tackle all sorts of questions about the nature of morality (Are there moral facts? If so, are they objective? How could they be objective if our moral intuitions are the product of evolution? Is God necessary for morality?) and come out with a much better sense of the strengths and weaknesses of each position. Your own views on the matter will be challenged and refined as you grapple with ideas and arguments that you've probably never considered before. Shelly is an awesome lecturer--super clear and rigorous, but also very funny and exciting--and although I can't speak to the quality of the other discussion sections, mine was fantastic. I've never been so excited to attend a section every week--you get to bat around ideas and debate in a fun, friendly environment for 50 minutes! If you're worried about Shelly's grading, take it Cr\/D; it's so worth it.",
    "I would summarize it by saying that lecture is very interesting (if you are into philosophy) and the readings accessible, but it deals with second-order morality questions, so I would recommend it if that is something that will not bore you. I would also recommend taking the class Credit\/D\/Fail (as most people I know did) because the material is interesting but the papers are graded harshly.",
    "If you're looking to learn a bit about metaphysics in a low-stress environment, this is your chance. You won't regret it!",
    "I really liked this class. Shelly did a good job to address some of the skeptical worries that a student would have about ethics. He is a great lecturer, the readings are not too much work and the essays were interesting and thought provoking.",
    "Dude, take this class. Especially if you're a physics\/math\/CS type of person, the logical thinking developed in this course is actually totally up your alley. It's not a lot of work. The readings are generally short, and there's only three 5-page papers in total. As a freshman who has never taken a philosophy class before and generally sucks at the humanities, I thought I'd get wrecked by the supposedly hard grading, but it really wasn't that bad for me. However, I would recommend starting off Cred\/D\/Fail.",
    "Take this course if you are interested in metaethics. This course is a challenge. Certainly not an easy A, but if you put in the work you should walk away happy even if you don't get a great grade. The readings are fascinating, and Shelly is an engaging lecturer.",
    "I think shopping the first few lectures will give you a good sense of what the rest of the course will be like, except I was hoping for some more comprehensive view of the topic by the end, but I feel like the topic was too broad or maybe too disjointed such that I felt like I didn't have any meaningful new views. Also the arguments were interesting, but often involved premises most would reject firsthand. I feel like most of the arguments then failed to change your opinion on the topic.",
    "Everyone should take at least one course with Shelly Kagan while at Yale. Why not Moral Skepticism?",
    "TAKE IT CR\/D\/F. I should've read all the previous reviews. CR\/D\/F, and you still have the option to convert later. Shelly is a good lecturer, but his grading policy will damage your GPA.",
    "By no means an easy intro philosophy course. The readings can be a little dense, and the essays are grading is pretty rough, but it certainly does well to expose you to the subject matter of moral philosophy and philosophy as a whole. Shelley Kagan is a great lecturer, and the readings, while dense, are manageable. Would recommend if you're interested in moral philosophy and don't mind spending a lot of time working on five page papers.",
    "I would only take this class if you are very confident speaking in section. Section is run as a discussion, with no one raising hands and the TA speaking minimally. Shelly will not give you a participation grade above a D unless you contribute meaningfully more than one or two times per section.",
    "A frustrating but often enjoyable class. Shelly treats it as obvious that objective moral facts exist and dismisses in just a couple of classes the evolutionary objection which is accepted by most scientific fields today as dogma. Many other objections were straw men-- clearly implausible objections that filled time-- while the only objections that really mattered were quickly refuted. Still, he is very fun to listen to and I generally loved attending lecture, even if I ultimately was not convinced by the argument of the course. (Side note: I considered ignoring the reviews and starting this course for a grade instead of CR\/D. I am glad that I did not. It is very hard to get good grades in this class. For perspective, I have tons of experience writing argument and have a GPA of above 3.9. I was getting low Bs in this course after working hard on essays. Nobody in our section got an A-range participation grade. You should please start this course CR\/D.)",
    "Take it for a taste of philosophy.",
    "If you have an interest in philosophy, or you might want to know what philosophy might be about, then take this course. Of course, start out on Credit\/D\/Fail, since grading is not necessarily the easiest. Regardless, taking one of Kagan's classes seems like a must-do before graduation.",
    "Even if you've never wondered about an objective morality, this course could be eye-opening. If you are willing to engage with arguments and think critically, and you enjoy these things, you will learn a lot and have a bit of fun. Meta-ethics is a playground for interesting arguments, and while it may not affect how you live your life, it will give a new perspective on the essence of morality. Shelly is a great lecturer, but he sometimes doesn't do justice to both sides of the argument. That doesn't mean you won't enjoy a fantastic course. If you are terribly worried about your grade, then starting the class CR\/D isn't a bad idea.",
    "PHIL 174 is an interesting course that resonates well for many but not all people. I would definitely recommend trying the class, but know that not everyone stays past the first week. I had no background in philosophy before this course, and I feel that I gained a good amount of familiarity and skill, but it also did take quite a bit of work to get to that point.",
    "Want to figure out why you think things are right or wrong? Want to learn how to write? Want to learn how to think through arguments? Take the class already!",
    "The course is a great course. It taught me how to approach the basic questions of meta-ethics and what the possible answers to them are. It taught me how to approach questions in philosophy in general. I think that, because it was the first time it was offered, it has some structural weaknesses, but it is a thoroughly enjoyable course. The grading demands a lot from you, but the payoff is worth it.",
    "I would recommend this class to a student who is willing to put in the time. It is a fascinating topic, the reasoning behind morality, and Shelley Kagan is an excellent lecturer. I would recommend taking one of his course at some point while at Yale. That said, I took this course expecting it to be an interesting and not-overwhelming supplement to my already full course-load. This is not a gut, to do well you really have to take time on the assignments and the readings. It was a bit more time consuming than I expected, and the grading is pretty tough. If I could go back, I would probably take this course credit\/d\/fail and enjoy it better. Still, classes like these are why I came to Yale so I would certainly recommend it. Shop it at least!",
    "Overall, I found Moral Skepticism to be a very interesting class, and a great deal of fun. It's not very much work; there are three papers over the course of the semester, and while admittedly the papers are graded rather steeply, I didn't think the grading was as obscenely harsh as some people made it sound. I'd say, if you're interested in morality or philosophy, take the class. The lectures are very fun, and it won't add a lot of work to your workload, but it will give you a great deal to think about, especially if you enjoy thinking about\/discussing these kinds of ideas.",
    "I would recommend it, but he prepared to talk about seemingly unimportant and useless things. Go in with an open mind.",
    "Moral Skepticism was a wonderful introductory philosophy course. Shelly is an enthralling lecturer and effectively laid out a broad overview of various arguments for and against objective morality. I thought the arguments the course covered were all quite compelling and intellectually provoking. Despite not having taken a prior philosophy course, I found most of the material quite accessible; Shelly does a good job of distilling jargon and abstract concepts with intuitive examples. Shelly's open invitation to take questions in class was quite nice, and made the lecture more engaging than typical lecture classes. His de facto office hours after class were always a great opportunity to continue those questions. I thought he perhaps could have connected the lectures with the assigned reading a little more explicitly; I started out doing the readings fairly consistently before each lecture but eventually only completed the readings for the topics that I wanted clarified (or was more interested in) after the lectures. The lectures themselves sometimes dwelled on certain topics for too long, while skimmed past others too quickly. I thought the papers were a bit open-ended, which had both pros (provided leeway to explore one of the topics that I was personally more interested in) and cons (the lack of structure was a bit daunting; the 3 papers all being open-ended meant that I get by with really understanding only 3 topics while neglecting the other topics we covered in class). I thought the grading was somewhat reasonable; if you read Shellys guidelines for writing papers and get feedback from your TA before each paper, I think it is fairly easy to get at least a B on the papers. The challenge is getting an A, which Shelly claims to reserve for papers that are not only well argued and articulated, but add something exceptional (which my TA interpreted to mean novel ideas) - thats a pretty high standard to have for an intro philosophy course. Overall, Id strongly recommend taking a philosophy class with Shelly - its a vital part of a complete Yale College undergraduate experience.",
    "Great class! Take it Credit\/D if you know what's good for your GPA. Trust me. Nobody gets above a C+ for most of the papers. They grade harshly and don't really teach you how to write (which makes 0 sense). However, the content is thought-provoking and very interesting to tangle with."
