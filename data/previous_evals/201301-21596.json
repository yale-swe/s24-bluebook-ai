   "comments": [
    "Interesting class, not extremely difficult, Prof Handelsman is very straightforward with the information, what she says in lecture is whats on the test. If you study and pay attention, you can get a good grade easily.",
    "Yes! And if you need a science credit, then definitely yes!",
    "I would recommend itto a student who does not already have a strong background in the biological sciences as it may become tedious for such a student. I had a strong understanding of biology from high school and I enjoyed the class because the information was very accessible as a result, but for students who are currently studying similar subjects I may recommend another class which would provide a bit more diversity to their college experience. Overall the class was a positive experience which I would certainly recommend to a student in a similar situation as mine.",
    "Good basic biology course, with some interesting insights from a professor who is an expert in the field. If you have any kind of advanced biology background (e.g. AP Bio), you'll probably be bored, but for students with limited knowledge of biology and an interest in genetics and bacteria, this is a good course. Not a gut, but the more effort you put into paying attention and drawing connections, the more you'll get out of the class.",
    "Interdisciplinary course that brings together genetics and ecology.",
    "A genetics course which explores, in particular, the vast and profound effects of microbial life and the environment on human life.",
    "Really amazing. Teaches you to think in a new way about science and current issues. A great, engaging science credit. Tests are tough and take a lot of studying. But so interesting, and I always enjoyed coming to lecture.",
    "Great class that would suit those who have never or haven't touched science in a while. You can apply what you learn directly to real life, so this class is never boring.",
    "It is a great science credit for non-science majors. Definitely not a gut - but if you do the readings, and go to class, it won't be too hard. There are lots of small assignment, which for some could be tedious, but I believe are actually a great way to remember the concepts. Sometimes it took a while to understand some of the topics, but Prof. Handelsman is great at making them as comprehensible as possible!",
    "Great.",
    "I would recommend this course to other students interested in gaining a science credit. Interesting and useful material",
    "A good science credit for both science and non-science majors - it's not rocket science, but not rocks for jocks either; it's not too difficult (if you prepare ahead) but you feel like you're learning something, too. The class relates concepts of genetics to relatable and global issues like climate change, disease, genetic manipulation, and agriculture. Prof Handelsman's gig is scientific literacy, and that's exactly what the course delivers. Tests and exams are not the sort in which you regurgitate your answers - they require some careful thought.",
    "Sure. Honestly, this is a class just for the science credit. If you pay attention, study well, and participate, you can achieve a fair grade. If I didn't know about the bad reputation of other bio classes, I would want to take another after this class.",
    "Yes! Interesting material, famous professor, science credit.",
    "I would recommend this course.",
    "If you have to or if you want a random smattering of information!",
    "As a history major, I can say that I truly enjoyed the entire course. This is not a gut class, so (as I mentioned earlier) be prepared to do work. That being said, the class was entirely manageable and it wasn't difficult to comprehend the material."
