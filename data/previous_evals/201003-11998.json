   "comments": [
    "I really liked this course. It is an excellent option for history majors looking for another non-western credit! I previously knew nothing about Japan in this period, and was worried it might get dull because we focused on a relatively narrow window of time, but Professor Botsman kept it very interesting. Reading is manageable, and to be honest, only relates to lecture about half the time, so you don't even have to do it all. Interesting, fairly easy history lecture.",
    "Absolutely! Great overview of Japanese history from the Tokugawa period onwards. Definitely take it! Thought it was one of the best history courses I've taken at Yale. Liked the outlines for lecture. Professor Botsman is a great lecturer!",
    "Take this class if you're interested in how Japan had grown to become a major power. The course covers a timespan roughly between the early 19th century and the Japanese annexation of Korea in 1910. We can see the clear transformation of Japan from a secluded country run by warlords, into a dynamic global power united under the Emperor's rule.",
    "This was an excellent class! Botsman is a fantastic, engaging lecturer, and the workload is very reasonable. The information we learned was also interesting, especially for someone who knows very little about Japanese history (or any Asian history at all). A great class to fulfill your ROW, and a great class to take in general.",
    "Take it! The material is really interesting. The reading is a pretty standard amount for a history class. And Professor Botsman is both very funny and a great lecturer.",
    "A very good history lecture. Professor Botsman is an engaging lecturer, and he does a good job presenting the material. The course is completely standard in its layout, with a midterm, midterm paper, and final, plus section. Highly recommended for those focused on Chinese history but seeking a better view of East Asia from 1850-1910s.",
    "Prof makes the course, but TA can break it. Definitely get Jonathan if you can. My TA was definitely a harder grader on the tests than every other history TA at Yale.",
    "I highly recommend History 303. Not only is it a rest-of-the-world course, it is extremely interesting on its own right. This era of Japanese history is often overlooked, but is very important to understanding what Japan would do leading up to World War II. It's also good to see a non-European country not simply collapse in the presence of Western nations and come out of their interactions better off. Professor Botsman is an incredible lecturer and packs a ton of information in 50 minutes. His tests are drawn directly from lectures and he provides lecture guides that are invaluable for studying. He also adjusts the weights of assignments in order to maximize your chance of doing well, which means the class is not stressful at all. Take it!",
    "Yes. It's a very well taught course on a very important period of history. Whether it's your area of interest or you're just looking for a rest of the world course, it's worth it. Botsman is knowledgeable, nice, and entertaining.",
    "Hist 303 is a good lecture class covering Japanese history from 1650s to 1900s, but focusing a lot more on the 19th century and the Meiji Restoration. I don't think that grade distribution was well organized or very fair, they were very harsh on the paper and midterm. but overall, an interesting class.",
    "This was a fantastic class. Prof. Botsman is a great lecturer. Attending this class is like listening to a well made documentary about Japan. I absolutely hated it when I had to miss lecture. The material is also fascinating. I highly recommend it.",
    "I took the class because I was looking for an other part of the world history credit, but I'd recommend it to anyone interested in the material. The lectures are engaging, clear, and easy to follow. I learned a lot, and especially enjoyed learning about Japan's relationship with the West. The class is pretty straightforward: just show up for lecture and study the terms for the exams. There is not too much reading, either. The professor is also very nice.",
    "This is one of those classes that I took because I needed the geographical requirement, but I'm so pleased that I took it. Not a very challenging workload, but the class still gives you a strong background in the formation of modern Japan in the 2nd half of the 19th century. Amazing professor makes it totally worthwhile.",
    "I would recommend it.",
    "I highly, highly recommend this class. For someone coming in from the perspective of studying Japan, it does an excellent job of situating Japanese history in the context of the larger themes of history, highlighting the contributions Japan's particular circumstances make to our understanding of feudalism, modernization, colonialism, and historical international relations (among others). From the perspective of someone studying history, it's an excellent introduction to two major periods of Japanese history (Tokugawa and Meiji) and the impact our understanding of those times has upon the world today. Besides that, Professor Botsman is a wonderful lecturer, and it's a really fun class. Take it!",
    "If you have any interest in history, Japan, historiography, revolutions, or bad jokes about hairstyles, take this class. The class focuses on about the half decade from 1850 to 1900, the end of the Tokugawa era of feudalism, replaced by the Meiji era and a drive towards Japanese imperialism.Professor Botsman is new to Yale but an excellent professor with a great sense of humor. He crams a lot into every lecture but is easy to follow and creates useful handouts of the main points. He occassionally deviates from the more linear series of lectures (\"major person led to major event and then stuff happened\" style of history) to provide a less centrally relevant but still really interesting lecture on thematic elements uniting the period: stepping back and analyzing Japanese commoner's views of events through pop culture of the day, changing relationships to shinto and buddhism, etc. So in total, the lectures cover both the factual events and a much more impressionistic understanding of what the era felt like.Sometimes a lot of reading (but what history class doesn't?) although its possibly to squeeze by picking out the most relevant parts.",
    "A great introduction to a fascinating and important topic. If you like Botsman's style (and give him a chance, I wasn't thrilled with the first lecture either) and you're interested in Japan, you'll love this class.",
    "One of the best history lectures I've ever taken. Addresses an extremely interesting topic thoroughly and in an entertaining way. The readings and workload aren't too heavy, but the lectures are totally full of information. You have to learn a lot of names, dates, and terms, but in return you get a good understanding of a fascinating instance of non-Western modernization and industrialization from political, economic, social, and cultural standpoints. Professor Botsman is a great lecturer and teacher. I'd definitely recommend this class.",
    "A great class! Take it! Japan is really interesting (I knew nothing going in) and I like how the themes interact with broader historical ideas. And Prof. Botsman is so cool and a good prof.",
    "A great rest-of-the-world class. Botsman is a really great professor, funny, engaging and an overall nice person. The subject matter is interesting and the workload was rather light. Take this class!",
    "Definitely. A great introductory history class to a topic that many people might not know. As a senior, I found it pretty simple--almost too simple at times (the material, that is. The class is graded as a standard history lecture--not too hard). Would be a great history class for an underclassman or someone who really wants to know about Japanese history. A great course overall.",
    "Really interesting outlook on the events that preceded WWII in Japan, taught by an excellent and super engaging professor. Course is organized and paced well; exams aren't difficult. Take it, especially if you're interested in Japan, but even if you're not."
