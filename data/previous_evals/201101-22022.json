    "Great way to explore a topic in depth and tailor the physics curriculum to what interests you most. I didn't do a huge amount of work day to day, but I am working really hard on my final paper.",
    "best class. take it. take it. FIND A GOOD ADVISOR. what makes a good advisor? Someone you're really comfortable with. trust your gut.",
    "Definitely!",
    "Yes. 472 is a great way to get credit for exploring research. The requirements for the \"class\" are minimal, and they help you in structuring your work. Prof. Barrett is very helpful and will work with you to figure out any issues in the process. Picking a good adviser and lab is very important. If you can talk to any other undergrads who have been in that lab, it could help you. Also, try to meet the person\/people you will work with directly- likely a grad student or postdoc.",
    "Definitely recommend it if you would like to work in an independent project",
    "I would definitely recommend Physics 472 to another student. Learning to do research is extremely important for graduate school. This course will teach you how to approach research problems and how to write and talk about your research. It is a very rewarding class.",
    "Very good! Of course, I imagine it depends on each person's individual research project, but I enjoyed spending time on mine and felt I learned a lot by the end. Also, it's quite necessary to get your physics degree.",
    "It's a great independent research course that's well advised."
