    "A fairly fast-paced introduction to reading Homer, which is significantly more difficult than the Attic texts from L3. I would recommend it to someone who is fairly comfortable reading a page or two of Plato a night. Homer is definitely enjoyable, though the grammar and forms can seem a little random. Professor LeVen is great. Definitely more work than L1-L3, but still very manageable.",
    "Intro to Homer is an introduction to the style of Homer by reading selections of the Odyssey. The learning curve can be a bit steep at first \u0097 Homer's Greek is weird \u0097\u00a0but it's definitely worth it to interact without the complexities of translation with one of the oldest texts humanity has produced.",
    "Course is absolutely recommended---if you're truly prepared for it and know what you're getting into.",
    "Good class. You read some Homer. Not much more difficult than L3"
