    "I'd recommend this class not only to comp lit students but to students in other literary disciplines. It's a nice survey of the history of intellectual trends in the field as well as an opportunity to share ideas with people working in different areas. There is exposure to many kinds of ideas as well as methodologies that would be useful to any student of literature.",
    "Yes, it's a good look into literary theory",
    "Yes, if they are interested in the history of Comparative Literature. For a broader look at literary criticism, I would suggest a survey course.",
    "I would recommend this course to any humanities student looking for a good intro to Comp Lit. It would be helpful in many disciplines."

   "comments": [
    "This was a useful grounding in comparative literature methodologies, more or less chronologically as they have developed\/taken precedence. Knowing these methodologies is useful not only for completing my own work but for understanding work done by others. I feel that my comfort with philology is much expanded, and I am more convinced of its importance. I think the work I did in this class will help strengthen the backbone of my method which I will apply to all my writing, including my dissertation.",
    "An introduction to material that I needed to become acquainted with. And I'm sure I'll return to some of these texts in future research.",
    "The course was very helpful since it introduced me several important texts that will definitely contribute to my further research in other comparative literature courses I will take.",
    "I don't yet know how it will contribute to my dissertation, but it was useful for my research in my other courses. The assignments that required us to follow a certain model of criticism were excellent exercises for thinking about different ways of writing generally."
