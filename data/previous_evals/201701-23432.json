    "This class is very difficult, but I've learned a lot. If you use the resources Reza provides you can succeed in the class.",
    "Great course to learn how to use excel to do the simulation.",
    "Great course for modeling. The in-class labs were very helpful in learning VBA.",
    "It's a great class for learning the material it promises. However, as a result, it's a very tailored class and is very straightforward in how to code in VBA\/Excel. Working on the class project allows for a little creativity, but not much.",
    "Strength. Learned so much about VBA and modeling in excel, coming from a background of almost zero experience. Very satisfied with my skills now. Weakness. None.",
    "Great topics coverage in terms of modeling methods.",
    "Strengths include learning to build various models and learning how these models might run in real world research. Weaknesses include the limitations and lack of transferability of the skills we were taught. The class did not empower or teach students to independently build models, but just to replicate code written by the professor, which limits the application of this learning to formats that diverge from what we learned in class.",
    "Fantastic course for hands-on excel modeling skills."

    "Instructor: Reza Yaesoubi \u00a0Very attentive, helpful, and responsive.",
    "Instructor: Reza Yaesoubi \u00a0Very straightforward and clear.",
    "Instructor: Reza Yaesoubi \u00a0Great!",
    "Instructor: Reza Yaesoubi \u00a0Very kind instructor. Very knowledgeable and responsive. Taught in a way that is easy to follow and very comprehensive, and builds your skills from the ground up. Excellent instructor. I would recommend for everyone who uses excel.",
    "Instructor: Reza Yaesoubi \u00a0Reza is very helpful and informative.",
    "Instructor: Reza Yaesoubi \u00a0Reza cares a lot and is tremendously knowledgeable. Unfortunately, the format of the class is such that he is mostly lecturing on Excel techniques which makes it hard to engage students in conversation, despite the fact that the class is virtually seminar-sized. It would be great to better balance that dynamic in future years. Nonetheless, it was really great to learn from Reza.",
    "Instructor: Reza Yaesoubi \u00a0Strengths: covered a lot of important ground. Weaknesses: covered too much material too quickly.",
    "Instructor: Reza Yaesoubi \u00a0Very organized!"

   "comments": [
    "Yes, take this class if you want more Excel skills.",
    "Great course to learn how to use excel to do the simulation.",
    "This is a great course if you want to focus on modeling in public health.",
    "Take this course if you want to learn how to model decision trees\/Monte Carlo\/Markov simulations in Excel. The class will certainly teach you that, but as a result, it gets a little rote and mundane.",
    "Take it! But only if you're willing to actually learn VBA and get dirty. Some people treat it like another biostats course and just copy-paste codes without understanding it. Those people don't get much out of it and will be punished with hours and hours of frustration and error messages ...",
    "Great introduction to healthcare modeling. Will recommend it to fellow students.",
    "This is a great course for learning Excel, especially VBA. That said, it's worth noting that the course is not necessarily the most real-world applicable. How many jobs use Excel as the primary means of analyzing information? Nonetheless, really great foundational skills emphasized, an especially great follow-up to Paltiel's \"Cost-Effectiveness Analysis and Decision Making\" or for anyone in the Modeling Concentration. Well-paced. Note: this class will be WAY easier if you're working on a PC, as compared to a Mac. A PC should virtually be a requirement in my opinion.",
    "I think learning objectives for the class need to be clarified. If students are supposed to know how to code in VBA, this class did not accomplish this. I can however now use Professor Yaesoubi's code to run nearly identical models, but is this really realistic? The course was interesting and I learned how models are built and run, but I did not necessarily learn how to build them myself.",
    "Hands-on course to implement the material learned in Cost-effectiveness and Policy Modeling. Great for learning excel modeling\/VBA"
