   "comments": [
    "If you are a math major (or similar), the first few weeks will be painfully boring. However, you will learn new material once the course gets through the basics of set theory, and it's worth it to stick around - it's one of the more enjoyable, relaxed classes I've taken for the math major.The workload is very low-stress (in terms of no exams) - we had five problem sets worth 60% and one final problem set worth 40% of the grade. If you are used to doing rigorous mathematical proofs, you'll be fine.",
    "This course is challenging. Conceptually, the material is a bit difficult to grasp, especially if you don't really understand the importance of mathematical logic. \"So, why is this important?\" is a question I've been asked a number of times after sharing my last lecture with afriend. To be honest, I can't provide an answer. The course is really cool but the subject matter is really information for information's sake. If you are not fascinated by the subject, I would not recommend taking this course lightly. If you are up for the challenge and love the feeling of cracking a really difficult and complication proof, then go for it.",
    "I cannot rave enough about this class. It was just wonderful, fun, incredible. First of all, I don't hesitate to say the professor is one of the best and fun instructors you can ever find. Second, the course material was fascinating, creating a whole grand narrative as you go along the semester (beware, once you move from the sentential logic to the meta-first order logic part things get tougher so make sure to keep up with materials). Psets are relatively easy (max two hours a week), and the final problem set took me about 20 hours. I loved it.",
    "Definitely take it if you want an introduction to proofs and logic.",
    "The formalization of stuff we did in First-Order Logic. If you are into logic, or eventually want to take computability, then definitely take this class. It is taught very well, and isn't a lot of work, especially if you have a math background (I presume)As a philosophy student who didn't go on with math after high school, I really enjoyed the change of pace in terms of the type of work I was doing. Instead of reading and writing essays like a normal philosophy class, you just have to worry about understanding the material (by reading or going to lecture etc) and then doing the psets, which more often feel like doing puzzles than homework.Definitely not much about any of the \"deep\" philosophical questions surrounding the logic and its formalization, but definitely a prereq if you are interested in these questions.",
    "A good class to take if you are interested in logic from a philosophy or a math standpoint. Very good if you are looking to improve your proof-writing abilities.",
    "Phil 267 is a great class. If you're interested in logic or any kind of rigorous philosophy you should definitely take this class. Sun-Joo will really help you understand the material, so go to lecture. Definitely more difficult and a higher workload than 115, but manageable and mostly fun work.",
    "Yes, but be wary that it's really a math course, not philosophy.",
    "I would not really recommend it to anyone (unless, of course, it is a requirement for your major). While it is well taught, math logic is difficult stuff, and you often have to rely on very few examples to complete the psets. Furthermore, this semester we did not get our psets back until very late, so I was always unsure of whether I was doing something correctly or not until much later (the textbook contains no solutions and only few examples). It was also discomforting to see so many of my peers drop out of this course--either the students did not put in the time required for this course (doubtful, many of these students have had experience with upper level mathematics, comp sci, and philosophy), or proofs at Yale just aren't taught very well. I actually think this class should either meet three times a week or for over an hour twice a week, since the TF sections, however well-intentioned they were, did not help much.",
    "Sun-Joo Shin is a great professor, but the subject matter is very, very difficult. I wouldn't recommend taking this course unless you absolutely need to, since it will take a lot of time to learn the material. Even if you consider yourself to be a quantitative thinker, it is still extremely difficult material.",
    "I would only recommend this course if you have a background in math and philosophy and a genuine interest in pursuing this subject in detail. This is not an easy QR credit, but the material can be engaging, if you put in the time and effort. Professor Shin really knows her stuff, but the course is focused on specific material, and its difficult to imagine how one would apply or use this material again, if one is not planning on studying Math Logic or Analytic Philosophy further.",
    "The course is pretty simple at the beginning, but about half-way through the semester, the material suddenly starts getting more and more difficult. Be prepared for the end to be hard, even if the beginning is easy.",
    "Yes! You really understand Logic, what it is and what it aims to do as a field. you learn so much more than what you did in Phil 115",
    "Tough class if you haven't taken 115. Interesting material, and the lecture notes are particularly well done. Sun-Joo is very funny and I enjoyed her humor in lecture. Jessica was a fantastic and very helpful TA, giving us more of her time than even I thought would be reasonable.A major annoyance of the course was the slow return of psets, and the rather inefficient grading. Psets were often returned without comments, and separate comments would be emailed, without reference to particular lines of our work...this made it very hard to learn from mistakes. For the entire Final Pset period, we were missing two prior psets, which made referring to prior work and understanding of the material unnecessarily onerous.",
    "Yes",
    "Great class! Sun Joo is super funny and her lectures are very organized. Every lecture you get a very detailed printout of all the notes, which is a true luxury. The handouts are easy to follow, and the material is very interesting.",
    "I would recommend this if and only if you are interested in the subject matter. It's quite neat to see the underpinnings of first-order logic. Unlike other math and science professors, Professor Shin does try to engage students, but I'd bet that's not enough to keep people interested who are not interested in the subject matter, though. So if you want to learn what you need to know to start understanding G\u00c3\u00b6del's work, take it.",
    "Maybe... but only if you are confident that this is the sort of thing you want to be doing.",
    "Mathematical logic is a fantastic course. Professor Shin knows the material and answers questions very clearly. She's also extremely nice and approachable. Go to her office hours for any help on the material or just a casual conversation with a very interesting person. Some people complain that her accent makes it hard to follow lecture. Being Korean, I'm probably not speaking for everyone when I say I didn't have that problem.",
    "If you like very formal math and proofs - great class! This is not a philosophy class, if you were wondering. On the upside, the proofs won't be difficult. So, in short, it's a fun proofs class, but you won't learn anything new or revolutionary. That said, the lectures are very clear, and the teacher's handouts are so amazing that you don't *really* need to come to class... On the other hand, class is the only place you can get them, as they're not online.",
    "Sure. Math Logic is not a hard class if you are a math major and is a good way to do a math-major area requirement together with set theory in the Fall. Professor Shin is very entertaining and wise, and a pleasure to learn from. The material is fun, a lot like Set theory with bits from comp sci 201 logic. It can get rather abstract\/ notation heavy at times but that is an essential part to studying logic. Note that the final assignment at the end of the semester is rather long and takes a lot of time.. be prepared to have to write it during the last week of classes when you will probably have several other assignments at the same time.",
    "No. This course needs to improve the grading, resources offered to students and structure before I would feel comfortable recommending it to someone, even if he\/she were interested in the material.",
    "If you don't have much background in proof-based math, I don't know what to say, but if you do, I will say that this class starts off very slowly. It does get more interesting as the course progresses - the compactness and completeness theorems are fascinating, but I definitely found myself bored early on.",
    "This course was very interesting. Professor Shin is quite engaging, very knowledgeable, and (though she pretends she doesn't care) a very good teacher. She moves quickly and expects you to keep up, but the homework is very fair (six problem sets are the only things that make up your grade, but they make sense and are long enough to give a good representation of how you understood the material). I liked this a lot since I am a math and philosophy major, but keep in mind this is very different from PHIL 115! They make these out to be a sort of series, but this course is much more rigorous.",
    "Very interesting class, which I enjoyed having to do the work for. But I don't know what I learned. Logic feels so detached from everything else.",
    "Excellent course! A really interesting exploration of the foundations of math and logic. I skipped First Order Logic and went straight to this course, which was definitely the right decision, especially if you've done one or two proof based math courses before: I had to work a little on translations but apart from that, I didn't feel like I was behind because I didn't have First Order.There aren't many problem sets so you have to be self-motivated to keep on top of the work. Lecture is often Sun Joo talking in general terms about concepts, but the handouts are detailed and clear. I'd recommend reviewing them after class to make sure you understand what's going on.",
    "This class is very different from first order logic. It requires a real understanding of the philosophical concepts. The proofs are very much different. It picks up after the 2nd pset so make sure to get a good idea of what it's like early on so if you need to drop it, you can dos oearly."
