    "theory behind linear models",
    "Assuming that you've taken Linear Algebra before, this class dives deep into the basis of linear models. It's pretty helpful in understanding the math behind regressions from a perspective of linear algebra. Too many times do people just throw around the phrases of regression or linear models without understanding what is actually happening in the background \/ the math behind these methods.",
    "I furthered my statistical knowledge and learned about linear models.",
    "Learned theory behind linear models and practical implementation in R.",
    "a really great overview of the subject - interesting and useful material, comprehensive but not overwhelming",
    "I got much better at linear algebra and learned how linear models problems can be visualized and solved using linear algebra.",
    "I learned a lot in this course about vectors, random vectors, and regression.",
    "Visualizing linear models",
    "I didn't have high expectations for this class coming in, by which I mean I really didn't know how much you could do with linear models. I was really impressed, however, and found the material to be interesting. The class basically spends a semester explaining why linear regressions do what they do and what the geometry\/statistics underneath them entails.",
    "I learned to perform linear model fitting and inference, such as ANOVA and multiple linear regression.",
    "Learned linear modeling theory from a very visually-oriented linear algebra perspective. There are few courses\/resources that take this approach, but it's ultimately a great benefit once you learn to make it past the initial hurdles. Many things feel intuitive after being able to see linear regression model as an orthogonal projection of random variables onto a subspace.",
    "linear model theory - least squares, hypothesis testing",
    "Linear Algebra applied to statistics. A rigorous, engaging, and welcoming course.",
    "This class was a deep dive into the field of linear models and linear algebra more generally, that really focused in on a thorough examination of a subject often reference but never explored in other classes."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Brinda's intriguing pedagogy and great skills as a lecturer are probably the two biggest strengths of the class. He favors the \"Anki\" method of learning mathematics, and I found that it really increased retention and learning for me. It is something I will take with me to other quantitative classes as well. A weakness is probably the pacing of the class -- Brinda, in an effort to make sure that everyone is on the same page, agonizes about really small steps when going through derivations which was something I found frustrating at times. On the whole, the class was my favorite of the semester and probably the most useful class I have taken at Yale in terms of being foundational to my statistics education.",
    "The strengths are that Dr. Brinda is an amazing teacher with great passion, articulation, and engagement in the course. The homeworks are useful and complementary to the theory in class. No weaknesses. Legendary class with a great professor",
    "This course did not have any perceivable weaknesses to me. It's fair, grading is very fast and clear (as well as fair), the midterm and quizzes are fair, the textbook builds on itself in a very natural way, Prof. Brinda is excellent. Solid course.",
    "Strenghts: Dr. Brinda is a great instructor who cares a lot about his students weaknesses: Very hard to get a grasp of if your linear algebra background is not up to par (which most people's aren't because of Yale's linalg curriculum)",
    "No weaknesses. Perhaps we could also do a real-life application project too? But aside from that, this class was great and very well taught.",
    "A great, straightforward textbook that is a lot easier to digest than other classes. The class could be a little more friendly to those who haven't done R.",
    "The first half of the course was amazing, but at the start of the second half, it was difficult to see how the subject matter could fit into our previous discussion. Refining the approach to cheaper 5 of the textbook, specifically, would be helpful: we should know that the distribution topics may be difficult to visualize and seem difficult algebraically, but that the distributions will all fit in by chapter 6.",
    "strengths: course is well presented, the book is beautifully written and the topic is very important. professor is very excited about the material, which helps make the lectures well-organized. weaknesses: not a major weakness, but grading scale could be improved. sometimes, when assignments are graded our of 3 or 4, 1 point cuts could account to major point cuts out of 100 scale.",
    "Strengths: This was a great class. I love how the homework and quizzes and textbook were structured for ultimate learning, I think the professor did a really good job with laying out the class. Weaknesses: The final exam was ONLY on the last chapter of the course, which we had spent around a week and a half on. Unfortunately for me individually it was worse as I was away from school (my grandmother died) but despite reading other students' notes, spending a long time reading the book and doing everything I could to catch up on the material, the final exam was much harder than any of the homeworks or quizzes and will likely bring down my final grade a lot despite me getting 100's on all the quizzes and A's on almost all the homeworks as well.",
    "I feel the R component is more significant than what I thought. You really need to be well versed in it. I feel the homeworks were certainly applications of what we learned, however, it was hard to do at times. We didn't practiced problem solving of what we learned in class. Professor Brinda was great.however, very theoretical. Quizzes were weekly but very easy. If you have a hard workload, and not a very strong math background, do not take the class!",
    "Professor Brinda is awesome! His goal is truly for you to learn. Grade weighting can really screw you over though, although it is honestly very fair. The weekly quizzes are great as they help you stay on track and not fall behind on work.",
    "Very good class - but there is some lack of continuity between assignments and the material taught in class.",
    "I thought this was a very well done class. I thought the lectures were well taught, the quizzes were a helpful check, and the homework was useful. I would say I was disappointed in the number of opportunities to distinguish your grade, however. The quizzes and homework are basically participation, so it's only the midterm.",
    "The course does a good job of being self-contained: almost all of the prerequisite knowledge, such as probability or linear algebra is covered during the course itself. While it is still highly recommended that you take these prerequisite classes, the class does a thorough review of the important material that will be relevant for the class, something that is often done in a haphazard manner, or not at all in many other higher level classes. On the other hand, the lectures were often somewhat disconnected from the actual assignments, and the textbook often lagged significantly behind the lectures, rather than being prepared ahead of time. This meant that it was difficult to review my notes, as anything that was unclear in class I had to wait until office hours to get clarified.",
    "amazing professor.",
    "*Strengths:* This really was an excellent course in linear model theory. Professor Brinda really knows the topic inside-out and is always excited coming to class. The lectures are always very engaging, and he's second-to-none at explaining most topics. If he feels like he failed to cover something in a lecture, he'll circle back to it in the following lecture to really try and fix any ambiguity. He wants everyone to do well, and really makes an effort to make sure everyone is able to understand. Ask questions in class! He's always happy to clarify. Also go to office hours! Sometimes the psets can be very tricky (in part because prof tends to have a unique way of thinking of things) but he's extremely welcoming and helpful at office hours. Midterm and final exams were tough, but for the most part they were hard but fair. He told us what to study going in, and he kept to that when making the questions. Also he wrote our entire textbook from scratch in Latex\/RMD this semester, and it really is an excellent resource with clear explanations, examples, and diagrams. It's clear prof put ~a lot~ of work in creating this class from scratch this semester, into the course it is now. *Weaknesses:* I thought the memorization aspect at the beginning was a bit high, and could end up being extremely time consuming, but in retrospect, I do see how it ultimately reinforced material to the point where I feel like I've really internalized many of the core concepts. That said, I'm unsure if the same could be said had we just had longer psets that required us to derive said concepts (this was addressed in part in the psets, but as prof said, he wanted psets to be shorter and instead try the memorization angle). There were a few topics towards the very end of the semester that seemed overly complex (they are complex topics for sure) and prof had trouble explaining during lecture. Going to office hours really helped clear things up though. I think he just needs to teach the course a few more times since this was only his second time teaching 312. Textbook he wrote was very great, but there are places that have a strong over-emphasis on \"learning through example\" where there is a worked example to introduce an entire concept in lieu of a brief statement\/definition of the concept + explanation\/motivation. He was writing the textbook as the semester progressed though, so I'm sure the flow will be refined after a few rereads.",
    "Strengths - material and problems were straightforward. Although it's a theoretical class, the questions do not feel as if they are heavily proof based. The content is very cohesive, with one thing leading to the next. Weaknesses - lack of engagement with the problems. It feels like you are able to assume too much for the problems. Oftentimes, even though the solutions require only 1 line of code, it takes many steps to get there, and these steps are not required for the problem, leading to overall deficiency of information.",
    "I really like the weekly quizzes.",
    "Prof Brinda has put great care into the textbook (which he wrote), the lectures, and the homeworks. The course is well organized and is the perfect balance of engaging\/challenging without being too much work.",
    "The course does focus only on a few subjects, and as a result feels as though it moves slowly, but overall I still felt it was well organized and appreciated the depth. Now that the textbook is completed and proofed, I'm sure that the next iteration will have less bumps."

   "comments": [
    "Yes. I would 100% recommend this course to any student who is interested in math or CS or statistics. Brinda is an amazing professor, who really wants each student to learn to the best of their abilities.",
    "If you have taken courses like Stochastic Processes\/Optimization Techniques\/Statistical Inference and take this course after, you frankly may be a bit bored because a lot of this course can be construed as review, though I will say I have never seen anything like Prof. Brinda's \"variables picture\" before. I have a very hard time with visual thinking, and Prof. Brinda still managed to get me to understand what was going on from an orthogonality point-of-view. The class is fun, it has the \/right\/ amount of work, the midterm was very fair, the weekly quizzes can get a little bit annoying sometimes but you get to drop three, so it's no big deal. Prof. Brinda was the highlight of this class, so take it if you want to receive really excellent teaching.",
    "Take it if you feel comfortable with linear algebra and want to learn theory",
    "Yes. Please take this course if you're serious about statistics\/data science, and if you're interesting in learning about the fundamental level of linear models. If you're interested in working in data science\/quantitative research for a career, this is a must-take! A big problem that I've noticed with some of my peers in the Statistics major is their inability to understand the math of what's actually happening when they're running a ML model, for example. You can't just run a function and interpret the results - if you want to be truly good at what you do, you need to know the math behind what's happening and why you're getting the results that you are. Take Math 222 before this course, and if you take 312 along with Stat 365, you're truly going to be prepared for whatever career or internship or research that you do in ML.",
    "Yes! Not the hardest stat class at Yale and you learn a lot.",
    "Yes!",
    "yes!! a great course- well taught, useful, interesting, and not too overwhelming",
    "If you are a Stats major and took Linear Algebra or S&DS 242 and are still somewhat confused, take this class.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course! It's one of the best taught statistics courses I have taken.",
    "Only if you really are prepared for it. Strong stat background, strong R skills. if those apply to you, then yea you'll be fine. Otherwise you might spend a lot of time on it.",
    "Great professor (Prof Brinda). You will finally understand some parts of Linear Algebra that may have gone over your head in Math 222\/225, and you;ll come out feeling like you have a string grasp of some key concepts in statistics. So yes, I definitely recommend this!",
    "Yes, would recommend!! Linear models is truly a beautiful subject, and if Brinda is teaching it, it is sure to be illuminating. Would say it is different for a stats course because so much is theoretical, but still very fun.",
    "If you're a statistics\/data science student but you're interested in the underlying math behind your algorithms, take this class. It's far more in-depth than something like S&DS 365 because it's so niche. Not sure how applicable it is, but I really enjoyed it.",
    "I would recommend this course as a S&DS credit to pad out your semester. It's not terribly engaging, but also comes with a lighter workload than most other high level S&DS courses. There are weekly quizes which took me maybe 30 minutes a week to prepare for, as well as a weekly R assignment that took maybe 2-3 hours. As long as you pay attention during lectures, the class is pretty easy. I would definitely not recommend it if you are not a S&DS major, as the content is mostly theoretical, such as understanding exactly what ANOVA is doing under the hood, or how various estimators work. For non-S&DS majors, a more data-centric, applied class is likely to be a much better use of your time, such as learning how to actually use ANOVA packages or interpret the results of a ANOVA package.",
    "Highly. Professor Brinda is great about explaining concepts and teaching the class in digestible chunks. Much improved since the first time he taught 312.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student, as long as Brinda is teaching again. He's one of the best professors I've had at Yale and a real asset to the S&DS department.",
    "If you are taking for the major, sure. The class is fairly straightforward and cohesive, and the problem sets do not take long at all. The quizzes are essentially free as they were taken from a pool of problems in the textbook.",
    "Definitely take this course if Prof Brinda is teaching it.",
    "It is a class that I think would engage math\/stat students most highly, and other students would get less out of it. That being said, I enjoyed the class and the professor and would recommend it."
