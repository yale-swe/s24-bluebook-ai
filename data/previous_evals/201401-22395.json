   "comments": [
    "I would summarize it as a lecture seminar that allows students to help shape the course. I would recommend it because everyone should study African history and anthropology.I would recommend that incoming students be vocal if they feel that the pace of the class is too slow and communicate such thoughts with the professor.",
    "It's a required course for M.A. students in African Studies, but I would not recommend it to other students outside the department. I would not want to give other students the impression that this is all African Studies has to offer. We are already a marginalized program at Yale and largely undervalued, regardless of our new university president's efforts. This course would not impress any student, Africanist or not. There was also very little learning about specific African countries. Only a few countries were cited as mere examples to a larger theme. The discussions on African history either remained broad and theoretical, or it concentrated heavily on the Atlantic slave trade. I don't feel we were specific enough in our discourse when giving such a broad history of the continent.",
    "I would say that it is a good class, but it could use some improvements. If it became more discussion based, and the students were held more accountable for their readings, then it would be excellent.",
    "The course covers thought on African issues from early history up to the modern day and allows students to see various perspectives on the authors in addition to the issues.",
    "Take the course if you want a broad overview of African studies, not Anthropological theory. It may be lacking in rigor for graduate level students.",
    "As an introduction to African Studies, this course includes a lot of useful information and can lead in many directions. However, I believe that the course is underutilized, and would not recommend the course if it is taught in the same manner. If it is shifted to a more discussion-friendly course - a seminar rather than a lecture format - I would recommend it.",
    "Highly recommend",
    "I would summarize African Studies as a survey class which approaches and clarifies some of the most discussed themes about Africa.I would recommend it to fellow students because I feel that it provides students a framework to thinkabout the most talk-about subjects of Africa and provides context for a lot of the discussion revolving around \"the Dark Continent.\"",
    "Given changes mentioned above, I would recommend the class. It's one of the few courses on campus that has the potential to be a real \"think tank\" forAfrican issues. But as I said, I think there needs to be serious modifications to the structure of the seminars."

   "comments": [
    "I benefited from hearing my classmates discuss their research and passion.",
    "While the course provided me the opportunity to meet other students passionate about our field of study, it did little to deepen my knowledge of the discipline or contribute to my personal research.",
    "This class helped me study topics that I had not really approached in depth before. It also helped me with writing my Masters thesis.",
    "I learned of early thought on economies in Africa, which I hadn't learned before. Stages of Economic Growth and Theories of Underdevelopment were valid for my research.",
    "Not much contribution to research interests, other than a deeper appreciation for the many facets of African Studies. A few readings are useful for an understanding of the African continent but not Anthropology.",
    "Diverse selections of readings and various topics on African issues",
    "This course provided additional context and background to frame my dissertation research.",
    "The discussion portions of the seminars were immensely helpful. I think we all benefited from being able to mull over our respective research, and to have different perspectives added."
