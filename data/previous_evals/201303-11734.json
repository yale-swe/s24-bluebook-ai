   "comments": [
    "Yes, wonderful class. Take it.",
    "A great class if you enjoyed 131.WARNING: first 3 weeks are tough, but once you get past that point, the material is a lot easier.Midterms and finals are fair. We cover a lot of material in a short time with many mathematical proofs, but for the exams you do not need to do proofs, but know the concepts and how to apply them.I was hesitant at first to take this course, but after the 4th week, I understood what was going on and my mind was more at ease.",
    "Take it! It's important material and Meghir is really dedicated to teaching you the material so you understand it and doesn't rush to get through the end of the lecture. The exams are also really straightforward. Overall, if you're interested in econometrics or field experiments, take it.",
    "Econ 132 is awesome if you want to learn some econometrics. It's occasionally challenging but it's not awful. The biggest downside is that the people in the class, at least this semester, are painful to be around. Imagine all of the worst people in all of the classes you've ever taken put into one room. You've got a ton of EPE majors, hypercompetitive nerds, finance bros, and the people who go to office hours every single week just to get some good facetime and show off how much they know. The worst part of being in a class like that is that it makes you wonder if you suck as much as everyone else around you. Besides that major downside, great class.",
    "This is not a class for everyone. It can feel quite abstract at times and the p-sets are hard. I can't say that I loved the class, but I did learn a lot during the semester. Most of the topics were discussed in Econ 131, but this class provides much more depth. My Stata skills have also improved enormously. If you can take it with Professor Meghir, I would absolutely recommend doing so.",
    "Yes, it is a a course that will be useful for econs majors",
    "Take it if you are genuinely interested in the application of econometrics. Very useful and can be very fun to the right audience.",
    "This class is really just \"How to run regressions\"You learn how to regress something, and then the rest of class is basically dicussing all of the potential problems\/cool options you can through into your regressions (fixed effects, heteroskedasticity, instrumental variables, autoregressions, etc...)Therefore, the material isn't particularly difficult once your realize that it's all basically the same thing. The problem is that the class doesn't teach it that way ... the class teaches each of these add-ons independently rather than in relationship to one another.Tl;dr - Take it. It's hard, but it doesn't need to be.",
    "If you're interested in economics, especially from a more technical, math-based perspective, I absolutely recommend it.",
    "Absolutely necessary if you are interested in writing a statistical senior thesis. The material can be challenging but once you start to review it, I think you will quickly realize that it is far more intuitive than you thought at first",
    "If you feel you've learned nothing from 131, definitely take this. The class is well-taught, most of the students are driven to actually learn econometrics well, and it's indispensable for research!",
    "Second round of econometrics for the economics major. Costas Meghir is a great teacher, and very good with students. He's fairly lax (though you still have to finish your assignments). Problem sets can be challenging, but exams are a very fair representation of how well you know the material. Everything you need to know is in the professor's lecture notes posted on classesv2",
    "Yes, learnt so much.",
    "I would not recommend this course to anyone. It is much harder than it needs to be and relies on almost all theory and very few real world examples.",
    "Take this class, and take it with Meghir. You will learn so much about statistics, and Meghir is an incredibly clear, concise, and surprising funny professor.",
    "Exploration on what constitutes causation. I would recommend it if you want a good theoretical background in econometrics. Not totally needed in my mind if doing a senior thesis.",
    "The material is challenging, but it is taught well, and econometrics is extremely applicable in almost any analysis.",
    "Yes if you want to learn more about the quantitative side of economics, but if you just want to learn the basics about econometrics, then this class might not be your choice.",
    "Take this course! Statistics are used (and mis-used) so frequently in everyday life, and it's so important to understand what they mean and whether they mean anything at all. Don't be the sheep who goes along with what some researcher says just because their finding is \"significant at the 20% level\".",
    "Amazing material taught quite well by the instructor. A bit rushed but comprehensible. Very clear, amazing powerpoints. No need to scamper around campus for help as everything that needed to be taught was presented extremely well. Careful though - material is a bitmore tough than the average econ course, and most fellow students are nerds about it too (myself included) so take it if you have an interest in learning the magic and power of metrics."
