   "comments": [
    "I learned some basics of python coding for astro data processing, as well as the basics of conducting research in astronomy.",
    "Python programming in the context of astronomy.",
    "I learned to code a bit in python, and how astrophysicists do research, collect data, and analyze that data",
    "We learned about telescope mechanics and engaged in our own research projects. While we were learning about the material necessary to start the research project, Professor Geha kept emphasizing that what we were doing was not astrophysics. But, at the end, she acknowledged that what we did through the final project set us up for what real research and astrophysics is all about. This course is NOT for someone who wants to learn about stars, planets, galaxies, etc.; it is for someone who wants to learn about telescope systems, CCDs, simulations, etc.",
    "I learned about astronomical research techniques such as spectroscopy and radio astronomy, how to analyze research data in Python, and how to write a telescope proposal.",
    "You learn a lot about how astronomical data is collected and how to analyze it, specifically by using Python. It helps to know some Python before taking the course, but you can definitely get through it without having programmed before.",
    "I learned a lot of programming in python and how to reduce data",
    "You learn a lot about the basics of coding for Astrophysics using Python. Making color images, analyzing spectra, understanding astronomical imaging. It makes you feel very prepared to work in an Astrophysics lab. I highly recommend it.",
    "This was my first time learning any sort of coding, so that was a big development. I also learned a lot about the technical side of astro research, particularly about data reduction.",
    "How to use programming to deal with science data.",
    "Excellent job with teaching the basics of python specifically for astronomical data, but obviously transferable to other fields that interpret large amounts of data graphically\/statistically. Additionally, we learned about the mechanics and techniques of astronomy (different types of telescopes, how seeing conditions work etc.). Finally, we got a real, hands on experience picking a topic that interests us and writing a research proposal.",
    "This class gives one a detailed understanding of how telescopes actually work and how one can use them to do actual science. It is a great class for either learning how to program or for applying coding to worthwhile problems.",
    "This course did an excellent job of teaching the basics of various observation methods - optical telescopes, spectrography, radio - as well as basic programming in Python. While the actual physics remained pretty much at a high school level, this course provided an invaluable guide to \"how modern astronomy works\""

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The course was very well organized and a lot of fun.",
    "Weaknesses - I wish Marla actually taught Python. In class, she gives the most generic overview of an astrophysics concept, then the concepts in the homework (always coding + astrophysics math) were never really taught in class. The friday \"labs\" were pretty insufficient, and I wish Marla used that time to teach code instead of warming up marshmellows in a microwave. Also, the final project was super hard. If you do take this class, DO NOT do a coding simulation for the final project Strengths - Marla is really kind! Overall the class was great--I personally wish I devoted more time to it so that I would get more out of it.",
    "Strengths: Professor Geha! She made even some of the more dull material fun and interesting Weaknesses: There weren't a lot of worked examples in class, so the PSETs were sometimes very confusing",
    "The biggest strength was Professor Geha. She is an extraordinary lecturer with a gift for keeping her lectures engaging. She talks in a manner that isn't too jargon filled and is really great at explaining things in a clear and concise manner, even to students completely new to astronomy. The only weakness about this course was the problem sets. Despite the lectures in class being extremely well-done, there were multiple times on the problem sets that I felt that we weren't completely taught how to answer the questions. That is, sometimes the content we learned in class didn't correlate to the questions we were supposed to answer in the homework.",
    "A great professor and TA and super fun material. This class rocks!",
    "This course is structured perfectly. Even with little coding experience, the work is enough but not overwhelming. The assignments feel meaningful and rewarding.",
    "This is first and foremost a class for sophomore and junior astro and physics majors to learn programming skills for research. This was kind of lost this semester as the class was larger than normal and filled with many older CS students. As a result, the course more so catered to them and their lack of astro knowledge, while not focusing enough on giving other students the depth of programming skills they were hoping to get. It also caused the final project to change from an independent research project and poster presentation actually using the coding skills developed from psets to a telescope proposal. While this was still a fun activity, it was not as useful in terms of using what we learned over the semester and prepping students to do research. I think the class should be more restrictive in size, year, and major to avoid this in the future.",
    "This course is awesome. Not to big, lectures are clear and straightforward. I was really nervous about learning programming, but Professor Geha and Tim made it SUPER approachable. I love astronomy, but this course made it more tangible, like I could pursue it in the real world. Great course, 100% of the way.",
    "The final project, writing a telescope proposal, was a really good way to wrap up everything we had learned in the class. I like how you work with real data on the problem sets (e.g. from the Hubble Space Telescope).",
    "Greatest strength was Prof Geha - very good teacher, creative and hands-on instruction, skilled at handling a large class with a very broad range of student abilities in both physics and programming (I could have taken the exam on day 1 but knew zip about Python, while the CS majors were the reverse). I do think the course and the students would benefit from a bit more physics - as noted it was mostly high school level, and there were very few if any derivations. But it was more important that the course explain the nuts and bolts of how astronomers do their jobs. Prof Geha clearly cared a lot and put a ton of time into every aspect of the course."

   "comments": [
    "Absolutely. Astro major or not, the class is useful, fun, engaging, and cool.",
    "Great for S&DS majors curious about astro.",
    "Sure? If you do take this class without a background in astro & coding (like I did), you'll be okay. Some weeks are super tough, some are chill. the final project was hell",
    "YES! This course is fantastic, but you have to already like astrophysics to enjoy it. If you're just looking to learn about astro or to see if you like it, this is not the course for you.",
    "I couldn't recommend this course enough to another student, especially to CPSC majors. I was initially planning to take this course just for a science credit, but I soon get really enraptured with the content that Professor Geha was teaching. We worked a lot with Python, but for CPSC majors, it was far below in difficulty anything we covered in the computer science core classes. That, plus, the well-explained lecture content, makes ASTR255 one of the rare classes where the difficulty is like a gut but the satisfaction and amount that you learn is immense.",
    "I would recommend that first years wait a year to take this course. This course is mainly for physics and astro majors who are sophomores and juniors and want\/need to become familiar with analysis of astronomical data. There were some CS\/S&DS seniors taking this class to get an engaging but not too work heavy science credit, but I would recommend those types of students take other astro classes. The professor adjusted the class content and final project this year because of the changing makeup of the students taking the class to make it less coding oriented, which is kind of unfortunate for the astro and physics majors taking the class because they need to learn how to code. Overall though, would say it is a really good class and would recommend.",
    "Any astronomy or CS majors should definitely take this class! Also anyone generally interested in science and astronomy would love it!",
    "Of course for Astro majors. Even if not, I still think many non Astro majors would enjoy it. It really was rewarding and engaging.",
    "I would recommend it to other astro and physics majors.",
    "Yes, it is a great course to learn one interesting application to programming.",
    "I don't think I would ever recommend a course as highly as I would recommend this one. If your a CS person, the astro stuff will be fun and interesting for you. If you're an astro person, this course is a perfect way to learn coding. Professor Geha is a verified BADASS and the best professor I have had at Yale so far. Tim did a great job as well. Awesome awesome class.",
    "I would recommend this class to not only Astronomy majors but also to computer science majors who want to apply their skills to a new set of problems.",
    "I strongly recommend the course. The physics can be handled by anyone, and the assistance given by the excellent TF Tim Miller will help anyone get through the programming (I sure needed help here). You gain a strong introduction to how modern astronomy works, which is useful to anyone, as well as basic programming."
