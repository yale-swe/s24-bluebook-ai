    "Yes it's a great class to learn more about China-Africa debates however, take everything with a grain of salt.",
    "Definitely. There's really no other course at Yale that covers this topic, so do take it if you're interested! Just know it may be less like a seminar and more like an intimate lecture.",
    "Take it if you are specifically interested in the topic of China-Africa encounters. I wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t recommend it if you are just interested in learning more about China or Africa, because China-Africa encounters is a field which is under-reported.It was my first anthropology class and I learnt a lot about what anthropology is.",
    "If it is more than 15 people don't take it. If you are expecting a deep and intellectually stimulating anthropology class, I would not recommend it. However, as an introductory course to both China and Africa and if you want to get lectured more than speak in class, it might be a good option for you.",
    "Yes. A good course to learn about the different perspectives on the China& Africa issue.",
    "The class is probably going to get revamped big time when it's offered again (likely 2015), but it's what it is - a niche class focusing specifically on the interactions of China and the Chinese with the African continent, and vice versa, with an anthropological focus. Whether that topic packs enough juice to be a Yale College seminar, I can't say. The anthropological approach often left me, the non-anthro study in want of methodological rigor, but alas, that was not to be.The professor really emphasizes on teaching you how to write a proper research proposal that you could use for a Fubright or dissertation thesis, which was helpful, but unfortunately it's easy to get through the class without having learned anything otherwise. The workload was very low. There was little time for discussion, so little motivation to actually do the readings.All in all, this class needs a lot of work before it's something worth taking. Right now, I would say there are far better options both on the China and Africa sides of the equation.",
    "A new course, so not very structured, but covering a fascinating topic with lots of great readings.",
    "Barring serious changes to the class, no... take something else. This could have made a good Political Science class, but as anthropology class it utterly failed due to (1) the kinds of students it attracted - few people in the class knew what anthropology was (2) the lack of critical scholarship of any quality regarding China-Africa relations from an anthropological perspective and (3) the obstruction of meaningful discussion by the professor's teaching style, the size of the class, the irrelevance and tedium of the readings, and the fact that few in the class seemed to even do the readings. I took this class because I thought China-Africa would be a \"hot topic.\" It is, but because it's so recent and so little thought about, there isn't much to it."
