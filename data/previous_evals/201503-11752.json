    "Challenging class that you really have to be dedicated to doing all the work for. Very rewarding though when you find yourself able to speak and understand Korean!",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student. I loved this course and it taught me so much. I wish I could take it again. I feel really comfortable going into the next level.",
    "I absolutely LOVED this class. It's one of my most favorite classes at Yale so far because of many different reasons. Lee Seonsengnim is extremely attentive to individuals' progress in the class and is super nice - she took us out for food multiple times! We have a lot of fun in class doing different activities together. Our class also became really close to each other which really added to the experience and it's not something that you can find often in classes at Yale. We all made a lot of progress.",
    "My favorite course so far. It's a ton of fun for about an hour of homework and studying each night. Angela Lee-Smith is amazing!",
    "Amazing fun. You learn a lot.",
    "Excellent introduction to Korean course.",
    "I definitely would -- it's a worthwhile class to take and I learned a lot about Korean culture and language!"
