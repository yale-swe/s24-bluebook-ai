    "I have improved my understanding of classical music and the music theory associated with this genre of music. I have also greatly improved my knowledge of general musical structure. Finally, my music composition skills and ability to read sheet music have greatly improved.",
    "Music theory, also improved my listening skills. Harmonic syntax and formal structures.",
    "I learnt a great deal about model composition. I completed two projects and discovered that I enjoy composing.",
    "Studying techniques used by classical composers and practicing incorporating said techniques into my own compositions.",
    "I learned a lot of theory (Roman numeral analysis, figured bass, etc.) and fundamental rules of composition, like counterpoint, parallels, and logical chord progressions.",
    "I learned how to write and analyze music in the Classical style.",
    "I learned a lot about model composition and basic classical theory, as well as a lot about the challenges and struggles to writing our own classical music."

   "comments": [
    "This class excels in teaching how to compose and analyze classical music. The workload is low but consistent, allowing for students to engage well with the course material. The material is also well-organized for learning. I felt however that we didn't go over that much material which was relevant to my interests. I am a primarily contemporary musician and I was hoping to learn skills and information in this class which would aid in my creation of more contemporary music, with this class being part of the only music theory track. However, I felt that a lot of the information was only relevant to the classical period. Though there are plenty of carry-overs, I feel that I am coming away with less than I was hoping for.",
    "I wish there were notes on what a logical chord progression is, or rather a lesson on constructing chord progressions or studying common ones.",
    "Strengths of this course: you learn A LOT of music theory (analysis and composition, as this class is advertised to be). However, I feel like we didn't learn a lot in class and ended up learning most of the material while doing the homework. In addition, when we got to the midterm and final project, we (the class) generally felt like we weren't taught logical progressions besides the standard (I-IV-V-I) and so all of our feedback was mostly \"this chord progression doesn't make sense\". We felt really frustrated and wished we had discussed this more in class, ex. with examples or homework more dedicated to the composition aspect of the course.",
    "Strengths: Fun, discussion based class. Covered a lot of interesting and relevant material. Weaknesses: not a lot of opportunities for assessment.",
    "The strengths of this class are the material and interesting end goals in taking what we learned to write our own pieces. I really liked that aspect of the class. As far as weaknesses go, I often felt a lot of the learning was on our own and not all that clear, and in the compositions I sometimes felt overly constrained by the 'outdated' rules."

   "comments": [
    "Yes, especially to anyone interested in writing or arranging music.",
    "I would recommend this to any suitably prepared student.",
    "Yes, it is a light work load and a very fun class.",
    "Yes! If you're interested in music theory (whether it's because you need it for lessons, a distributional credit, or want to understand the pieces you're playing), this is a great class to explore and to learn the fundamentals of music theory. However, be prepared to learn a lot on your own\/reach out for help when you need it.",
    "I would. As someone who came into the course with very little music theory background, I was very glad to have an instructor like Clifton, who made himself incredibly available if students needed help, which I frequently did. The course was definitely more difficult for me as someone that also isn't much of a listener of classical music, so I didn't always pick up on some of the themes that were presented right away.",
    "Yes. If a student wants any idea of how to compose classical or really any genre of music, this foundation is a must."
