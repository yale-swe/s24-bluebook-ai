    "Take this class it is very interesting and not very hard.",
    "The best class I've taken\/probably the best class I will ever take at Yale. Fascinating subject, amazing professor. Yes. Please take this course.",
    "Yes! Super informative while remaining low work, great lecture and fun section!",
    "Fantastic class. Definitely take it if you are even somewhat interested in bioethics, our health care system, medicine, or law. It covers a range of controversial issues which Latham presents very well.",
    "Definitely.",
    "This is an absolute gem of a course. TAKE IT TAKE IT TAKE IT. It's everything you want in a 5th class. Not too much work (a 5 page paper, midterm and final), a great professor (Latham is an amazing lecturer), and fascinating material (I honestly learned a ton in this class and the material is really cool). The strengths are everything, the weaknesses are none. Take this course and I promise you won't regret it.",
    "Take it! Very interesting and engaging lectures and you learn a lot. Would highly recommend going to class because the material is very interesting. Only downside is that your grade is highly dependent on your TA.",
    "It's interesting and a constantly changing field so it's worth learning about.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class. Prof. Latham is extremely engaging and makes the class really interesting even if you know nothing about bioethics or law",
    "Must take",
    "Take it, great class",
    "Take it, not much work and so interesting!",
    "Highly recommend!",
    "Good professor, interesting material, but this course weights the final too heavily and provides too little instruction or guidance for the kind of essays expected on the midterm, paper, and final.",
    "Recommended class if you have interest in law or healthcare. There's not very much work, but that doesn't mean it's a gut. You do have to work to get an A, especially because the exams aren't that difficult and you have to produce really good essays to differentiate yourself from the masses. Latham's lectures are great and you should definitely go to them.",
    "It is a class that explores bioethical issues in society today. We covered issues including abortion, physicians assisted suicide, and so forth. I would definitely recommend the course.",
    "Look its not hard to do well if you show up to class - I barely ever opened the book except to write the paper",
    "Interesting, doable workload",
    "Great class! Would definitely recommend taking it!",
    "Yes take this class.",
    "This is a great course! Every Yale student should take this course just to learn about and be prepared for the bioethics decisions you may have to face during your lifetime. This class truly made me think about our healthcare and legal systems and how they intersect. It got me thinking about what I want for myself in relation to some of the current bioethics issues.",
    "Take the class, but be weary of your TA. They determine your grade, so choose wisely.",
    "Relatively easy but solid introduction to bioethics and law. Interesting but not too much work. A good fifth class.",
    "Bioethics and Law is a great class with interesting material and a wonderful professor. The workload is fairly light as well. I would highly recommend it to everyone.",
    "100%. If you take one class at Yale and then drop out, make sure it's this one.",
    "Yes. Excellent course that teaches you a lot of law and the complex field of medicine.",
    "DO IT! I was excited to go to every lecture and the topics are extremely interesting and relevant, whether you are interested in the medical field or not. One of the best classes at Yale in my opinion.",
    "A great taste of a law class, and also a really awesome way to engage with a different type of reading. Case law is actually really fun, if you like a mix of qualitative understanding and logical thinking \/ memorization.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. Very informative and interesting",
    "I would 100% recommend this class to other students. It was my favorite class I have taken at Yale and I can't wait to take more classes taught by Professor Latham. Bioethics and Law has made me want to become a lawyer.",
    "Great class with really interesting material. You can do reasonably well with little work, although everything depends on your TA and section.",
    "Must take. One of the best classes at Yale with not much work. I could listen to Stephan Latham lecture about bioethics and the law for all 4 years if possible.",
    "One of those quintessential lectures that is interesting, relevant, and easy. If you're looking for a nice lecture to fill out your schedule, look no further.",
    "This is a fantastic course. If you know a lot about the law already, you don't have to do any work to get a great grade. If you don't know a lot about the law, then you'll have to study hard for the assessments to do well, but it's still a class with very little work and lots of interesting information to be learned. Professor Latham is amazing. Highly recommended.",
    "TAKE THIS! You will not regret it.",
    "I would recommend Bioethics and Law to another student. The material is fascinating and Professor Latham is a wealth of knowledge on the subject. The workload is manageable--just three graded assignments in addition to section participation: midterm exam, 5 page midterm paper, and final exam. Julian was a good TA and I would definitely recommend him if you can.",
    "Best class at Yale!!",
    "great class. i thought it was interesting and cool. i would take it again, but i dont think i would DEFINITELY take it again its really really easy to not do any of the reading and still do well (i didnt open the book once) as long as you study for the midterm and final and do your paper well",
    "Best in both difficulty and material- so interesting and super easy",
    "An interesting class. A little repetitive at times, but interesting and with very little work. It's an awesome class to take credit\/d.",
    "Take this class it is very easy and pretty interesting if you actually do some of the readings.",
    "Midterm, 5-7 page paper, Final. Section is optional, but it was helpful to go. Latham is a great professor, so class is always interesting and entertaining (no powerpoint slides - Latham just speaks and occassionally uses the chalkboard). But, it's not totally necessary to go to class as long as you read the book.",
    "Lecture is always interesting and very applicable to your own life. At least one topic in the class will apply to everyone directly, and for me most of the topics applied. If you like law or medicine, or just are looking for an interesting topic to learn more about, definitely take the class. Not much work - just a midterm and final plus one short paper.",
    "Bioethics and Law is definitely a course worth taking. It was pretty interesting, but not as great as I thought it would be. It's also not very stressful, since the only work you have to do is the weekly reading, a midterm, paper, and final. You'll basically learn a little bit of everything that has to do with bioethics, including the fact that Professor Latham hates Donald Trump and Jenny McCarthy.",
    "Highly recommended for students of any major!! Fascinating and relevant to everyone.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. It is very interesting, and probably good as a first class about law for people interested in going into law in the future. It is not too much work, but I still felt like I was learning throughout the class.",
    "Yes.",
    "As someone who is a poli sci major but had never taken a medicine- or healthcare-related class, I LOVED this course and got so much out of it. Take it if only for the awesome opportunities for dinner table conversation! Latham is an awesome professor and you will never be bored in class. The readings aren't really necessary (just go to class and read briefs of the cases before the exams to make sure you know what you're talking about).",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS! Bioethics is so interesting and you probably won't get a chance to learn about this stuff in any other class. Professor Latham's lectures are amazing - he's definitely the best lecturer I've had at Yale so far. There's not a ton of work, but sometimes the TA's do grade kind of hard. If you don't want to put in that much work, definitely take this class Cr\/D\/F because then you can just go to the lectures but not worry about reading all the cases in the textbook.",
    "Yes- interesting but not incredibly interesting and a gut",
    "Best lecture I've taken at Yale. It's a small workload with tons of interesting lectures, and the discussions in sections are fascinating. Just going to lecture basically guarantees you a good grade as long as you pay attention, and Latham is phenomenal. Absolutely recommend for everyone!",
    "Yeah, it's a good time. Go and pay attention to Latham when he lectures.",
    "Bioethics and Law gives a good overview about questions such as organ donation, physician-patient relationships, death \/ assisted suicide, etc. It is a great lecture where you get an interesting overview of contemporary issues that show up on the news all the time. Professor Latham does a great job debriefing everyone, and making complicated legal arguments accessible to students with little to no law background. I Credit\/D\/Failed the class because there were so few assessments (that were worth a lot) that doing mediocre on one would affect my grade too much. The TFs are pretty chill, but really range in their expertise on the subject. My TF, Ben, was really chill but he also was a law student so was very good about how to approach analysing the cases and asking questions. Frankly, the class isn't as inspiring as I thought it would be, but it's still worth taking as a 5th credit! You do not having to do any of the readings, although it is interesting to get a sense of how cases are written and how judges articulate their thought process \/ decisions.",
    "YES. Professor Latham is a great lecturer. Every lecture all semester, SSS 114 was completely packed. The course material is also interesting and super useful regardless of your major (everyone should know more about health care, in my opinion.) Not a lot of work, and the readings aren't really necessary as Prof. Latham covers everything you need to know in lecture. There is variability amongst the TAs in terms of how harsh\/lenient they are.",
    "I won't say much: take it. one of the best courses I've taken at yale.",
    "super amazing class - the professor is one of the best lecturers at Yale, the material is interesting and relevant, and section isn't mandatory. the class notes are sufficient for the exams, but the reading is a great supplement anyways. Take this class - it's relevant to everyone, not just those interested in law or medicine.",
    "Take it. Professor Latham is an amazing lecturer, and the material is always interesting.",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone!! The course is a useful introduction into some of the most controversial issues today--after taking the class, I feel like I can form legitimate and well-informed opinions about these issues rather than having opinions based upon political associations. So, so worthwhile.",
    "One of the best courses I have taken at Yale. Professor Latham is an amazing lecturer and he is willing to spend time with you after class or in a coffee shop somewhere. Take it! There's no reason not to!",
    "It's a great class, especially if you're looking for a 5th class. You don't even need to Cr\/D it, because as long as you come to class, take lecture notes, and review for the exams, you'll be fine. The material is very interesting, and Professor Latham presents it in an engaging way. My TF was Ben, who was awesome. I learned a lot. I would recommend this class to everyone. For the reading, do what you can, but it's totally ok if you don't. Make sure to read up on cases covered in class. There is one midterm, a paper on a topic of your choice, and a final exam.",
    "Good class. Professor Latham definitely knows his stuff. Sometimes it gets a bit repetitive, as when the Professor starts by recapping the last class and we end up spending most of the time reviewing old material. But in all very interesting and a reasonable workload.",
    "YES- just info that you should know in general.",
    "There's not too much work. The lectures and readings are really interesting.",
    "This is one of those classes you wander into and then get sucked in for the rest of the semester. If you're at all interested in law or public health, this is an excellent class. Latham is an outstanding lecturer, and the readings are extremely interesting. If you have a great section leader, this is really the ideal class at Yale. Put in the effort to do the readings, and it will pay off.",
    "This was a great class. I took it because I thought it was a gut, and it is in terms of workload. Just a midterm, a 5-7 page paper, and a final. However, you should take all of them seriously because minimal effort isn't going to get you an A. But if you do study and put some thought into your paper, you should be fine. Going to lecture shouldn't be a problem because Professor Latham is really cool and a really good lecture. Section isn't even mandatory, but really helpful. I knew nothing about bioethics or law before I took the class, but I definitely came out of the class having learned some practical and interesting information that any good citizen should know.",
    "If you have a hard TA, it's not as much of a gut class as you would think",
    "Definitely take this class during your time at Yale. It is such an interesting class. During lecture, when you're taking notes, you don't even notice the time fly by. The topics are amazing and Professor Latham really knows what he's doing. I loved this class and definitely recommend taking it to another student!",
    "Take it, it's a gut",
    "Take the class, not terribly interesting but pretty easy.",
    "Bioethics & Law covers fascinating debates in bioethics like abortion\/reproductive choices and rights, end of life treatment, and human subjects research (to name a few of the big ones), and how each debate has manifested itself in law and policy. Professor Latham is interesting and really invested in the subjects! At the same time, it's a huge lecture, so it feels pretty impersonal and has a reputation for being pretty easy. If you're interested in the topic, go for it; if not, take it or leave it. Try to get in a good section!",
    "FANTASTIC COURSE. A course that everyone at Yale should honestly consider. I learned so much about every potentially interesting bioethics-related issue out there: healthcare, organ donation, end-of-life care, public health, etc. I feel so much more enlightened as a citizen and prospective doctor; the course taught me concepts that I believe should be understood by all. This is also a course that can definitely be audited. I was able to sit in lecture and absorb most of the information without having to actively memorize or study it.",
    "Interesting course, not too much work. Professor Latham is an engaging lecturer and the material is particularly useful for people going into health-related professions but can be relevant for everyone.",
    "Highly recommended - Professor Latham is terrific and made this class incredibly engaging, relevant, and accessible.",
    "Excellent material and even better professor. You must. Take. This. Class.",
    "PLSC 257 offers a good overview of some interesting issues in bioethics. However I was left disappointed with the knowledge I actually got, and thought it could have been gleaned from reading a few articles on these issues. If you are looking for a PLSC course with little work I would recommend it otherwise I would probably skip it.",
    "It's a great class. It was enjoyable: lots of interesting information presented in clear and consistent ways. It never felt like it erred on either side, either being too topical and not thorough enough, or too thorough and rote and without breathing room. Professor Latham is a great man. I found his lectures (and lecture style) to be captivating. He was clear, consistent, and concise. He knows his shit, and he yet he's never intimidating: he has the greatest ways of bringing you into his world and his discussions. He's always very approachable after (and outside of) class for extra discussion. I'm definitely looking into taking more classes with him. Having taken the course, I feel like a bit of a better citizen: rather than having focused on deep, intellectual (and impractical) conversations about bioethics and law in the abstract, the course did a good job of laying out extremely practical information about how these things work in the United States (and a bit in the rest of the world). For instance, I know a lot more about, say, Obamacare, then I did coming into the class, and that makes me feel so much more prepared to have an informed conversation about it with other people.",
    "Very Very Highly Recommend. Take this class. You will enjoy every lecture, and learn more than you thought possible about healthcare and ethics. The lectures are incredible. Don't miss this class.",
    "I took this class as an easy poli sci credit. But I quickly grew to really enjoy the class and our course material. Latham is incredibly knowledgeable and a fantastic lecturer. Go to lecture, and you will learn so much. The coursebook is definitely helpful, but I got by without it. The midterm paper was a lot of fun, and the exams are super fair. Take this class.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student. As a premed student, I was very interested in learning about the American health care system, bioethics law, and the cases that have shaped it. The evaluations consist of a midterm (25%) a paper (25%) and a final (50%). The exams are both essay based. They are evaluated based on the logic of the argument, and references to course material.",
    "Yes must take. Light workload, interesting material as well. You get what you put in from it.",
    "TAKE TAKE TAKE. so good. Latham's lectures are fascinating and you will learn a lot. A great 5th class because there isn't too much work but its not a gut, in that you won't be wasting your time here either.",
    "Take it.",
    "It's a must-take.",
    "Great class, and very easy. The material is really interesting, lecture is engaging, and there's a reasonable amount of reading (although you definitely don't need to do it all). my favorite class of the semester by far!",
    "Great lecture. Interesting material for those interested in a variety of subjects: medicine, ethics, the law.",
    "Definitely take this course if you are slightly interested in bioethics, the legal system, or medicine. If you are premed, this is actually a great course to take because you learn about the history of legal proceeding surrounding what might become your career in the future. It might even inspire you to go into law because this course does a great job of giving a comprehensive view of what bioethics law is really like. I definitely had never known any of the things I learned from this course so I\u2019m definitely glad I took it, and you will too! Professor Latham is such a great and inspirational lecturer. You will never be bored during the lectures because it seems as if he\u2019s talking directly to you because he makes the cases so clear and addresses the issues in a personal manner. It was a great experience to take this course!",
    "I would recommend this class. It is very interesting and well taught and has a manageable workload.",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend this class to another student. The subject matter is very interesting and relevant. Professor Latham is an amazing lecturer, which makes going to class enjoyable.",
    "While this is still an interesting class and a solid choice for your schedule, my praise is not as effusive as it has been from others in past years. Latham is a great lecturer who is truly captivating for the full 50 minutes twice a week, and his style makes it very easy to take notes. The material is fascinating and may even be helpful in real life. It's a good balance between legal cases, policy, and current events. However, it did seem like a rushed course -- I felt like we tried to cover too much material in too little time, and thus it felt like each topic was only treated to a cursory examination. One reason for this might be that the class was 50 minutes twice a week this semester instead of the usual 75 minutes twice a week, and (for once) I think lecture could have been improved if it lasted 75 minutes. It often felt like Latham was just getting going before he had to stop. The very large lecture this year also meant that a lot of people took this class just because they heard it was easy, which was disappointing and did end up detracting from the section experience. I do admit that it's not much work though: the midterm and final are very fair and ask about general topics, and the paper is short and open-ended.",
    "YES. AMAZING. EVERY FUTURE DOCTOR MUST TAKE THIS.",
    "Very interesting course, even if you're not pre-med or pre-law. Latham has so many awesome dad jokes. Took Bioethics Credit\/D but don't know if I really needed to!",
    "Bioethics is an interesting lecture -- cool material, although most of it is familiar if you read the news. Not a huge workload and tests are very open ended",
    "YES",
    "I would definitely recommend it!!",
    "Take this class!",
    "Worth taking",
    "Take it; it's pretty good.",
    "Yes! Take bioethics!!! Great lecturer, awesome material that is applicable to real life and so interesting!!",
    "Solid course. Professor Latham is one of the best dynamic lecturers at Yale. He has a unique way of telling stories yet including both morality and legal perspective in what he teaches. I'd take the class just for him, however, the course material is interesting and the workload is low.",
    "Definitely. One of the more interesting classes I have taken (I am a senior), and really makes you think. It's the type of class that you discuss the topics on trips or at lunch or in real world contexts. Very cool.",
    "No. The TFs are horrible and you just learn a bunch of cases - does not teach you about ethics or how to critically think (like a con law class will)",
    "Good class with little work and pretty conservative grading. Tough to get a straight A",
    "This class covers all the various topics regarding bioethics today. I highly recommend this class. Professor Latham is the man. Go to lecture because they are really good.",
    "Fascinating subject, and Prof. Latham is a very engaging lecturer. The class has a very light workload, so it makes for a great 5th credit.",
    "Huge lecture but wonderful lecturer - Stephen Latham doesn't use powerpoint or write much on the chalkboard, but he does tell a fantastic narrative of each case and the history of bioethics. Light workload but very interesting; take it!",
    "I really enjoyed this class, as it really allowed me to explore a field that I didn't know much about before. I think that the pace of the class was perfect, though the reading was pretty heavy. Professor Latham was great and he always came to class very prepared, hardly ever using notes or a powerpoint. He explained things in great detail and designed the class in a very logical way. One of the best professors at Yale.",
    "An engaging overview of the state of public health. The more you put in, the more you get out of the class. The great news is you don't have to put in too much to get a lot out of it. I felt engaged all semester and emerge with a better understanding and deeper interest in public health law. So it's win-win!",
    "Learn about development of key issues in bioethics primarily through case study. FIND A GOOD TA. A law student if you want to focus on legal mechanics\/development. A non law student if you want to focus on ideas and issues.",
    "Fantastic course where everything you learn is interesting and relevant to the world we live in today. You get a good mix of historical background and current legal doctrine, presented in extremely engaging lectures, with a very reasonable amount of work. A great option for a fifth class. Take it!",
    "Do it, I truly enjoyed it",
    "Great class, definitely take it. Very interesting, useful in the real world. teaching staff is awesome",
    "Yes! Great class, just make sure your TA likes you (Your grade will depend on it)",
    "Good fifth class. Very little work",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student. Bioethics has been one of the best lecture classes I have taken at Yale. The material is relevant to everybody and honestly has a lot of crucial information for the entire public. Take this class!!",
    "Take this class---as a non poli-sci major I really enjoyed it and thought it wasn't too hard! Although the final is 50% of your grade...",
    "Absolutely Recommend!! Great lecture, incredible professor, awesome material. 3 assessments (midterm, 5-7pg paper, final) all of which were manageable and straightforward. Definitely a worthwhile class that is a must-take at Yale. Take it you will definitely not regret it",
    "Good class - it's worthwhile stuff to know about just for general life. Good lecturer and not too much work.",
    "I would definitely recommend it. It is a good fifth class because it's not very demanding but the lectures are super engaging.",
    "Take this class (especially if you are pre-med). You will learn the context behind which bioethical questions are framed in America. The workload is very light. Only a midterm\/final\/~7 page paper. I hardly did any of the readings BUT I attended every section\/class and took copious notes. I did the readings if my TA encouraged me to do them. The grading can seem a bit arbitrary - I think it is, but I'm not so sure. I learned a lot in this class, and I'm very glad that I took it!",
    "Would definitely recommend this class. For how much you are required to put into the class, the output is extremely high. Latham always delivers excellent and interesting lectures, the TFs are helpful, and the class provides a useful knowledge of which you ought have a basic understanding. The work and the exams are very manageable and the readings are also not very dense. Overall a great class.",
    "I would highly recommend this course!",
    "Yes, I would recommend this class to another student.",
    "Great 5th class. Not much work, interesting course material, and some really cool readings (you don't \"have\" to do the case book readings but if you like reading law cases there are some really famous\/good ones).",
    "Good overview of major issues in the field of bioethics - Latham keeps the material interesting using unique, often funny, examples and the material is not too difficult either. Cases can be pretty long in the readings although Latham provides a nice summary of the most important ones. Not too hard to do well if you put in a bit of time studying for the exams and writing the paper. Learn some interesting things too - take it!",
    "Absolutely! It covers a lot of important issues and is a great lecture!",
    "Yes. Very interesting.",
    "Good course but pretty wishy washy",
    "If you want a solid political science class, I recommend this course.",
    "This was a really interesting course. Professor Latham really knows his material and all the information we learned was relevant and eye opening. Either go to lecture or get the notes from someone to do well on the midterm and the final. There's also one paper.",
    "It is a very interesting course about bioethical issues and a basic law related class. It gives a great foundation to the law if you are interested in that field. One of my favorite classes at Yale so far.",
    "I would 100% recommend this class to anyone. The content is really interesting, and it's probably good to have some background in issues like end-of-life care, informed consent, abortion, Obamacare, etc. Also Latham is just an incredible lecturer. He's one of those few professors out there that can just step on stage in front of hundreds of students and start lecturing - no notes, no PowerPoint - and actually keep your interest. Your grade is composed of just a midterm (25%), paper (25%), and final (50%). It's very little work. The actual amount of reading assigned is insane - there's pretty much no way you could do it all, but there's really no point in doing it all anyway. As long as you go to lecture and take pretty good notes, you'll be fine. After the midterm, I just stopped doing the readings altogether, but if you're going to do them, just read the cases that were mentioned in class. Section is optional, but I actually really enjoyed going to mine - it was more of just a casual conversation about the issues we discussed in class. Overall, fantastic class and definitely take it.",
    "Everyone should take this class. It is an amazing amazing class, where you look at actual cases, and learn about healthcare and the legal system. Professor Latham is great. It is most probably the best class I've taken at Yale. It's not an easy A, though.",
    "A great class for anyone. Definitely take it.",
    "Dope kids",
    "I would definitely recommend it because you don't realize how much of these problems are occurring in our judicial system right now. I learned a lot",
    "Would recommend",
    "You learn about topics such as the following: what are the legal ramifications of removing the ventilator during end of life care, do we own our cells, why can't we have easy access to drugs that are not FDA approved if we consent to it, what is the ideal doctor-patient relationship, is quarantine justified, is life patentable? etc. The class is very thorough, I learned a lot for sure, the professor does a great job explaining things and the textbook might seem scary (I'm international) but it's really not and you can get a lot from just reading it.",
    "A wonderful class. Depending on your TA, it can be a little harder than you might think. But I'd definitely recommend.",
    "Definitely a must take. The work load isn't too much and it's very interesting.",
    "Take it if you're at all interested in biology, human rights, law or just looking for a great class with an incredible lecturer. Lot of reading though.",
    "Yes!! The course was really interesting. The lecture was easy to follow but still informational. I feel like I learned a lot. Really interesting lecturer. He had a really great way of speaking, not lecturing from notes, really concise and interesting.",
    "Yes totally.",
    "On par with Intro to Psych, this is another Must Take class. Not hard, informative, and enjoyable. What more could you want? The answer is nothing.",
    "Yes! Interesting lecture, light workload. Overall, a win.s",
    "Really interesting lectures! A lot of information I am glad to know now. He sometimes seemed to repeat lectures which was a little annoying, but Latham can hold the attention of a room without notes or slides, which is cool to witness. Enjoyment might be a bit dependent on the grading style of your TF- mine added stress that the class didn't need. Would recommend overall.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS! It's fun, it's fascinating, and it's not much work! An essay, a midterm, and a final, none of which are too hard and all of which you can get help preparing for. If you can, opt for Julian Polaris as your TA because he was brilliant.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. Go to lecture!!! Don't just rely on a friend's notes because it will serve you well on the exam if you absorb and retain the information yourself. Also, the readings aren't mandatory. It's just extra information available for you if you truly cared about a specific topic.",
    "YES!!! great 5th class. super interesting and relatively easy.",
    "I would recommend this class to another student. I think the majority of students would find this class interesting.",
    "Great course!! Highly recommended.",
    "Interesting class and worth considering. Stephen Latham is an animated lecturer. No law background needed. Focuses on bioethics issues in a contemporary context and makes you think about things differently.",
    "A lot of the time you feel the professor is just ad libbing. One lecture he definitely improvised and just repeated the same things from previous classes. He is amusing enough, though. You definitely feel like you learned something from the course, but in all honestly, you are unable to put a finger on quite what you have learned and what you are supposed to take away. Sure, you've memorized countless cases and are able to talk intelligently about them, but there seems to be a disconnect between the cases you learn about and the material tested or even what you can apply. I'm probably being harsh. It's a decent course.",
    "The grading is tougher than I thought it would be--they grade very harshly in terms of your argument. It's a tough course for anybody transitioning from a mostly STEM-background--the material is interesting, but brushed over, to be honest. Ben Graham, in particular, is a tough, tough grader, who was fairly unhelpful\/made section a chore. I wouldn't recommend going to his section. Latham is a great professor, but again, tough grading means if you're looking for a gut, look elsewhere.",
    "Take this course! The material is interesting, there is only a midterm, final and short essay and they are all relatively easy if you show up to lecture.",
    "This has been my favorite class at Yale -- A MUST TAKE FOR EVERYONE regardless of your major, year, academic interest. This is an absolutely fantastic class. It's super interesting and Professor Latham is a total baller. If you go to lecture you will be fine for exams. You really don't have to do any of the readings, but you'll want to because they're so interesting\/very manageable. You will want to go to every class; I looked forward to going to this lecture every Monday and Wednesday. This class with teach you how to think -- something that I think other classes at Yale fail to do. I look at the world, ethical and legal issues differently after taking this course.",
    "Yes, I would recommend the class. These are interesting and important issues for anyone to think about. Lectures are interesting, and the workload is reasonable",
    "I would recommend this course in a heartbeat to any student. I think everyone should take this course at some point during their 4 years.",
    "Definitely take it. It's kind of a gut, but not at the expense of learning. All you have to do is SHOW UP (I didn't do a single reading) because Latham is an AMAZING lecturer. You'll be surprised when class is over, because he just talks for 50 mins straight about fascinating stuff. There is very little work. Just go to class, take a midterm that's super chill, and a final that's a little tougher, but seriously fine. And write one paper. Do it. Extremely important issue, taught by one of the best professors at Yale. You will NOT regret it. A great 5th class, too."
