I would also like to note that there was a lot of interaction between Professor Arkolakis, Fabian Eckert (the grad student I worked with), and me. I never felt lost and these two were always there to help and guide me. Because I got to work with such amazing passionate people and I made the most of the experience I can't really think of any weaknesses."
