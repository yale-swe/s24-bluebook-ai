   "comments": [
    "Sigga will not be teaching this course again. But if she does you should take it. It is one of those rare places in Yale college where you can go very in-depth and serious on a subject without tyrannical levels of work.",
    "I would recommend it, but with caution, as the professor next year will be someone else.",
    "This was a pretty technical class, but still very interesting. Not sure if it will be offered again tho, since Sigga is headed to Iceland.",
    "Class is heavy in finance and you need to have a solid background in order to keep up (not a lot of theory presented, but knowledge in financial markets should definitely be a prerequisite). Workload is good (two presentations and a final paper) and the professor is amazing.",
    "Take the course if you're actually interested in financial instruments and institutions. If that's not your area of interest you'll be bored. If you are actually interests and ideally have some experience in finance you'll enjoy the course. It wasn't stressful but youll get a lot out of the course if you do the work. Great selection of readings.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to any student interested in finance. It is one of the few finance-focused courses available to undergraduates at Yale, and explores a wide-breadth of topics through a qualitative, case-study manner. It is a unique course that is enhanced by its characteristic as a senior seminar."
