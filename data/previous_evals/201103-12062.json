    "A good class but a hard one. You have to delve into the lectures and textbook to understand the material, which is very necessary for the completion of problem sets and lab reports. The labs are also a huge amount of work in this class, which takes this class from \"same\" workload to \"much greater\" workload in my opinion. The actual going in and doing the lab will only take a little bit of time (unless there is a problem with the equipment which seems to be an increasing problem) but then the write ups consistently take about 10 hours. Professor Reed doesn't put aside much time for students outside of class, so you have to rely on the TA's to help you outside of class. So get friendly with those TA's. Finally, the exams are not very difficult if you have studied and made good equations sheet (which you are supposed to write up and bring in to the exam) so that is a nice part of the class.Oh yeah, and if you are an applied physics major, this class will be harder for you than if you are an EE major, based on what I have observed from the students in the class this year. Just FYI",
    "This class is more of a \"plug and chug\" treatment of the material. Unless you are super proactive about learning on your own, it's too easy to skate by this class with the minimum, and thus leave the course not actually learning anything.I am embarrassed to say that I cannot actually explain how a semiconductor works.In terms of grades, I think it might be on the easier side, even though the material is quite difficult. The exams are super easy if you construct a good formula sheet.Lab reports will take too much time.",
    "This is a great course if you want to understand, at a fundamental level, how electronic devices work. The transistor is the basis for all of modern electronics, and you will understand how the most common transistors work by the end of the semester. You start with some quantum mechanics, which actually plays a role and matters at the nanoscale, then go into energy band diagrams and learning about carrier concentrations. You learn about semiconductor crystal lattice structure and how this affects the conductivity and energy band diagrams of various semiconductor materials. Once you have all this electrostatic and quantum theoretical background, then you start looking at devices, the first of which is the p-n junction diode. Then you cover the JFET, the MOSFET, and finally, the bipolar junction transistor (BJT). In summary, the first half of the class is theory and the second half is focused on analyzing devices. You definitely learn a tremendous amount in this class, but this class is pretty time-consuming. There are 19 mini-psets (2-3 questions each, assigned at every class) along with 8 labs (and 8 corresponding lab reports), a midterm, and a final. The professor and TAs are okay with you turning things in late (without penalizing you), but be warned that the psets and lab reports can easily start to pile up. I had a ton of psets and lab reports to catch up on over Thanksgiving break and reading period. This class was a lot of work. The labs, however, reinforce the material learned in class really well. The whole class is very coherent. Also, you get to take a tour of the clean room where they actually make transistors during one class period, which is pretty cool. Apparently this class is only required for ABET-track EE majors, so not many take it. There were seven students taking this class for a grade, and yet, there were two TAs and two possible lab times for the class. The textbook can be a bit unclear and confusing at times. Sometimes the problems in the textbook ask about things the textbook doesn't really cover or explain clearly. You'll often find yourself searching online for more details and clearer explanations. That was frustrating at times. You have to make a lot of simplifying assumptions in many problems. You come to appreciate the complexities of analyzing electrical devices. I think this class gives you a very good introduction to the theoretical foundations of semiconductors, and it is a pretty interesting course overall, but it is a LOT of work for 1 credit (it should really be 1.5 credits - the lab component is definitely worth at least 0.5 credits; I felt like I probably spent more time total on the lab reports than the psets). Make sure you're not taking any other too time-consuming classes the same semester as this class.",
    "Definitely take this class! One of my favorite EE classes so far. It was a bit of work between the labs and psets, but so worth it! Also, don't be afraid to take it as a sophomore if you have room.",
    "Pretty good. It might not be the best class to take if you aren't an EE major - due to the excessive effort necessary for labs."
