    "This course provides a very good overview of European tragedy across a broad time period. If you can take it with Professor Homans, definitely do it. She is amazing! The readings can take a lot of time, but actually taking the time to do them leads to a much more interesting class discussion which makes the paper writing process much easier. The course is well structured and very straightforward, and essay prompts are given well ahead of time. I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for an interesting class to fulfill distributional requirements, or anyone looking to broaden their horizons.",
    "An amazing class. Take it. You will learn so much, read incredible works, and feel yourself grow as a writer and reader. Professor Homans is fantastic.",
    "I would recommend this class with Professor Homans. It was a great learning experience for me.",
    "I would sincerely recommend other freshmen take Engl 129. The reading load may seem staggering, but it is truly rewarding to have read and discussed such a breadth of tragic dramas. I feel that I now have a true foundation that I can use to place my future English courses in context. Professor Homans will very fairly and efficiently help you adjust to her expectations and the more general dictates of college-level writing.",
    "Yes! This is a truly great class, and the syllabus is incredible. Take it with Homans if you can, and be ready to put in the work.",
    "English 129 is a good introduction to tragedy with a great reading list, and I'd recommend it to anyone with any interest in literature .",
    "ENGL 129 is a very reading-intensive class. I would not recommend this class to another student because it lacks educational compass.",
    "There are 4 short papers and a final. If you out the time and energy you will improve! I'm really glad I took the class!"
