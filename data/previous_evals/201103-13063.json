    "Not that great of a lab. It was interesting to see how data is collected, but it could just as well have been condensed to half a semester \u0096 the second week, reserved purely for discussion, is relatively useless, and drags on tediously. Excessive amounts of Excel manipulation, and sometimes unclear guidance on requirements. We had next to no guidance for the final Launching the weather balloon was a high point, and it pretty much went downhill from there. But hey, if you're taking this lab, it's because you're stuck with it, and EVST 201 is well worth the trouble.",
    "Great lab! We looked at clouds, launched a balloon, learned about basic weather instruments. It was very enjoyable! One lab report due every other week.",
    "Take it! Especially if you have a dangling half credit from a language course.",
    "Of all the labs at yale, this one is benign. Only 2 hours a week (instead of 4 like chem) and there are only 5 lab reports. Lots of data analysis is required. I would recommend the class.",
    "This lab is overall a good course. It's not as long or intense as other science labs that I have heard about and most of the material is worth learning, I would recommend it.",
    "Labs are only every two weeks. This gives more time for write ups and the ability to go over questions in between lab weeks.",
    "You have to take it. It's not that challenging although the final lab exam is kind of a doozy. The labs are fun but the quality of this course is definitely dependent on which TA you have.",
    "The lab has to be taken with the class, but it is unlike other labs I have taken here. Labs are quite enjoyable, from launching weather balloons to going on field trips to nearby rivers and taking water samples, and much shorter blocks than other lab courses. I would definitely recommend this class and don't shy away because of the lab requirement!",
    "This lab is pretty straightforward. It's probably pretty easy compared to other science labs but you still need to put in some effort writing up the lab reports. Reports were due every two weeks so it wasn't overwhelming. The labs don't seem to totally relate to the lecture work but they were mostly pretty interesting.",
    "Not great, but not hard and you need it to take the one of the best classes at Yale!",
    "NO. I would only take this course unless you have to or are actually genuinely interested in geology",
    "It is required with the class...",
    "I recommend it - this class you must take with the lecture anyway.",
    "It's required to go with the class (Smith's Atmosphere, Ocean and Environmental Change class) so if you're taking the class you have no choice. It's not hard though, one lab every 2 weeks and only 2 hours of lab a week.",
    "My only \"lab\" at Yale, definitely an enjoyable experience! The hands-on experiences of working with a theodolite, taking water samples at actual locations around New Haven, etc. was really enlightening and helped me to understand concepts from the lecture. I especially enjoyed the global warming debate, which helped me to understand exactly what topics are being considered by politicians and scientists and how the data can be interpreted.",
    "Well. If you're taking the class, you have to take the lab. It's not great, and I could honestly think of more valuable ways you could spend your time...but the fact that you get to take the class makes this lab worth it because it's a. not a huge amount of work and b. the class itself is very interesting and practical.",
    "A relatively fun way to learn about meteorological topics covered in class.1. Learn atmospheric measurement gauges2. Launch weather balloons from roof of KGL (fun)3. Field trip to various sites along local CT rivers (very interesting)4. Analyze statistical data (terribly dull)5. Global warming debate (interesting to see the \"other side\" of the debate)You are required to take the lab if you are in the lecture. Labs one week, reports due 2 weeks later. Is actually about 1\/2 credit worth of work.",
    "EVST 201L is a required lab course for Atmospheres. Very chill, at times boring, but overall easy.",
    "Necessary if you are taking EVST 201. A lot of people really liked it. I didn't but it was party because it was a requisite for my major that I had been putting off so I resented the time it took. Much easier and shorter than most other science labs though and you get to pretend to be a meteorologist.",
    "You have to take the lab to take the course, and the course is really great, the lab is OK but sometimes felt a little pointless, but it fits together with the course and is well-run and well-taught mostly. Not a highlight, but definitely not a horrible experience.",
    "Its required with the lecture...but its pretty interesting. Very painless labs, especially compared to chem lab or something.",
    "You have to take the lab with the course. It's not difficult in the least, and some of the field trips are quite fun. Probably the easiest lab you will take at yale.",
    "It was a bit pointless and dragged out but not the worst lab at Yale.",
    "If you're taking the lecture class, you also have to take this lab, and there could be far worse things you have to do, even though this lab isn't very exciting. There's a couple labs dealing with lab instruments, weather balloons, and data analysis, along with a fun field trip along the Quinnipiac River and a surprisingly interesting global warming debate at the end of the course. Lab is only 2 hours long at the most, and each lab lasts for two weeks, so there's only 4 lab reports and the debate. However, the lab reports are extremely tedious and mostly involving plotting lots of data on Excel and answering questions based on your graphs. By the fourth lab, this is extremely boring. Overall, the workload is low and simple, and it should definitely not deter you from taking the excellent lecture class. Things do depend on your TF, however \u0097\u00a0mine wasn't very good and that may bias my opinion.",
    "Fun lab!",
    "If you're reading this evaluation, you're likely taking the corresponding Atmospheres, Ocean, and Environmental Change course. If you've taken any sort of Chem lab, this will be easy. The labs sometimes interesting and sometimes tedious, but the bright side is you get two weeks to turn in a lab report."
