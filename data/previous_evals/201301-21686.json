    "218 is a fun and engaging introduction to the development of key aural skills. A must for musicians or anyone who wishes to refine their ear. A great half credit!",
    "Music 218 is a very rewarding class. I entered the class with a weaker musical background than the majority of the class, and so I struggled with the material. However, my struggles were mitigated by the fact that my instructor was extremely helpful. Because there is a keyboard lab component and homework for each class, I'd say that the .5 credit may be too low. However, it may just be that I had to put in more work because of where I started. Nevertheless, take this course!",
    "Very much a basic overview of musicianship skills. You learn ear-training and sight singing through melodic dictation, harmonic dictation and a variety of games aimed to help you. The farthest that we got was dictating and sight-singing examples with chromatic embellishments (lower neighbors) and modulating to a closely related key. If these seem simple to you, take 219. If not, the instructors are very patient.",
    "MUSI 218 helps you to develop your listening and dictation skills. I would definitely recommend it because I would say that every serious musician needs these skills. Overall, there isn't very much work. This was one of my favorite classes this year.",
    "A great class. Take it if you have some music experience and are comfortable dictating. A lot of fun and very low stress.",
    "Great course to improve your ear training and musicianship skills. You definitely need to take this if you have any intention on making or performing music. It's a lot of fun work, but if you really want to get a lot out of it, you need to put in the time and practice, especially for the keyboarding lab component."
