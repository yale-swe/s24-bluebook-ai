    "French 140 is a great grammar review as well as a great way to learn how to speak better.",
    "I would recommend it for another student if French is their chosen second language.",
    "French 140 was a good class. Before I took the class, I had hoped to improve my writing and speech, and I feel that I indeed have improved in these areas after taking this course. Professor Wing is encouraging, funny, and cool overall. I would recommend taking this class.",
    "You work on your french every day, read plenty of novels. Plenty of work, but you also learn plenty of french.",
    "French 140 is a solid continuation of French 130--more challenging texts, more vocabulary, more complex grammar. The workload is not substantially heavier. I would recommend it.",
    "4. It\u0092s an L4 French class. Take it if you need to. I was bored to tears at first, since I thought I could just jump straight to L5, but the intensive correction on speaking and writing was very helpful."
