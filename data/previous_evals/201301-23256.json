   "comments": [
    "The question the class seeks to answer is, why don't more people believe that global warming is a problem? It's very helpful in answering that question, but when it moves into the realm of how skeptics can be persuaded, it becomes silly, because each discussion is an echo chamber of like-minded do-gooders who agree that global warming would be fixed if only enough \"awareness\" were raised. Most people in the class seem to believe that \"raising awareness\" of the problem is more important than actually fixing the problem itself.I believe climate change is real, but that was probably lost on everyone in the class because I questionedthe effectiveness of \"raising awareness\" and also criticized a few oversimplifications and shortcuts taken by liberal politicians and media figures.If you're looking for an easy reading list, this one consists of New York Times op-eds, as well as a few longer social science reports that can be easily conquered by an experienced skimmer.Take the class and you will learn a few very interesting things and probably enjoy yourself.",
    "Professor Resch is engaging and responsive. She teaches not only how to write but also how to think and analyze.If you are a quantitatively oriented student, I think you will find this class greatly enjoyable!",
    "This class involves a lot of small writing assignments and two major writing assignments at the end. I would highly recommend it to another student.",
    "Do not take unless absolutely necessary.",
    "Despite the few problems I had with this class, I would still absolutely recommend it to anyone interested in writing and psychology. The syllabus features some fantastic authors, and all of the readings are truly thought-provoking. Climate change is an incredibly important subject, andlearning about the psychology behind it and how to write about it is all very interesting. To be honest, the workload is pretty light besides the two big papers that come towards the end of the semester, so this class is rarely a source of stress. Instead, you just get compelling conversation twice a week and you get to write short, creative pieces that are actually a lot of fun!",
    "This is a great class. Professor Resch is very chill and allows a lot of freedom during in class activities. If you like the topic, you will likely enjoy the class. Plus, just as with any other writing class, you get what you put in. So if you really work on your writing and try to write some polished drafts\/ assignments, you will get plenty of opportunities to play around with your style.",
    "This class is not like English 114. It is not as stressful but still giveyou a lot of practice with writing. The format of the class is great: we had many but short assignments in the beginning of the semester. That way, we were always working. It gave us excellent practice to write the essays. We only had two essays, both 6-8 pages long. Professor Resch has been the nicest professor I have had at Yale. She has reasonable expectations on our papers and provides very good feedback on our assignments. The readings for the class are all very interesting and provide very nice perspectives on climate change. Summary: Resch is awesome, light workload, and easy grading for an English class. PLEASE TAKE IT if you do not want to stress about your writing requirement!!!",
    "Would definitely recommend it as a relatively easy, laid back English class. Great writing credit that explores an interesting topic with a very manageable workload.",
    "Take the class if you are interested in the subject and want to learn simple ways to make your writing more effective. I learned a lot about the subject -- something that wouldn't have been taught in another course -- while learning to write."
