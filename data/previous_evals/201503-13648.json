    "I would recommend ENAS 559",
    "ENAS 559 is an awesomely challenging class that will make you think, above all else. You must be prepared to doing homework assignments without consulting answers in the back of a book. There is no book! And in some cases, you might feel like there are no answers. But, this is how you learn--or at least one very effective way to learn. You should take ENAS 559.",
    "It is a great course, one of the most rewarding courses I have taken. It is like drinking from a firehose however, and might not be everyone's cup of tea. Dr. Venkadesan is a very good teacher, and I highly recommend taking his courses, not just ENAS559, but any others that he offers. The grade is homework centric, and the grading is pretty liberal, so your focus can entirely be on learning and thinking. You will learn a lot of things in this course, some in more detail than others, specially contemporary research in the field. This course is a great primer in scientific paper reading, which is an essential skill in every grad student's kitty.",
    "A predominantly literature review class that aims to develop our critical thinking abilities on the subject.",
    "I would certainly recommend this course to another student. It is a lot of hard work but at the same time a delight to sit in the classes and work out the assignments. In case the fellow student is working in the same field, the course is a great way to make oneself familiar with the major concepts and state of the art in the field."

   "comments": [
    "Madhu really tailored the course to the students needs and was not afraid of going off course to offer information that may be needed in the research of some of his students. He brought an interesting twist to a biomechanics class through the analysis and critique of journal papers, a necessary attribute for a student researcher. Overall the class was a great experience!",
    "This course deepened my understanding of fundamental knowledge (in math, mechanics, control) to a great degree. This course contributed to my research in that it gave me a primer to optimization."
