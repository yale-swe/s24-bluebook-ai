    "If a friend were serious about learning Arabic and could not learn it through some other venue (abroad\/summer study, etc) then I would recommend Arbc 130 because it's pretty much the only option. However, I was overall quite disappointed in the course. I would not recommend it to a student who just needed to fulfill a language requirement.",
    "For the amount of work that this class requires, I feel like my Arabic really didn't improve (and maybe even regressed a bit). It is very disorganized and we often learn something, like new vocab or grammar concepts, and then don't review it all, so we all forget it. I find it sad and disgraceful that Yale has let its Arabic department become so dysfunctional. Ustath Aziz is a nice guy, but he's not a great teacher. He doesn't explain grammatical concepts very well and makes extremely difficult tests that we just aren't prepared for. He also changed the due dates\/descriptions of our final assignments many times at the end of the semester, which made it extremely hard to prepare for them.",
    "Arabic is one of the most important languages to learn right now. That is why I take Arabic and that is why I would recommend it to another student. The Yale Arabic department is notoriously bad, but at the same time if you really want to learn Arabic you should still take it. If at all possible, don't take it with Professor Aziz. You will be very frusterated. Use your TAs as much as possible and be prepared to independently teach yourself a lot of the material. If Arabic is your passion though, use these classes as a stepping stone to actually becoming fluent through study abroad later.",
    "I really don't know how I could recommend someone to take this course. If you really want to learn Arabic, I don't know what to say. I really don't feel like I am learning Arabic, I feel like the course could be done so much better, and I really am interested in learning the language. You can take the class, you can pass, but if you really don't apply yourself beyond the class (I am talking extra hours every day) then don't expect to really learn Arabic.",
    "I would not recommend ARBC 130 as it is structured now."
