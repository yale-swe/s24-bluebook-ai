    "Music 110 is a great class and presupposes no prior musical knowledge. It really allows you to develop an understanding of music fundamentals and the basics of composition. Despite having played piano for 10 years, I still felt as though I learned a lot from this course and am a better musician because of it. It's not too hard either, so don't let your lack of prior experience deter you from taking this course.",
    "If you are at all interested in music theory, do not hesitate to take this course! And if you can, take it with Josh! I always looked forward to going to class because the environment was non-intimidating, yet I learned SO much! I cannot recommend his section too highly.",
    "would definitely recommend this, great grade boost for people who know music already",
    "It's great if you want to take music theory but have never had any formal training. I'd take it early so you can take higher classes.",
    "I would recommend this class to any person who is interested\/enjoys music and wants to understand the mechanics behind it. Some students had a little bit of previous music background, but from a variety of different places, and some students had none. Having makes that background makes the class easier, but if you don't it's totally possible to understand everything and do well."
