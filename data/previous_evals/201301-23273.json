    "English 114 is a good course that allows you to explore writing academic papers through the lens of a specific topic. Here, the topic was empathy, and it was very interesting, more interesting than I thought.If you would like someplace to start, and are not confident with your own abilities in writing, start here.",
    "If you can take a class with Christine, do it. She is an incredibly nice person and plans out the classes such that they're not a chore to go to. However, this class was a LOT of reading every night on top of the four papers. The subject is interesting, even if you've never thought about empathy before. It was definitely worthwhile taking this class.",
    "Yes. I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. Especially as a freshman, leaning to write at the college level is incredibly important. As a potential science major, I decided that this kind of analytic writing would be very helpful for me in the future. The class is fantastic and everyone should take it!",
    "Good solid writing class.",
    "Yes. Great readings.",
    "This course was immensely helpful for my writing. I feel as though I've gained so much and that my writing has improved.I look forward to applying that which I've learnt to future papers."
