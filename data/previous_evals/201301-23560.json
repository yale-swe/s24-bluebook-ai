I especially appreciated the no-technology rule in the classroom, and found that Prof. Graedel then adjusted his pace in an appropriate way. Great class discussion all the time, and it meant a lot that Prof. Graedel learned all of our names. The travel opportunity was wonderful, and I learned so much.Thank you to the whole team!",

    "Tying the readings back in to the course - I did very few of them and regret this, but they were easy to neglect.",
    "It was pretty good actually.",
    "The content could be better organised. It seemed a little disjointed.Also there could be more emphasis on other aspects of Industrial Ecology, such as Industrial Symbiosis. (Instructor focused a lot on his own research area).",
    "The spring break trips need to be better organized - for example, I think the projects should be assigned earlier and the projects that require travel should have some logistics pre-arranged such as housing.",
    "Dr. Graedel often used graphics in his lectures that he could not explain well when questioned. This made the lectures less engaging than they could have been.",
    "The fact that only some groups traveled for fieldwork was a little bit disappointing.",
    "The MFA assignment was very difficult and we were not given appropriate knowledge in class to complete this assignment. It was a very interesting assignment, but it would be good to give a longer time period to complete it (at least two or three weeks), and it requires a technical workshop from Nedal to explain how to use STAN. In addition, an entire lecture should be devoted to explaining how to do this assignment appropriately, as it took all of us dozens of hours of working together and asking each other and the TA questions, in order to figure out how to complete it.",
    "Way too much time spent on the theoretical, academic aspects of IE. Most students are not going to to become industrial ecologists or similar scientists, so we are more interested int he applied aspects of IE.",
    "ensure that projects are feasible at an early stage",
    "The lectures were slow moving and repetitive. We were not trained in class to do anything related to the assignments. The class could be much stronger if we had lectures devoted specifically to what MFAs and LCAs are and how to conduct one step by step.",
    "More writing about the readings. Incorporate some level of peer evaluation, either for coursework or feedback for participation in group projects. This can often be more valuable than TF feedback."

I wish we spent more time on quantitative tools\/concepts because I expect most my work will involve higher levels of data analysis and such.

I think the project we're working on is a little too broad and it's been challenging trying to wrap our heads around how\/where to place our boundaries. Nedal and Clare Gupta have been very helpful, though.",
    "The project was too sizeable to handle alone, but the group shirked a lot of work. One person did very little, but this will not impact their grade. There is no accountability.",
    "Advantages: solve problems\/experience the application of IE to real world issues.Disadvantages: group members not always rational\/reasonable.",
    "the group work needs to have a peer review feedback component. The work was widely unevenly distributed in my team and no way for that to be incorporated into the grade received.",
    "The team project was my favorite part of the course. Traveling together as a team brought us closer, because we had to work out logistics and get through mishaps together. There was a little friction at times, but learning how to work through it was as educational as the research itself. Plus I made some good friends and a lot of great professional connections during the trip.",
    "My group members were great and I really enjoyed the overall process.",
    "The group work was the best aspect of this class. It provided an excellent learning opportunity for us to really delve into Industrial Ecology and apply the tools we were learning in class.The group projects should have been lined up before the class started, and the application for assignment for group project teams should have been completed in the first week of class so that students can take their project into account when deciding whether or not to take the class. We were only told we would be going to Hawaii less than 3 weeks before spring break, which did not give us adequate time to make travel arrangements, as nearly everything was already booked given that spring break in Hawaii is very busy. We spent dozens of hours making travel arrangements for Hawaii which were more expensive and time-consuming than they otherwise would have been had we been able to plan in advance. In addition, we spent all of our time leading up to spring break making travel arrangements and had almost no time to devote to background research on our project, contacting stakeholders, and setting up meetings, so we arrived in Hawaii feeling very unprepared. If the project groups are confirmed at the beginningof the semester, we would have far more time to devote to adequately preparing for the trip and ensuring that we are meeting with the appropriate stakeholders and were sufficiently prepared for each meeting.",
    "This is the part of the class that needs fixing. Everything else is great. The group projects, oy vey. Some people just don't know how to talk to research subjects and lack interview skills. Really rude. There really should be a mandatory workshop on qualitative methods skills for people assigned to the projects involving travel and interviews.",
    "Good to double check and walk through problems with peers.",
    "advantages: check and balances on approachesdisadvantages: coordinating people's agendas",
    "In this class, group members' vision for the project were not aligned. One person didn't carry their weight.",
    "The group work gave us multiple people to conduct interviews and do field work, but the disadvantage was that not everyone contributed equally.",
    "Working with the group was fine. Although we received very little guidance on setting the framework for the research project, and our relationship with the \"client\" (Bridgeport) was not that helpful because they were not very invested in the outcome of the project."
