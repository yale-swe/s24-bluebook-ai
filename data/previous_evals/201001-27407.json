   "comments": [
    "Yes, take it if you haven't taken Spanish in a while, but feel ready to tackle more sophisticated grammar concepts after a few class sessions. Tests and concepts can be challenging, but fair overall. Great bridge for high school spanish classes and higher-level spanish college classes.",
    "This class will improve your Spanish a lot. It will clear up many of those little grammar nuances that you wondered about, and I feel much more confident in my speaking and writing. The work isn't too hard and I didn't think there was too much of it, also the class was not boring with Profesora Seymour. Take this class!",
    "Spanish 243 provides an intensive and deep study of the intricacies of Spanish grammar. I would highly recommend it to other students who want a better understanding of the language and its constructions.",
    "It is essential if you want to move towards fluency at Yale. However, it was slightly below my expectations. I was expecting true grammatical analysis, including using technical terms and even a linguistic approach, I was hoping this might include taking am occasional literary text and analyzing it grammatically. After all, it was ADVANCED Spanish grammar. However, the course was mainly memorizing expressions and constructions that we applied in boring, repetitive drills. The same goes for class time. The homework was not hard, and easy to get full credit for. I guess they were effective in setting in what you just studied, but I will admit, they did take a lot of time. I enjoy writing in Spanish though, so they weren't much of a problem for me. The course is not organized in the best way. I sort of felt like the textbook it was based on was organized arbitrarily. There was a vast difference between this class and the intensive intermediate class I took last semester. We did not talk that much in class, and my speaking certainly didn't improve. However, all in all, I can say I learned a lot of new stuff this semester, but I wouldn't necessarily say I am that much better at Spanish.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this class to anyone wanting to improve and hone their Spanish grammatical skills. Very well-run and organized. You learn a lot in a semester."
