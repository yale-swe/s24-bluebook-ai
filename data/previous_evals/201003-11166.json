    "This was probably the best course I've taken at Yale. I learned a lot and was challenged in a safe but productive atmosphere. Ali is a professor unlike any other seminar leader, remarkably intelligent but highly approachable. Just be warned that the class tended to attract students with similar ideologies, which allowed us to cover a lot of ground but might be frustrating for a more conservative student.",
    "This course offers a broad, global perspective on sexual rights; it is historical, analytic and theoretical. In this class you will learn about key sexual rights issues (i.e., trafficking, rape, marriage, LGBT rights) from an academic and legal lens. It is a challenging course, and in order to fully benefit from it you need to commit yourself to the readings and participate in the class discussions.I would absolutely recommend this course to others, in fact I already have."

    "This course helped me to gain a deeper understanding of the sexual rights issues that impact populations in the developing world; specifically in relation to national and international law. More importantly, this course held me to a standard of participation and critical analysis that has made me a better student."
