   "comments": [
    "This class is very promising, but its lustre dulls fast.",
    "It's a really broad overview of different topics and disciplines. You learn a lot! Exams are really tricky. I would recommend this class if you are interested in the topics.",
    "LING 116 is an introduction to the study of language using linguistics and cognitive science. The essential question is whether humans have an innate grammar, about how much nature dominates the nature vs. nurture fight.",
    "Go see the professor for help! I went to every lecture and did all the readings and still sometimes came out of it confused (for a select few topics, definitely not for everything). I didn't like the TA's at all but Prof. Frank was really cool. So I would definitely suggest going to see him if you need more explanations to understand a certain topic. Also, make sure to actually study for the exams. They're mostly multiple choice with a few short answers, but that means that if you don't know things, the points come off really quickly.",
    "Very interesting material, though you will need to work harder than you might expect from a class that only has three homework assignments.",
    "I would highly recommend this class! But beware - the homework assignments are a fair amount of work. The course can also get pretty technical at times, but not enough to scare away any humanities\/social sciences majors (take it from one).",
    "This is a cool class! I took it for an easy social science credit, which it was - we only ended up being assigned three of the promised five homeworks, and the tests were mostly multiple choice. The final wasn't even cumulative! But I definitely learned a lot of interesting things about grammar and how it works in the brain and saw a lot of cool experimental results. Metacognition at its best! Professor Frank was enthusiastic and fun, and I don't really have any complaints about the class. Take it!",
    "I was warned against this class by many of my friends, who called it too technical and very difficult. I found it just the opposite: well-spoken and conceptually attainable. I will grant that the readings were, as warned, technical -- I have no doubt the class would be a hard read for humanities majors -- but for anyone fluent with the usual disfluencies of sciencese, the reading was a reasonable breeze. More importantly, the class presentation was done well and in the vernacular, keeping the course overall accessible to anyone of reasonable background. Most importantly of all, the homeworks and tests were very much centered on measuring your conceptual understanding, not on gauging your fluency with jargon. I'm told this is a rare thing for a technical science course; whatever the case, I like it. It reminds you that the point of learning is learning, not buzzwords.",
    "An overview of the intersection between cogsci and linguistics. Some of the material is very interesting, some is emphatically uninteresting. Take if you have a strong interest in either of these fields--otherwise I'd probably avoid it, as there are better classes out there. The readings are sometimes long and technical, and doing them is unnecessary to your success in the class. Problem sets are annoying, as they counted for a large portion of the final grade but always seemed sort of thrown together and arbitrarily graded.",
    "I would recommend this class only if you've already taken a cognitive science or linguistics class before. This class has a lot of interesting material if you're interested in either of those fields, but is not really an intro course. It's a lot to take in if this is the first time you've been exposed to cognitive science or linguistics.",
    "This is a good class if you are interested in linguistics OR cog sci. They do a good job of relating everything to cog sci so some of the more technical linguistics is not as intense or tedious as it could be.",
    "Solid course with interesting material if you're interested in neuroscience, language, linguistics or even literature. Problem sets were infrequent but sometimes too puzzling\/sudden (in terms of the concepts tested), but exams were very fair and the content is definitely manageable.",
    "A good class - definitely if you're interested in linguistics. But you absolutely have to be interested in linguistics, not just cognitive science. I was, and so I enjoyed the class a lot. The kinds of connections we think work one way and we learn actually work in a different way are revealed in this class. We covered questions such as: Do Russian speakers perceive shades of blue differently because they have different words for them? What kinds of languages CAN exist - and why can't we create just any artificial language? How do deaf children use sign language to communicate and understand the world around them? This was an awesome class.",
    "Way harder than I was expecting. They rope you in with traditional psych concepts at the beginning and then you get blindsided by a lot of more algorithmic stuff later on. Interesting course though, definitely well taught and good.",
    "This was an extremely interesting and engaging course. I had always been interested in language acquisition and other aspects of language. I would definitely recommend this class if you are interested in the topic. This is the kind of subject that I find myself having long, thoughtful conversations with other people about.",
    "This is an overview of linguistics and the mind. I would take it if you are interested in linguistics but it was a little difficult to follow sometimes for someone who had never taken a linguistics class before. Do the reading because it helps support the lecutre and make sure you go to class because if would be very difficult to learn on your own since there is no textbook. The homework and tests are kind of hard so do not take this as an easy 5th class. But so interesting!",
    "Take it if you like hearing about a lot of the current\/recent work being done in the field, and if you want to delve deeper into concepts about how we communicate that you've never really stopped to think about before!",
    "The course is an excellent, must take course. Professor Frank is a great teacher who makes his lectures fun and engaging. Throughout the course, we learned the fundmental components of how we represent and create language, what we have been endowed with naturally to assist us in language learning, and cases of language development in the blind, deaf, etc. The course is amazing, the workload is not all that heavy, it is a great course to take!",
    "Ling 116 is a great introduction to the field of linguistics, with a fun cognitive science twist. It goes through the basic important topics of linguistics, but never loses sight of larger questions about how the mind works and what are the relationships between different faculties of the mind. The work load is totally reasonable--just a few homework assignments and 3 exams--and the class is overall a lot of fun. Bob Frank is a great lecturer.",
    "This is a great intro course if it matches your interests. Go to the review sessions!",
    "This class was extremely interesting and I learned a lot. Barely requires work as long as you go to the lectures, which are very informative. Consisted of 3 midterm exams, the \"final\" being the easiest if all. Professor Frank is passionate about linguistics and was very good at teaching topics that weren't always easy to grasp.",
    "I enjoyed this class a lot. It had something for everyone. It began as a wonderful split between an introductory cognitive science class and an introductory linguistics class (both of which I shopped last fall), and then branched off into more detail in phonology, vocal production, syllable structure, syntax, and cognitive processing as modeled by computer-like algorithms. Sometimes subjects became more technical than was interesting for me, but we never spent too long on any one area and then would move on to something else engaging. Three exams, evenly weighted (no final), primarily multiple choice and very straight-forward. Only three assignments. Readings were not vital but they were interesting. Professor Frank is a wonderfully engaging and enthusiastic lecturer, and an incredibly approachable and supportive teacher. A very manageable class and one of the best I've taken at Yale.",
    "Great class, not especially taxing, but not a gut. Really interesting material, good for that So credit.",
    "Cog sci of language was definitely a fun class for someone with an interest in both cognitive science and linguistics. I took this as an elective (I'm a physics major) and thought it was exactly what I was looking for. The material is wide-ranging and interesting, and Bob Frank is awesome! There were only three homework assignments all semester and two midterms, so there was not much work. Furthermore, the assigned readings were not necessary to do well on the exams (I barely read any of them and did fine). I greatly enjoyed lectures and would strongly recommend the class to someone interested in the material!",
    "This was a very good class. The curriculum goes through quite a few topics, including statistics, evidence for universal grammar, perception, sentence structure, language acquisition, etc. Each topic on the curriculum can be pretty different and you'll probably like some and dislike others. If you took Intro to Cognitive Science previously you'll notice a lot of similarities and will pick up on some things more quickly, but the class is also very accessible even if you didn't take Intro CogSci. The class is also more about linguistics than cognitive science, so you should be interested in linguistics if you decide to take the class. Overall I thought it was good and would recommend it.",
    "LING 116 is a class that stretches a mile wide but only an inch deep. If you're interested in cognitive science, know that this class focuses more on the linguistics than the cog sci. Prof Frank is a great guy who knows his stuff and makes class interesting, but the material itself can get pretty boring, especially in the middle third of the class. The exams are more difficult than expected, but not unbearable. The problems sets are fairly straightforward. Overall not a class that I would take again, but not one that I regret taking either.",
    "If you're at all interested in linguistics, I'd definitely recommend this course. It's more heavy on the linguistics than the Cognitive Science, but it's interesting nonetheless. Professor Frank is very excited about the material, which makes it a fun class to be a part of. The workload is pretty minimal, but you learn a ton. I'd recommend doing the readings even though they're not strictly required. The tests are much easier if you've read.",
    "CGSC 216 is a class that looks at the mental processes behind language. It covers a ton of different topics, though this makes it difficult for the class to have any major solid themes, which can become frustrating.",
    "I dropped this class. I found myself interested in the applications of the findings people have made through the study of language cognition, but not in the field itself. What I mean by this is that I found it interesting that by studying language, people have been able to successfully treat kids with social disorders. I did not find the cognitive methodology behind language production interesting. I found myself falling behind in lecture, failing to understand the technical concepts, and since the problem sets were all about these technical concepts, I did badly. The tests too took the material to a level I was not prepared to handle. The professor was friendly, engaging, easy to approach, and an excellent, interesting lecturer. Truth be told I was irresponsible about using him and the TAs as resources. I do not know whether or not I would recommend this course- I think it comes down to whether or not you are interested enough to exert yourself.",
    "As a psych major, I was not prepared for the amount of linguistic theory and philosophy in this course. Although Professor Frank is very nice and helpful, the lectures were difficult to follow."
