   "comments": [
    "Definitely take this course: one of the best classes I have taken at Yale. It's by no means an easy class -- each Monday, you are assigned 3-5 scientific articles to read for Wednesday (A LOT of reading) -- but you will learn so much. This course definitely taught me how to think like a scientist, and it's really cool to hear how basic science can explain diseases in many different areas.",
    "You won't learn much information, in the strict sense, in this class. It's all about applying stuff you already know to understanding the current state of scientific exploration of various diseases. I loved it because: I got to listen to lectures from some of my favorite MB&B profs (Schatz, Sung, J. Steitz, Neugebauer) and I got to meet a few that I hadn't heard lecture before; we read some really cool basic science papers; everything was very up-to-date (Joan often brought up scientific investigations that were in progress or had recently been published). The paper-reading isn't nearly as bad as previous course evals suggest it to be. 2 hours per week, tops. Group quiz every Wednesday, midterm mini-review, final paper proposing new treatment\/exploration of a disease. Overall an awesome class.",
    "Very interesting course. I learned a lot about the state of knowledge of unique diseases. I also learned how to read scientific papers with relative ease.",
    "This class is awesome! It's quite difficult in terms of the concepts covered in the papers, but is very worthwhile, and the group assignments and quizzes are very doable if you put in the time. The final paper is very challenging and requires a lot of time, but is a very effective exercise.",
    "Great link between basic science and medicine; you really learn a lot in a relaxed setting",
    "Great course. You apply and expand what you know about biochemistry from 301. Get much better at reading literature. Not to hard to cruise through but you get out of it what you put in.",
    "Yes, I would recommend. Weekly group tests on Wednesdays covering Monday lecture and readings is stressful but overall rewarding.",
    "Awesome class. Really interesting. Not difficult",
    "The Medical Impact of Basic Science will challenge you to apply what you have learned in MB&B 300 and 301 to develop an understanding of a series of human diseases at a molecular level. On the first day of class each week, you will hear a member of the MB&B department lecture on the biochemical mechanisms underlying a specific disease or class of diseases, and you will be assigned review articles and two to three research articles on that subject. On the second day of class, you will respond to a series of questions based on or motivated by the reading, either in groups or individually. The Medical Impact of Basic Science was one of the best courses I have taken at Yale, and I would strongly recommend it to any MB&B major interested in understanding the molecular bases of human disease. The course covers illnesses ranging from pandemic influenza to progeria and demonstrates how defects at the levels of DNA, RNA, and protein can cause disease. Based on what I have heard from my classmates, I think that this class is one of the more challenging and work-intensive upper-level electives in MB&B. However, the sheer amount of material you will learn and the excellent quality of teaching justify the effort the course requires. This class will teach you to read primary literature critically and will refine your ability to think scientifically. In the end, you should emerge with a greater appreciation for how understanding the molecular mechanisms of human disease can yield novel, targeted therapies."
