   "comments": [
    "It's a great course that takes an evolutionary approach to understanding a range of contemporary human behaviors. It definitely presents something to think about without putting too much stock in evolutionary theory. Take it if you're interested!",
    "This course is a great ah to learn about evolutionary theory and it's application to human culture and behavior. The readings are very managable and the course in completely essay based, so there is not the stress of memorizing terms for an exam, but you still learn a lot and write about interesting topics.",
    "I enjoyed Anthropology 270. Though I am primarily interested in studying non-human primates, the class offered an interesting and novel way to understand human behavior. The work load is definitely doable. We had to write three five-page papers, one three-pager, and a final paper of approximately ten pages. Not bad! Though Professor Watts has a drier lecture style than some students might appreciate, it is an efficient way of covering a huge amount of information in a short amount of time. Also, I've found that his interest in helping students is unparalleled; if you ever have a question, he is always willing to answer after class or via email. His responses are prompt, and he goes above and beyond to ensure you have all the information.",
    "Maybe. The material is incredibly interesting, but it needs to be presented in a more engaging manner.",
    "I would recommend this if you are interested in evolutionary behavior. It is in complete lecture format, but the lectures are quite interesting and the workload is rather low. Overall, a good course."
