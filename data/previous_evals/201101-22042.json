    "if you want to stay in shape in japanese, you'll do youself a big favor by just reading, watching movies, and memorizing vocab on your own.",
    "Basically the same as the class during the fall semester. Largely reading-based (plus the subsequent discussions\/homework about the readings), with short weekly Kanji quizzes. Readings have a good range of fiction, criticism, news. There are also individual speeches and some multimedia (though not as much, it seems, as the other Japanese classes). This is probably the class at Yale furthest from having a set syllabus; if you really want to do something and talk to Hiroe-sensei the class will probably end up doing it.Hiroe-sensei is super-chill about things like tardiness or not turning in homework on time. He's also a caring, funny, knowledgeable guy who's fun to get to know. We'd have out-of-class lunches at HGS that were always a great time. Still, though, this class is occasionally a lot of work. You're reading tough texts and answering tough questions, or writing responses on tough topics.I've lived in Japan and took this with the hope of just keeping up my Japanese at best (the class is only twice a week), but ended up learning tons, without the stress of my other classes.",
    "Great class, a good balance between different sets of skills necessary in learning a language. The homework is abundant and time consuming, but not too difficult."
