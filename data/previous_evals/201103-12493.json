   "comments": [
    "Okay, so, SUBHOJOY IS THE BOMB. He was an incredible teacher; he's far better than some of the Math faculty that teach 120. He's really understanding and very available for help with the material, which is fantastic. Our calc class scored much higher on the second midterm than the average because he prepared us so well.That being said, I would NOT recommend Math 120 to another student. Frankly, it concentrates far too much on area and surface area of 3D shapes, which is pretty boring. If you can take another class instead, do so. If not, the material isn't too complicated; you just have to keep yourself engaged.",
    "Take it if you really need to. Multi-variable calculus is a good course to take in general but if you struggle with math then try and avoid it. The exams do get hard and if you have a bad teacher then it can get very hard to understand the material.",
    "MATH 120 is a basic introduction to calculus of multiple variables. First, we learned a bunch of operations (dot products, cross products, partial derivatives, double integrals, triple integrals), then we proved various identities between the different operations and used them to evaluate certain properties of a function.If you're looking at this course, you probably have to take it for some requirement. It's definitely manageable. I didn't ever take Calc BC and I got by just fine (Iwent to one extra session with my prof to learn L'Hopital's rule and integration by parts, which were the only things necessary from BC). By any means possible, GET SUBHOJOY AS YOUR PROFESSOR. He's the most helpful teacher I've ever had.",
    "You're probably taking it because it is required for you. The class is good and the material is covered well, but the unfortunate lack of proofs made it difficult for me to understand where the material came from, so I sometimes felt as if I was just blindly applying the formulas and was not really thinking or understanding what I was calculating. This is especially true later in the class, as the exact meaning of what Stokes' Theorem and divergence theorem are is left somewhat vague.",
    "Math 120 is a great course. I felt like we didn't get through a whole lot of material, but what I do know I understand. Class is all about the how-to-solves but rarely the how-comes. This class got me excited about math again after a year's hiatus.",
    "Look, you know if you need to take this class or not. Take it with Subhojoy if you can, your life will be much better",
    "I thought this course was very boring, and this is coming from someone who thought single variable calculus was interesting. It's hard to say why exactly math 120 is so uninteresting and un-fun, but it just is. I was lucky enough to have an amazing instructor (take it with Gupta if you can), but I still wonder if I made the right decision in taking the course. All I will say is that you should think twice about taking this course if you don't need it for your major, because I haven't talked to one person in math 120 yet who's enjoyed it.",
    "I loved Gupta. He is an amazing teacher and will make your time in calc so much easier and so much more fun. His lectures are always very well organized, and he takes the time to explain things carefully so that no one is left behind. In addition to holding great review sessions before each test, he sends out notes and sample problems that are VERY helpful. He will even hold extra office hours before exams (he was available every day during reading week and exam week). He has these unbelievably funny moments that will put a smile on your face for the rest of the day. He is very supportive, friendly, and approachable. He genuinely cares about his students and will provide you with as much support as you need. Math 120 is a great course if you have a great professor. It is one of the most insightful and practical courses I've ever taken. Stick with Gupta and you will definitely not regret it.",
    "Get ready for an uphill climb--but a rewarding one, in my opinion. The curve is really steep so if you are premed\/obsessed with grades, be forewarned.",
    "Good class, take it with Subhojoy, he's excellent. Our class's average on the mid-terms was far higher than the mean for a reason. Subhojoy explains things clearly, he's willing to help you outside of class for an infinite number of hours, he makes all the corny math jokes you can expect in a math class, and he's just a generally great teacher. One of the best I've ever had.Also, his review sessions are just incredible. I skipped a lot of class over the semester and just showed up to these two hour sessions and learned everything needed for exams.The class itself was solid. The final was rough but everything else was very easy. The whole class builds up to the last three weeks when you learn the key theorems of MVC.",
    "Just be prepared to put in extra work to truly understand the material",
    "you gotta do what you gotta do",
    "Don't take it unless you need to. Going into it, I actually kind of liked math (although that may just have been because up until then, I considered myself pretty good at it). Coming out of it, I hate it and am just relieved that the class is over.",
    "Take it if you're interested--it's interesting material. Or if you have to.",
    "Math doesn't come easy to me so Math 120 was a bit of a struggle at times. I don't regret taking the class at all but don't let yourself ever get behind because all the concepts build on each other. Gupta was an amazing professor and if you take the class, you should definitely try to get his section. You could tell he really wanted his students to thoroughly understand the material.",
    "Mathematics 120 04 is a decent course that covers the concepts and techniques in multivariable calculus. The workload and difficulty of exams are reasonable. However, the class never goes into applications of the material. If you want a math class that discusses applications, I would recommend ENAS 151 (multivariable calculus for engineers).",
    "This was a great course! As you reach the end of the course, the material gets more difficult, but Subhojoy made himself available for office hours to make sure everyone understood the material. If you are thinking of taking this course, take it with Subhojoy!",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to any student who is interested in taking multivariable calc. Subhojoy is a great teacher--he goes above and beyond to offer review sessions and extra practice, especially around exams. The workload really depends on how much practice it takes you to learn the material, but the graded weekly problem sets are manageable.",
    "I lucked out with Subhojoy Gupta, but it seems to just be a regular, have-to-do-it math class. Go ahead and take it.",
    "I would recommend taking Math 120 with Subhojoy Gupta. He was a great professor; easy to understand and follow and has neat handwriting (which makes taking notes in class much easier). Additionally, the class has a lot of applications for anyone considering taking other classes in math or in any of the hard sciences.",
    "If you did well in a typical high school calculus class (i.e.,Calculus BC) you should be well prepared to take Math 120. Most of the course material is quite manageable although near the end with Stokes Theorem and such it gets a little more difficult. However, if you do the problem sets and put in a little effort, the exams shouldn't be too difficult. As for the professors, that's a bit hit-or-miss. Obviously there was Michael Frame who everyone wants but I had Subhojoy who was also a very good instructor and who I would highly recommend. On the other hand, when another Math 120 prof (can't remember his name) subbed in for Subhojoy one day, the other students and I were appalled by his mediocre teaching ability.",
    "Math 120 is like Calculus you would take in high school, but it is in 3 dimensions and studies different theorems. I would most certainly reccommend this class to anybody, especially with Subhojoy Gupta.",
    "Not surprisingly, Math 120 is a difficult class, especially if you're not someone who is math inclined. The first half of the semester is pretty easy, especially if you've seen vectors before, but it definitely nosedives after the first midterm. Honestly, if you don't think you might need this class for you major, I wouldn't recommend it; for me, it was way too much time spent on a subject I realized about a month in I had no passion for at all.",
    "Really good class for students who know basic single variable calculus and graphs.",
    "Mathematics 120 is a fantastically taught course. There was ample help, the textbook was very useful and the examinations were fair. Multi-variable calculus is something everyone should know because it has such a wide range of applications. In short, TAKE IT AND TAKE IT WITH SUBHOJOY"
