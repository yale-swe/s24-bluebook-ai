    "This class is really interesting but a lot of work. Don't expect it to be a walk in the park for your senior year. Doug asks a lot (although he is leaving so I'm not sure if this class is even going to continue on). You'll learn and it'll be great",
    "I would certainly recommend this class to any Econ student that wanted a challenge and a supportive environment. Unfortunately, I don't think it will be offered ever again, since Prof. McKee is leaving. Nonetheless, it's one of the best classes I've taken at Yale and I can't speak highly enough of it.",
    "I would recommend this course. It is one of the best I have ever taken at Yale.",
    "You must take it if you do want to learn something as an econ undergrad",
    "Yes if you're interested in reading economic papers. I'd recommend some familiarity with econometric techniques, but it's not necessary. I had forgotten everything from Econ 130, but re-learned what I needed to remember.",
    "DEFINITELY TAKE IT IF YOU ARE AN ECON MAJOR! GREAT WAY TO THINK ABOUT THESIS IF YOU ARE A JUNIOR",
    "Easily the best economics class I've taken. The workload isn't very daunting and I felt like all of it was very effective in actually getting me to understand the material. Probably he best prep for economics research \/\/ a great guide to see if you want to do a thesis. it's a shame that Dougie McBuckets is leaving!",
    "This has been without a doubt the best Econ class I have taken at Yale. Professor McKee is an incredible professor. He really cares about having his students understand and engage with the material to the best of their abilities. The workload is pretty fair: every week you read 3 papers and submit a worksheet on them, an in class presentation (which Professor McKee heavily assists you with), and a final paper. While the final paper was definitely one of the hardest papers I have written at Yale, it was also the most rewarding in that you really engage with a subject material.",
    "it's not being offered anymore with McKee, so why does it matter :(",
    "Economics of Human Capital in Latin America is a great introduction to the field, exposing how difficult even seemingly simple poverty questions are, and providing students a crash course in econometric methods. Students dig deep into current literature and learn themselves how to engage critically with the literature as well as create a proposal for research of their own. The class is an excellent choice for an economics senior seminar, especially because the teaching is unusually good for econ at Yale.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class!! The assignments are useful and interesting! I genuinely looked forward to class!",
    "Highly recommend this course to another student again, probably the best I have taken in the Economics department. Professor McKee cares a lot about his students and takes time outside the classroom to help with the material and components of the research proposal. It is a challenging course for those without significant econometrics background, but the topics are really interesting and definitely left me with good working knowledge of key econometric techniques in modern economics research."
