    "Principles of Operating Systems teaches a lot of core concepts in computer science (memory management, process management, storage, file system, virtual machines, and distributed systems). Our year, there was a good bit of overlap with CS323 but with a little bit more depth on those topics. There were 5 problem sets that took 1-2 hours each, a midterm, and a final, so the workload was very light.",
    "If you want an east CS credit, take it. Otherwise, don't. It's just a TON of relatively easy material, meaning the tests are essentially vocabulary tests where they pick 30-40 terms out of a pool of 1000. Grading should be fine, but IMO you'd be better off taking something else.",
    "If you're looking for a fairly gutty CS class, this is probably a good one. There is no programming, and each of the 5 assignments took no more than 2.5 hours. The lectures are all online so you can use those to study for the tests, so you don't really have to go to class.If you're looking for an easier CS credit or want to get the basics of OS's, this is for you. If you want to really learn about OS's though, take the one in the spring.",
    "Really easy CS credit. You actually learn something if you pay attention when reading\/studying.",
    "It was a very easy course that didn't require much regular work (you could just cram for the exams). However, that might have been because this was the first time this course was taught. I think the course is bound to change next year (if it is taught again).",
    "This class is new. While the idea of teaching principles without implementation is not bad, I don't think it works very well with the operating system subject. Most of the concepts covered tend to be too dry and not very interesting to learn. Lecture attendance goes down through the semester as the material is thought word for word from the text book or slides. The so called problem sets were not real problems to engage the student. The class is definitely easy if one has a hectic semester and needs an easy elective but there is basically nothing interesting to learn here.",
    "CS423 is a great course for expanding your knowledge of the fundamentals that make up computer software, especially in Linux systems. For example, before coming in I had already worked on a few low-level multi-threaded systems, but this is the first time I have truly had a formal explanation of the theory behind it, beyond just mutexes and semaphores, and how these apply to modern operating systems (deadlock avoidance, resource allocation, etc.). The tests were perhaps too focused on specific tidbits from the slides rather thanimportant conceptual ideas, but the professor is a great teacher and the class is enjoyable overall.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student."
