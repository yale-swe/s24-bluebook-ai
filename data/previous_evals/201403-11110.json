    "I would say that, unless you are already a meter wiz who has studied a bunch of this stuff on your own, you'll be learning a great amount of new information and skills that you'll rightly feel you should have known earlier. I would also make sure to emphasise that the course will culminate in your being allowed to investigate almost anything of your choice (outside of nineteenth-century Europe) for a beautiful fusion of the course's material and your own peculiar interests--you will almost definitely find fascinating overlaps no matter what you may decide to write about. Definitely recommended, especially to anyone who thinks that metric analysis is just lining up dots.",
    "This course explores the various methods of engaging with rhythm and meter in music of all genres and styles. A highly thought-provoking seminar for any curious music student.",
    "MUSI 952 should be considered an essential\/highly encouraged experience for all entrants to the music theory PhD program. As the course stresses, the time domain is systematically understudied in music theory broadly. This seminar represents an opportunity to gain some entre into the topic with one of it's most influential scholars living today. The seminar carefully brings forward a number of issues involved in metrical analysis with some selected repertoires. I found the course's use of specific introductory tutorial materials in addition to available published scholarship to be very helpful.",
    "Metric States and Scripts provides a combination of an overview of rhythm\/meter-related thought and Rick Cohn's own take on the topic, built on his various publications and past seminars. It's a great opportunity for a fairly traditional kind of music-theoretical practice; there is no shying away from abstraction, and individual or unusual hearings of pieces provide the starting points for much of the discussion. I highly recommend the course, particularly for anyone who is familiar with Cohn's work on harmony and who would like to see another side of his thought.",
    "The course focuses on the different ways that musical meter can be conceived, focusing on 19th century music for much of the class but also including popular music and non-western music. The class investigates the interactions that create a sense of meter in music. I would recommend the class. I really enjoyed the course, learned a lot, and I think improved my musical understanding."

   "question_text": "How did this course deepen your knowledge of your discipline\/profession? To what extent did this course contribute to your dissertation\/research?",
   "comments": [
    "Meter is certainly one area of music theory that is currently trending, at least in some circles, and so gaining a deeper knowledge of it is important in that short-term sense. I also see it as important because I believe that it will (or at least certainly should) stay an important part of analysis even when it is no longer trending. Because I am expecting my own research topics to more harmonically focused, I think this course will help very much as a counterweight to the potential to forget the other elements of music--from now on, a miniature Rick Cohn will live in my head reminding me, \"Don't forget about meter, now!\" whenever I am most likely to do so.",
    "This seminar was a useful graduate level introduction to an area of music theory that I had little previous experience with. Thus, I now find myself able to better engage and think with more sensitivity about research on meter and rhythm that I might not have otherwise had much insight into. I am unsure as yet what role the specific concepts addressed might have in my future dissertation; this seminar was, as mentioned, a foray into a new area for me in which I felt rather out of my comfort zone but a valuable seminar nonetheless.",
    "I don't know yet how this course will impact my dissertation work, but it will certainly inform my analytical practice, opening the door for a more meaningful consideration of metric issues in whatever repertoire I am dealing with in the future. The majority of the methodologies involved combine well with other approaches, both formalist and hermeneutic. It deepened my knowledge of the discipline through readings covering repertoires both in- and outside of the common practice period.",
    "The course deepened my knowledge of the discipline by introducing me to work on rhythm and meter, much of which was unfamiliar to me before this course. I do think that what I learned in the class will affect and contribute to my future work, but at this time I'm not entirely sure in what specific ways. At the least, having more awareness and attention to meter and rhythm is likely to change how I hear and think about music, which is certain to affect my future research."
