    "Italian 1 starts out very intense - it is a surprise to be put in a class in which you are being taught in the language you are trying to learn - but you will catch on. I learned as much Italian in one semester as French in 5 years of middle\/high school study.",
    "YES!! So much fun. Awesome. Take it!! Italian is such a great language to learn!",
    "I would recommend Italian 110 07 to another student. After one semester, I feel that I could communicate, read, and write reasonably well in Italian and have a basic understanding of the language and its grammar.",
    "Yes. Take this language. The language is beautiful, the TAs are great, and thethe language isn't terribly hard to learn. Do it.",
    "I would definitely recommend it. You feel so accomplished when you get to the end of the semester and can actually hold a conversation in Italian."
