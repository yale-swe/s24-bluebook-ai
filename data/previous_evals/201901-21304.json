    "This was a great intro music class. I've been singing my entire life and I thought this course was going to be easy, but upon entering the class I discovered that I knew a lot less than I thought. This was very helpful for my singing and greater understanding of music. We went through rhythm, harmony, the circle of fifths, triads, major-minor-diminished-augmented qualities, seventh chords, chord progressions, and basically everything up to functional harmony.",
    "Coming into this course, I knew next to no music theory, only what I had casually picked up from playing music for ten years. Coming out of this course, I now feel as though I have a solid foundation in music theory, having learned more than I could have expected and having realized just how vast the field as a whole is. Before I took this course, I had no idea how to read any clef other than bass, how to identify intervals, or how to analyze a piece of music to determine its chord progression, and now feel perfectly comfortable doing all of those things.",
    "This course was a great introduction to music theory. It goes through all the basics beginning with the elements of the language, all the way to starting to understand how they come together. We covered musical notation, major, minor keys, triads and a bit of cadence. We developed skills in writing music, listening to music and recognizing different elements and a bit of keyboard skills.",
    "I got a good introduction to music theory basics, composition principles, and analysis. I also developed an ear for listening and identifying intervals and practiced basic keyboard skills."

   "comments": [
    "The course is straight out of the book, which is both a strength and a weakness. The tiny class size is also both. In a class of five, I got a lot of one on one time, but the class wold get very awkward at times, singing in front of each other and playing our keyboard assessment sin front of each other. By the end of the semester, our prof learned that that made us nervous and she made each assessment private, which was much better.",
    "I really appreciated the balance between short lectures and applications of the material we had been learning, such as singing short passages, identifying intervals by ear, or doing dictation. I can't think of any way it could have been improved!",
    "I think the syllabus is incredibly strong. I think engagement with the textbook could either be stronger, and the use of interactive material that I found on my own was really essential to my learning, so I wish more of that could be integrated."

    "I loved this class! I highly recommend it for musicians and non-musicians. As a psych student, it was a really nice break from my other work. The homework was like a fun written task that almost felt like a math worksheet. It activated a different part of my brain. I feel like I know a lot more about music now!",
    "I would recommend this course without hesitation to any student even mildly interested in learning music theory, since it starts off slowly to make sure that everyone's on the same page but very quickly gets into material that, to someone with no background in music theory, seems rather advanced but still very interesting.",
    "Yes, the description of the course is exactly what you get, so if you are interested in getting an introduction to music theory, this is the course to take.",
    "If you don't have much experience with music theory and want to learn more about it or take other music classes down the road, definitely take this course. It's a great class and is pretty well taught."
