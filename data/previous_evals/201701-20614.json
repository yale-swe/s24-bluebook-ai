    "Literally, everything German. Max is an amazing teacher, and I've really learned a lot about the grammar usages, and the different types of sentence structures, and just a lot of vocabulary.",
    "German skills.",
    "This class does a great job of exposing you to listening, reading, speaking, and culture in good measure. It's a very engaged classroom, so you have to speak and participate a lot which is definitely helpful for learning."

   "comments": [
    "The in-class time was very productive and helped facilitate an easy learning environment. However, students in STEM fields had more of a disadvantage in this class because they had much less time to spend outside class studying\/improving.",
    "The German department tries a great deal to get us engaged in conversations with one another and connected with German culture. The homework assignments vary in forms, from speaking tasks, video projects, movie\/books, research and presentation etc etc. These are not only ways to study the language but also to learn about the culture.",
    "I really liked the laid back style of this class. It was taught mostly as a discussion, consisting of activities, small projects, and conversations in class that made sure everyone was actively participating. It meant we had to learn most grammar outside of class, but I think this was the best way to take advantage of the hour each day that we were in the company of other people learning German. I often didn't like having to do all these class activities, but they pushed me out of my comfort zone and forced me to practice speaking, even when I was afraid of making mistakes. I'm much better at German now because of it! I don't know how practical this is in a 12 person class, but I wish we could have gotten more personalized feedback, especially on pronunciation and writing. Also, our forum posts weren't corrected, so I feel as though I made the same mistakes in my writing throughout the semester without knowing it.",
    "It was 9:25am.",
    "It was a german course--not much more to it than that."

    "This is an excellent course for anyone looking to begin a relationship with the German language, provided you have the desire and time to put into it.",
    "Yes I am taking German as my third language and it is a great experience. Yale language classes never disappoint you!",
    "I would definitely recommend this class! Max is great, and teaches the class more as a conversation than as a lecture. We don't spend much time on slideshows and grammar, and instead focus on general communication and conversation skills. There is a lot of grammar covered in L2, which at times can get a little overwhelming (especially with not too much class practice), but I think the style of the class facilitates the development of speaking skills much more than if it were focused on grammar and vocab more.",
    "Yes! Especially with Max!",
    "It's 120. Take it if you took 110.",
    "120 is well taught and semi-intensive without being overwhelming. You have to keep track of all the assignments, but none of them are crushing in any way and you'll learn a lot and definitely make friends in class."
