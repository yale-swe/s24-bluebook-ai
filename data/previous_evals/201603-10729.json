   "comments": [
    "I came into this course lacking confidence in my writing abilities. By the end of it, I not only have strengthened my skills, but am also considering a writing intensive career now!",
    "This course has taken my writing to new heights. I came into the course thinking that my writing was okay but that I would be nothing compared to what was expected of me. However, even though I was not the most capable writer in my first week, this class was still a joy to be in and I felt my writing improve with every essay.",
    "I have become a much better writer after taking this class. I really appreciate the time and energy that was put into making this class amazing. Really interesting material. You'll definitely improve your essay writing by taking this class.",
    "I learned about the art of writing a personal essay in this course. It was certainly not an easy course as I took the writing very seriously, and sometimes it was very frustrating to write about myself. But I ended up learning quite a bit about how to think about myself and put it into writing.",
    "Through English 120, I learned so much about writing in general and about the form of the essay. It was my first real introduction to genre-based writing and really pushed me to approach the entire topic of writing differently.",
    "I learned a variety of techniques to use in creative, personal writing. This class taught me how to linger on certain topics in order to provide insightful commentary on a myriad of topics in my writing. Most importantly, I learned how to read as a writer.",
    "This course grew my maturity as a writer incredibly. It taught me how to integrate my personal life and the world around me with broader, public points about our society, as well showed me a variety of different styles to approach the modern essay.",
    "This class forced me to critically assess my abilities as a writer and helped me better understand how to construct a compelling argument. I learned how to read essays for structure and form, provide helpful suggestions to peers, and improve my own writing through insights gleaned from model essays, workshop feedback and individual meetings with Shifra.",
    "I really improved my writing during this course, both in terms of sentence structure and effectively constructing a personal essay. This course also taught me how to think deeply about what I'm writing, and how to challenge myself and my own thoughts to come to a deeper conclusion than the one I would have initially reached. It also definitely taught me the importance of multiple drafts when writing this type of essay."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "At first, I considered the rather open ended writing prompts to be a weakness of the course, but having fought them this semester, I have come to see them as a strength. While of course certain themes must be present, the professors are more than willing to allow you to write about things that interest you, and that certainly helped with my confidence.",
    "I think this course was great, I think it is run very well and is designed to make you into a better writer.",
    "This course had interesting readings, a fabulous professor and a wonderful design that kept my reading load relatively low and yet provided enough reading that I could see how to improve my own essay writing.",
    "I thought discussions on readings were sometimes a little bit disorganized and it could be improved.",
    "I liked the readings of the course a lot, but I wish there had been a less-harsh grading policy. I know very few people who got even A-'s on any of their essays and I wish Professor Sharlin had laid out more specific requirements for how to write for the class.",
    "English 120 is a very strong course! The reading is manageable compared to most English classes and the essays are spread out well. There is always compelling class discussion and the workshop experience is fantastic. There are very few weaknesses. Perhaps the class could benefit from more concrete discussion on how to implement what we read directly in our own writing.",
    "I really wouldn't change anything about this course -- I really enjoyed it! There was a good balance between guided and open-ended prompts, reading\/writing time, and I received much feedback on how to become a better writer.",
    "The in-class dynamic of this course was excellent - Shifra facilitated free-flowing and productive discussions, and everyone, for the most part, was engaged in responding to example essays and providing feedback for each other. Shifra also went out of her way to provide individual feedback - I had several hourlong meetings with her to discuss drafts at various stages, and they were always helpful. I sometimes wish the five units were more clearly divided so that the topics were distinct from essay to essay - at times, the units overlapped and bled into each other, and the example essays and my own work felt less distinct as a result.",
    "The classes themselves are incredibly entertaining and educational. Attending class feels much more like a cozy discussion club with friends than it does like a lecture. I made friends in E120 in a way that I didn't in any of my other freshman fall classes.",
    "I loved this course! I thought the seminar environment was really nice, and we had a lot of fun in class. All of the readings we did were really interesting and challenging, and the workshopping component was really helpful, both for receiving feedback on your own writing and learning to criticize and improve the writing of others. The essays definitely required a lot of mental energy, but that is what made the class so unique."

   "comments": [
    "100% would recommend. It exponentially improved my writing abilities. The readings were interesting and not tedious to do. The professors are engaging and are truly there to help you succeed.",
    "Yes. This course was fantastic, it facilitated really great in class discussion about essayistic techniques, and really can make anyone who puts in the effort into a better writer.",
    "Yes! This is a wonderful course! Not a gut but not a hard course at all. Grading is not the most generous, but the workload is low and it will improve your writing if you put in even the slightest bit of effort.",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend this course to another student, because it really helps you to think critically and spend a lot of time for introspection on what to talk about. It is really a great course to reflect on yourself.",
    "I highly recommend English 120! It's challenging, but rewarding to understand and write in the essay genre. You learn a lot about yourself as a writer and a person, and it's refreshing to take a class more unique than most writing classes.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this class to another student, although I would ask them to really be sure they wanted to write at a complex and personal level.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. English 120 is an excellent course that teaches students how to read as a writer and implement techniques from readings into personal essay writing. My class became a very tight knit group and I learned a lot about writing both from my classmates and professor.",
    "YES -- this course is incredible! It really grows your writing and thinking ability, and helps you look at the world from a critical perspective.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to anyone hoping to improve their personal writing. Our class bonded over the course of the semester and developed a great rapport as we shared our writing with each other. Shifra even had us over for dinner! The model essays we discussed in class were varied and thought-provoking. The workshops for each essay provided helpful variety in giving and receiving feedback. And Shifra went out of her way to provide individual feedback and support, pouring considerable effort into her feedback and making herself available for one-on-one meetings every week. She also brought an ample supply of candy and snacks to every class - a nice bonus. This course really pushed me to think more critically about my essays, and it has made me a more thoughtful reader and writer.",
    "You'll have a lot of fun, your writing will improve a lot, but you'll certainly also have frustrating experiences with essays that just seem impossible to get right.",
    "Yes! This course teaches you to write beyond complicated sentence structure and academic words. It teaches you to both think about what you are writing in an in-depth, meaningful way, and honestly makes you think a little deeper about life in general. The essays do take a lot of time, but the class was so fun and rewarding that the extra effort is definitely worth it."
