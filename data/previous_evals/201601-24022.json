    "This course is a thorough course on Islamic Political theory. If you are interested in Islam and learning more about Islam and politics, I would absolutely recommend taking this course.",
    "A great overview of the conundrum of Islam and Democracy for a student from any academic background. This class was amazing! As an EPE major who studied the Middle East, this class was right up my alley but there were plenty of other students from different majors who had great experiences. Professor March is an excellent professor - easily one of the top five I had at Yale (took the course second semester senior year). If you are at all interested in this issue take this class!",
    "A study of the history and development of Islamic theory and the intersection of Islam and democracy. Very intriguing and informative. Good for both beginners and experts.",
    "Take this class if you want a background in the Middle East, but be prepared to have 400 pages of reading a week. Professor March is incredibly knowledgeable, and you will come out knowing a huge amount about the region, its politics, and its history. Do not take it if you are not prepared to do the reading, but definitely do take it if you ever want to seriously engage with the Middle East in any capacity.",
    "Broad course covering the religious and political intellectual history of the Middle East from the 19th through the 21st century. Topics include divine sovereignty, the crisis of the caliphate, revolutions, the muslim brotherhood, and ISIS. We look at countries like Iran, Egypt, Jordan, Palestine, Saudi Arabia, India, and Pakistan. Really cool survey of how intellectual debates have operated and influenced politics.",
    "Very informative class-- might be helpful to have some background on Islam though... or to meet with the professor about it to make sure you're not going to get too confused. The class does a great job of tackling the question of Islam and Democracy-- you will definitely become very knowledgeable and familiar with various arguments and areas of confusion related to Islam. And the professor is great!"
