   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this course 150% - best class I've ever had. Content is super duper interesting, and this class as a whole, with Natalie as your guide, literally changes how you think about people and life and the world, and my writing\/analytical skills improved tenfold.",
    "Section 20 of English 114 is the class for anyone who is looking to become a better-informed scholar. The class does as advertised (providing an introductory course for the basics of academic argumentation) but does so through a diverse selection of readings. The voices you encounter will definitely contribute to your thinking.",
    "Yes, but take an interesting subject cause I think it depends on the teacher what kind of 114 experience you will have.",
    "It's a very interesting class with a solid amount of work. I would definitely recommend it. It was so much fun and everything we talked about was very relevant.",
    "Definitely take the class! I'd heard mixed reviews of ENGL 114, so I really wasn't sure if I wanted to take it, but I'm SO glad I did. It was by far my favorite class of the semester. The topics covered everything from disability to sexuality to bioethics, and the discussions changed how I looked at the world. With a great professor, an amazing group of people in the class, and an interesting topic, this was an awesome class.",
    "I would like to recommend this class to everyone really, since there is so little chance to expose oneself to disability studies as an undergrad. The terms disability studies or sexuality studies may be a bit misleading, I feel, to describe this course; while these are some of the topics that we covered in class, the class was really about questioning what lies at the core of humanity - what makes us uniquely human despite our differences and how we should treat each other while being mindful of the complex intersections of our identities.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. If he or she is looking for a course that informs a difficult and sometimes tricky perspective, this is the class for that! I learned to view and discuss disability and queer studies while also gaining a window through which to look at a lot of other issues in the context of my life. This class potentially shaped the direction I'm looking to take my future studies at Yale.",
    "I would say that ENGL114 is a course that helps prepare you for more college writing as well as gives you a variety of topics to choose from so you aren't bored. I would recommend this course to another student because of the small class sizes, interesting topics, and manageable work load.",
    "I WOULD DEFINITELY RECOMMEND THIS COURSE. Future Unruly bodies students, this is by far the best ENG 114 you could get. Not only are the paper writing and argumentation skills highly improved, but the professor is one of the nicest and intelligent individuals who really worked hard to make the class dynamic work perfectly. Please do all the readings, they will be challenging at first, but the more you do, the more comfortable you get AND THE MORE YOU LEARN! You will surely have fun, and if you are lucky to get in, trust me! you won't regret it."
