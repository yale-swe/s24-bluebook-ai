    "The Yale French Curriculum is atrocious and needs to be revamped. The focus is not at all on students learning French; it is on following a rigid method of teaching French that penalizes students for not being able to devote several hours of work per night to a single course.",
    "I improved my French grammar skills. I learned a lot of new verb tenses and more vocab words.",
    "Furthered my knowledge\/understanding of the French language; learned more vocabulary and grammar.",
    "I learned French.",
    "I think I have got a lot of improvements in my French reading, listening and speaking skills."

   "comments": [
    "This course is good, but I think it's hard to retain vocab for the long term if you're just worried about cramming so much for an exam.",
    "This course is very well run. I never thought I could learn a language as well as I have in the past year. The only weakness was the sheer amount of workbook exercises which sometimes take away from more helpful studying.",
    "Strengths: very structured and well organized Weaknesses: sometimes we did many grammar lessons at once, so it was challenging to make sure that I had a good handle on everything",
    "This course will definitely teach you how to speak French. The only weakness is that sometimes you will have students who are already familiar with French in your class, and it can be difficult to catch up.",
    "Well, I myself am more grammar-inclined in language learning. So I might not be so used to this way of teaching. But it seems lots of other people enjoy it very much."

    "TAKE ANY OTHER LANGUAGE APART FROM FRENCH YOU ARE DOING YOURSELF A DISSERVICE. I heard about all of the \"known flaws\" about the department once I have already committed to the language, and it has been the biggest mistake I've made during my time at Yale. Choose something else while you still can unless you already have a significant amount of French experience.",
    "Yes. You learn a lot of French",
    "If the student is really looking to learn a language, this course is a great class.",
    "Yes - I believe the French curriculum at Yale is very effective and deliberate with its teaching methodology, but as with any course, you only get out what you put in.",
    "Yes, it's a great course.",
    "Yes. It's fun."
