    "Take. this. course.",
    "Take this class! Take it if you are interested in neuroscience, linguistics, and education. There are many relevant implications and advantages from this class. It is very detailed and you have good readings and most importantly, Professor Pugh as a resource! You have an opportunity to write a research grant at the end of the course as a final paper which you can carry out in Haskins if you want!",
    "I enjoyed the material of the course and Professor Pugh very much. I feel like I've learned a lot about the field, particularly with regard to the scientific process in this field. However, the class was disorganized and started late and ended late, which could be frustrating.",
    "Literate Brain and Mind is a really cool class. Dr. Pugh is an expert in the field, and we focused on a lot of cutting edge research and unresolved questions, a very different approach from the standard \"survey of established truths\" you get from many classes at a liberal-arts university. Although it wasn't for me, this would be a great class for interested students to find research opportunities in linguistics\/cogsci\/psychology. Even if you aren't necessarily a linguistics\/cogsci\/psych major, this class is definitely doable as long as you're ok dealing with unfamiliar terminology and reading papers."
