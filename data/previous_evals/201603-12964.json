   "comments": [
    "Beyond basic questions of research design, what stands out is better insight into the upsides and limits of experimental methods, and substantive knowledge of some of the topics we discussed (clientelism, ethnic politics)",
    "An improved understanding of the methods used in political science.",
    "Excellent survey of substantive topics in Comparative Politics.",
    "I got a good overview of qualitative research design.",
    "I learned more about diverse methods to answer questions around comparative politics. The readings assigned for the course were a great introduction to the state of the literature in the subfield, and were insightful guidelines for using various tools prevalent in the social sciences.",
    "This course introduced me to the sub-field of Comparative Politics through some of the best works in the sub-field. The first few weeks of the course focused on specific aspects of research design. The knowledge gained during these weeks and the class discussions served as a good ground for later part of the course during which we read some of the most well-regarded works in the Comparative Politics sub-field. Reading and analyzing these works, along with the class discussions we had, helped me gain insights into ways in which political science scholars have handled various aspects of research design: formulating a research question, proposing a theory and related hypotheses, choosing research methods and implementing them. Additionally, I enjoyed the discussion, towards the end of each class, on the research design aspects of the papers presented at the Comparative Politics Workshops. I acquired skills to critique aspects of research design, as well as to think of alternative explanations. The most valuable, although fundamental, knowledge that I gained from this course was on how to write a research proposal, and how to identify possible research challenges.",
    "This course equipped me with the necessary methodological training necessary for my future research.",
    "I learned what the best works in Comparative Politics do in their research designs to make them exemplars of the field. The course was great for showing that a work can do this with any method: historical, field, experimental, and observational. Exposure to these works also made the methods employed seem more accessible. These are not techniques used by other scholars, but methods we will be using soon. I am glad that this course gives students a quick and accessible introduction to the most common methods employed in Comparative Politics research.",

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I think a strength is the good mix of methodological and substantive work. The aspect I enjoyed least was the student summaries of the books, which were often very long even though everyone had done the reading. Those could be shortened (or the time limit enforced), or made a little more interactive\/critical -- what often happened now was just a run-through of the arguments and the book structure, without any new content.",
    "For the most part, this was a good course. The reading selections were interesting and appropriate, and having to write a research proposal (and receiving feedback on that proposal) was the most helpful task assigned in any of my classes this semester. My only complaint is that class conversations were often disjointed. I think this is largely a function of the class being too big. I don't know if this is possible, but in the future, it might be helpful to split up the class into two sections.",
    "I liked our class discussions although I would have appreciated if they had been more focused on the technicalities behind the methodologies of each week's book.",
    "The course's strength lay in its extensive focus on one single book per week. This allowed us to critically engage with the author, the argument and the method, both in our response papers and in our class discussions. The student-led discussions of the books was also helpful. The course could have been made better by way of increased professor intervention. While Sue did an amazing job synthesizing the readings and our comments during the discussion, I would have liked to hear more about her thoughts on how to approach these readings, or how to better engage with the details of the method and argument in a manner that is relevant to our own research agenda.",
    "Strengths of the course included: 1. An opportunity to read and discuss some of the most well-regarded research works in the Comparative Politics sub-field. 2. An opportunity to understand the wide range of research methods used by scholars engaged in comparative politics research, and the advantages and disadvantages of these methods. 3. One of components of the course was to write a research proposal. As part of this, one needed to propose a theory, hypotheses, research methods; and this provided a remarkable hands-on, learning experience. Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed this course, but perhaps, three minor additions could improve it further: 1. Incorporating a few readings which are at the intersection of the Comparative Politics sub-field, and another sub-field such as, International Relations or American Politics. 2. Incorporating a reading or two which explicitly studies psychological aspects of political behavior - something which appears to be of growing interest to comparative politics scholars. 3. Having some open-ended discussions during class on \"what is a good research question?\"; as well as on \"what is a clarifying question and what is not?\" - might be especially helpful for those who attend the Comparative Politics workshop (as well as job talks).",
    "It would be nice if we read more works in comparative politics instead of methodology textbooks.",
    "My complaint about the course is not about its content, but about its placement in the CP track. Having this comes first can be daunting for those who do not have much background to Comparative Politics. Many of the works assume foreknowledge of prior debates and contributions within the CP literature, but if you do not know these, then the substantive significance of the work can be lost. That is, I may know the main argument of the book, but I do not know why that argument was important to make or how it contributed to research in CP. As a result, think an introduction to the major works and debates of CP before taking this course would have made me more engaged with the material. Maybe this is a personal preference, but nonetheless, having a field survey course before a methods course would make the methods course seem more exciting.",
    "The strength is the material and design of the course."

    "Yes, it's a good course that gives you a solid grounding in the comparative method and allows you to engage with interesting topics in CP.",
    "I would.",
    "Yes. An absolute must for any serious student in comparative politics.",
    "Yes because it is incredibly helpful for preparing research proposals and Sue gives excellent advice and is a critical thinker.",
    "Yes - this course is a great survey of the prevalent research methods in comparative politics and provides an engaging space to discuss insightful literature.",
    "Yes, I would certainly recommend this course to another student - especially to one who is interested in the sub-field of Comparative Politics. The course is not only a great introduction to the sub-field, but also to the many nuanced aspects of research design. It also provides significant knowledge on a range of research methods (quantitative and qualitative) which political science scholars engaged in comparative politics research use, as well as ways in which these methods complement each other.",
    "Yes, to all students who are interested in quantitative and qualitative analysis in comparative politics."
