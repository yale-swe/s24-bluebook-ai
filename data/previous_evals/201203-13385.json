    "English 127 is a class where you read american literature, from Benjamin Franklin to Herman Melville to Faulkner. You read a mix of novels and poetry and there are 4 total papers about these readings. Class is a small seminar setting.",
    "It is in some ways difficult to summarize English 127 (American Lit) because your experience varies so greatly with the professor \/ grad student you get. While all sections read some of the same books (Moby-Dick, most notably), teachers have a lot of latitude to select their own reading list. Moreover, your experience will depend on who leads your section. I had Daniel Jump, an english grad student. While this may seem alarming, he was actually quite good. He was prepared for each class with a group of themes or passages he thought would be helpful to touch on, and he supported classroom discussion well. He was also very willing to meet out of class, and was quite friendly and warm. The workload is pretty typical for a mid-level literature seminar. The reading load could get pretty heavy (~200 pages a week?), but you can get by without reading all of it if you please. There were three 5-7 pages essays, as well as a final paper that was actually a revision and expansion of one of the first three essays including new primary or secondary sources and a decent final.",
    "I would if you have never really encountered American literature - it's a good introduction. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone who wants to delve deep into American literature, because it doesn't really go into much depth for each work, nor to do you come out with a coherent understanding of what you have read.",
    "Yes, I'd recommend it. Be prepared to do the readings, but aside from Moby Dick they're not that bad. You really learn what \"American Literature\" is, and can have some great discussions in class."
