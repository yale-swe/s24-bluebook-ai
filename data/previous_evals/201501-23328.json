    "Overall a good course, slides are excellent and although the classroom teaching is average the slides are easy to understand and follow.",
    "it's a good class but it doesn't need to be a whole semester. after lecture 6, everything seemed to be kind of niche and not very useful. The R-sessions were not very useful as i think only 4 people in the class actually knew R. The first midterm was not quite what I was expecting -- very calculation heavy and the blank pages were intimidating and different from most tests I've ever taken (with charts to fill out, space to write answers) and it would have been nice to know beforehand. But that being said, the content on the midterm was fair. For the end of the semester, managing homeworks, the project, and a final was a bit much. I was very glad when we stopped the homework. However, I think we should JUST have to do a final project (maybe individually) and not do a project and a final.",
    "The course is very useful and the instructor gives clear lecture.",
    "By taking this class, you will learn applied skills on how to deal with survival data.",
    "The class was well-designed, and the class lectures and slides were really detailed, clear, and helpful.",
    "Strength: - extremely useful course - covers all the major topics and even some advanced topics in survival analysis",
    "Strength: detailed slides, thorough explanations, great examples Weakness: dense lectures, no breaks during lectures Should give 5 minute breaks during the 2-hr lectures",
    "The slides are perfectly organized!",
    "Very responsible instructor. Very detailed PPT. Maria is the one of the best teacher!",
    "A well-done course with attention to both the execution and framing of survival analysis. At times, a single meeting time once a week seems adequate; other topics in course would benefit from a more defined lab component.",
    "The lectures are in full detail and the teacher is really nice.",
    "good slides"

    "Instructor: Maria Michelle Ciarleglio \u00a0Maria is probably the best bio-stats instructor I have come across. Unfortunately the comparators are terrible.",
    "Instructor: Maria Michelle Ciarleglio \u00a0great slides for studying. reads off the slides a little bit would be great if we could have a short break halfway through class -- 2 hours is a long time",
    "Instructor: Maria Michelle Ciarleglio \u00a0She is awesome! Very nice lecture notes and patient to students all the time.",
    "Instructor: Maria Michelle Ciarleglio \u00a0Great slides. She is good at teaching skills and making knowledge clear. However, her class is a little bit boring sometimes.",
    "Instructor: Maria Michelle Ciarleglio \u00a0Maria was very knowledgeable and detailed-orientated. She explained the content in a very clear and organized way. Maria was also very responsive, and she answered students' questions really quickly.",
    "Instructor: Maria Michelle Ciarleglio \u00a0Strength: - Dr. Ciarleglio is very approachable - An excellent instructor; she knows her material well and her slides are very comprehensive",
    "Instructor: Maria Michelle Ciarleglio \u00a0Strength: Very nice, encouraging Weakness: Sometimes too detailed",
    "Instructor: Maria Michelle Ciarleglio \u00a0Very hard-working; can explain things very clearly; would be better if can give lessons in a more intuitive way",
    "Instructor: Maria Michelle Ciarleglio \u00a0Great teacher!",
    "Instructor: Maria Michelle Ciarleglio \u00a0Excellent. Organized. Knowledgeable. Consistently interested in the material, even when exhaustive. Having a good sense of humor about biostats is a plus.",
    "Instructor: Maria Michelle Ciarleglio \u00a0Dr. Ciarleglio is a very patient and lovely teacher, her slides are very clear and you can learn everything from the slides.",

    "Biostats class with weekly homework and dense lectures. Somewhat easy to understand, only if you pay attention in class. Only recommend the professor (she's great!)",
    "A well-done course with attention to both the execution and framing of survival analysis. In conjunction with Longitudinal analysis this course reinforces the importance of time as a factor in health outcomes.",
    "I would recommend it to another student. This course is fundamental to clinical researches, almost every clinical research has something to do with survival analysis.",
    "very useful course"
