    "It is a lot of work, but it is worth it. The course develops your Spanish mind in every aspect.",
    "I thought this was a great course. It made Spanish fun again! I think that my reading, writing, and speaking skills all improved and I thought the evaluations were very fair and the workload was very manageable.",
    "I would definitely recommend taking Spanish 140 to other students. The workload is more than manageable and the cultural content is interesting. You truly feel that you are getting better at Spanish.",
    "It is a good course for strengthening and applying Spanish grammar and knowledge into discussion and polishing one's Spanish language base.",
    "I would recommend it.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course. Your fluency will definitely improve, but by how much you improve will depend on your class participation and the time you spend out of class practicing.",
    "It meets everyday so it definitely takes a good amount of time but it was a fantastic and very instructive.",
    "I really didn't like the syallabus or the class but Joserra is the best professor I've had here at Yale. This class is a bit of a struggle at times but is definitely worth taking if you can get to take it with Joserra.",
    "Intense, but your Spanish will improve. Too many assessments.",
    "Spanish 140 goes over advanced grammar and the development of spanish speaking confidence"
