   "comments": [
    "This material is a good introduction to thinking like a Chemical Engineer. I loved the material of the class, but professor was boring. Played Candy Crush to stay awake for almost the entire semester.",
    "The material wasn't too hard, and Professor Haller is really nice. He tries to get to know all his students by name and makes himself as available as he can to help everyone. However, his lectures are not very clear, so most of the learning for this class was done through the book. If you're thinking of majoring in Chemical Engineering, don't be discouraged if you don't find this course very interesting. It's thekind of thing that gets more exciting as you take more involved courses, so don't use this as the basis of whether or not you want to continue the major. It's definitely not a bad course, but I don't think it's the kind you would want to take unless it's required.",
    "Overall, this was a good class. I found the material to be a little boring, but I think this is mostly because we couldn't delve into the chemical theory and instead had to derive our answers from fake data the textbook provided, so I have hopes that the material will become more interesting. The majority of the material focused on the various methods to create a chemical factory, instead of engineering new chemicals, which I also think is the less interesting of the two concepts. While the professor was not the most engaging lecturer, he was committed to his students and tried to make the class as relatable and engaging as possible. He was also just a very nice guy to talk to so it was nice going to his office hours. Finally, the workload for this class and the tests were definitely fair which is always a good thing",
    "Only take this if you have to. There are a lot of problem sets, lecture is unbearably boring, and I don't feel like I learned much of anything.",
    "Not too much work, do the textbook readings (its not much) and problem sets and you'll be fine. Also, look for overlap between lecture slides and textbook for exam questions!",
    "If you have to take it, take it. If not, don't. The class is pretty good-nothing to worry about.",
    "Yes. If you want to see if Chemical Engineering could be right for you, then definitely take this class. It's a good intro course to the major.",
    "CENG 210 is an overview of various chemical engineering concepts. In general the class was not very difficult, although a few of the concepts were somewhat complicated and required some solid thinking time to be understood. Haller is a very nice guy, but his lectures are quiet and monotonic, making them a perfect lullaby. I would recommend this class to anyone genuinely interested in chemical engineering. The class can be either really cool or excruciatingly boring depending on your level of interest.",
    "If you are reading this review, then you probably have to take this class and so nothing that I might say could sway you much either way. The class took place in the basement of Becton and the sound from the soda machine right outside the door would sometimes drown out the professor. Professor Haller is the sweetest man and is extremely knowledgeable about Chemical Engineering and is also a great person to talk to one-on-one. Unfortunately, he is not the best lecturer because he is quiet and he gets distracted talking about things that no one actually understands and he makes powerpoints filled with way too much information that is just difficult to read and to keep track of itself. The textbook, however, is very good and very clear. The problem sets, although they do not correspond to the lectures very much, are also kind of fun in that they are very engineeringy and are interesting in and of themselves. My recommendation is to read the textbook before class and to try to ask questions so that you don't fall asleep. Also, this is actually a good introduction to chemical engineering and it helped me understand some things in other classes as well as bring together some of the things that I was learning (or know that I am going to learn).",
    "CENG 210 is interesting course to describe\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Process design is like solving a puzzle, and mass balance is really just algebra. Graphical analysis is mostly just figuring out how to set it up. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d recommend this course, but it definitely wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be for some people. Professor Haller is extremely nice but most of your learning will come from the textbook, which is well-written and organized. Study hard for the final exam.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class (although my recommendation doesn't mean much because all students interested in chemical engineering have to take this class). The problem sets are pretty straightforward and the tests are alright as well. Professor Haller is great and a lot of fun to talk to outside of class. Overall the class teachers you how to think and solve problems -- two things which will serve you well in life!"
