   "comments": [
    "I would recommend it for those in math-heavy research areas or disciplines, as well as for those who are well aware that they have strong math backgrounds. Otherwise, you're going to spend way, way too much time studying in private and on the homework just to keep up with the class in any sufficient way!",
    "It's a course which is very basic. If you have a good math background and want to be excited by studying something more than what you learned in undergraduate, you might consider studying some other course.",
    "In terms of required courses, I liked this one more so than ENAS 902 (the other option)",
    "ENAS500 may not cover all the topics that apply to your specific areas of study, but it does cover a lot of general topics and most will prove to be useful. I would recommend the course to all students who need to learn the material or brush up on things we may have learned previously.",
    "Basically, review of all the college math you learned or should have learned, but have since forgotten most of.Yeah, it was helpful for getting a hold of the basic math stuff I should know again. Also picked up S-L theory and complex analysis stuff.",
    "I would recommend because it is a comprehensive overview of everything.",
    "Yes, as this course will give a very good overview of mathematics used in engineering.",
    "Yes it's a good class it's both basic and advanced so I would recommend people taking it.",
    "see aboveIt is required presently, so a recommendation is not as pertinent. I think there is another math credit that could be taken though I cannot comment on it.",
    "In ENAS 500, a large range of topics are covered that are useful tools for an engineering career. However, some basic knowledge would be very helpful during the course as many topics are covered with an understood previous exposure to the material. The text is very helpful and particularly instrumental in completing problem sets and exam preparation."

   "comments": [
    "Honestly it did nothing for my current research, but it helped to enforce the mathematical concepts that I see in other coursework. I anticipate that I will need to be proficient in some of the topics covered for my work in the future, and otherwise I am happy to have seen and gained familiarity with so many different topics and concepts just in the sense of becoming more mathematically informed, so I may listen to and better understand peers' work and mathematical methods used to obtain the results that I do use for my research.",
    "The course is a foundation builder for important topics we expect to see in later courses or in our research.",
    "Helped with remembering important math concepts.",
    "While certain topics within this course could be helpful in my research, the lack of depth in exchange for breadth impaired this course in being as useful. Thus, I feel it was good for general education, but I may have benefited more from a select focused math course."
