    "you read french novels and poems and plays and then discuss them and write essays about them. simple and great.",
    "I would recommend FREN170 for any student interested in learning about and reading the classics of French literature, even if you haven't had any experience with a literature course at Yale or in high school. As a survey course, youwill cover poetry, novels, short stories and philosophical thoughts on the various major literary movements in France and get a great understanding of major literary themes as a whole. Mme Pinzka is also a great lector and will actively help you out to develop your critical and analytical skills, something that I find particularly useful for any course you take at Yale. The readings are also extremely interesting, but I guess that might be some bias coming from a potential French major.",
    "Great class if you're interested in French literature. A decent amount of reading, two classes per week, three essays over the semester, one in-class presentation, final oral exam, and two \"ripostes\" (responses) to other people's presentations over the course of the semester, though I don't think the ripostes are graded. At times it feels like there is very little work in the course and at other times it feels like there is a lot; but it will depend a lot on your schedule. Mme Pinzka is fantastic--take the course with her if at all possible!",
    "I would recommend this class for someone who is ready to read a lot of great french lit over a short period of time and also ready to write deeply about them",
    "Definitely take 170 with Pinzka. It's very discussion-oriented, and the reading list is a good mix of heavy, philosophical material and lighter reading.",
    "I took this class as a way to keep up my French and learn about some literature, but I sort of wish I had just bought some French books and read them on my own instead. It was a pretty good class, and I didn't hate it by any means. If you put a ton of effort into it and had the timeto really stringently read and analyze all the details of the books I think you could get a lot out of it, but if not I wouldn't necessarily recommend it. The discussions themselves were usually just sort of engaging and added some to the reading of the book, but nothing you couldn't do with a lot less effort on your own. I would take French 160 from Pinzka instead.",
    "Great course that scans French literature across the centuries until the modern ones. Great professor."
