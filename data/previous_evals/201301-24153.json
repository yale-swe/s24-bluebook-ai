    "An interesting class on the reasons for corruption, the nature of corruption, and possible ways to stem corruption. People did terribly on the midterm, which was really nitpicky and it was strange to have a midterm test in a political science seminar in the first place. There were also weekly reading responses which are nice because you can have a bit of a dialogue with Paul and he can get to know you and your writing, but they are also graded (on the check\/check plus\/check minus scale) and can be a bit of a pain. Class discussion was often annoying because people had often not done the reading and then tried to get away with vague musings about corruption and stereotypes about Latin America.",
    "I do recommend it. It is a good class.",
    "Yes, a great class that is essential to understand corruption and its study in a Latin American context. I would definitely recommend it.",
    "Yes, take it. It was the best class I've taken at Yale.",
    "Take this class if you're at all interested about learning more about corruption and Latin America in general",
    "I would only recommend this class to a student if they are interested in the subject, but definitely do not take this course for a grade."
