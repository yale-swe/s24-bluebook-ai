    "I essentially learned Matlab from this course - I had never seriously used Matlab before this class, and after taking it I can now write my own code to answer my own research questions. And in every class session I learned something conceptually that I did understand at a deep level - hence, I now have a broad, conceptual understanding of probability, when to use certain statistical tests, ways to avoid mis-using statistical tests, etc.",
    "I learned how to use MATLAB to analyze data. We did in depth lectures and coursework related to probability, maximum likelihood estimation, and hypothesis testing. Then we did an overview of different data analysis techniques used in Neuroscience.",

   "question_id": "GS403",
   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths: variety of topics covered was great, different professors with different backgrounds expertise, level of explanation given during each lecture, the fact that professors walked through their code line by line. Weakness: none really. Improvements: none really. Actually now that I think about it, I do have a minor suggestion: I got the most from lectures in which the professor gave some brief background info, and talked about the concepts at a pretty basic level, and then dove into the Matlab code. Looking back, this made it easier to understand some of the nuances of the code that I might have otherwise missed.",
    "The strengths came from the engagement of the TA and Daeyeol in crafting the coursework to get the students actively using MATLAB to do statistics. Many of the lecturers were top notch, but the course did suffer a bit from lack of continuity. We covered permutation tests before we covered basic linear regression, which I thought was out of order. This likely is due to the availability of lecturers, and it wasn't that big of a problem, but the course seemed to zig zag as a result of this. Additionally it could be improved to include more coverage of skew, kurtosis, sphericity, and all those other measures that come with standard statistics that are commonly used. I also would have enjoyed explicit coverage of how to choose the appropriate post hoc test, and the assumptions inherent in each. That could also have been a nice place for continuity with the earlier lectures on probability and independence. The hackathons were OK for working on homework problems and getting homework help. I believe they would be improved if Daniel or whoever TAs in the future, would formally start each hackathon with a brief (maybe 30 minute out of 2 hours) coverage of the concepts from the lecture. The hackathons where Daniel did do this were the most helpful for me to understand the why of what we were learning.",
    "Strengths: - Highly relevant class. - Love the practical aspect to it! It's one thing to learn about techniques conceptually, it's another to be able to implement them yourselves. - Nice having different professors come in to talk about techniques that they're familiar with. Possible improvements: - More continuity between classes. A downside to having multiple professors is that it's a little disjointed. Also, it seemed that that it wasn't established exactly what would be covered for each class. - More obvious relevance: for some classes, it wasn't so clear exactly how you would apply the techniques to neuroscience. - Feedback on homework! Or upload an answer key after each homework is submitted. - TA sessions could be more guided. I know this is a graduate class and that students should be more motivated, but it would have been more useful for the TA session to be an overview of the class, and guided help on the homework. - Maybe break this class up over two semesters, where the first semester is the basics e.g. intro Matlab, intro linear algebra, and then the second semester is the real stats class. Personally the pace was fine with me, but that's because I already knew how to program.",
    "strengths: experienced and inspiring teachers and TA. diverse topics"

    "Yes. I would say this course should be mandatory for anyone analyzing data in neuroscience. (So basically mandatory for everyone.)",
