   "comments": [
    "An invaluable opportunity to review recent trends in the history of early modern science and medicine with an expert in the field.",
    "I learned about the history of science as a field. I also learned to write a better response paper, work in the special collections, and read a book very quickly! I learned how to contribute more effectively to a class discussion, as well.",
    "I understand the historical writing technique so much better because of the high exposure to a diverse group of authors. My fellow students' remarks about various readings and their analyses really helped me grasp readings and concepts at a much higher level. In general, it made me realize how subjective history is and how much is still possible to investigate.",
    "This course has enabled me, someone whose research interests are in the twentieth century, to understand numerous methodologies that historians can utilize to better understand the cultural and familial contexts of historical narrative. \"Early modern science and medicine\" has also helped me to analyze pre-modern ontologies concerning concerning health and well-being, and after taking this course, I have gained extremely helpful insights on how to approach my own research interests. During a few class sessions, the Professor helped us better analyse different categories (for example, the distinction between analytical categories and actor-categories) of historical investigation, which added to my necessary skills as a historian."

   "comments": [
    "Strong seminar conversations, Professor Bertucci is most capable of bringing the most helpful points out of the discussion. The syllabus was mostly very easy to engage with, and when the texts were more difficult or laborious that just allowed for interesting seminar work. The project was a fantastic opportunity to engage with some of the more interesting texts in the Beinecke or Medical Historical Library. The comments that were to be turned in before every class were not always helpful for discussion, but they push you to read the required texts in time.",
    "This was an excellent course. Learning how to work with the special collections of the library system was especially useful and introduced me to historical materials I had previously only dreamed of accessing. Professor Bertucci's guidance in helping structure a thoughtful discussion each week was essential. I always looked forward to class, not only because of the material, but because I knew I would be challenged in helpful ways. It was wonderful to read newly published materials; however I found it difficult to work with texts that were only available as e-books as I find it very difficult to read at length online. This is a minor comment and took away nothing from the content of the course itself.",
    "The course is incredibly rich because of the authors and Yale materials. The length of each class is perfect for engaging with primary sources as well as having meaningful and original conversations about technique and material. I really enjoyed the structure and think it works very well the way it is.",
    "Strengths - (1) I think response papers were incredibly helpful for better understanding the texts. (2) In addition, the low class strength helped me to articulate my questions and concerns about the text. (3) The hands-on engagement with the primary materials was extremely helpful in better understanding both the context of scholarship and the craft of writing history. (4) The feedback that I received during my appointment with the Professor was extremely helpful concerning both my writing abilities and the final paper. (5) The diversity of methodologies in the book was a further strength of the course, which showed us the different strands of historical analysis. Weakness - (1) This point is not necessarily a weakness, but it would have been further helpful if we were encouraged from the beginning to write a complete book review (and, not just a response paper) for at least one of the texts (or an outside text)."

    "I would recommend this course to any student looking for a well-designed course that incorporates material from the archives. Though the course topic was beyond my intended research, I discovered many exciting ideas and look forward to incorporating what I have learned from the Early Modern period into my work.",
    "As someone whose interests are different from those covered in the materials of this course, I gained immensely from this course, and especially from Professor Bertucci's feedback, and I would recommend this course to every student in the history of science or medicine."
