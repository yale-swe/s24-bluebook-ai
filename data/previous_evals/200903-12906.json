   "comments": [
    "DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS unless you took math bc in high school. Then if you did that, do not go to class because the teachers (all of them, not just Nicholae) will confuse you. SO SAD!!!",
    "If you need to get your math requirement out of the way as I did, shop around for the best teacher. Trust me, this teacher was not the best out there.",
    "Easy QR credit, and requirement for major.",
    "easy.",
    "Take this if it's a req for your major. If you've taken AP Calc, it should be a semi-easy QR. If not, it can be very difficult. Go to class! If not, you'll end up teaching yourself from the book which has bad examples in it. Problem sets aren't too bad, one a week. 2 midterms and 1 cumulative final.",
    "It is not well taught so it is mostly an independent course study",
    "If you have to, it's fine.",
    "This was not my favorite class. I think the lower level math classes here are kind of weak adn I don't liek that they kind of assume you are going to learn from the textbook instead of the teacher overall. Tecu is definitely the best of the teachers. he explains things clearly and methodically and tries to keep the class engaged. It's just not the most enthused group of students.",
    "I would recommend it to any student that wants an introduction to calculus.",
    "The course provides a good introduction to those with limited knowledge of calculus. To those who have some idea of what calculas is, it is a good tool for revision. i would recommend this course to those who have had little exposure to calculus.",
    "If you have never taken calcus before it will be very tough. They go at a very fast pace.",
    "Don't take it you need u just want to take it for a QR credit, only take it if u need it for a major or pre-professional requirment",
    "It is an introductory calculus course that is fast-paced, not a huge work load, but the finals and midterm require a lot of studying.",
    "This is a fairly easy course. The workload isn't bad and the teaching is decent.",
    "A lot of work",
    "Yes I would. This class was fine as long as you keep up with the material. It was a good QR.",
    "I would suggest taking it if you need to fulfill a credit for the course.",
    "I would definitely recommend Math112 even for students who have already taken calculus. The course gives a good starting point for further studies of math and calculus.",
    "I would definitely recommend Math 112 05 especially fi you intend to og on to a higher course. Math 112 helps you familiarize yourself with mathematical concepts that you will see in Math 115.",
    "Whether taken to fulfill a distributional requirement, take the first step in a math-driven major, or to gain an understanding of the basic, core elements of calculus, I would recommend Mr. Tecu\u0092s course to anyone. As the course advanced I decided to sit in on other Math 112 courses (not out of dissatisfaction with mine, but out of curiosity), and I realized I had been fortunate enough to have selected the most helpful and clear instructor. Students from other Math 112 courses tried this as well and eventually came to Mr. Tecu\u0092s course instead of their own. If you can\u0092t take a harmless joke, however, this class may be difficult for you to get help in during actual class time (some students were \u0093mocked\u0094 very lightly when asking questions). Office hours are flexible enough to account for this though, so I would encourage anyone (with a reason to do so) to take this course."
