   "comments": [
    "If you love the syllabus enough, then do it. Otherwise, you'll be really frustrated by the lack of organization, almost complete lack of feedback, and dead discussions. The readings are so long that even if you wanted to finish them you probably couldn't, unless you routinely sacrificed sleep and other classwork, but most of the class clearly made no effort do the readings at all. The best part of the class was the two cycles of presentations about independently-chosen social movements. It was fascinating to find primary sources and really get to know and share a social movement, and very cool to hear about the whole array of different movements. Overall though, I'm not sure if it was worth it.",
    "I would not recommend this class unless you are dead serious in how interested you are and dying to learn this stuff, and dont mind a disorganized professor. I was pretty interested but was disappointed in how the course failed to deliver its potential",
    "A great seminar on the history and theory of marxism and social movements.",
    "I was really excited for this course and ended up being fairly disappointed. Denning is really wonderful--super passionate, clearly lives and breathes this stuff, and seems to be the rare professor who does actually care about his students--and the material is obviously great. But somehow the parts just didn't add up. Denning ended up doing a lot of lecturing, which I suspect lead students to do less of the reading, and then that in turn made it difficult to ever have a real discussion, which lead to him continuing to lecture more, etc. The syllabus itself might have something to do with it. Over the semester, the class alternates between readings and presentations given by your classmates, the topics of which are wide-ranging and can be hard to try to synthesize into any sort of framework. The other issue is likely the sheer quantity of reading, which at times can be particularly daunting given the difficult nature of the material. You try reading hundreds of pages a week of Marx's Capital during midterms...",
    "This course will introduce you to a wide variety of interesting and inspiring movements and people, give you a quick survey of a few of the important thinkers of the mid-1800s to 1919 period, give you some historical context for whatever else you may be studying, and introduce you to a great professor and great fellow students - probably. The actual running of the class is not always all it could be - our class was very large, and so the seminar format didn't really serve it well (as often happens with classes over, say 5 people, I find). Class was good when Professor Denning lectured, but otherwise could occasionally be frustrating. Take it if you're interested in the material, or you are not yet interested in the material but think it might fill in some gaps in what you've learned at Yale so far.",
    "It's a good class to cover the origins and contributions of Marx and people who drew on Marx early on. It's an interesting class for people interested in social movements and philosophy. If you don't keep up with the readings you miss a lot of the class content even if you won't necessarily be called out for it. I'd recommend for people who have the time to devote to it.",
    "If you like theory, definitely take it. Prof. Denning is great and has wonderful and fascinating things to say about the reading. If you're more interested in the history of the social movements than in the theoretical writings, this class will be a bit of a slog. The student presentations are fun, but overall the class is mostly theory, which you really have to have a taste for in order to get through all the reading.",
    "Don't take it. It's great subject material taught in the most dull way possible.",
    "Marx, then Marxists. In a seminar.",
    "Class structure: mainly lecturing, Denning is fantastic, brilliantly weaving associations between the different social movements of the time, though not an excellent discussion leader. 1st half - Marx. 2nd half - Lenin, Luxemburg, Goldman and Du Bois. Two presentations on any social movements and two 8page papers. Readings are crucial to understanding 19th and 20th century world history, should be read regardless. Denning is flexible and open to whatever kind of social movement you want to study, and whatever concept you want to explore in the essays. Again, the class discussion is stunted and weird, but for Denning's flexibility and the excellent readings, the class was ultimately worthwhile.",
    "Chance for independent projects and learn about how Marxist ideas have affected movements around the globe (not just the US). You get to choose your area of focus and how to apply different thinkers to different movements.",
    "I was very glad I took this course because there are few other classes that let you read Marx and understand his historical context. It was a little disorganized, but if you feel that Marx is missing from your education (as I did) then go for it.",
    "This is a good class to immerse in Marxist theory and select social movement history if that interests you. However, the amount of reading was unrealistic and a lot of people didn't do it. The class was good but not completely coherent; it seemed disjointed at points.",
    "This class is your opportunity to read Marx and Engels, alongside several of the major inheritors of their thought in the early 20th Century. You're not going to get to read these incredibly important thinkers anyplace else--and that alone is reason to take the class. But don't expect a really juicy seminar discussion. The twice-a-week schedule and large class size lend themselves to Professor Denning lecturing. The sheer quantity of material covered also problematically forces the course to sacrifice depth.Denning comes at Marx from a unique perspective--he is particularly interested in the interconnectedness of social movements in different periods and different places. At times this makes the class feel ahistorical, and at times it distracts from the more narrow intellectual history of Marxism, but it also places Marx in a truly global context of the social movements in which he was a participant or observer."
