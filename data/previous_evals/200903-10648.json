   "comments": [
    "I would highly recommend taking GENE 625. It is a well-organized graduate-level course that presents important core concepts that may be of interest not only to aspiring geneticists, but also to aspiring cell or molecular biologists or even aspiring biochemists.",
    "An advanced genetics course that has a focus on reading important historical literature and requires you to think about the material in the form of take-home questions. Yes, I found this class difficult, but interesting.",
    "Yes, I would recommend other students to take this course as I did learn many form it!",
    "I would recommend the course because it provides a very thorough background of genetics and covers many interesting topics. The discussion sections are very helpful to learn how to read papers and talk about them and debate scientifically. The take-homes are a little tedious, but it is a good experience to work on the problems and think critically. The debate on the last day of class was a lot of fun, too!",
    "Very useful for anyone in the field ofbiology as an understanding of genetic tools is an essential.",
    "A great class.I will recommend other students to select this course.",
    "Basic introduction to methods of genetic analysis. Definitely recommend.",
    "It's a very good introductory level that surveys most areas of classic and modern genetics. It is taught at a very conceptual level but rather didn't focus on the techniques, which may be good or bad depends on the need of the students.",
    "I strongly recommend this course to graduate students in BBS program. It not only provides the core knowledge and history in genetic analysis, but also teaches students how to read and critique literatures. Besides, it is very practical.",
    "Weekly assignments and paper readings to teach a broad range of genetic concepts. Yes I would recommend the course but barely.",
    "Yes I will recommend to another student. This course is very good and helpful. I learn a lot.",
    "It's definitely something of a workload and I wouldn't suggest it to someone who is taking a number of hard classes already. However, it does provide a lot of information and I found that it covered completely different material than my undergraduate genetics course, so it probably would not be redundant for most people. I would recommend it to someone who wants a comprehensive overview of genetic experimental techniques.",
    "yes, it is a good way to get a overview of genetics",
    "It was great. My genetics was not very good before. I began to think about questions more with genetic analysis.",
    "It's ok. Since it's one of the three core courses, most people will have to take it, and it's not horrible like cell bio. It's relatively more work than cell bio, but you'll learn a moderate amount, and won't feel like you've COMPLETELY wasted your time. Still, could be a lot better if professors learned how to effectively teach.",
    "This class was a great introduction to methods of genetic analysis. I would say it's a must take class for anyone interested in genetics as well as cell biology.",
    "Very good class, and I would recommend it.",
    "I would not recommend it to all undergrads - only those who have the time and are committed.",
    "I would recommend the course."

   "comments": [
    "I definitely feel like I understand genetic concepts more and how to set up experiments.",
    "I did learn both of the basic and new knowledge from the classes. The instructors are all experts from their own fields. It's very helpful to me to take this course.",
    "This course helps me a lot in my future research. It gives me the history, the development of different genetic analysis methods, and makes me think about the future direction of the field.",
    "The course did not specifically help me with my research topic or general research interests for my graduate work, but it did provide me with an important overview of genetics that every graduate student should have. The course also helped me feel more confident reading scientific papers and discussing them.",
    "Helped immensely with the papers and the take home assignments.",
    "I have learned a range of genetic screening concepts and it is really helpful to work on the tome-home questions with fellow students.This class will be useful.",
    "Great foundation for genetics. Will use many of these techniques in my research in the future.",
    "It helped me further understand why genetics remain to be an important tool and field for biological sciences. I would apply many concepts and approaches introduced from this course in my thesis research, very helpful.",
    "It deepens my understanding about biological research and attracts me to try rotation projects in related field, which probably contributes directly to my research.",
    "My understanding of the concepts would have been much more greatly enhanced if the lectures would have been more interesting and clearlt focused",
    "I learn a lot of genetic analysis approaches. The paper reading is also very helpful.",
    "learned a lot.",
    "what i learned will help me read papers and listen to lectures and understand the information better",
    "It is good to have genetic ideas in your research. Genetic analysis is basic and powerful.",
    "I feel like I did learn some foundation of genetics and its tools in research.",
    "I learned more about genetics in this class than I have during my entire undergraduate career. I am very glad that I took the class.",
    "Gave me a much clearer understanding of practical modern approaches in genetics.",
    "learned a lot, but it was a bit patchy. the topics were not continuous"
