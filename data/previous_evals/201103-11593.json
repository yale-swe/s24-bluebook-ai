    "The class walks you through the very inception of the medium, going back to Daguerre and Talbott, all the way up to the invention of the Kodak handheld camera and the beginning of film (not so much). I didn't think I'd like this as much as I did!",
    "YES! Amazing reading and great subject.",
    "I suggest strongly against taking this course. The lecture course was intended for 80 people, started out with about 30 people, and ended up with only 4..I stayed anyways because I thought the subject is interesting. But Professor Armstrong's extremely disorganized teaching style made the course the most frustrating class I've taken at Yale. Her lecture consists of a bunch of pictures slapped onto a slide. There are no labels. Sometimes she doesn't talk about all of the pictures in the slide, so when it comes down to exams, you spend a good couple of hours not learning the concepts or theories, but googling the images to make sure you matched it up with the right title. Sometimes the images can't be found on google, and you'll just have to give up and hope it's not on the exam..that's what all of us did for exams. The most frustrating thing is labeling an image wrong and answering it wrong on the exam, you're basically being punished for either not spending time via google to make sure your titles are matched up to the painting, or you're punished for bad googling..even though you understand all the concepts. This definitely takes away the fun from learning about 19th century photography, which is supposed to be a intellectually stimulating topic. There is also like 200 pages of reading per week of dense, philosophical photography writing that she expects you to do. If you want to take this you need to make sure you're into that kind of reading and be able to commit that kind of time.",
    "Absolutely! I think a lot of people think 19th century photography would be boring compared to 20th century but there's a lot of very interesting material in this course and it's something you probably wouldn't learn about in any other photography course at Yale."
