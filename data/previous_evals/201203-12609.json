   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend this class if you are interested in really understanding semiconductors. It is a lot of work. The labs take a huge amount of time, but at least they are helpful in understanding the material. Prof. Reed is a great guy and makes the class enjoyable and relaxed. There is a lot of material covered in the midterm, but if you study, it's very doable.",
    "While I really enjoyed this class, I would only recommend it to EE majors and APHY majors because it has a high work load and is very rigorous. We had weekly problem sets, but also weekly labs, which would be very valuable to an EE or an APHY major. That being said, this class was one of the highest workload classes I have taken at Yale. Professor Reed is an excellent teacher, and both of the TAs for this class were great to work with. I wish I had taken it sooner.",
    "Lots of physics about diodes and transistors - Professor Reed covers a ton of details and you can learn a lot in this class. He is a great person, and it's worth taking the class just because of that! The topics covered are quite hard to delve into in depth - there's some quantum involved (don't stress about it though: while the professor covers a lot of quantum and related physics in the first few weeks, in the end it amounted to a tiny part of the class). There's a bunch of equations (the derivations of which are complicated). It takes a while to understand the theory - it's one of the reasons why the lab reports take so long. They are really time consuming! You have a lab a week, and some of them ask you to investigate a lot of concepts. The labs cover the course material and are 50% of the grade, so it's worth putting the time into them. Still, they were quite frustrating: in almost every lab after the first two, some of the data did not make sense. But you could email the TA's about it and they would be very understanding if e.g. your MOSFET data was all over the place. The psets and exams were similar: they were mostly plugging and chugging equations and sketching a few graphs - they were fairly easy once you understood the concepts.This class took up a lot of my time because I was not familiar with the electronics. I had little choice but to take it for my engineering requirement, but the grading and teaching was fair and I was quite satisfied with the class despite the workload.",
    "I would recommend it to anyone that is interested in electrical engineering at all. Obviously, few people will take it outside of the major, but I think it is a solid class, and even some physics students might like it.",
    "This is a good course, but only take it if you are ready for the course load. Weekly labs could be stressful for a single credit course.",
    "Good introduction to the fundamentals of semiconductors and semiconductor devices. The first part of the class is quantum mechanics--if you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know it, find help early. If you do the work, you will have a deep understanding of a few of the most basic devices, their history, and how they are made. Beware of the lab reports: they take around ten hours apiece to do. The exams (this semester) were very straightforward, and the grading is fair. Overall, good class, good professor, quite a bit of work.",
    "Excellent class for any Electrical Engineer or applied physics major interested in learning about semiconductors. Mark Reed is an awesome professor and the book this class uses is pretty good. Lab write-ups can be pretty lengthy and can take a considerable amount of time but the TAs are very flexible and understanding in getting these in. The time in labs themselves isn't very much as most labs took only an hour and a half. The homework isnt bad at all and most questions follow the examples in the book. Overall, very good class and definitely worth it for any electrical engineer."
