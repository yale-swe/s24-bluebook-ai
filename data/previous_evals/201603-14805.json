   "comments": [
    "Learned about environmental justice. Each week was a different topic, which was good, but sometimes felt a bit cursory in depth. The last three weeks students led the discussions, which was very cool, because I learned about what others were passionate about! Surprisingly, I improved my writing quality a lot in this course. Sigma used to be an English teacher and provided very helpful constructive feedback on writing, which is rare for a non-writing credit class at Yale.",
    "Amazing course! Led very well. Student participation is what makes it very unique.",
    "I learned a lot about the world and how the environment has impacted people of color. We discussed so many issues that pertain to the environment and minorities and it was eye opening to see how much people suffer and are ignored.",
    "I learned a lot about environmental justice from the readings and from my classmates.",
    "I developed a broader understanding of environmental inequalities in a variety of communities, although our analysis was mostly focused on the US. We were able to explore topics that interested us in a group project, that I found really helpful in meeting students with similar interests to my own and for working collaboratively. Our midterm paper was wonderful as a narrative piece that allowed me to explore my personal connection to this material. Finally, the final paper allowed us to academically explore a topic of interest. This was my first seminar at Yale and definitely worth it! Professor Colon even took the time to help me learn Chicago formatting.",
    "Interesting introduction to environmental justice through several different lenses.",
    "I learned the foundations of the environmental justice movement, and gained a thorough understanding of the disproportionate effects of climate change and some of the reasons for this inequality, as well as possible ways to rectify it.",
    "Environmental Inequalities teaches you to understand the environment as something more than just a physical space. I learned to expand my definition of the word \"environment\" and look critically at the social factors that create our environments.",
    "The syllabus and selection of readings served as an excellent introduction to environmental inequalities. The wide array of the scholars and the varying perspectives in the classroom made for great discussion. The form of the essays helped me develop a different style of writing. Lastly, the opportunity to lead discussion helped me formulate alternative ways of learning and allowed me to explore topics I would have otherwise not researched.",
    "I learned to think and see the effect of a lot of broader environmental issues on the individual, especially minority populations. This mindset, focusing on the individuals affected by larger systemic issues, is important and not always discussed.",
    "This course gave me insight into many different aspects of Environmental Inequalities in the US and abroad. I learned how to read government reports, and all types of company reports. I learned a vocabulary and skills to speak about environmental issues.",
    "The feedback I received for written assignments helped me to understand how to convey my thoughts more clearly through more precise sentences."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths - draws a unique group of students that genuinely care about the topic. Opportunity to learn a lot from your peers! Reading list is carefully cultivated and almost every reading feels worthwhile. Structured to promote learning but is not too much work. Lots of support from Sigma - she really wants you to learn and will meet with you outside of class and provide extensive feedback on work. Weaknesses - felt too basic at times given that it was an upper level seminar; the discussions could have been more nuanced and pushed further. Quality of discussion varied weekly, sometimes it was great, other times Sigma would try something new and it wouldn't work great.",
    "The course material and in-class discussion was definitely a strength of this course. Conversation typically flowed naturally. It could be improved with more carefully selected readings and books from a broader range of topics that could help in writing the papers. In addition, we should be tracked in class for our progress on the final paper so it isn't too daunting at the end.",
    "The strengths of this course was the breadth of material we covered, the multiple different perspectives on the issues that we discussed and also hearing everyone's perspectives and peple facilitating their own sections on topics of their choosing. I think there should have been more time for those facilitated discussions, it felt very fast, maybe bigger groups of people for each week. I also thought sometimes we engaged with the material in ways that were not supportive of bringing out peoples thoughts about it or real underlying questions.",
    "Good class. The seminar could have used more background information on the subject though, as discussions often became based on what students previously knew.",
    "This is a great course and an incredibly important subject. The majority of the readings were valuable and were conducive to good discussion, but sometimes the discussion was dominated by a few voices.",
    "AMST 315 had a wonderful atmosphere. Discussions were simultaneously engaging and relaxed. The readings were excellent and always facilitated good discussions. In my opinion, one of the greatest strengths of the class was the student-led discussions at the end of the semester, which allowed students to focus on an area they were uniquely interested in.",
    "Strengths: Class structure Class environment Selection of readings Discussion leader component Class Website Mandatory One-on-one meetings with Prof. Colon Weaknesses: Can't think of any!",
    "It is a comprehensive course that touches on many issues related to environmental justice, but sometimes discussion petered out and no one had much else to say.",
    "This course was amazing. One of the best courses I have ever taken. The readings were engaging and the cohort created by Sigma was wonderful to work with."

   "comments": [
    "Yes! This is such an important topic that really is not discussed enough. Learning from the other students in the course is inspirational, and being exposed to these authors and ideas has transformed the way I think about the environment. Definitely a class with lessons that will stick with me for years and I'm very happy I took the class.",
    "Most definitely!",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student that is interested in ER&M and the environment. There were a lot of policy discussions also, which was interesting.",
    "This class was amazing, mostly because of Sigma and the other people in it. Everyone was super engaged and I enjoyed the classes near the end that were led by students.",
    "Professor Colon was, by far, one of the most engaging professors I've had at Yale. Getting to know her is enough of a reward in this course. In addition, I think it is a great seminar that fosters unity through students with similar interests. I would highly recommend this class to any student that is interested in Environmental Inequalities if they can get in!",
    "Yes, would recommend as an easy but interesting intro to environmental justice. There's a lot of opportunity to explore personal interests as well, with great support from Sigma.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student. Know that it's a lot of work, and that you might have to fight a bit to have your voice heard, but it's a valuable course and gives you the foundational knowledge that you need about environmental justice.",
    "AMST 315 was excellent. You should absolutely take it if you have the chance.",
    "Environmental inequalities encompasses various facets of environmental justice. Workload is manageable and Professor Colon does a great job of facilitating discussion. She understands her students and makes an effort to create a safe and welcoming class environment. Take this course if you have the chance!",
    "Yes. I am not sure if it will be offered later but it is amazing. I learned a lot.",
    "Yes, Sigma is a great instructor and is very helpful throughout the course. There are quite a few small assignments throughout the semester (reading responses and comment responses to others in the class) but they are very doable. Environmental justice is a really important topic for everyone to learn about so I would recommend this course no matter your background.",
    "Yes! Sigma was amazing in facilitating this course and helped create the healthiest learning environment I've ever been able to find at Yale. The material is engaging and helped me develop skills and the confidence to speak about environmental issues. It also taught me to research and look for information in appropriate spaces. Take it! You will not regret it, even if Sigma doesn't teach it this class was great! The readings were varied but always engaging overall. Creating and running your own class with a group was an amazing opportunity and the research paper was a rewarding experience."
