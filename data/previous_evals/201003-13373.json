   "comments": [
    "Boring and hard to follow.",
    "I find the course very helpful for a health professional to understand the economic aspects of public health. And the workload is handlable.",
    "Should be advertised as a introductory microeconomics course, did not have too much of a focus on healthcare. However this is understandable because it would be difficult to frame healthcare economics without a basic understanding of the fundamentals.Strengths: Successful as an introductory economics classWeaknesses: Lecture slides often unavailable before class, no textbook, assigned readings were more interest pieces. Would recommend adding an undergraduate econ textbook as part of the syllabus.",
    "Strengths: The course material is important and relevant to the healthcare industryWeakness: Course is taught ineffectively. It would be much more helpful if Doug would do some econ problems during class written on the board. His powerpoints are not very helpful in completing the problem sets.",
    "I think this course was a waste of time\/money. It was disorganized and did not do a good job at teaching the core principles of microeconomics.",
    "Tough to follow the lectures sometimes. Slides provide adequate information to understand the material.",
    "The course was not very good and I feel that I did not gain much from it.",
    "The lectures were a bit all over the place in the beginning of the semester but got a lot better as the course went on. The problem sets were fine. The exams were problematic. Seeing what people had to do in past years and comparing it to what we were asked to do this year I am not at all comfortable that made grade in this class will be a fair assessment of my ability compared to those who have taken it in the past. Maybe it isn't supposed to be, but it bothers me a bit. I do not think the issue was moving the class from a fully qualitative nature to include some quantitative measure was the issue at all. Instead I think the issue was feeling that what I learned to do in class made me ill-prepared for what was going to be on the exam. Things were not emphasized that should have been and things that were emphasized didn't really show up on the test. I never really felt the exams were fair and since they are 85% of our grade this is a bit problematic. This was especially true on the final. That exam seemed completely out of left field. I understand wanting to make student make connections and \"next logical steps\" with what they have learned but I do not think the problem sets\/instruction\/review prepared us enough for the type of questions that were on these exams.",
    "this is a fine introductory to economics class. while it claims to cover intermediate topics, it did not cover anything i had not already studied in my introduction to microeconomics class in college. also doug mckee is a really, really nice professor and a great guy, but it doesn't seem like basic micro is his strong suit.",
    "I thought that Doug had difficulty relaying the information to a lay audience (people without an economics background). I didn't think the midterm or final were indicative of what he taught us or assessed through weekly homework assignments. He was approachable and accessible though.",
    "I strongly believe that the first half of the course should have more relevance to health care. I know this is how the course has been taught for many years, but still I would like to see more health application especially as the course's title is \"Microeconomics for Health Care Professionals.\"",
    "1. This class should be less about computation\/ applying formulas and more about understanding economic theories as they impact health. Core concepts like elasticity and discounting are much more important than the formulas that we are required to understand. I think whoever designed this class lost the forest for the trees here. No one in this class is actually going to be doing the type of calculations that were presented in the word problems on home works or old exams. We do need to understand markets and econ, but that was stressed much less in this class (just because learning the nuts and bolts of computations take so long).2. The course text is way to extensive for our needs. Can you find a more appropriate text and put that on reserve? Again though, the focus on this class should not be on computation, as perhaps an undergraduate level class would, but on concepts.3. The final exam was written well and did test our understanding of theory. The problem is that it expected us to rise to a much higher level then we were prepared for, both in class and also on old back tests.4. If you do keep the computational components of the class (and I hope you don't), please provide additional problems with answers for practice.5. It was astounding how many mistakes there were on the back tests. That is not Doug's fault, but pathetic none the less.",
    "I really enjoyed this class. Excellent introduction to microeconomics with great coverage of intro concepts and their application to health care. The structure was perfect - fairly easy weekly assignments for credit and very fair exams.",
    "The course was fine as an introductory econ class, however the instructor could have taught it better for those who had never taken an econ class before.",
    "poor teachng materials (used another professor's ppt); practice tests not indicative of formating on actual exam (used another professor's practice exams); material on exam did not cover methods covered in class.",
    "A solid, basic introduction to economics, loosely set in the healthcare context. I would have liked to see a more critical view of the usages of economics in healthcare in the course material, but there is a limit to how far you can do this in a basic introductory course without scaring the students off. There is a lot of math, but I guess that's unavoidable. I would be really interested in a higher level course that was more critically-oriented - game theory in health insurance at the institutional level, for instance!",
    "I think the department really failed the students in selecting an instructor that had never taught at a graduate school level, and never taught basic economics. If I was told Doug was a humanities post-doc I would believe it...he often struggled teaching us the basic concepts in lectures (Supply, demand). I have a real issue with the decision because the department is full of profs with econ backgrounds. I heard the breakdown of grades, and for 55% to receive honors is a joke, and for at least 30% of the 55%, you have Katie (the TA) to thank.Furthermore, I expressed my concerns for his teaching ability during the midterm evaluation and really feel I was given lip service. Nothing was done, changes weren't made. For all new professors, someone should view a class to basically confirm the prof knows what they are doing. As someone who went to a state school for undergrad, paid less than $200 per course, Yale should be ashamed...Doug was the least qualified professor I have ever encountered. I feel I should get at least a partial refund for the 3000+ dollars I spent for that class.",
    "This class would benefit from more applications of the information we are learning so that we have a better knowledge of how it applies to our field specifically. Also, I think the class could have been structured more cohesively. Furthermore, more throughout supplementary reading might have helped compensate for the deficiencies in the lectures.",
    "I enjoyed the class and did learn a lot! I think it would be nice to have more time to discuss more of the health related issues (as we did once) - but understandably, there isnt enough time to cover all the material and still be able to do so."

    "Instructor: Douglas McKee \u00a0Unprepared",
    "Instructor: Douglas McKee \u00a0He is humorous in class and nice with students. One problem is that he sometimes look puzzled even in front of the questions raised by himself. I assume more preparation for class is needed.",
    "Instructor: Douglas McKee \u00a0Doug certainly cared about the students and made an earnest effort in teaching the material. At times, he had difficulty answering student's questions or contradicted his lecture material.",
    "Instructor: Douglas McKee \u00a0Strengths: He is very knowledgeable in the topic and is obviously passionate about his work. He is approachable and nice.Weakness: I have taken econ courses and in comparison, this course would be very hard if I hadn't taken an intro econ course. The powerpoints are not effective in teaching the concepts or how to solve the problems. It would be much better if Doug can go over a concept briefly and then solve an actual problem on the board. This would be a much better reference to have when we go on to do our own HW problem sets and take the exams. He could also be more prepared because when he is confused or is questioning his statement, it makes me confused.",
    "Instructor: Douglas McKee \u00a0Although Doug is very nice- he is too far beyond the basics of economics to teach an intro course.",
    "Instructor: Douglas McKee \u00a0The instructor seemed unprepared for class, unable to ever effectively explain a problem fully, and incapable of understanding the material well enough to teach us.",
    "Instructor: Douglas McKee \u00a0Professor McKee was an interesting case. He is a newer professor so I understand that he needs to get some rust out and he did. His lectures improved tremendously over the course of the semester, but once again the exams are a problem. A lot of people were unhappy about the mid-term and I don't think that those criticisms were taken into account when developing the final.",
    "Instructor: Douglas McKee \u00a0prof. mckee clearly put time, effort and thought into the class, but i think it may have been too long since he'd spent any real time working with the fundamentals of micro. he's very clearly an intelligent man, but struggled to convey some of these topics in a clear, concise manner. probably there are other classes to take from him that more accurately reflect his strengths. that said, he's a very sympatheticguy.",
    "Instructor: Douglas McKee \u00a0I thought that Doug had difficulty relaying the information to a lay audience (people without an economics background). I didn't think the midterm or final were indicative of what he taught us or assessed through weekly homework assignments. He was approachable and accessible though.",
    "Instructor: Douglas McKee \u00a0Doug McKee is an excellent instructor.I was extremely impressed with Professor McKee's patience and understanding both inside the classroom and out. During class he frequently took time out to explain both easy and more difficult concepts to any student who asked. Moreover, he was consistently available outside of class hours for extra assistance - both during regular lecture weeks and for even extra time during exam periods.Professor McKee was able to teach to a wide range of students' backgrounds - from those of us who had never had a course in microeconomics to those who had more than a few semesters of economics. Indeed, he was extremely cognizant of students' feedback and was able to aptly and constructively manage and incorporate this feedback into the course.",
    "Instructor: Douglas McKee \u00a0Doug is an great dude and I really like him. As a new instructor, he would benefit from1. Mentoring from a more seasoned teacher on how to break down economic theories simply. Practice in communicating need to know ideas more clearly.2. Help with writing exams (the final was much better than the midterm)3. Less waffling when answering questions",
    "Instructor: Douglas McKee \u00a0Dr. McKee was an excellent teacher - good at clarifying concepts and spent a large amount of time responding to students' interests and questions. Very helpful in office hours.",
    "Instructor: Douglas McKee \u00a0The instructor never seemed prepared for class. There were times when he did not know what was on the class slides. The tests were not representative of the material that was learned or presented in class, especially the final exam. Overall, very disappointed with the instructor.",
    "Instructor: Douglas McKee \u00a0Doug was really at ease with the class. I would have preferred if the slides were ready before my bedtime on the night before class, but I eventually learned to get up early and print them off during breakfast.",
    "Instructor: Douglas McKee \u00a0See comments above.",
    "Instructor: Douglas McKee \u00a0The instructor was extremely helpful and accessible to the students. Also, his instructions in his office hours were useful and offered a lot of clarity. However, the class lectures were not terribly well structured and the lecturing was extremely unclear and confusing.",
    "Instructor: Douglas McKee \u00a0I think as this was the first time teaching the class, Doug can only get better. He is truly dedicated to making sure that students understand - and I think that is very important."
