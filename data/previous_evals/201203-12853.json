   "comments": [
    "Spanish 150 is a class where you speak spanish for 50 minutes, discussing articles and stories you read on your own for homework. There are debates and roleplaying in addition to movie-watching. I would recommend this class to anyone who wants to increase their fluency and increase their confidence in speaking the language. Also, this is a great way to fulfill the language requirement. I think it's definitely one of the easier L5 options.",
    "Take this class, it will make you near fluent, the only next step being in a spanish speaking country to become more fluent.",
    "This class is a perfect choice for those of you who have placed into L5 and need to complete your language credit. I highly recommend it if you fall into that category. It's not work-intensive, so it won't be a drain on your resources. Honestly, it's a pretty smooth ride.",
    "This class is one that helps students become more confident with their conversational skills through a lot of classroom discussion and partner-to-partner exchange. It only meets three times a week, so the time commitment is not that great and the workload is very manageable. If you get the chance, take it with the wonderful Prof. Valle. She's capable, confident, and very approachable, and makes the class enjoyable to attend. If you're looking for a class that will help you brush up on your speaking skills while not demanding too much work, this is a great option. Shop it for sure.",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone looking for an easy L5 to fulfill the requirement or to anyone looking to improve their Spanish in a relaxed environment. Spanish 150 is a great class - you basically read articles or stories each week and discuss them in class. There are also a few role playing exercises and discussion panels. Minimal work and the oral exams were not stressful. Take it with Sonia Valle if possible. She is really helpful and gives great feedback on how to improve.",
    "Take this class, even if you're intimidated on the first few days. If you're looking to fulfill the language requirement, this is a low-stress way to do so. You won't have to memorize that much vocabulary: instead, you'll learn to actually use those words in conversation. Sonia Valle is amazing: she provides clear explanations, and she's extremely nice and approachable.",
    "Spanish 150 is a great class and is much easier than any of the other Spanish levels (I took L1-L5). The workload is not tough, although it is essential that you prepare each day for class. If you like spanish or need this to satisfy your language requirement, then take this class (especially with Sonia Valle if you can get into her section).",
    "If you need an L5 to fill your language requirements (or if you just love conversing) take this class, and definitely take with Profesora Valle. The workload is easy\/manageable, the midterm and final are oral conversations in partners with prompts given way in advance, and your Spanish will improve a lot.",
    "Spanish 150 is a great opportunity to refine your conversational skills and read\/discuss some interesting novels, short stories, and topics. Professor Valle is wonderful, and I would absolutely recommend any section taught by her, if you can fit it into your schedule. Keep in mind - you will likely not improve your knowledge of Spanish grammar or language in this class, but you should come out of the course being able to speak more fluidly!",
    "I would recommend this class. If you are looking to improve your oral spanish, then take this class. Professor Valle is great and the class itself is enjoyable. If you put in the effort, you will see results. My Spanish improved a lot over the course of the semester."
