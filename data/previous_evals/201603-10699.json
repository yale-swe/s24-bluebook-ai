   "comments": [
    "I learned many different writing skills. I learned different styles of papers to write, through this learning different writing tactics.",
    "I learned a lot of skills on writing papers, reading extended essays and articles and managing my time. I had to balance this class with STEM classes and was able to use skills I learned for English in my other courses. I gained writing skills I know will help me in future classes.",
    "I learned how to better develop an argument and how to write more coherently.",
    "I appreciated the structure and guidance this course gave me to learn to write in a more succinct and clear way.",
    "ENGL 114 is great introductory writing course that requires one to write a lot of material over the semester. I learned the value of drafting and laying out stages for each one of my essays, which I think will help me in the future with my writing!",
    "I feel that I really improved my overall writing skills through this course. I learned how to write a variety of pieces, including both a research paper and an opinion piece.",
    "I developed reading skills from all the readings as well as my analytical skills. Additionally, I developed my writing skills, especially in terms of time management when writing. I learned how to approach different types of papers.",
    "ENGL 114 taught me how to make academic arguments and support them with evidence, write clearly, and critically read academic writing.",
    "Taking this course, I learned how to write academic essays of various types- essay that is supported by one or multiple sources of evidence, an opinionated essay and a research paper. It was a fantastic course and introduction to the guidelines of a good writing that will be of use for many other courses in college. I learned how to have a debatable and strong argument and counterargument and how to analyze my perspective efficiently."

   "comments": [
    "I really enjoyed discussing reading in class and having our third paper be the research essay, it was due at a much better time. Although sometimes nerve racking, the presentations we did were very helpful to collect my thoughts. I would have liked more office hours around the third paper.",
    "I think there should be more writing workshops and I also never quite understood how to make my arguments deeper so I needed help with that but never truly got it.",
    "The readings were interesting, but not always relevant to the assignments. The structure was as asset to the course.",
    "Although I really enjoyed our class discussions, sometimes it did become slightly less engaging, and perhaps some way of spicing up the discussion would work well at those times. I thought basically all the rest of the course was great!",
    "I really enjoyed the readings of this course and the topic\/ assignments. I did not think there were any major weaknesses.",
    "A strength was the diversity of types of papers we had to write and the order we had to write them in.",
    "ENGL 114 (Beauty, Fashion, and Ethics) helped me improve my writing by making me more conscious of what good writing is. Through reading academic papers and writing four papers, I grew tremendously as a writer. Also, the readings on beauty were eye-opening and thought provoking because they presented me with different perspectives of beauty that I hadn't considered before. In terms of weaknesses of the class, I can't think of anything-- this class helped me significantly improve my writing, the due dates for assignments were considerate, and Katja was so incredibly knowledgable and helpful. However, this course could improve the amount of feedback given on each paper. I felt that we received very helpful feedback on papers 1 and 3 but not sufficient feedback on papers 2 and 4.",
    "The course's strengths are that we got detailed feedback on 3 out of 4 papers on our first draft before we submitted the final draft and that was really helpful because we knew what do we need to revise and along the way, learned from the process about what do we need to improve in our way of writing for the long term. One more strength was the fact that the readings and papers that we had to write were greatly varied- different topics for the readings and different styles for the writing- and that difference made us enjoy reading and writing more, work harder and be more creative. I loved and was attracted to the topic of the course as well. This course taught me how to look at a single topic from different points of view and in depth."

   "comments": [
    "Yes, I thin this was an interesting topic for an English 114 class, and I learned many writing skills.",
    "Absolutely! Loved this class",
    "Definitely recommend if you want to become a better writer. Also it is a great introduction to college writing and the expectations of college writing.",
    "Yes, if the they hope to improve research and writing skills.",
    "I would recommend this class! It's a great class for what it's for - an introductory college-level writing course - and it will get you accustomed to writing essays with deadlines and managing your time. I feel prepared to go into the other writing classes at Yale now as well!",
    "I would recommend this course to other students at Yale looking to improve their writing skills. I really enjoyed it, and enjoyed the topic of this section in particular.",
    "Yes, I definitely would!",
    "I strongly recommend Beauty, Fashion, and Ethics to anyone who isn't confident about their writing skills and wants to improve their writing. This class helped me become more aware of the elements of good writing-- specifically the importance of being clear and concise. Katja is a very helpful, kind, and knowledgable instructor and gave me such great feedback during her office hours. Katja is the best ENGL 114 instructor in my opinion and readings for this class were fascinating, so what more could you ask for in a class? Definitely take Beauty, Fashion, and Ethics!",
    "Yes definitely, it is an excellent course and great introduction to academic writing. It required a lot of work sometimes- but pays off at the end of the semester when you realize how many things you have learned about academic writing in a mere 3 months. I believe that every student should take ENG114 to improve his\/her writing skills for college essays in general and this topic and professor were amazing. I highly recommend this course."
