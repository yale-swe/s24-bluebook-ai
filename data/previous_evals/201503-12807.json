   "comments": [
    "Would highly recommend if you have at least a small foundation in reading academic theory. Take it and actually set aside the time to do the readings, and you'll get a lot out of it.",
    "I loved this class! This class gives a great historical perspective on a huge body of feminist and queer theory and gives a lot of context for the current debates about feminist and queer issues that I really appreciated. Whether or not you're a WGSS or English major, you should take this course!!",
    "Definitely take this course with Professor Homans. She is brilliant, insightful, and truly cares about her students. The reading in this course is not insignificant, but they are for the most part fascinating, especially because Professor Homans guides the class to the most salient point in the text. You will leave with an amazingly comprehensive understanding of the history of feminist and queer theory, if you put in the work. Be prepared to spend significant hours doing the readings for this class. The essays are not too long (two 7 page, one 3 page, one 1-2 page), but just because they are short(ish) doesnt mean they dont require significant time. But this class is so worth the investment! Take it!",
    "This class has an enormous amount of reading, but it is some of the most interesting reading you will ever encounter. One semester only skims the surface, but Professor Homans tries to expose her students to as much of the surface as possible so that they may continue learning on their own. Truly a life changing class.",
    "As others have noted, this class is invaluable and will radically change your perspectives in and out of the classroom. Margaret Homans is also wonderful; she's funny, brilliant, and managed a large class (and a large volume of readings!) with complete grace. But the class sometimes felt like too much--too many students (the seminar was over -enrolled), too much reading, and not enough time. In a sense, this speaks to just how expansive and important this material is, and it shouldn't stop you from taking the class! But do be prepared for long readings, and to sometimes wish for more time to cover it all.",
    "Absolutely, take this course if you get the chance. It's one of the best seminars I've ever taken at Yale at Professor Homans is a wonderful teacher, mentor, all around human being.",
    "This course is pretty reading intensive but assignments are manageable and Prof Homans tells you which to focus on. You survey feminist thought beginning with the 19th c. but spend most time on 20th c writers and by the end of the course are reading extremely contemporary stuff. Very useful for getting acquainted with the academic discipline.",
    "Feminist and Queer Theory is a fantastic historical approach to gender studies in the West, from the 1700s to the present. If you've only been exposed to snippets of 2nd or 3rd wave feminism before, this class is crucial to helping fill in those gaps. Take it with Margaret Homans! She is incredibly knowledgeable and gives excellent feedback.",
    "Great class, even better professor!!",
    "Just know what you're getting into. A lot of scattershot but interesting reading.",
    "Boring, boring, boring. If you're a WGSS major you have to take this (I'm sorry). If you're not a WGSS major, steer clear. This class, while it did provide a good foundation in queer and feminist thought, was incredibly, painfully boring. Piles of reading that are impossible to wade through.",
    "feminist and queer theory is a seminar that traces back to the earliest writings of feminist texts starting in Europe and moving throughout the various waves. Although we do discuss more women writers of color as the semester progresses there is a really strong concentration on European white women in the beginning.",
    "Absolutely must take. Professor Homans is brilliant and everything on the syllabus is a must-read."
