    "Compared to Korean 110, I was surprised to learn so much Korean at such a fast pace. I got a better grasp on Korean grammar and usage, and I feel much more confident trying to talk to in Korean to native speakers. Also, I can read Korean characters much more fluently, so now when I go to karaoke, at least I can sing despite not understanding.",
    "I further developed my Korean writing, listening, and speaking skills through this class.",
    "L2 is a great expansion off of the L1 learning. I felt like I made significant progress in reading, writing, speaking, and vocabulary. All in all, it was a very standard and well done language course.",
    "Further development of Korean grammar",
    "Elementary Level 2 Korean, which was an elaboration of skills learned in Level 1."

    "Professor Choi was extremely efficient in teaching us Korean. The class is taught at a near perfect rate, and my writing and speaking skills improved. However, I think the dictation\/listening aspect of the course could be more heavily focused on. We speak at a much slower rate than native Koreans do.",
    "This course is provides a sufficient amount of work to improve your proficiency in the language. By the end you should be able to hold basic conversation and understand very basic conversation. The daily vocabulary quizzes helped increase my vocabulary knowledge and improve my conversational skills.",
    "I think that the structure was handled very well and that all the expectations were made very clear. I don't feel like there were many faults with the course.",
    "Strength was that there was a very good emphasis on speaking & listening. Weakness is lack of structure.",
    "I think this course is very thoughtfully laid out and functions well to help students learn Korean, so no improvements are necessary."

    "If you're looking for a language to pick up pretty easily, Korean would be a good choice.",
    "Yes, enthusiastically!",
    "Yes",
    "I would recommend this course. We learned many important new grammar concepts that helped me to make my writing and speaking more complex.",
    "If you're interested in learning Korean at even the base level, this course is obviously a must.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student committed to learning another language because the work load would not be fun for a student disinterested in the content."
