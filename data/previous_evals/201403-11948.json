   "comments": [
    "A great Spanish course that uses a variety of media to expose you to spoken Spanish and has a great focus on grammar.",
    "This is a strong grammar course taught by a passionate and entertaining instructor. If you are uncomfortable with the vocabulary of studying grammar, you will struggle HARD unless you take time to make sure you actually understand the theory of how sentences work. With more self-study than the homework alone provides, students in this class have the opportunity to fill in several spanish language gaps that are easy to grow. Likewise, even after taking this course, you will not become any more fluent in Spanish unless you aggressively practice and participate in class.",
    "Overall, I think that SPAN 132 is a solid course if a Spanish Heritage speaker wants to delve into the fundamental grammar rules and principles of Spanish. In other words, if you're a student who has spoken Spanish all of your life and have a vague understanding of how to read\/write the language but you lack a structured background in specific grammar rules, then this course is for you. In this course, you'll be exposed to many different types of Spanish literature, expected to and instructed on how to write essays in Spanish (with multiple drafts, peer review, and personalized editing from the professor), and tested on various subsets of Spanish grammar. SPAN 132 was also a particularly small class when I took it. (only 8 students!) That was definitely one of the course's strengths since it meant that you could easily get in contact with the professor if you ever needed any help with anything, and the professor was able to get to know you very well by the end of the semester. It's a great course, but like all courses, it is what you make of it. If you choose to slack off on the work, you won't better your Spanish significantly. Good luck!",
    "I would recommend this course."
