   "comments": [
    "A transnational understanding of Mexican\/ mexican American history. Major themes. Historiography of the field. Methods. How to write a review.",
    "I learned an expansive history of Mexican and Mexican American experiences concerning the United States. From expanding the timelines of the Mexican American civil rights movement and the Chicano Movement, complicating understandings of undocumented migration, rurality, and farmworker labor, and deepening understandings of sociopolitical formations of Mexican Americans, this course was extremely helpful.",
    "Gained general historiographical knowledge about field of Mexican and Mexican American history; critical archival analysis; ways to foreground class and gender in writing; new ways to pose critical questions; sense of types of questions on oral exams.",
    "I gained an understanding of the timeline of the history of Mexican\/Mexican-Americans from 1848 to the late twentieth century, with a particular focus on labor history and immigration history that I previously did not have a good grasp on. This course was useful in helping me build my knowledge of specific laws and policy changes throughout these histories as well. Additionally, through tangential networking opportunities at various events, I furthered my professional development.",
    "This course was useful in providing an overview of Mexican and Mexican American labor, migration, and cultural histories. The readings for this course were mostly recently published works that allowed us to discuss the different methodologies and new topics being explored by scholars."

   "comments": [
    "I loved the reading selections and the responses for each week. Loved when primary sources were brought to class! Maybe each student during presentations could bring their own primary source.",
    "Strengths: the syllabus was very thoughtful in its contents; the practice oral exam questions were useful in preparing PhD students for orals Weaknesses: when students didn't read, the discussions fell short",
    "Strengths were professor's great facilitation of discussion and clarity in explaining ideas and concepts; willingness of class to contribute to discussion; variety and thought put into pairing the readings; weekly responses helped distill thoughts. Weaknesses: can't think of any. This was a good class.",
    "On weeks that there were multiple readings, I wished that there was a choice where students could pick one author to better delve into their work as opposed to trying to fit in both. I think it would give students an opportunity to collaborate more further through teaching each other about the works and readings. Otherwise, the course was outstanding."

   "comments": [
    "Absolutely! It was also a great course to learn graduate school basics like writing reviews, keeping notes organized, and using the library online.",
    "Yes, as a history course, this class was extremely helpful in understanding Mexican American issues, such as citizenship, migration, civil rights, and labor.",
    "Yes-especially to any historian who generally wants to learn about different strategies for writing history and doing research, and also how to run a class really well.",
    "Absolutely. I think for the experience of discussing with fellows students these important histories and learning from an excellent faculty member, this course is essential for all students.",
    "I would recommend this course to any students interested in borderlands history and migration studies. Although this course focuses on Mexicans and Mexican Americans, it will provide valuable insights to students working in Latinx and Ethnic studies."
