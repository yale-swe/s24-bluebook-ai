   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this course to any student pursuing any major. It provides a view of American history, and of current American society, that is very important to be aware of. This course altered the way I think about how I live, as well as how I will live out the rest of my college career.",
    "It's a cool mix of religious studies and american studies. But you have to buy into the idea that religion is everywhere.",
    "NOT a history course, kind of just a rock-and-roll amusement park ride in American Studies Disneyland, if Disneyland were the ashram du jour of the Williamsburg overclass. You will laugh, cry, hate Lofton, idolize Lofton, peg her at various time as Oprah\/preacher\/cult leader, question your mental health, and realize that maybe, maybe your parents are getting their 60 thousand dollars' worth.",
    "Religion in Modern America is sometimes eye-opening, sometimes infuriating, but on the whole definitely worth taking. It opens your eyes to a new way of looking at the world, which is what the best classes do. Lofton is brilliant and engaging, but don't get too caught up in her cult of personality to maintain a critical distance from her ideas; the course is ultimately more fulfilling that way. TFs' careful grading is a feature of the class, not a bug. It forces you to actually construct a good argument rather than just write essays that get an A for being well-written and somewhat coherent. The class pushes the limits of what a history course can be and provides you with more theory than facts, but as long as you're open to that it's a rewarding experience.",
    "YES! Great class--grading is very arbitrary to seem \"hard\"--but the truth is, some of the comments under which I \"lost points\" didn't really make sense on my papers. That being said, I would say about half of the comments made perfect sense--so half of my writing definitely got better!",
    "I wouldn't recommend this class because a lot of it felt like a stretch of what religion is. We had a few classes on Oprah, and I was not convinced that Oprah is modern religion.",
    "Yes, it is a great class and I learned the most in this class (out of all of my classes this semester). Professor Lofton makes you think about interesting, relevant issues and her class will force you to look at the world in a different way. It's definitely a demanding class, so you might want to start it out Cr\/D if you can and aren't using it for your major, but I think that anyone can do okay if they work hard.",
    "YES. This is literally the PERFECT class to take credit\/d. I highly recommend doing that - not that I would've done poorly at all, but it's the perfect class to just enjoy without having to stress about grades at all. The lectures are PHENOMENAL - after 7 semesters at Yale, Kathryn Lofton is without a doubt in the top 3 professors I've ever had. Maybe top 2. Her passion and enthusiasm and energy are so contagious. I loved every single lecture and was very sad to see the class end. The papers are all short, and the exams aren't too difficult if you study. It's really nice how spread out the assignments are, so you'll never have one thing that's worth a huge portion of your grade. The class seriously opened my eyes to the study of religion in a way that I never thought it would. TAKE IT TAKE IT TAKE IT.",
    "Religion in Modern America is a really interesting class. Professor Lofton is a fantastic lecturer but the class is quite difficult, so I would recommend taking it Credit\/D\/Fail. The workload is heavy (about 70ish pages of reading as well as reading questions and reading responses per week, and 4 papers throughout the semester) but most of it is interesting and worth the work.",
    "HIGHLY RECOMMEND",
    "Yes def take. It will change your perspective of religion and how it intertwines with American history.",
    "This class was touted as one of the best at Yale and the first class certainly got my attention in terms of its delivery \u00e2\u0080\u0093\u00c2\u00a0Lofton knows how to put on a show. Unfortunately, it didn't live up to my high expectations. As a senior, this class was overwhelming in terms of workload (too many short papers) and underwhelming in terms of content (not analytical enough, lacking nuance); it was created with a stereotypical freshman in mind (bright eyed, unconfident or overconfident in their writing, and willing to take in over simplified, one-sided arguments). I couldn't stomach the lectures which, despite many theatrical elements, went into very surface-level shit for the most part. The readings were interesting, but they were almost never discussed in lecture \u00e2\u0080\u0093\u00c2\u00a0and readings were discussed way too much in section.Enough critiquing, here's how the class can be improved. Taking a topic head on \u00e2\u0080\u0093\u00c2\u00a0say religious education in public schools \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and gearing the lecture towards the argument around this kind of curriculum. BOTH SIDES of the argument. We'd read the court cases, Sehat, and one proponent of Christian-based prayer in school. This would allow us to see: what do proponents of public prayer say, and what do opponents rebut with? Analyzing the arguments and their validity would improve the lecture's appeal to reason. Of course emotions could be provided by Lofton and the class (WHY DIDN'T LOFTON SOLICIT RESPONSES FROM THE CLASS, EVER?).Also, stop with the BS writing assignments. It's bad enough having to be told with \"primary\" and \"secondary sources\" are, but to structure not one but TWO papers around that kind of knowledge is absolutely demeaning to the majority of the students in the class. We don't need to analyze a source, especially when it's a topic we haven't discussed in class. We need to go deeper, and build off the class.",
    "An interesting religious studies course that will approach the study of American religion in a unique way, using unlikely objects--such as \"The Matrix,\" Oprah, and lynchings. Don't expect a straightforward historical survey of American religious practice--it's much more theoretical, and Lofton selects a variety of disparate subjects, often from the peripheries of American religion (Jonestown, Scientology, etc.)",
    "Great Class. Too much workLoved it, but it was way too much work. 4 papers, midterm, and final. Do NOT think that just because the papers are short they will be easy. They are the hardest papers you will ever write, and she is a HARD grader. That said, AMAZING class. Take it Credit D",
    "I would recommend this class to others because it was an interesting and fun class.",
    "Take it if you're interested in a different look at the history of religion in America!!",
    "Yes. If looking for an easy humanities course to fulfill Hu requirements, look elsewhere. Lofton is a dynamic lecturer - each class is an experience in and of itself. The readings are for the most part very interesting and necessary for the midterms \/ final. The 5-6 short essays, graded on a \"rubric,\" were probably the greatest weakness of this course. Read: Focus on \"checking the boxes\" on the rubric because essays are not graded \"holistically\" whatever that means. For science majors \/ pre meds looking for a solid introduction to modern American religion, you'll learn so, so much from this course but expect some frustration with at-times arbitrary grading. On the plus side, Lofton is INCREDIBLY responsive, remembers your name, and really puts in the effort to see students succeed if they reach out (take advantage).",
    "Yes! An overall challenging, but thrilling ride. A course like no other!",
    "Lofton is a #goddess. I love hearing her speak. Her arguments are really cool (even if sometimes they aren't as successfully argued as you might like.) She's amazing to talk to. She's not for everyone though--gotta make sure you like how she lectures. There was a lot of writing, which was annoying. However, I didn't think things were graded nearly as hard as people say they are--but maybe it's based on your TA\/your experience in writing. I took it Cr\/D which was a bit annoying given the workload (and I was doing well enough anyway) but it was nice to not have to obsess over the papers.",
    "I would describe Religion in Modern America as being an overview of how religious practice has developed in the United States. I would recommend the course to other students cautioning them to be aware of the amount of required reading.",
    "Excellent! Definitely a must take- Professor Lofton is an incredibly engaging and entertaining teacher and the topics are interesting and gripping.",
    "History 145 tries to answer the question of what is religion in modern America? It is an overview of many religious movements in America and the cultural and societal shifts that were involved in the origins of the religion and how society changed because of the religion in question. I would definitely recommend this class to another student if they are interested in religion and even if they are not and know little about it. It is a great class to hone in on writing precise historic papers and the content of the course is really fascinating.",
    "An enjoyable course with good insight into the relationship American people and society have with religion, however I would not go so far as to recommend it, as the subject matter I feel may not appeal particularly to most of my friend group",
    "This class had moments of brilliance, but overall, was disappointing. It is basically a sociology of religion in America. Don't take it expecting a straight history class. You don't learn a ton of history in the class - the more American history you know going in, the better.I definitely learned in this class, but, as someone who already discussed religion much with my friends, I felt that I gained little insight I could not have gained through conversations with them. Certainly, though, I was exposed to different topics (scientology, megachurches, Jonestown, etc.).",
    "Sure! It's one of those survey-scope American history lectures (like Chauncey's gay history and Blight's Civil War) that are just good to take while you're at Yale."
