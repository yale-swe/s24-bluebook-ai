   "comments": [
    "I would. It's an interesting class that challenges you to think in new ways.",
    "Take it. There is almost no work, and it's pretty cool stuff.",
    "I would not recommend this course to another student, unless he already has background in the subject. I had a friend taking the Lecture course (ECON 115) who helped me out with this class, and as I saw his material and his professor's slides, they were much more helpful than the ones in ECON 110. I think that it depends on which professor you get for the seminar, however, as I had friends taking ECON 110 with Olga that enjoyed the class very much.",
    "Econ 110 is nice because you'll be able to interact with the professor more than in the Econ 115 lecture. It's still a lecture, though. Just a small lecture, not a seminar. If you want to regularly contribute, you absolutely can, but it's not as if you're sitting around a table having a conversation. It's a good class, and you'll get a lot out of it, but be sure to spend real time on the psets, because they're such a small part of the grade, and it's easy for them not to seem important.",
    "This course is an interesting intro to microeconomics, and the textbook as well as the instruction was effective at contextualizing this in a broad framework.",
    "Take it if you think\/know you have an interest in economics--you'll get a solid grounding of the material and learn some interesting things. Don't take it just if you are mildly interested in exploring the field--you'll get bored. The problem sets aren't much working but you'll need to do a ton of studying for the midterm and final.",
    "I would recommend it to anyone is considering studying economics. It is a good class to understand what the subject is about."
