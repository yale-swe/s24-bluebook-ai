    "Basically a continuation of Arabic, but I thought it was much improved. We learned vocab as quickly as last year at first, but instead of moving on, we kept reviewing it over and over, which means that the vast majority of it stuck. Definitely not as grammar-heavy, so we have a lot more fun with stories, skits, etc in class. We even got to watch Ice Age II, and understood a good deal of it. The workload was definitely more manageable and seemed less like busy work. I enjoyed going to class every day (except maybe CC day), and I feel a lot more comfortable in every area of the language. If you got through 120, you'll really feel good in 130. I enjoyed it.",
    "Arabic 130 is a good way to finish learning all MSA grammar. However, the vocab is worthless if it came to actually speaking in the modern Arab world. The teachers rotate, which is only good when you have Shady Nasser or Sarab! Overall, it feels like you don't really learn that much useful stuff over the semester, but if you do want to learn a language, you have to keep learning and taking classes. It's up to you!",
    "I still don't feel like I can speak any Arabic, but I'd say it definitely helps with reading. A much less annoying course that L1\/2",
    "This class is very disorganized. Because we don't use the book and use short stories instead, you don't interact as fully with the vocabulary. In particular, I left the class with minimal listening comprehension despite the class periods that we spent listening to Ice Age. I do feel more comfortable forming my own dialogues after spending a good amount of time doing that this semester.",
    "I would not recommend this class to anyone who did not ABSOLUTELY need arabic for their major or future careers. Even then, I would probably advise them to try and take it at another university, over the summer, or in grad school.",
    "DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS. The department is hopelessly unorganized. The DUS is inacessible and unfair. The course requirements will change throughout the semester, as will the grade distribution, and you will be confused until the class is over. Students that grew up with Arabic speaking parents or in a comparable environment that gave them background Arabic knowledge will be in your class and will be given an advantage because the DUS will favor them and their abilities instead of trying to assist students that might struggle more with this difficult language because they started studying it at Yale without any background knowledge. If you are already familiar with Arabic and tested into level 3, go ahead and take the class. You'll probably get a good grade. If you don't need this class, however, don't take it. If you need to study Arabic for one reason or another, consult Sarab Al Ani about an independent study program. She is the only professor that will help you develop your Arabic language skills.",
    "Its a good class and but by no means is it an easy ride, you'll have to spend a lot of time on it. But at the end of the day, the feeling of achievement for having come this far in Arabic, is good feeling!",
    "If you want to learn Arabic, do it after Yale. You don't want to waste course credits or Wednesday and Thursday nights memorizing conversations you don't understand or 100 words of obscure vocabulary.If you want to learn Classical Arabic, this might help you.If you ware taking Arabic to be an Area Studies Major, just do Poli Sci with IR and don't take Arabic.",
    "Intermediate arabic, gets annoying from time to time to go to class everyday and feel like you are not really much",
    "This course is not for anyone interested in conversational Arabic. If someone is interested in reading classical Arabic, or the study of linguistics, then this course is ok. This course will not, in any way, prepare one for conversation with an average citizen of an Arab country.",
    "I guess if you already took L1\/L2 and you are deciding whether to power through L3 to finish you language requirement or not, you should take it. It isn't horrible, and it's maybe a little easier than L2. It's still a grind though, and I don't feel like I've advanced much in my understanding of the language. Make sure you get a good TA so that section isn't miserable. Also, I don't know if teacher rotation is going to stick around, but if not I would recommend taking Shadee's or Shady's class; I had them for most of the semester and they are pretty cool guys.",
    "I would definitely not recommend this class to another student. It is necessary if you want to take Arabic at Yale because you have to take L3 before you can move on to a dialect (which is an actual spoken version of the language, where as Modern Standard is just the basics of the written language), but I wouldn\u0092t recommend taking Arabic at Yale in general. At least not right now. The department claims to be \u0091revitalizing\u0092 the curriculum, but I am not sure how long that will be going on. I had Ghassan for L1. He was fantastic. Though the course material was difficult, I looked forward to going to class each morning. However, he left for one reason or another. Recently, the department has decided to implement a rotating cycle with the teachers. However, this cycle is completely flawed. Though it should work out so that each class has each teacher once every five weeks, it does not work that way at all. This semester I believe the 9:20am section had Aziz for the first two weeks, Sarab for one week, Shadee for three or so weeks, Hazmik for one week, and then Shady for the rest of the semester. I am not sure if the other two sections were more standardized, but ours was completely inconsistent. Part of this was due to the fact that the department changed the curriculum in the middle of the semester. It went from being a lot of work to a LOT of work, but in an organized way. For every Monday class we had to write and memorize a student Core Conversation (dialogue) with one or two other students, for Tuesdays we had to read and summarize either one or a series of \u0093Joha stories\u0094 which are stories about a silly man who somehow manages to get everything right, Wednesdays we learned new grammar or reviewed old grammar, for Thursday classes we had to memorize all parts of page-long Core Conversations (dialogues), and every Friday we took avocabulary quiz for which we had to memorize between 100 and 200 words from vocabulary lists that came from short stories we had read \u0096 so they usually contained words relating to magical forests, fairies, and dwarves: all not so useful in Arabic-speaking nations when trying to hail a cab or order a meal. On testing weeks we had a listening test on Monday, a written test on Tuesday, and then Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday continued as mentioned above. I would have enjoyed putting in this much work if I felt that I had come out of the course with a comprehensive knowledge of the language and the ability to speak it somewhat proficiently, but I do not feel this way at all. I also bought the assigned textbook and then touched it a grand total of one time throughout the course of the semester. The department created its own course packet, which was available online (which was good), but it would have been nice to know we would no longer need the book that was written as required on the syllabus. Also, the majority of other undergraduate-level Arabic language departments (at various schools) use that textbook, and follow its curriculum, and their students seem to feel like they learn the language rather well."
