   "comments": [
    "Yes. Pretty easy class and interesting.",
    "Really interesting class, make sure you go to lecture each week and you won't have trouble with the weekly quizzes. Prof is great.",
    "It is a great class! Take it, for sure!!!",
    "The class covered interesting topics about Christianity and Islam in general and how these religions interacted with politics to give rise to a spectrum of social and political systems today.I took R&P as a light fifth class. It was not much work. There were weekly in-class writing assignments (60% of your grade) for which you could get by without doing the readings if you paid attention in class. There was also a final (40% of your grade) which was pretty straight forward even without doing the readings if you had good notes from class. Overall, it was a good choice for a light workload class that was interesting as well. I wish that the professor would have been a little more organized and engaging though.",
    "This is a great class to really delve into roots of capitalism. It was pretty sweet.",
    "Yes: it's easy, it's enjoyable, you learn a lot about how religion shapes politics, and it challenges your assumptions.No: lectures were a little bit boring at times.",
    "I would recommend this class to another student. The Professor clearly states what you need to know, and gives you the resources necessary to study it.",
    "Yes take it. The way the class is structured forces you to be on top of your stuff all throughout the semester, which makes for a relatively stress-free end of the year (as long as she keeps the weekly writing assignments). Subject matter is fairly interesting.",
    "Easy A but the class itself is dreadfully boring (even if politics and religion generally interests you). The lectures are extremely repetitive and I easily got an A even after not going to class for the second half of the semester.",
    "take it",
    "Yes, if you need a gut social science credit (as I did) or you are a varsity player without any time to spend on fulfilling your major requirements and actually for your poli sci classes.",
    "I would recommend it. I didn't love it but it was an easy class with a light workload. Attending lectures wasn't absolutely necessary but definitely helpful.",
    "Gutty gut gut gut. Really easy to do well in, if you look over the lecture handouts before each in-class writing assignment. Concepts are pretty simple, and Professor Kahl explains each one a LOT. GEM GEM GEM. I would only not recommend it if you are genuinely interested in religion and politics and you want to learn more about Islam in relation to politics, because there are much better courses in RLST, MMES and probably better PLSC courses to take for that. BUT this is still worth it as a supplementary class.",
    "Very relaxed, low-pressure class on how religion can play into politics. Very good initial overview of Christianity and its history (I learned a lot about how the Christian church underwent changes to become all the different denominations we see nowadays).Coverage of Islam was good (could be a little disjointed at times), but infusion into the discussion on Christianity and secularization was very good. Professor was very nice and likeable. Was a little unclear sometimes in that she would be talking about certain points and then get lost in her thoughts and jump around to previous topics and it would end up very disjointed and confusing. Otherwise when she covered the points on her slides and went through in an orderly manner, class went very smoothly. It was a little sad how around half of the class (mostly jocks) showed up for the writing assignments and then just left the auditorium immediately afterwards. Final was very fair and straightforward. Show up, take notes, study your notes, and you'll definitely do very very well.",
    "It's a fairly easy class with a minimal workload. Good fifth class for sure.",
    "Topics get much more interesting towards the end and the professor is very nice and approachable. Weekly writing assignments which seemed to vary completely depending on which TA graded them, and a final for 40%. We would write the assignments and then hope for the best. Most times we would get some very arbitrary comment and an A-. The final was okay- confusing since questions were poorly worded but I'm hoping the grades will end up being good, but who really knows. The format of the class is very nicely spaced with the assignments each Monday. This class is perfect for if you want to put in no effort and coast by with a b+ or a-, but if you want an A you need to work a bit, which is fine. That said, the professor said she would give up to 3 extra points of extra credit for active participation throughout lectures (and .5 for registering a clicker), so we will see if those points are real shortly. If it is true, and I have every reason to believe it is, then it should be fully within your power to do well.",
    "The class is interesting, and does give some interesting insights into how religion and politics relate. The work is certainly light, and the suggested readings and such a very interesting to consider. On the whole though, I wouldn't say it broadens your world view but very much is a clarification of what seems obvious in the relations between religion and politics.",
    "I only took this course because I had a whim to double major in Political Science and Sociology the day before shopping period, but that quickly passed over. Not necessarily because of this course, but more so to point out that there's not much reason to take this course unless you need a fairly easy credit or are genuinely interested in the material. The class is average, somewhat disorganized, the in-class writing assignments get pretty annoying (though it seemed like the TAs got tired of it too at the end, since I got As on my last 6 assignments). Also, because of the disruptions and random cancellations this semester, we literally covered only half the original syllabus, so I bought three books for no reason whatsoever.",
    "It is an easy grade if you attend lecture and do the readings. The weekly writing assignments are graded nicely and the final wasn't a curve ball. A good 5th class or credit d choice",
    "Very interesting class, and tremendously pertinent today. Weekly assignments were not overbearing and actually helped stud dents stay on top of material throughout the semester. Not too difficult and not too much work, yet very fulfilling.",
    "Hard to do poorly in this class because of the weekly writings",
    "really easy going class. i would recommend it if you're intrested in the material and you want a chill 5th class.",
    "Yes, necessary information to uncover the roots of a lot of politics today",
    "Professor Kahl is adorable and a good lecturer, but was often unable to finish all the material proposed for that day, leading to confusion over what readings were supposed to be done, etc. Pretty simple and straightforward material, though, and the assignments (8 in-class writing quizzes and a final) were not difficult whatsoever.",
    "Yes I would. Great class with manageable workload.",
    "Probably not. It's pretty easy but didn't really learn that much.",
    "I would not take this class again. Despite being very little work, I felt myYale education withering away while I sat in lecture.",
    "I would not recommend this class. Avoid it unless you need a comparative pol.sci credit or something. If you do take it, at least bring a friend. That is the only reason I got through this class. The subject matter is pretty interesting (you learn a lot about Islam, including differences in political theology of Shiites and Sunnis, and a lot about different sect of Christianity - Lutheranism, Calvinism, and Catholicism), as are the readings, and the work load is not too intense (in-class short essay every week and a final), but the lectures are so disorganized, and the reading schedule constantly changes as the professor is incapable of teaching the quantity of material assigned for the week. About 20 people left the class every day after the in-class writings. The Professor seems nice, but you will find yourself bored in class and the questions she writes almost incoherent.",
    "Great class. Interesting material.",
    "Good introduction to the study of Religion and Politics. The course is designed for you to succeed and if you are interested in the material it won't be very difficult. Would definitely recommend to anyone interested.",
    "Slow paced course and easy to keep up with thanks to the weekly in class writing quizzes. I recommend attending lectures and taking notes. Readings are not awfully important.",
    "Great"
