    "Highly recommend for both the professor and the subject material!",
    "A seminar on Romantic Poetry with a special focus on Wordsworth (a focus that was just fine with me). Manageable reading, interesting conversations (most of which Brisman dominated, at least for the first half of the class, which I also preferred), and three fun essays with prompts of your choosing. I loved this class, the readings, the professor, etc. Sure, some classes left me somewhat baffled, but Brisman has this wonderful way of making the most subtle distinctions both clear, interesting, and important. He pushes us to think and question.",
    "I enjoyed the poetry studied immensely and the class discussions were always fascinating and wonderful. The ideas we talked about in the poetry were always a joy to consider and contemplate. This course challenged me to read much more deeply and critically and to be much more sensitive to poetry. Professor Brisman's high standards and deep knowledge can be intimidating, but his kindness is encouraging. I enjoy listening to his introductions to the texts in discussion. His questions were always challenging and thought provoking, and they helped me to read poetry in new and wonderful ways. This class is difficult, the poetry is difficult, and Professor Brisman is very exacting, but it is a class that is wholly intellectually rewarding and fulfilling, especially if you love romantic poetry."
