    "I think that the professors should have more individual meetings with teams, rather than the workshops (groups of teams). Clinic projects are so diverse, and while there are many common issues faces between them, the workshops didn't provide much value. Individual team meetings would allow teams to talk through the technical aspects of each project, and more specifically discuss the memo's, which were useful, but felt unacknowledged.",
    "Project opportunities were incredibly valuable for hands-on experience and networking. Probably one of the best projects I've been involved with in my three semesters at FES--meaningful and effective. Weekly class was not helpful to me; topics were broad-ranging and disconnected. I would have loved to have had class time be dedicated to project group meetings."

   "comments": [
    "Even though the lectures were useful, it would be great to have further discussions on specific issues that come up regarding our cases, such as the smaller discussions we had within a few groups.",
    "The lecture component to this course was, for the most part, helpful, though I don't think every lecture should be mandatory for people taking the course for the first time (there should be some kind of exemption for people who don't need an \"environmental law and policy 101\", for example. I also did not get much out of the workshops (which were new this year) and think the class would benefit from scrapping those in favor of more single-group meetings (or if relevant, meetings amongst groups experiencing similar issues or challenges int heir projects). Finally, I think the project bidding should happen before the beginning of the semester (don't think it's too much to ask that students interested in taking the course bid early) so that people can get an even more immediate start on their project as soon as classes begin.",
    "I didn't like the fact there many students were often not in class. I also felt as if some of the lectures and discussions we had were not well organized.",
    "Workshops\/team-professor relationship and meetings. Also, the rushed project assignments at the beginning of the semester did not allow for the best team formations. I think students should be able to have some say as to who their teammates are-- I had recruited someone to be on my team, but because of the short timeline for assignments, he was not accepted into the clinic, which was disappointing.",
    "I did not find the structure of the workshops very helpful for our client project. I would suggest re-working those to make it more generative for students.",
    "Class time. I took the course to work on the project. I wanted to spend that time working on the project. The overview of environmental law principles was on-and-off engaging, and overall not helpful to the project or to my interests. Each session was very well taught, and the professors are absolutely experts in their fields, but it was not information that I was seeking.",
    "The lecture component of this course seemed scattered (many different topics, lecturers, etc. with no overarching theme or goals), and the workshops ended up being fairly useless. Although the project itself was great and our group got a lot out of it, we always dreaded going to class. (Although Abbie Dillen was amazing.)"

Some of the lectures were just scratching the surface of other classes of mine, so were not a good use of my time. Perhaps you could have applications to opt-out of specific lectures if the topic is duplicative of other coursework.",
