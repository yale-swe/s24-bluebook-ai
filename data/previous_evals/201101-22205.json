   "comments": [
    "Yeah, I probably would. It's difficult and time consuming, but it actually is comprehensible and at the very least, you learn how differential equations are used in scientific applications.",
    "Fairly unorganized but interesting course. The beginning is fairly difficult but once you have your bearings it becomes more and more enjoyable. Loewenberg is brilliant and often skips steps on the board so asking questions is encouraged. The TA sessions are necessary for completion of the problem sets but also very useful for test preparation because the tests often mimic the problem sets. Overall good course, but don't buy the textbook. Wasn't used at all.",
    "Most students are taking this because they need to for their major. Professor Loewenberg is a poor lecturer, but he is very willing to meet with students one-on-one. And he is very helpful outside of class, so take advantage of that.",
    "Sure. It's probably required for you, right?",
    "1. Don't take it with Prof Loewenberg if you have a choice.2. If you do end up taking it with him, be prepared to ask the same question a few more times without feeling stupid because what will happen is that he'll start doing a problem on the board without giving you any hint as to what he's doing, you'll raise your hand and ask \"so, what are we doing right now?\" and he'll give you the most cryptic response which will leave you feeling stupid without shedding any light into what's going on and then you'll be scared\/embarrassed to ask again and you'll just zone out and say I'll just figure it out on my own later.3. Don't buy the book because it'll be a complete waste of money since you use it maybe once throughout the semester.",
    "I'm not sure how it's taught in other years, but with Loewenberg, the main focus is learning the mathematical (and I guess conceptual) technique of solving transport problems, rather than understanding the theory behind it. I think this is a very worthwhile course, but is probably now what you think the course is about.",
    "Chances are youre a chemE or envE and have to take this class. My advice: plan to attend every TA\/help session that is offered for this class, also make some good friends with your classmates. If you are into textbooks, try to get a copy of Deen. Loewenbergs lectures follow this book more closely than BSL",
    "I would say that it is a great class with a cool professor. Its hard though, and you will be putting in a lot of work. You will learn the power of non-dimensionalization and approximation and various ways of analyzing transport processes.",
    "Althoughg this course maybe difficult, please do not let that stop you from taking it. The type of material that you will learn is definitely relevant and the professor is amazing. Before this course I was still trying to consider if this major was for me, and Prof. loewenberg's course really helped to show me that this is something that I wanted to do. If you need any additional help with your assignments or just have questions about life, the prof is there. When taking this course, DO NOT BE AFRAID TO ASK QUESTIONS! And stay on top of assignments, so that you have questions for class. This course is as great as you make it.",
    "Do not recommend, unless you have to take the class.",
    "Mass, energy and momentum transport modeled with differential equations and fluid mechanics concepts. Only take this if you have to!!",
    "A very hard class, but you will gain a good understanding of the concepts and the math. See Prof. Loewenberg if you have any questions; he is very helpful. Also, TA sessions are a must if you want to do well on the homeworks."
