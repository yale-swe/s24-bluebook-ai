   "comments": [
    "This course gave me critical insight into the way in which museology both engages with and inhibits religion. I was particularly interested in the way that this course dealt with religion in art museums, and the course gave me the language to evaluate and analyze the manner in which museums display (or do not display) religion.",
    "This course helped me think much more critically about my overall approach to museum curation and how to engage with religion in public spaces.",
    "I learned how to think critically about museum spaces, to interrogate their functions, the stories they tell, the motives curators bring to exhibits.",
    "In this course, I became more sensitive and informed of the ways in which religion is displayed in museums. Through the careful curation of assigned readings, thoughtful presentations, and distinguished guest speakers the class served as an engaging way to make sense of the display of religious art and material culture. I am personally still learning to find my own voice in the classroom, but always felt welcome and encouraged by Professor Promey to engage with the class discussions and materials.",

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Centered on a series of case studies, this course excelled in providing specific, real-life examples at the intersection of religion and museum. I was also impressed by the breadth of theoretical material that we covered in class, which built a foundation on which we could base our own seminar papers. I do wish that we spent more time with the material on the syllabus, and less time on student presentations. Although I learned a lot from my peers and their individual projects, I felt that we rushed through some of the material; generally speaking, classroom discussion were excellent, and I would have liked to have more time in class in this capacity.",
    "I thought that one of the strengths of this course was the way its seminar style format allowed for visiting guests and student presentations. I do think that time could be managed a little better so that those who prepared to present could have had a fixed amount of time, but this didn't really seem to be much of an issue.",
    "I think it could be improved by making it more widely known to doctoral students. I also think that too many classes were devoted to student presentations. While I find it valuable to present my own work and hear colleagues' work, we ended up devoting several weeks to presentations, when I think they could have been pared down to have one or two more classes of reading.",
    "strengths- the practical curatorial side was interesting weaknesses- class spent considerable time on some subjects than others"

   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. It requires engagement on a multidisciplinary level, and I think that the makeup of our class in particular demonstrated the ways in which this course could fit a variety of interests and needs. Professor Promey is also extremely adept at constructing syllabi, and the materials she assigned were highly topical and dealt with contemporary issues.",
    "I absolutely would. I think that it is especially applicable for art history students or divinity students with an art history concentration that are interested in learning more about how religion functions in exhibition spaces.",
    "Yes, I would. Dr. Promey's syllabus was great. It pulled together many different scholars who work on disparate areas which forced engagement with material I was unfamiliar. That was wonderful.",
    "Absolutely! Professor Promey clearly has a wealth of insight and knowledge in her field. She takes time outside the classroom to further mentor, assist, and to provide clear feedback to her students. The class discussions were incredibly lively and Professor Promey always had a thoughtful and insightful way to steer the discussion. While I was already incredibly interested in the subject matter, Professor Promey made the classroom come alive\/even more interesting with her clear love and passion for the subject matter. It was my favorite course of the semester!",
    "yes if the student is interested in decolonizing museums"
