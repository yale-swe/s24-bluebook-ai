    "No - there is not a supporting environment.",
    "I would definitely recommend the yearlong essay over the semester process simply because the finished product is a singular achievement in my academic career. The extra time allowed me to plan out my research and writing in such a way that it made the project a lot less daunting and stressful than I initially assumed it would be, and my final product was something I could be proud about having accomplished in a way that a forty page paper wouldn't have been.",
    "I would recommend the yearlong experience if you're looking for a rigorous academic opportunity to produce original work. Don't be deterred by the 80-100 page requirement; it's manageable if you do good research and preparation in the first semester. Definitely consider giving it a shot!",
    "The year long essay is a great way to delve into a larger topic. It is important, however, to make sure that you are committed to your topic and have a professor that you want to work with. It is a better pace than the semester essay.",
    "Great experience. Absolutely worth doing the yearlong senior essay (though the 80-100 page requirement is crazy long.) Highly, highly recommend it. This is the best capstone to your undergraduate education",
    "It's a bitch but glad I did it. Easy to say once its over, though.",
    "Doing a year-long senior essay was an enormously rewarding process. I was grateful for how much free time I had in my schedule, and it was a terrific opportunity to dive deeply into a project I was excited about. It was also great to produce a paper that I was actually proud of, instead of the usual last-minute rushed work. Especially if you have a topic in mind that you are excited to spend a whole year working on, the year-long senior essay is worth considering seriously."
