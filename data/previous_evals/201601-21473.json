   "comments": [
    "I would recommend, it was a good exercise in learning how to apply macroeconomic policy lessons.",
    "Phenomenal class. Take it if you can get it! (fight for it!!)",
    "This course is broad reaching and while it related directly to Japan, there is a great insight offered about the entire global economy. Expect to participate and also to learn quite a bit.",
    "I would recommend this course for anyone seeking to learn more about Japan's economic situation, but more importantly, a course that delves into macro challenges with rigor and detail. It is definitely not an easy course, but you come away much more informed and a more astute economic observer.",
    "Great class for improving your knowledge on macro. Class could sometimes feel like a slog, but I definitely left that class knowing much more about Japan and macroeconomic policy than I did coming into it. Student presentations take half of each class, so there will be a lot of variation, depending on the quality of the other people taking the class. Overall, I felt that I learned a lot, but I can't say that I thoroughly enjoyed going to class. Prof. Roach really knows his stuff though, and he's always happy to put time into his students",
    "If you find what you read about macroeconomics in the newspaper interesting, take this course! Everyone! If not maybe taking this course will make you interested.",
    "The course is exactly what the name conveys - take it if you have even the slightest interest in applying forensic macro to the case of Japan. The workload may appear daunting at first, but don't let it deter you from taking a great seminar.",
    "DEFINITELY RECOMMEND THiS CLASS! BEST ECON CLASS I HAVE TAKEN AT YALE. You will learn a lot in this class and be able to have an intelligent opinion about economic policy making around the world. Learning about these things against the template of the Japanese experience makes it even more fascinating!",
    "Highly recommend. Get in and get prepared to get mind-blown",
    "I would highly recommend this course! - A fair amount of reading, but all of it quite interesting - Engaging seminar format: 1\/3 lecture, 1\/3 discussion, 1\/3 class presentation - Final essay: I found this to be a really rewarding essay to write, and Professor Roach provides great feedback along the way. Take this seminar!",
    "I'd recommend it. Professor Roach is great (smart and caring) and the topic is interesting.",
    "Econ 474 is a phenomenal course that helps one gain a solid understanding of the roots of the Japanese economic malaise and its present development, as well as in relation to other major economies. This has definitely been the best economics course I've taken at Yale, and possible of all courses I've taken. The coursework is demanding but very rewarding. Definitely take this course with Professor Roach, who is an expert in this field as well as in China, which plays an important role in learning about the economic policy lessons learned from Japan.",
    "An astounding course and one of the best (or THE best) Econ senior seminars around. Professor Roach is dedicated, highly experienced and very knowledgeable in this field. You wont have to understand many technical or mathematical papers, but you will walk away with a good grasp of Japans economy and policies and how they relate to China, Europe and the US. The workload is manageable and grading is fair. The class size is around 20 but many students will be shopping it so be sure to register for it in advance. Highly, highly recommended.",
    "Overall, would highly recommend this course to other students particularly Econ majors. This is one of the best courses I've taken in the Department top 2-3 for sure. This is a can't miss if you're heavily interested in macro and want to learn crucial topics in a small seminar setting with a professor that guides you through the issues in a compelling way.",
    "This is a very interesting class. I would recommend it if you are interested in East Asia or economic questions."
