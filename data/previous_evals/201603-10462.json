    "Problem taking skills",
    "I have a very good theoretical basis of thermodynamics. Heavy quantitative analysis skills.",

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "This is the first time Prof. Hu is teaching the course. Obviously there were some bumps along the way, but judging off of the past experiences of my friends with this class, I think that I really lucked out by having a manageable thermo class with an enthusiastic, caring professor.",
    "The main weakness of this class is the lack of structure, which is a result of the poor choice in textbook. I understand the appeal of Callen, as it's very informative and has all the theory necessary to understand thermodynamics, but it's simply too high of a level for this class. There's too much difficult to follow math, insanely challenging examples, and confusing wording.",
    "Very theoretical. Could be better with more applied examples",
    "The course this year was hard, but manageable, especially in the latter part of the semester. I wish that the course had included more examples of what we were doing in class, as this would have been very helpful on the tests and problem sets.",
    "Thermodynamics in itself is a very abstract concept and may be hard to grasp. To make it simpler, Hu had lots of reviews time and again which made it easier to understand what was going on.",
    "This was a very good course. We learned A LOT of info in a very good manner. Lectures are very important. A weakness is that it was a bit less textbook than other standardized classes. I thought t was excellently delivered.",
    "Strengths of the course included the lectures, discussion sections, and the homework assignments. Professor Hu always took the time to answer questions and make sure that students could understand the concepts being explained, and the course material was presented in a structured manner. Sections and individual meetings with the TA or professor were very helpful for understanding both conceptual and quantitative problems. Although some of the first homework assignments were quite difficult, most homework assignments were an accurate reflection of what the most important concepts in the course were. Two valuable improvements to the course would be for additional suggested practice problems to be posted in addition to the regular homework and for there to be greater clarification with regards to what readings in the textbook are helpful for the material. Homework problems did provide good practice in preparation for examinations, but looking for practice beyond them was not always straightforward. Before investing energy into completing difficult practice problems from the textbook, it would have been nice to have some additional suggested problems to guide studying, since problem sets cannot have too many problems on them. In terms of readings, there were two textbooks used this semester: Callen and Van Ness. The first half of the course focused more on Callen and later on we switched to Van Ness. Although I did deepen my conceptual understandings of the topics from reading Callen, reading Callen was not that helpful for actually solving problems. Van Ness is a much more approachable textbook, and it has very nicely laid out examples. But Van Ness is also much bigger, and for sets of chapters on similar topics, it was sometimes hard to focus on what was needed. Posted readings, with page numbers or chapters, that are meant to supplement lectures would be helpful. Thankfully, lectures and lecture notes were robust enough that reading the textbook was not absolutely necessary to learn the material."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "No. Please don't take it unless you have to. I hope someone else is teaching it when you take it.",
    "I think this class will get better as time goes on, and Professor Hu certainly wants to do a good job in teaching the class. I would recommend it maybe five years from now.",
    "You probably wont take this unless you have to. Professor Hu is new and has improved a lot since the beginning of the semester (fall 2016). I trust that he will be even better in courses to come. He is very understanding and clearly cares a lot about teaching thermo. It's challenging material but he tries his best",
    "I would not take this course if it was not a requirement as it is a very theory-heavy and hard course, but this semester it was manageable for the students who took it (only chemical and environmental engineering majors).",
    "Yes. Hu is great",
    "Yes. You take this because you have to, but it was one of my favorite classes at Yale. Shu is absolutely fantastic and funny. He is also very open to feedback and will shift the class if needed to help us learn. The class is extremely front heavy and will start very hard. It is much easier after midterm. I definitely recommend this class with Shu. It's worth taking a class with him.",
    "Yes -- take this course with Professor Hu. He is an AMAZING teacher -- we learned so much.",
    "This was a great class with professor Hu. He was very flexible and accommodating in teaching core chemical engineering skills. I would recommend this class to the environmental engineers and chemical engineers.",
    "I woudldn't recommend that you take it if you don't need it, just because it is a difficult subject and the professor makes a huge difference on how the class goes. Thermodynamics is a fundamental course for understanding chemical and mechanical systems, so if you do end up taking it, most likely for your major, at least know that you are learning information that will help you if you decide to go into industry. I don't think Professor Hu is teaching it again the near future, but if he is, take it with him."
