   "comments": [
    "Its my first sociology class and I think I would have liked something that was more relevant and dealt with current issues. If you like theory, then this class definitely sets a good foundation.",
    "I absolutely loved this class. Professor Erikson makes what can often be very abstract, complicated social theory accessible to students, and she is an engaging and dynamic lecturer. Her lectures are logical and easy to understand. The class covers major theorists: think Durkheim, Weber, Marx, with some Kant, Simmel, DuBois, etc., and involves minimal work. Just do the readings, come to lecture, and you're golden.That being said, I took this class as a requirement for the sociology major, but ended up loving it. I do, however, know people who found this class to be too difficult or too boring, but personally, I thought it was great. The material is stuff you should know, and taking what is essentially a philosophy class under the sociology department makes for way easier paper-writing.",
    "YES - if you know you like reading philosophical thinkers etc and analyzing them. If you don't... don't take this class.",
    "This class is such a great experience. There are a lot of readings but in the end it is all manageable. The topics are some that are applicable to everyday life which is why it is so interesting.",
    "Yes, I would recommend it, just because it is interesting, not if you want an easy grade though.",
    "Yes; readings are those things one must really get out of their education at one point or the other. What better place to do it at Yale. Found them intellectually stimulating (not just interesting for class).",
    "An overview course to social theory. Deals with texts that all Yale students should read, I would take the course or something similar.",
    "A course on a great list of writers that you should read no matter what your major is - Hobbes, Aristotle, Marx, etc. The work is not overwhelming but you learn a lot, and the section can actually be really helpful. It's a perfect So credit for the perplexed. It's broad and introductory, so the discussion can't be too deep, but I feel like a more responsible person for being able to contextualize what I think about society and politics.",
    "take it. useful and necessary stuff.",
    "Take it if you're interested in the development of sociology. The class is very theoretical.",
    "It was an interesting and well-taught course. Professor Erikson was an enthusiastic teacher whose passion for her subject and students was clearly conveyed in her lectures.",
    "It was an okay course. Take it if you're interested in Sociology.",
    "This class is all about the scholars you cover: Marx, Weber, Durkheim, Simmel, and Du Bois. If you are interested in learning about their contributions to modern social science \u0097 teaser: they contributed a lot to modern social science \u0097 then this class will be a lot of fun (and Prof. Erikson turned out to be a good lecturer). It's also not too tough to do well although you have to wrap your brain around some (at times) dense material.Overall, I would recommend the course as a third or fourth class, not as one of your top-of-the-roster exciting choices. Considering I took it as a SOCY requirement, I was pleasantly surprised and definitely enjoyed the class.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student if you are interested in theory (not even just social theory).",
    "I enjoyed this class far more than I thought I was going to enjoy it. The material was taught in such a straight-forward, interesting way that I really felt like I understood everything. Professor Erikson was great. Though this might change, the class consists of four reading quizzes (each worth 15% of your grade), section and lecture participation, and a final paper. You have plenty of time to write the paper, and your TFs are willing to give assistance when needed. Students are encouraged to talk and ask questions in lecture. The quizzes are not difficult if you understand each theorist and they are spread out across the course of the semester.",
    "I would highly recommend this class to several groups of students: those interested in sociology, those interested in the more philosophical\/theoretical side of political science, and humanities students (like philosophy or humanities majors) looking for an interesting and relevant So credit. I fall into the last group. I was shopping the class for a So credit and had to take it; Professor Erikson's lectures are fascinating. If you find the early classes on Aristotle, Galileo and Hobbes interesting, take the class. It stays just as interesting all the way through.",
    "yes! not too much work, focus on the final paper",
    "Definitely take this with Emily Erikson. Fundamental readings, and amazing discussions on them.",
    "This class gives a good overview of the main theorists in sociology, which was tied to some of the bigger philosophical trends in history. Lectures usually built off the readings and sections helped clarify and review the material. As a required course for sociology majors, it's pretty interesting reading and explains how the modern field of sociology has developed. The quizzes are not bad at all if you do the reading.",
    "Awesome class! Emily Erikson is lovely and accessible, and you may find yourself discovering how applicable these seemingly-distant texts (Marx, Weber, Durkheim, Simmel) are to modern life and society.",
    "I began this course slightly annoyed the fact that it was required for the sociology major and expecting to be irritated by its focus on the works of \"dead white men\" including Aristotle and the like. Yet I was very pleasantly surprised by how much I wound up enjoying it. The readings were well-designed and lectures were well-taught in a way that I'd actually call creative and stimulating. Yes, we read theory by the \"usual suspects\" of Marx, Weber, and Durkheim and mostly by those male, white, and long gone, but Dr. Erikson made many efforts to enliven the course. The readings by included some interesting metaphysics in each unit, and even included some diversity by adding in WEB Dubois. Additionally, Dr. Erikson taught lectures well, first by actually talking to us, not \"at\" us, and secondly by explaining things clearly with creative\/funny analogies.I was also lucky to have a helpful TA.Granted, I'd recommend taking this course only if you are actually interested in social theory, philosophy, or sociology because if not, you will not enjoy the readings no matter what. However, if you have any interest in these subjects, this course is certainly well-taught and worthwhile.",
    "It seems like a good overview of the various social theories; the professor is very conscious of trying to connect the theories to practical problems. Good class!",
    "I'd recommend this class for students who are interested in the philosophical foundations of social theory. Reading is light, and the quizzes were easy, even if you hadn't done all the reading. That being said, you'll get a lot more out of the class if you actually want to do the reading. Professor Erikson became a more confident lecturer as the term went on. For me, the best part of the class was section -- if Elizabeth Breese is still a TA, try to get in her section, she's fantastic.",
    "If you are interested in the subject matter and want to read the texts on the syllabus, definitely take this course!",
    "A good course in sociological thought. Not too difficult if you keep up\/understand the reading.",
    "Yes, I would recommend it, though I hope it evolves to become a more challenging course.",
    "Good course. Insightful teaching of social theory..",
    "A requirement for sociology majors but certainly not a tortuous one. Erikson's quizzes were easy, and took a lot of stress off of our shoulders because of the waythey're formatted. She's totally open for feedback as well, which is great. The final paper requires a rough draft, where your TA points you towards the right direction. It's very difficult not to do well in this class, even if theory is very difficult for you to understand. For those who are good at BSing, and can understand the various theorists easily, this class should be a breeze."
