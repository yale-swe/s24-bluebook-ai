    "Provides a great overview of cardiovascular disease.",
    "It was a great class for an overview of cardiovascular issues in public health. I enjoyed the guest lecturers, although each class was so different that it lacked a bit of continuity.",
    "This course provided a very solid overview of the different types of cardiovascular disease and their risk factors. I also appreciated the structure of the assignments.I wish that Professor Lichtman had gotten the opportunity to lecture more often because she has such extensive research experience in the field.",
    "Good class to learn more about CVD epi.",
    "The course is a great introduction to a focused topic area in public health. The lectures are interesting, enjoyable, and worthwhile.",
    "I enjoyed the range and diversity of speakers and class topics. The assignments were unique and thought-provoking, and not at all mundane. The speakers were engaging and encouraging of questions and comments. There was no final exam, and all of the assignments were short (~3 pages each). It's a very manageable class. There's nothing I would really change about it.",
    "One of my favorite classes at YSPH.",
    "This course provided a great overview of issues surrounding the epidemiology of cardiovascular disease. The set-up of the course with visiting speakers from their respective areas of expertise made for a very interesting environment to learn about cardiovascular disease.",
    "Strengths: engages the students, makes them think and not just accept information passivelyWeaknesses: There were a few days in which we got out early and could have covered more material",
    "I enjoyed the opportunity to learn about different areas and causes of cardiovascular disease. It was a very good introduction to the different types of diseases and the significant risk factors for developing disease. Having guest lecturers was helpful in the learning process as they all provided excellent information about the sub-fields associated with cardiovascular disease.",
    "Strengths are that the course gives a very practical approach to research and its implications with respect to heart disease and its implications on policy. Weaknesses are is that sometimes it is inclined towards the instructors research interests more and focus on other topics is slightly less",
    "- Dr. Lichtman is a very engaging lecturer. She is always enthusiastic and makes sure that the reading assignments pertain to the lecture\/discussion. She is very considerate and she prints out the lecture slides for every class, which is immensely appreciated.- All of the guest lecturers were very interesting and thought-provoking.- The assignments are very applicable and are great exercises that could be useful for one's future research\/job."

    "Instructor: Judith Hilevi Lichtman \u00a0Judy is really great. I wish she would have led more of the classes as opposed to guest speakers.",
    "Instructor: Judith Hilevi Lichtman \u00a0I enjoyed Professor Lichtman's interaction with the class. She engaged us during lecture regarding the readings. Her enthusiasm for her work in stroke and CVD shines through daily.",
    "Instructor: Judith Hilevi Lichtman \u00a0Professor Lichtman is an excellent teacher and provided helpful feedback on all of our assignments.",
    "Instructor: Judith Hilevi Lichtman \u00a0Dr. Lichtman is extremely knowledgable in this subject matter and has a lot of practical knowledge to share. She is engaging and passionate about CVD epi. Feedback on assignments was an issue as assignments were not returned in a timely manner.",
    "Instructor: Judith Hilevi Lichtman \u00a0The instructor was great at challenging us to think critically. She gave us helpful comments on our assignments and was very knowledgeable about the course material.",
    "Instructor: Judith Hilevi Lichtman \u00a0Dr. Lichtman was a good professor, although she only lectured a couple times and the rest of the times, we had guest lecturers (which I liked). Her assignments were unique and required thought and creativity -- which is not true for the assignments in some other courses. Being able to research and review the literature is key. At the beginning of the semester, Dr. Lichtman was very good about getting assignments back quickly. Towards the second half of the semester, that was no longer true. I understand that she was busy with her own research and what not, but it would have been helpful to have received feedback on our assignments before we had to submit the next one (so that we can take her comments into consideration).",
    "Instructor: Judith Hilevi Lichtman \u00a0Knowledgeable expert in Epi Heart Disease& Stroke. Attentive to students' needs and asks stimulating questions.",
    "Instructor: Judith Hilevi Lichtman \u00a0Judy did a great job of highlighting the current issues in cardiovascular disease and where we should focus our future research. I really appreciated her focus on developing our critical reading skills by asking us to apply what we were learning to what we were reading.",
    "Instructor: Judith Hilevi Lichtman \u00a0Strengths: very interested in helping students succeed, makes students think critically, sensitive to students' schedules and time pressuresWeaknesses: doesn't always grade papers so quickly",
    "Instructor: Judith Hilevi Lichtman \u00a0Dr. Lichtman was very knowledgeable about different types of cardiovascular disease and causes, particularly involving stroke. Feedback she provided was helpful, and she was very willing to communicate outside of the classroom. She always asked thought provoking questions, which was greatly appreciated. The only criticism I have is that it sometimes took a long time for our assignments to be returned, with the final two assignments not being returned by the time the class ended.",
    "Instructor: Judith Hilevi Lichtman \u00a0She is awesome and has great insight about how epidemiology influences policies and guidelines.",
    "Instructor: Judith Hilevi Lichtman \u00a0Please see above"

   "comments": [
    "This class is an overview of the most pertinent topics in cardiovascular disease epidemiology. It is taught by a series of experts in their respective fields. The assignments are interesting and test pertinent skills.",
    "I highly recommend this course to other CDE students. Heart disease and stroke are substantial contributors to mortality in our society, and all epidemiologists should have a decent understanding of them.",
    "Good class to learn more about epi methods and specifically CVD epi.",
    "I would recommend this course because the content is very interesting and the work load is also manageable.",
    "It's a seminar-type course with different guest speakers discussing topics related to CVD. However, the course is not entirely focused on the specifics on CVD; instead it explores a number of different risk factors including diabetes, sleep apnea, and nutrition and also looks at things like interventions and risk scores. Therefore, don't expect a class which describes the ins and outs of everything heart disease. You will acquire knowledge on a number of different topics.",
    "Best class at YSPH. Take the class.",
    "Good overview of epidemiology of heart disease and stroke. Looks at risk factors for heart disease and stroke and how we measure them.Yes.",
    "The course was a great introduction to the epidemiology of cardiovascular diseases, and comes highly recommended.",
    "Good elective for CDE. I would recommend it to have a different perspective and have a course with some less work.",
    "This has been one of my favorite classes at YSPH. I highly suggest shopping forthis class."
