    "EENG 325 is a class about diodes, transistors and amplifiers. It provides a nice overview of what each does and how they work.",
    "A stellar course. Perhaps one of my favorite engineering courses here at Yale, I greatly enjoyed the course material, the course's teaching staff, and the organization of the course material. Professor Xia is an gem (and the reason you should take the course) - he is kind and generous, and is often willing to go out of his way to help students (he often will recall his memories of being a college student). He is also wonderful at teaching! Should you not be able to learn from Prof. Xia (which I would find shocking), the textbook is absolutely amazing - the best I have seen from any course of any subject. The biggest drawback to the course it the lab. There is a weekly lab for a few hours to implement some of the concepts that you learn during the semester. I would have preferred longer\/additional problem sets to the laboratory time (as I did not find them particularly informative or fun).",
    "Classic Xia course. Its very good overall, You learn about more circuits. Labs are fine. Workload is not bad. Midterm and Final are fine. Prof Xia is not the most inspiring lecturer but he is effective, approachable, and willing to help. Be aware the the second half of the course is much much harder than the first. Overall, I would recommend this class.",
    "Introduction to transistor amplifiers from the very fundamentals. Lectures are fast, but the homeworks and labs are generally easy until the end. would recommend.",
    "This class picks up in difficulty towards the end. You'll come out of it with a great understanding of transistors and multi-transistor circuits. Pay attention in lecture and do a lot of studying on your own.",
    "This class is a great course that encompasses material all the way from the device level to multistage amplifier circuits in a well-structure manner. I'd recommend this class to electrical engineers as well as other STEM students interested in gaining a deeper understanding of electronic circuits."
