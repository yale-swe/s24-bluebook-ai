    "TAKE IT, NOW",
    "The class is focused around 4-5 major units with 4 major papers. I would highly recommend this course to any student wishing to improve their writing drastically.",
    "The course is recommended for students who needa solid introduction to college-style academic writing. It prepares you for the bulk of writing (especially in the humanities) for the next few years.",
    "English 114 02 was primarily a writing course themed with revolutions. I would certainly recommend this class to another student who is looking to improve his\/her writing and critical reading skills.",
    "Yes, I recommend this class if you feel like you need to get a better feel for writing standard college-level essays. Jordan is super cool and I think the class is helpful in easing you into the art of writing college papers.That said, class was a little unstructured, which didn't bother me but it may bother some. Also, little time was devoted in class to honing writing skills- you do some writing exercises, but most class time was devoted to open-ended discussion of various readings. Although I enjoyed the class and the discussion, the readings often seemed fairly random and disconnected from one another.",
    "Revolutions is a class that will challenge and broaden your personal definition of \"What is a revolution?\" I totally recommend this class to all students. Argumentative writing is different from literary analyses or personal essays. This class will teach you how to form a solid literary argument."
