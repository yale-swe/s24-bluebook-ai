    "I improved my knowledge of high level vocabulary and sentence structures, became more comfortable with listening and speaking.",
    "I greatly improved my oral and audio skills and developed my writing skills and reading comprehension in Mandarin. I also learned the Chinese format of writing essays and got used to reading without Pinyin.",
    "This course definitely improved my Chinese speaking and writing. We had dictation everyday, so although the workload for this class was a lot, my chinese skills did benefit greatly as a result."

   "comments": [
    "The workload was excessive. Talking with students who took CHNS 130 in previous semesters, it seems that we had much more work than they did. Even for a language class, even for a Yale Chinese language class, it was just too much work. Check the syllabus to see if the workload was reduced before deciding to take this course. I mainly refer to the almost weekly presentations of our revised essays. We had to make powerpoints for these presentations along with a multiple-choice quiz (in English) at the end. These were very time-consuming to prepare for and make, and I did not find them very helpful to my Chinese. Ultimately, these presentations took away time I could have devoted to directly studying and practicing the actual material. Without the presentations, this would have been a very balanced course.",
    "I really struggled with the online listening and reading quizzes because the questions were incredibly subjective. Even if I understood every word in the reading or listening, the questions never seemed like they could actually be answered by the text -- like the true or false questions could always be either depending on how you interpreted the question.",
    "The course doesn't leave much to be desired. The schedule was very structured, which was useful, but we still had to study on our own, creating a nice balance of guidance and independence. When we present our essays, however, it would be nice if we present them before we move onto the next lesson.",
    "The teachers were really dedicated and amazing.",
    "This course did improve my Chinese considerably, however there was a very heavy workload (which meant I had less time to devote to other subjects). I think this class could be improved by having a one-on-one oral examination with the teacher, rather than online. I also think I would have benefited from more speaking practice in class (before the oral exam)."

   "comments": [
    "It's a lot of work, but it's worth it if you want to learn Chinese. Liang Laoshi and Xu Laoshi are wonderful and super-enthusiastic.",
    "I definitely recommend this course. Although I'm not very enthusiastic about language classes, I still had a fine time. Just know, it takes a lot of studying to do well in the class. If you like language classes normally, I would definitely recommend this course.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course. Learning a language is an invaluable skill in itself, of course. But classes that meet and have homework everyday can really help develop work ethic and organizational skills while still having a bearable workload, which is important especially in your earlier years at Yale.",
    "I would recommend this course. I would just make sure that this is the right level, and your skills are on par with the other people in the class. Overall, this was a great course, despite the heavy workload, and I plan to continue taking Chinese at Yale."
