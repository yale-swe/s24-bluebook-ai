   "comments": [
    "If you're a music major, you need to take this, but know that you'll enjoy it. If you're not a music major, I implore you to try it. Please note that the tests are daunting, but if you focus you should be able to get through it fine.",
    "I would say it is an incredible survey of the Baroque through early Romantic periods of music and that it is engaging, challenging and extremely well taught",
    "Hepo is the best! Even if you're not a music major, take this Credit\/D because he's such a great lecturer and you will learn so much from him. It's definitely a lot of work, especially in preparing for the listening exams and factual exams, but he goes out of his way to give you materials to prepare you - so use them! Excellent class.",
    "As always, Professor Hepokoski's music history lectures were a joy! Although this class is hard work, it is incredibly rewarding. Professor Hepokoski is a fantastic instructor. His lectures are seamlessly planned and delivered. His classes are some of the best I've taken at Yale.",
    "Standard \"Hepokoski\" lecture format. Might be a bit much for someone who has never taken a course with Prof. H before, but inspiring material over all. Three factual exams, three listening quizzes, and one large final essay. It's nice to have a class over before reading period all things considered, and the class does a good job of distributing the workload and examinations evenly.",
    "Take it and enjoy the lecture! Even if you are not a music major, this class will guide you into full and rewarding understanding of music, culture, and humanity.",
    "Take the class. It's not just a requirement. It's a privilege.",
    "Required class for music majors but a really great one! For non-majors I wouldn't recommend this class unless you have some background in music\/theory. Hepo likes to root his histories as stories that can literally be gleaned from the music itself so there are a lot of formal, theoretical, and analytical discussions. Non-majors should shop first and see if they're comfortable before taking.",
    "Obviously a required course for the music major, and Hepokoski is a brilliant lecturer. I think the course is outdated in its approach to music history (e.g. centered around a male-driven narrative of the \"masters\" without acknowledging why other perspectives are left out of the narrative) and I was not the biggest fan of the huge focus on FORM towards the end of the course, but some people love Sonata Theory so if so, this is for you. All in all, Hepo is an important experience and helps you think critically about music history - so much so that I now criticize his own course haha - and the music is spectacular.",
    "If you're a music major, you need it. If you're not, but you're really really passionate about this era of music and you have room in your schedule, you'll probably love it (if you like talking a lot about sonata form). The paper topic was pretty boring this semester, and the tests have a lot of material, but it's a good class.",
    "This was a great course, mainly due to Professor Hepokoski's enthusiastic lecturing. I was initially reluctant to study classical music, but the course drew me in, and I especially found the extramusical information--about political regimes, religion, social norms and conventions of thought--interesting. The music was not so bad either, and Hepokoski's love for the music is palpable. The course packs a lot of information into one semester, and I felt like sometimes the amount of material on the study guides was intimidating. For the exams, I found it helpful to prepare certain topics very thoroughly and briefly review others instead of trying to master everything. I liked the balance of different types of thinking required by the listening quizzes, factual exams, and term paper. There are three listening quizzes, where you have to identify ten short excerpts of music by title, composer, and date. There are also three factual exams, each with two short responses and one longer essay that is more analytical. Finally, there is a term paper on historiography due the week before Thanksgiving break.",
    "An amazing class! Beautiful music, fascinating history, and Hepokoski! Hepokoski is the best lecturer I've had, and he loves this material and music and doesn't hide his love for it. He complicates the history and makes you think more critically about history in general. This class is a lot of work and will drain time from your other classes -- it is three written exams, three listening exams, and one 12-page paper. I thought it was less work than 352 -- probably partially because I was used to it but also because there was way less reading, only one paper, and fewer hours of music on the exams.",
    "I would recommend Music 351 to anyone hoping to gain a broader understanding of Western music and its contextual origins. While most people in the class are music majors, it is TOTALLY accessible to other students. I am an Environmental Studies major with a passion for music; while some of the theory went over my head, the vast majority of material was within reach. Take it! Music history is even more fascinating than I expected it to be.",
    "This is a thorough and original sweep through Western classical music history 1600-1800. Hepokoski pulls a small number of very convincing threads through those 2 centuries, which rescues this course from being superficial and boring, like most music history surveys around the country. His interweaving of form and music history is very original and very illuminating. Hepokoski is a fantastic lecturer -- thoughtful, original, and crystal-clear -- and provides a great deal of detailed, helpful supporting materials (diagrams, etc.)."
