   "comments": [
    "definitely take it if you want to learn how to read the bible. If you get intimidated by professors, though, be wary. Professor Brisman can be intense.",
    "Take this course. It will help you understand the power of a book without which world history would be unimaginably different. It will also help you understand yourself, which I think is the biggest compliment I can give to a literature course. Parts of the Bible are incomparably beautiful pieces of literature and the chance to study with someone as insightful, communicative, and kind as Professor Brisman should not be passed up.",
    "The course was comprehensive and intriguing. Professor Brisman is brilliant and one ofthe kindest professors you will ever be lucky to have. This class provides a great environment to improve your literary analytical skills while studying such an influential classic--the Bible. The strengths are numerous: great professor, excellent introductions, goals for each class, and conclusions that you will dread (because you are enjoying yourself so much). The weaknesses? I've been sitting here in front of my computer for a couple minutes now and I really can't think of any. Consequently, I can't think of any improvements. The only improvements could be on the part of the students, who need to make sure to do the readings for good conversation with various contributors.",
    "Very interest class -- definitely worth taking for the simple reason that everyone should read the the Bible, but also because of the wonderful professor. Expect to be a little confused by the structure of the class. assignment as not always very clearly defined and the grading system is confusing, so definitely take advantage of office hours.",
    "This is one of those classic \"Yale classes\" that you have to take before you graduate. Do not worry about getting in - if you really want to take it, and finish the introductory assignment on time, you will have a spot in the class. You don't read the whole Bible, but you read a good chunk of it, and to read the Bible as a work of literature with an assortment of authors is quite the experience - regardless of what religion you follow, if any.",
    "The course provided an interesting - if not dull - perspective on the Bible. Professor Brisman really enlivens the material and conducts a fabulous discussion. The readings were not too difficult or too few, but they were boring. Also, many of the students in the course are very familiar with the Bible already, so if you're not - like me - discussions can feel intimidating and overwhelming.",
    "ENGL 395 is a must-take for anyone unfamiliar with the Bible. It provided both a rather comprehensive overview of the various books (through the readings) and then a theme-based exploration of the text in class. The reading itself took no more than 1.5 hrs per class, but I found the papers to be very demanding time-wise. Also, be warned that the pre-1800 option takes a significant amount of extra time - I spent at least 2 hours on each assignment. Brisman is an insightful, thoughtful professor and a very kind man. I was originally intimidated but have really come to like and respect him.",
    "Reading the Bible as literature means not reading the Bible as a historical document or as a theological document but as a collection of narratives. You could say in general the course is concerned with how the stories and the characters are constructed. So sometimes theological questions and questions of authorship are important, just as they would be in a Shakespeare class, but they're not the focus. There is also an emphasis on moments of moral ambiguity in the Bible. For example, when Jesus walks on water, Mark writes that he meant to pass his disciples by (their boat is floundering in a storm). So why would Jesus do that? I think everyone should read the Bible, since it's so important to our culture and especially if you are doing an English major, so I recommend the course particularly if you haven't read the Bible before (I hadn't before this term).",
    "English 395 is quite a bit of work, but it is definitely interesting and useful and is especially pertinent to English majors. I would highly recommend this course to anyone with an interest in either religion or the English major, but would suggest that non-English majors take the Lit course instead of the English.",
    "Excellent course, regardless of your familiarity with the Bible (though some familiarity might help). The course is difficult, but well worth the effort. Take it!",
    "Take it pass fail if you are interested. It's not a perfect course but the material is fascinating.",
    "Take it if you would like to look at the different interpretations of texts and want to tease out what the original authors could have been going for and why. However, don't take this course if you want to analyze the Bible as a whole and expect to interpret the text as one book.",
    "Take this class, which offers you an excellent chance to interact with some of the world\u0092s finest literatureand one of Yale\u0092s finest professors. Brisman is that rare professor who takes teaching very seriously. Don\u0092t miss a chance to hear his anecdotes, jokes, and ever-keen analysis (Bonus: you\u0092ll learn a lot about the Bible, which is really important!)",
    "Bible as Literature exposed me to the writing in the Bible. It asked me to look at scripture as a collection of works by various different people. Class discussion trained me to differentiate between the voices of multiple authors. The course made the Bible more relatable to me.The first few class meetings may seem dry, but they get more and more interesting. Professor Brisman is a unique teacher and includes everyone in class discussion. I recommend this class to anyone who is interested in reading the Bible.",
    "Great course! It will challenge you as a thinker, and no matter what academic background you come from, you will learn a lot from it.",
    "Professor Brisman is unlike any other professor at Yale.He knows his subject forward and backward, having taught it for 30 years, but he is rethinking and replanning the class for his students every day. He is the best seminar leader I have had at Yale, with a good balance of sharing his insights and leading discussion. He has exacting expectations, so read the syllabus carefully - he outlines everything explicitly, and you should take it seriously. Go to the first class and see what you think.",
    "I enjoyed the class because I knew nothing and wanted to learn about the bible. Having taught this class 30 times before, Brisman is incredibly erudite and it was a real pleasure learning about the bible from such a wise soul.That being said, it was pretty painful at times. The pre-1800 requirement was tedious and unnecessary, the final exam made me angry, Brisman's syllabus is a verbose novella, and his grading is totally arbitrary. Proceed with caution.",
