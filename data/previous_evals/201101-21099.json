    "Field Methods is a practical introduction to data collection in a new language. It involves a lot of out of class work, including processing recordings, notes, and other information collected in class and individual meetings. I would not necessarily recommend this class to a student for whom it was not a requirement.While the experience is very valuable. The workload is extremely heavy and the amount of frustration not worth it unless you have a serious interest in fieldwork. However, I think that may be heavily influenced by the instructor, so if you work well with the professor who is teaching the course, it may be worthwhile."
