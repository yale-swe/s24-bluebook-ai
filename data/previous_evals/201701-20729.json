   "comments": [
    "I learned SO much about a region I've never even thought about before, and I learned a lot about historical method, thinking critically about sources, and analyzing primary texts. I'm not a history major, but I think I learned things that I can take with me into other areas of study, and I definitely learned an incredibly large amount of content. I think that's one of the most special things about this class - there are very few classes at Yale that teach a domain with which nearly every student in the class is wholly unfamiliar, and do so in a way that feels extremely accessible. Professor Hansen assumes absolutely no background knowledge, and she stays true to that assumption throughout the entire semester without fail. Also, her grading on papers is SO helpful - she actually uses a rubric (rare for professors of history) and tells you exactly where you are losing points. It's not an ambiguous \"I liked this paper, you get an A\" but rather a detailed analysis of exactly where you went wrong and where you excelled, which is super helpful for growing as a writer. Midterms are very reasonable, she tells you exactly what to expect, so there's no surprises at all. Overall, I learned a ton from this class.",
    "This course is amazing for developing critical thinking skills and writing concise historical analysis. With regards to the course focus, we learned about Xinjiang and other sites along the Silk Road through the lens of archaeological artifacts.",
    "This is a good course to polish your ability to write concise and meaningful short papers, as well as an interesting exploration of a region that is very rarely covered in other courses. There is a lot to learn here that relates back to many other areas of history.",
    "From most history courses I have taken at Yale, I have gained similar skills in the context of new knowledge-bases. Professor Hansen's course is unique. Rather than focus on large scale understanding of the dates and events of a period (what she refers to as the \"great march of history\"), she structures the course around different documents found across Silk Road sites. Initially slightly odd (as I was so used to other history courses), I gained an appreciation for this style as the course went on. I feel that her class (if you choose to participate) allows for the strong development of analytical skills and more effective study of primary source materials. I also feel that I left the course with a strong sense of the nature of Silk Road life in Xinjiang and and understanding of the issues that continue to plague the region today.",
    "I think that this course is best thought of as a course to develop your reading and writing skills. Although I do not think I came out of it with an in depth understanding of the silk road, I wish I had taken it freshman year to hone my writing and analytical skills."

   "comments": [
    "Strengths are accessibility, Professor Hansen's teaching method, and very reasonable assignments\/grading. The class assumes absolutely no prior knowledge, so if you're interested in Asia at all or want to learn something new about a region that is rarely discussed, this is a perfect introductory course. You will also learn A TON because the textbook literally reads like a novel (I would be disappointed when I got to the end of a chapter - I wanted to keep reading, I wished there was more. Yes, you know it's good when students actively want to do MORE reading.) and because Professor Hansen is honestly one of the most knowledgeable people on the topic of the Silk Road in the entire world. Like, seriously, you're taking a class with someone who's legitimately very famous, don't forget that. And assignments are very reasonable and very clearly graded, which is very helpful. There's two midterms (IDs, a timeline that you prepare in advance, and a map quiz that's very easy to study for), and each of them has absolutely no surprises or ambiguity, as well as two papers that are 1,000 words each. Honestly, workload not bad at all, but high enough to keep you engaged with the course and engaged with the content. The final is a final presentation about a topic of your choosing, which is really cool because you get to explore something that interests you. The only weakness I can think of (and I'm really digging here) is that some students were definitely more engaged with the class than others, which was clear when we did discussions of primary texts. However, Professor Hansen would always jump in with helpful comments whenever we had any ambiguity or awkward lulls in conversation.",
    "The greatest strength of this class is its non-traditional organization. Each week, one lecture was devoted to lecture and the other to discussion of the text. As a expert, Professor Hansen offered valuable insight on how to learn best in this class and it was amazing to leave a class feeling like I had a handle on all of the material. The textbook also follows the class structure perfectly and that helped clear any confusion. The only weakness is that sometimes it feels very fast.",
    "I think we needed a bit more time per presentation to really bring more out of them, allow for questions etc, however that might be possible. Otherwise this is an interesting course and well taught.",
    "The strengths of this course are largely due to its structure. She creates a reasonable schedule of assignments, offers helpful feedback, and allows flexibility for re-writes. Additionally, a course built around primary documents is inventive and interesting. She is an engaging lecturer and allows many opportunities for student engagement. The only weakness is that in a course built on student engagement, if some students do not participate, it can be slightly less interesting. This is not a knock on the course or Professor Hansen, rather a call to students to take this course who are open to participation.",
    "I thought there could have been slightly better feedback on essays, as well as general information regarding what constituted an A-level paper. The final project was a great way to end the semester, as it was enjoyable to complete and collaborative.",
    "Like I said I think that this course provides excellent opportunities to work on close readings of primary sources. However, I believe that the course could be organized much better. I didnt really feel like there was a narrative arch to the class in any way. A lot of the material felt disconnected. We would study a particular artifact and a particular place, but I dont really have a sense for how the place and those things are woven into the overall history of the region. I also felt that jumping all the way to the present at the end felt disjointed. I would love to have more narratives and connections made along the way, or even to have had assignments which forced me to do that work myself."

    "ABSOLUTELY. I could not recommend this class more highly. If you are interested in Asia (or even if you aren't and want to learn something new), you should absolutely take this class. You will learn so much and learn a ton about how to approach history. The themes in this class - transmission of religion and language, long versus short distance trade, law and governmental structure, and so many more are all very interesting. You'll look at some REALLY cool primary sources - things that are thousands of years old and some of the oldest pieces of writing in the world - and you'll read their translations, many of which were done by Professor Hansen herself. By the way, she's literally one of the coolest and smartest professors at Yale - the amount that she knows about her area is absolutely staggering. I truly could not recommend a course more highly than I recommend this one.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. Professor Hansen makes the material interesting and it is tailored enough that students feel confident to explain the material they learn about in class.",
    "Yes. This is an unusual course in what it covers, and don't take it expecting to learn about the Middle East - but if you want to know what was in the 'stans before they became the 'stans, or why China cares so much about a sparsely populated (if huge) corner of its Western territory, this is a very interesting coverage of all that and more.",
    "I would wholeheartedly recommend this course to another student, especially one interested in developing skills crucial to the history major. Professor Hansen is generous with her time, funny and friendly in class, and very thorough in feedback. Overall, this was a very fun, interesting class that I think many would enjoy. It also provides a fresh take on a period often misunderstood in popular history.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this class to another student. The material covered and course assignments are very interesting and helped me sharpen my History skills. I would note that students should be prepared to invest a good amount of time into the papers, as they are slightly different and shorter than normal History papers.",
    "One of the best classes at Yale. I was not familiar at all with the topic but it ended up being one of my favorite classes so far."
