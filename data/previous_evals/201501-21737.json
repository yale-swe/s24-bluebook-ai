   "comments": [
    "Greek 120 is, as you might expect from L1, a rigorous, repetitious course. Like many language classes at Yale, it relies a lot on hitting you with the material for multiple hours a day (between class and schoolwork) and never giving you time to forget it. It's definitely easy to fall into a routine with this class (the trick is finding a GOOD routine), and the workload each night isn't too bad. Still, someone looking to dive more deeply into the text or language might want to supplement this class with another, as it focuses more on constant mini-assessments (that often end up based in short-term memory) rather than substantial projects or investigations.",
    "Greek 120 is hard but doable, just be sure to actually do the memorization work, the principal parts and such. Having been well prepared previously will help tremendously. Reading real greek will make it all meaningful",
    "Greek 120 builds on the first semester of Greek Grammar and begins to integrate textual readings. It is important that you have a strong foundation in the language. You will work through about seven chapters of Hansen & Quin text before starting on Plato's apology. I would recommend this course if you want to learn Ancient Greek. Not a good choice for an easy language credit.",
    "I would recommend this class to another student, but only if that student actually had an interest in Greek. If you aren't excited by Plato, Sparta, and Sappho, don't take this course! It is hard, and often feels like drudgery (because a lot of it is memorization, there is no way to make that fun). But, if you do love the classical world, then you get a lot of tantalizing glimpses of Ancient Greece in this class, and they are well worth it.",
    "You finally get to translate some real Greek in this class, which is very rewarding. And you need to take it to get credit for Greek 110, so I highly recommend it!",
    "GREK 120 is a great class as it teaches you the necessary skills to be finally able to read real Greek. The second half of the semester really pays off as you start reading Plato's Apology which is an amazing experience."
