    "This class was one of the top five most memorable, rewarding, and gleeful academic undertakings of my time at Yale. In the coming years, I expect I'll continue to think of my memories and experiences in Virginia Woolf's terms. Take this class.",
    "Lots of reading, but incredibly rewarding discussion and class dynamic. Definitely take it, but only if you are actually going to do the reading or you won't get anything out of the class!",
    "Take it. Great overview of Woolf. It's a lot of reading, so be prepared.",
    "This is great seminar if you're into reading all the book by one author. Virginia Woolf is a genius, and it's fun to take a course that allows you to read her letters and secondary materials. Homans, a gem of a professor, walks through class through discussions on how to understand Woolf's complex attitudes toward colonialism, her depictions of race and gender, and the references to class in her books so this is not a course that just fawns over a great writer. Be forewarned that people stop doing the readings partway through the semester and it will make the semester less exciting, since there is so much reading to do.",
    "ENGL 446 is a course on Virginia Woolf, where you will read most of her novels from Jacob's Room to Between the Acts, as well as other texts written by Woolf. You learn about the writer's life as well as her technique and political\/social interests. The course consists of a discussion twice each week, and culminates in a long final paper, which is the basis for the course grade. I would recommend this course to anyone interested in modern literature, Woolf, or gender and sexuality.",
    "Take it! Professor Homans is absolutely wonderful.",
    "This is an intensive senior seminar on Virginia Woolf, consisting of most of the novels, a good number of essays and some secondary literature. Anyone who has an interest in Woolf will learn a lot. (I might not take it if she isnt your cup of tea.) Since there is so much reading and your only assignment is a final paper, its very much a you get out of it what you put into it type of course. Recommend for the sr seminar requirement for English majors, or for nonmajors who really love Woolf. Woolfs work is incredibly rich and varied and formidable, and Margaret Homans is a great guide.",
    "An amazing course! A great way to really delve into Virginia Woolf as well as develop your own ideas and interests in the long paper. Professor Homans is wonderful as well!",
    "The course is a survey of what seems to be everything that Woolf has written and what others have written about her work, but in actuality it will only point out that this is the tip of the proberbial iceberg!"
