   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another freshman. It was wonderful to have such challenging discussions with other freshmen as soon as I got to campus. The books were sometimes difficult to read (because of the disturbing material and sheer length), but I adapted quickly and really enjoyed the process of reading them.",
    "You'll read a ton of South African lit that isn't always easy or pleasant to read, but you'll have really interesting discussions, write some great papers, and come out of the class with a deep and broad understand of certain aspects of South African society and how they are manifested in literature. Highly recommended if you're up for a lot of reading and interested in African Studies.",
    "South African Writing After Apartheid is a freshman seminar I would definitely recommend. It's probably the easiest writing credit you could get - one 2-3 page essay, three 5-7 page essays. You read a novel a week, which may sound intense but they're books you would read in your free time, not academic texts. Steph is a great and friendly professor.",
    "English 015 is a good class. The literature is very interesting, and I learned a lot from our class discussions. Field trips are a great change in pace. On the other hand, the literature is very traumatic and reading a book every four days of this manner can really mess with you if you get more emotionally attached to novels. Also be ready for heavy academic language, not only by the teacher but also by the students. Be prepared to translate on your feet empty academic sentences into concrete, simple, three word phrases.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to any student who loves to read and who is already familiar with writing literary analysis. South African apartheid is a subject sorrily neglected in high school, but it's such large stain on the history of the world that I think everyone should take a course such as this one.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class to a fellow student. This class encourages you to look at issues of race, class, gender, and sexuality critically, so I would especially recommend it to anyone interested in those topics. I would also add that the class does involve a great deal of reading, so people who don't enjoy that or who aren't prepared to take it on might want to consider something else. However, doing the readings was very, very fulfilling, and made me enjoy this already-wonderful class all the more.",
    "This class is incredible, take it!!! Professor Newell is the best, she's an incredible person and an amazing professor- she constantly pushes you to be better (and admittedly is a tough grader) and is just a joy to be around every week- she continually makes discussion interesting and engaging. The entire class is discussion-based, which I loved, and the texts we read are all so though-provoking. South Africa isn't an area of the world you generally learn that much about, and this class provides such great exposure to what happened post-apartheid. The one thing I would say as a warning is that a lot of the texts are pretty disturbing, so if you don't have the stomach for things like that, then this class may not be the best choice for you... But otherwise definitely take it!!",
    "A class that uses South African writing and other cultural objects to understand the legacy that apartheid left in the country and what kind of society exists in South Africa now.",
    "Yes, you learn so much about South Africa during and after the apartheid regime.",
    "If you are interested in South African history or society, modern or past, please take it! Even if you know nothing about South Africa or its history, tale it; you will not regret it. Mainly, you will discover new horizons of a very different kind of writings in very different settings, and you will love it!",
    "ENGL 015 can essentially be summed up in this way: a lot of reading, a lot of good, thought provoking discussion, and four essays. The reading is very interesting, though significant in pages, and the discussions are very substantial in complexity and overall \"interestingness.\" I would recommend the course - the workload was slightly above average in terms of daily readings, but the essays were not any longer than typical essays. The course was never boring, and the professor was great.",
    "A really good and interesting freshman seminar, where you get to engage with subjects that you don't normally get to discuss in American schools, particularly with regards to South African issues. Steph Newell is a great professor who will definitely go out of her way to lend you a helping hand when you need it.",
    "I would say it is an interesting, informing course."
