   "comments": [
    "It's essentially a required course for physics grad students, but for anyone else it doesn't make much sense, since it's designed so specifically for physics PhD students",
    "I would recommend the course because everyone should take graduate stat mech at some point. The course was difficult but if you put in the time, it is well worth it.",
    "I think the exams were a little off. Obviously, the midterm was a disaster for most people, but the final also just didn't make sense. There was definitely a better way to test our knowledge of the subject in general, then a few random questions that didn't really connect all the dots together.",
    "It's a great intro. to statistical physics. Yes.",
    "A bit of rigorous thermodynamics, a lot of stat mech, and a bit of phase transitions. Nice self-contained course.You are not a physicist if you have not studied these at least once, so take this class.",
    "Yes. Well its a necessary evil.",
    "This course is important for anyone pursuing a phd; however, I do not know if I would recommend the instructor.",
    "Great area of study but would be better with a different teaching style.",
    "I would recommend not to take this class with Prof. Read",
    "The class provides a great introduction into stat. mech. and an overview of thermodynamics. I would definitely recommend this course to another student.",
    "I think the course in itself is very interesting, but unfortunately not well taught. I would definitely recommend the course only if the instructor was different.",
    "Fairly standard Stat Mech course, although I hoped to learn more than I actually did."

   "comments": [
    "It helped me prepare for the qual, and aspects, especially quantum stat mech, should be useful in my research (condensed matter experiment).The subject is a pretty standard pillar to a physics education; this course fulfilled that.",
    "The parts of this course that overlapped with Solid State or previous courses like that served as a good refresher, but it was not particularly helpful otherwise.",
    "The course covers basic ideas that are important in any physics subfield.",
    "Basics!",
    "Didn't contribute.",
    "This course was very useful to understanding physics more deeply and broadly. While not immediately applicable to my current research, I have no doubt it will be in the future.",
    "Statistical mechanics is a beautiful subject that has a lot of connections with my sub field. Unfortunately I did not get much from the lectures, so I will have to study it by myself.",
    "Stat Mech is extremely important, so I wanted to leave the class with a deep understanding of it. While it put me on the right track, I think it could have been much more effective."
