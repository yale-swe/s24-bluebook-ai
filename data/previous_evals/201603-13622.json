    "This survey format doesn't really fit this seminar class. The seminars were great, but a few didn't really apply to me, but that will naturally happen. I LOVED the PeachLab seminar with Christina Roberto! I would love to see more speakers pertaining to lifestyle behavior factors in chronic disease.",
    "The speakers varied in their abilities to engage students. Some weeks speakers gave talks on cutting edge research, and other weeks it was not as interesting. For someone not that interested in doing research, I sometimes found it hard to pay attention because it seemed like all the speakers talked about their research. Maybe some sort of variation would be better. Also -- it is always hard to have incentive to focus when courses are non-credit, so maybe consider having this course be a half-credit and require students to read some paper published by the speaker before the lunch. That would help students both be more engaged and also incentivize them to pay attention more.",
    "It was alright.",
    "Good variety of topics. I appreciated that we talked about Community based participatory research from all perspectives, that was really great as we will be in the academic roles in the field and need to consider the organization's role as well. I think that SBS as a whole is really focused on domestic issues, maybe incorporate some global health POVs as well.",
    "Love the weekly homeworks and the constant reminders in class to do the required readings. So useful for learning.",
    "I think the instructors did an excellent job in selecting and organizing speakers on a a variety of topics from different areas within public health. These talks gave me a much better understanding of what public health looks like both in academia and in industry, and has given me several ideas of things to consider in my future career and studies.",
    "Interesting speakers! Strengths - there is a variety of speakers. Weaknesses - only researchers are brought as seminar speakers, lack of other SBS professionals as speakers",
    "Great lecture series",
    "In this seminar, some of the speakers were interesting, but some were inappropriate in respect to the topics they discussed. Some of the sessions that were intended for SBS students were more suitable for CDE students, as well. Moreover, a lot of the sessions went over the allotted time period, causing scheduling conflicts. The food was great.",
    "I really enjoyed all of the lectures. I wish there was some kind of structure for SBS so have discussion groups or conversations about topics in the field in addition to lectures.",
    "Very interesting seminar with great speakers!",
    "It was great having weekly lectures unrelated to class but related to the concentration.. nice to be reminded of what actual work in the field translates to in practice. However, not good\/many vegetarian options with lunch served and emphasis could be improved on healthy options (salads, wraps, not all just sandwhiches)",
    "Strengths: Many different lecturers come to talk on a variety of topics. You'll get a good taste of the kind of research being conducted in the field of public health."

    "They bring in guest speakers for seven Thursdays during the semester. Food is provided.",
    "Put in the time. It's worth it! It will feel so empowering to develop these skills.",
    "This course is a great introduction to all of the kinds of things individuals studying public health can do in the realm of social and behavioral sciences, as well as epidemiology more generally. I attended all of the talks, and always came out with some useful information on a field of research or an interesting agency. I'm looking forward to more talks in the future.",
    "Interesting topics, would definitely recommend if they are interested in pursuing research in SBS",
    "I learned from the presentations in this seminar, but I think that the presenters should have been selected more carefully.",
    "Interesting lunch time speaker series on SBS topics",
    "Interesting to hear about researchers in the field, nice mix of topics",
    "Take advantage of lunch time seminars to learn about new topics, as well as to perhaps connect with leaders in the field of a topic that you may be researching."
