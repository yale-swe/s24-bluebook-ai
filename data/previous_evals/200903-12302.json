   "comments": [
    "An amazing class that will dominate your semester. James is amazing, and much better read in class than on one's own. But he also writes long, hard books, so be prepared to put in more than 10 hours EVERY WEEK to complete the reading. You'll want to, because discussion is great (and Ruth Yeazell is a goddess) but do not think you will be able to skirt by skimming the reading. Plan on this being your biggest commitment of the semester.",
    "The most difficult class EVER.",
    "Two hours a week, lots of reading, intense discussion. Take this class if you can devote some time to it, not as a sixth credit or something crazy. And only take it if you're super into Henry James - if you've never read any, pick up The Ambassadors and read a few random paragraphs to give you a sense of the late style. He's the greatest American novelist, but that's not to say he's everyone's favorite.",
    "Highly recommended if you're a fan of James.",
    "A LOT of reading, and watch out for the 25-page essay at the end...but if you love James (or if you don't know James but love good literature), I cannot imagine a better class. James is an author who reads very differently the second time through---while it helps to have prior background in James, it can be an even more interesting experience if you enter without having read a page he wrote, especially if you observe your process of reading and comprehension throughout. James rewards all the attention and rigor hedemands, and Prof Yeazell likewise. She is a tough grader but a brilliant seminar leader and offers insightful, engaged comments on papers.",
    "This class offered the opportunity to discuss several James novels with a thoughtful (sometimes intense) group of students, under the guidance of Ruth Yeazell, a talented teacher and James scholar. Prof. Yeazell provides individual help with the writing of the long paper, though the class itself (appropriately, I think) does not emphasize research methods. Reading a James novel a week is a lot of work (sometimes a single page seemed to take about an hour!), and I would warn that this course should not be undertaken by those who don't expect to keep up with the reading or who can't stomach James's late prose style.Professor Yeazell is an excellent teacher--energetic, focused, sharp; she leads rigorous, fast-paced discussions.",
    "I would recommend the class to someone who has read James before (more than just \"The Turn of the Screw,\" which we do not cover in class). I'm not sure how well James lends itself to being swallowed all in one chunk.",
    "You read a lot of Henry James novels from different periods. I would recommend the class to people who like Victorian novels and\/or Henry James. But even for someone who didn't mind Henry James going into the class, I was pretty sick of him by the end. Also don't take the class if you have a lot of work otherwise. It's a lot of reading which I always had trouble finishing for class.",
    "Absolutely, but be sure you like Henry James.",
    "Henry James isn't everyone's cup of tea. His novels are sometimes abstruse, his sentences sometimes meander for much of a page before concluding in a manner that makes you question whether or not you've missed the punchline. Be prepared to be mystified. However, there is no better instructor in this area than Prof. Yeazell (who wrote the Introduction the Penguin edition of 'The Golden Bowl'). Class discussions were thought-provoking and she has the uncanny ability to reign people in when their comments get out of hand. Keep up with the reading or you'll get lost. One of the better senior seminars."
