   "comments": [
    "Kind of difficult to summarize. I'd say it was Professor Kastan's book history class and they'd know what I meant. I'd definitely recommend it. I didn't realize how much I needed it before I took it.",
    "I was unsure as to whether I would be interested in book history - now, I find myself wondering, even after these few weeks, why I never thought about this before, I feel like I've learned a basic set of skills that I shouldn't have been without. The work with books in the Beinecke alone was fun and very unlike my other classes. The course also tied in with the Beinecke lecture series, so there were a great deal of other perspectives and examples of how book history is seen by others.",
    "ENGL 591 01 is an introduction to the field called the \"History of the Book,\" with a heavy focus on theoretical approaches to \"the book.\" The course provides an opportunity to familiarize oneself with \"old books\" and many overlooked features of the book as a physical object. I have nothing but good things to say about this course. I have recommended it many times already! Fantastic course, excellent material covered."

   "comments": [
    "It gave me confidence using a lot of skills I didn't have before. Not sure what my dissertation will be about yet so I don't really know.",
    "I have already stumbled upon several things of interest just by digging a little deeper into books I would usually overlook. I have become so much more aware of literary production and trade in a way I found fascinating while writing my seminar paper. Because the skills and theory we have learned are so transferable, it's hard to see them not being useful.",
    "I am interested in analyzing Medieval concepts of assemblage and how what we term as \"conceptual writing\" hearkens back and reframes ideas of assemblage and \"the book\" in general. This course helped me immensely with that area of study--I now have the experience to study books as objects and a command of the terminology to flash in a professional setting."
