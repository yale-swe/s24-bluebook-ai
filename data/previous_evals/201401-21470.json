    "Yes I recommend this course IF it is taught by Harvey Weiss. He is a genius and makes the course material digestible for amazing discussions.",
    "I would recommend this course with reservations. The topic matter is important and engaging but the course needs an overhaul for sure (which makes sense considering this was its pilot year). There is an insane amount of reading, classes can drag on and feel unproductive, and Weiss was frequently disorganized BUT if you are really interested in agriculture this course is extremely valuable in grounding one's perspective on the modern food system in a historical context.",
    "Ehhh. The subject matter is interesting, there isn't very much work, and Harvey Weiss is a good teacher. It's a pretty solid class. At least this year, the class was basically a lecture; Weiss never left time for discussion. I think a lot of kids found that frustrating but I was kind of into it.",
    "The notion of agriculture is one that people rarely consider. Even more infrequent is the acknowledgement that only in recent times has the food supply been totally connected with and contingent upon the practice of agriculture. For these reasons especially, I think it's worth it to think about how agriculture came to be how it is today. However, I personally am passionate about food and agriculture in general, so this topic might be more naturally alluring for me than for other students. This course gives valuable perspective on agriculture but that's pretty much where the line is drawn: if you're not interested in the idea of agriculture--though this advice might seem obvious--don't take the class.",
