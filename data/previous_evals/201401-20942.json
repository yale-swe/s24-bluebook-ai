   "comments": [
    "A lot of reading, however, the books are interesting and relatable. One learns about how american literature developed over time and the ideas and culture behind it. Woul recommend this class.",
    "This is one of those classes that truly depends on the chemistry of the students. Despite the fact that only a few of us took it without the pressure of having to fulfill a WR requirement, our discussions were lively and interesting. Everyone had something to share, which is very important when you spend 2.5 hours together each week discussing the readings.",
    "It really is a great intro to American lit. and I would definitely recommend it to anybody who feels they don't know quite enough in that domaine. If you can take it with Professor Grimstad - he'll bring a lot to the class and will give you great books to read. The reading load is manageable and really enjoyable if you like fiction.",
    "I don't consider myself a great writer and I took this class for a writing credit. It was a great choice. The literature we covered were classics from authors like Emerson, Ellison, James, Hawthorne, etc. and I'm very happy to have read them during my time at Yale. The papers are very manageable, two during the term with a final 10 page paper. Would definitely recommend to other students, particularly to STEM students looking for a good writing class you'll learn from!",
    "Good class to read classic American novels, and get your ass handed to you politely on some papers in a productive way.",
    "Really good reading lists but I expected a lot more from the class itself. Grimstad is a great guy, but has no idea how to foster class discussion. He spends over half the time talking himself, but not about things in the book. One of the most frustrating things about this class was how little it helped my understanding of the books we read because we discussed them so little.",
    "Grimstad is a wonderful professor - the best English professor I've encountered at Yale. He encouraged really interesting and engaging discussion and chose some great works. It was a pleasure to attend class every week. Great works of literature, DEFINITELY an intro class worth taking - not much work, but you get so much out of it.",
    "Great course. Make sure you like your professor otherwise it might be a bit annoying. Texts are great what you would expect."
