    "Take this class. You will not regret it. There's not much work, the lectures are AMAZING, sections are fun, the MET trip is really great, and you'll learn a lot.",
    "Good class, nice survey of the history of Chinese landscape painting. Good if you need a credit in whatever distribution this was, or a fifth class. Would be really great as a Cr\/D, though manageable as a letter grade too. Fun way to get into art history--I hadn't taken any before this class, and found it was both easy to follow and engaging.",
    "It was a great art history course and a great introduction for someone who hasn't studied Asian art before.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to anyone interested in Chinese art and history. You don't need to know anything beforehand because Professor Kim does an amazing job of introducing it to you and breaking down the formal components of the paintings. There is a paper and two midterms, but the class doesn't require you to blindly memorize the pieces. Instead, they want you to focus on analysis and your understanding of the cultural history. Overall, I think this class really does a beautiful job of introducing not just landscape painting, but important moments of Chinese history.",
    "One of those great electives which is numbered high but designed to be accessible to non-majors. You trace artists, history, trends, and works of art from the 5th Century to the present. Youn-mi has a quirky, cute lecture style and the TAs were really nice. 2 exams, 1 essay, no final, and a cool trip to the Met. Take it if you want an interesting non-gut but low-stress humanities credit.",
    "Fantastic class.",
    "Chinese Landscape is an excellent art history class. Professor Kim really brings the material alive in beautifully structured lectures. She is funny and prepared, and her lectures weave the material together into a very accessible yet sophisticated narrative. The sections were really interesting, too. We made very good use of the art gallery and object study rooms. We rarely spent section reviewing material from class. Instead, we learned new material or practiced visual analysis in a more active and participatory way. We also had several casual opportunities to present our own findings and analysis to each other when we did gallery tours at the MET and the YUAG. It was very gratifying to watch the class progress together. Very few of us knew much about Chinese art before we began, but it really felt like we were all very interested and prepared to talk about it by the end. The workload is light and never feels like work for the sake of work, but rather as though Professor Kim thoughtfully constructed the syllabus and the exercises to impart specific skills and knowledge essential for our development. I highly recommend.",
    "Great course, interesting subject, a lot of social history.",
    "Take the class!",
    "I wholeheartedly recommend this course! It was by far my favorite of the semester. It was very centered on the art and how to talk about Chinese landscape as a genre, which I appreciated as an art history major and someone who has never studied East Asian art. It also offered a good introduction to the political history of China but not in a boring way. Professor Kim is the sweetest person ever, and I was always excited to go to lecture. Readings were interesting and not too time consuming, midterm and final were very fair, and there was lots of room for creativity with the paper. Overall 10\/10 would recommend this class.",
    "Yes I would definitely recommend students to take this course.",
    "The content of this course is captured by the title. It's exactly that and if it's something you're curious about, you should take it with Professor Kim. Going almost weekly to the YUAG may at first seem like a chore, but it'll quickly become an enjoyable experience and getting to curate something in front of peers at the Met museum is something you don't do every day.",
    "A beginner friendly class on chinese landscape painting. No need of art history or chinese background. The material is clearly taught and the workload is extremely manageable. Section once a week, two exams, a paper, and a field trip. The teaching is high quality",
    "This was one of the best classes I've taken at Yale. I'm not an arts history major, and I just needed a Humanities credit, and I'm so happy I took this class. Chinese landscapes are so beautiful and it was so fun to learn about famous ancient painters, painting techniques. Also, this class provides a ton of socio-political background to complement the paintings, and it really adds to the enjoyment of the landscapes. For example, I finally have learned the succession of Dynasties in China. Paintings produced amidst transitions of power sometimes have hidden messages! Sections are chill, and you just look at paintings and talk about details you notice. I loved this class.",
    "An incredible way to culture yourself by exploring an important field of the humanities, especially if you are of East Asian heritage. As someone who never took any art class previously, I have discovered a newfound appreciation for landscape art, and I feel more aware of the artistry that has shaped my cultural heritage for countless generations.",
    "Overall , HSHR 351 was an amazing class! I loved learning about all landscape paintings from all ears, and really enjoyed learning about the greater culture of China during each time period. Additionally we had a really amazing trip to the metropolitan museum of art which was so amazing, as we got to see a lot of the images we takes about in clas in real life. I would absolutely recommend his class to anyone, regardless of background knowledge on China and art history in general! Great class and great professor!",
    "I would definitely recommend this class! It was really fun and interesting.",
    "An art history class that focuses specifically on Chinese Landscape Painting.",
    "A very interesting Art History class that I would recommend Yale students even remotely interested in art or East Asian studies take.",
    "Yes! This is a surprisingly great course for someone with no knowledge of Chinese painting. Youn-mi Kim is a really good teacher, and the way the course is set up, looking at history alongside art history, works very well. At the beginning of the class I had no idea about Chinese painting at all, and by the end I felt I could research it on my own, and I also could look at Chinese paintings that I'd never seen before and tell a lot about them.",
    "As an art history major who focuses mainly on American art, I had never studied Chinese painting before. This was a great introduction to a really rich area in Asian art, and Professor Kim was a really great professor: so enthusiastic and helpful. Going in I felt fairly confident in my visual analysis skills, but learning about this completely new kind of art made me feel (in a great way) like I had to totally start over and develop a new vocabulary that actively expanded the type of art I feel comfortable talking and writing about. Chinese landscape is also a fascinating genre (even though it might seem limited) and also allowed for a lot of connections to history, language, etc. that were really interesting.",
    "After taking Timothy Barringer's intro survey course, I was keen on taking another art history class before I graduated. This course was such a surprise during shopping period! I always breezed past the Asian art in museums because it was dimly lit (I later learned that was to protect the paper and silk material) and all seemed the same to me, but this class really flipped my preconceptions and gave me a good sense of how Chinese landscape painting had evolved through the ages, from the Tang dynasty all the way to the present. Prof. Kim is so adorably engaging and intelligent, and she does a fantastic job of weaving in historical and cultural context into her analysis of artists and their works. I can now walk through Chinese landscapes in a museum and pick out which dynasty they might have come from, and what was going on in China at the time to engender specific styles or elements of the painting. The workload is really light - just two non-cumulative exams (unlike other art history classes, you don't have to memorize the artist, title, date, etc.) and a 7-9 page comparison paper between a Chinese landscape and another object in the YUAG. I also really enjoyed the Object Study Room sessions and the YUAG gallery sessions during some lectures and sections, where we got to see paintings and objects from the period up close. I really recommend this course, whether you are an art history major or not, whether you have ever engaged with Chinese history or art or not.",
    "Chinese Landscape Painting with Professor Kim is an excellent class. Her lectures are clear, organized, and comprehensive. I can now go to a museum with family\/friends and give a good historical\/formal analysis of almost any Chinese landscape painting. Exams are fair and don't test dates."
