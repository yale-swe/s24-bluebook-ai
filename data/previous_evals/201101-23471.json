   "comments": [
    "This was a great course. I felt that I learned a great deal. Particular strengths lie in the instructors' expertise in the field and our critical analysis of primary literature in lecture and discussion sections. Recommendations: the schedule was a bit disjointed, however that was not the instructors' fault considering that the large amount of snow during the early part of the semester significantly altered the schedule. It would be beneficial at the beginning of the course to hold review sessions on laboratory techniques discussed in the literature or take a short survey just to see the particular needs\/background of that semesters' class.",
    "The course is well-rounded with emphasis on both current knowledge and the future direction of disease vector control. The lectures are interesting as they are rooted in research and scholarly publications. The only recommendation is to provide the students with a better background in laboratory techniques (e.g., \"experimental toolbox\").",
    "This was a really good course for students interested in vector borne diseases. It was good to look at various systems of insect vectors and think of ways the insects can be controlled",
    "STRENGTHS-Very informative, and in depth-paper based model helps us understand how to try and answer hypothesisWEAKNESS-did not always convey the big picture concept easily",
    "Did a great job of providing us with key information on vector control techniques and stimulating our own research into the subject.",

    "Instructor: Brian l Weiss \u00a0This professor was excellent. He was very helpful, responsive to e-mail, and a pleasure to learn from.",
    "Instructor: Brian l Weiss \u00a0Professor Weiss is one of the kindest professors I have ever had as a student. Despite my initial performance in the course, he remained understanding and approachable. He is also considerate and respectful toward all students. I am truly appreciative of the support and encouragement he gave me as a student in the course.",
    "Instructor: Brian l Weiss \u00a0Dr Brian was a very knowledgeable and encouraging professor. He explained concepts such as transgenic insects on a clear and basic level.He made vector biology seem almost easy but you had to work to understand and think of how concepts can be applied to the field",
    "Instructor: Brian l Weiss \u00a0Very knowledgeable and helpful",
    "Instructor: Brian l Weiss \u00a0Very responsive to students needs and taught in a way that helped us really learn the material and come away from the course with an understanding of the subject. Fostered good conversation in the classroom",
    "Instructor: Brian l Weiss \u00a0S: available for questions; friendly and funny; interested in the students careers; spread his interests to the students.",
    "Instructor: Serap Aksoy \u00a0This professor was great. She was helpful and supportive of research project interests.",
    "Instructor: Serap Aksoy \u00a0Dr. Aksoy is a kind professor with a great knowledge of disease vectors. As an instructor, she is poised and open to discussion with the class. She is understanding and supportive toward all her students. I am grateful to have both instructors for the course.",
    "Instructor: Serap Aksoy \u00a0Dr Aksoy was a good professor who was very knowledgeable in the field of vector biology.Her lectures on the insect immune system and BT toxin among others were really insightful for application in the field of vector borne disease control",
    "Instructor: Serap Aksoy \u00a0Very knowledgeable and helpful-both professors use their strengths to teach different classes",
    "Instructor: Serap Aksoy \u00a0Very knowledgeable and also fostered great conversation on the subject",

    "Biology of disease vectors is a relevant course for those interested in vector-borne diseases, such as malaria and dengue fever. Although a strong background in disease vectors is not necessarily needed, it is a course that demands effort and interest in learning the course material. I would recommend the course to another student because it is well-taught and important to those pursuing a career in infectious disease epidemiology.",
    "Take This Class",
    "If interested in infectious diseases, then this class will help you clarify the role of insects on disease transmission. Totally recommended."
