    "I would definitely recommend this class, not only is it interesting and engaging but Prof. Darnell is wonderful.",
    "I would not. It's a lot more work and a lot harder work than I expected. Egyptian is a very complex grammatical language and I didn't realize just how complex. But if you're really passionate about egyptology then you might be okay with it.",
    "This is a fun and interesting choice for a language credit. I chose it on a whim and have not regretted it!",
    "I thought this class was great, and definitely would do it again. If you're interested in ancient languages, then Egyptian is both interesting and fun. Professor Manassa is a wonderful professor, and does a great job of keeping Egypt alive and fascinating. I highly recommend the course.",
    "A truly enjoyable introduction to hieroglyphics. Professor Manassa is a great instructor! A must-take if you have any interest in ancient Egypt and\/or languages.",
    "I would recommend the course to another student if they were interested in hieroglyphics.",
    "For those of you who consider this a gut language, you may want to think again. Yes, it only meets twice a week, but it is a lot of work - not only memorizing the signs, but all the grammar as well. It is incredibly tricky and intricate, and only gets more so as you move on in the levels. Definitely not for the faint of heart or the barely interested."
