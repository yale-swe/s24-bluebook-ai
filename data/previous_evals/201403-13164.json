   "comments": [
    "The class was a bit different this year as the original professor had a family emergency and a different professor finished the course. The course became more heavy on the literature and was less on the movies. Overall, I thought the course did a good job of teaching how to do a close analysis of both text and film. The selection of readings were enjoyable, but a bit difficult at times when it is in old english.",
    "Medieval Lit in Movies is a cross between an English and Film Studies class. You read various Medieval texts and then watch movies\/tv shows that are based on them. You analyze the text and learn the history of them and compare them to the media you view in class. I would recommend this to a friend who has an interest in learning about these tales and wants an enjoyable class that s challenging, but not so overbearingly challenging like some other English and Film Studies classes.",
    "Absolutely yes-- if Professor Lawler is teaching, medieval texts will never be the same for you again-- even if you have read the Canterbury Tales twice or thrice already. If Professor Minnis is teaching, expect an interesting, low-stress class on the act of adaptation, over anything else.",
    "So bad- just really nothing interesting or rewarding about this class",
    "The purpose of this class was to look at society's perception of the medieval, by reading medieval literature and then watching film adaptions of them. Professor Lawler was an excellent lecturer, and he did a great job connecting details in the films to themes in the literature. The class is not too much work; there were only four or five works over the course of the semester, and three papers, all of reasonable length. I think this is the type of course that you get as much out of as you put in. I really enjoyed the material, so I put in a lot of time and learned a lot. However, you could definitely get by without doing much. I am really glad I put in the effort, because my writing improved a lot, and if you are interested in the material, I would definitely recommend the course.",
    "I would recommend this to students interested and kind of already well versed in medieval literature. It's totally doable with no background, but I bet you're more likely to enjoy it if you know\/like the subject.",
    "A study of a few classic medieval stories and some of their literary and film adaptations. I would only recommend this class to someone already interested in medieval literature. It is a lot more work than originally expected and moves at a relatively quick pace.",
    "Definitely recommended for a straightforward pre-1800--a lot of the movies are not great but the literature is obviously good. And even though a lot of the movies are pretty bad, that almost made it more entertaining in a way. Didn't know what to expect from this class but I definitely don't regret taking it!",
    "If you're an English major who wants to know about Medieval lit through movies, take this course. If you're a film major who needs a writing credit and who wants to learn about Medieval lit, take this course. Put as much time as you can into it, and you'll probably enjoy it. Things were a little weird because Professor Minnis had to leave mid-semester, but the TAs and Professor Lawler did an amazing job of keeping things cohesive. Great course.",
    "This class is a fun, solid introduction to medieval literature for people who've never read it, and to film criticism for people who've never studied it.",
    "An interesting course, though focuses more on the texts than the films. There's the option for creative final projects which is nice. Be aware that your experience will depend a lot on who your TA is since you'll be interacting primarily with them. You're expected to watch the movies outside of class too, which takes a while (though that might just be because I generally am able to do weekly readings in 2 hours, which appears to be average movie length.)",
    "I really liked the course overall. It made me enjoy medieval literature a lot more than I did in the past and changed how I looked at movies, including modern ones. I got a lot more out of the course than I had expected and feel that my writing improved with each paper.",
    "I took this class in order to get an \"easier\", introductory level humanities\/english credit. This was a fair class that has 3 major papers and weekly section. No required readings per se, but in order to do well on the papers you have to have seen the material before.",
    "No. It sounded great but was terrible."
