    "Survey course of the developments of technology from the 18th century until the 21st. Overall interesting, with a few boring holes. The readings can be kind of long and repetitive, but they're helpful to fill in the details since Prof. Kevles does an overview of the material during class. It's a decent amount of work but definitely not too much.",
    "There is a lot of interesting material, so be prepared to get swamped by ideas and events, this is a history class. However, it is an interesting take on history, through the assessment of science through time. I enjoyed learning about the history of science of technology, and found the material engaging, if not a little dull at times. There is a lot of assigned reading for section (which is mandatory), but the section discussions get very engaging and thorough.",
    "The course covers many areas of science that have contributed to inventions that shape the technological world in which we live. I would recommend this course to someone interested in both science and history.",
    "I would reccomend the course to a fellow student if they like history.",
    "fairly boring and a good amount of work. probably not worth taking",
    "Interesting class. Fair amount of reading but I enjoyed the lectures.",
    "Overall I would recommend it. Had a pretty good experience even though I am a science major and this was my first history-type class.",
    "Great class for Hist Science\/Med majors",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone who is interested in the history of science and technology. The course material is very interesting especially as you progress into the year. The only issue is that you have to force yourself to pay attention in lecture, but that is not much of an issue if you're excited about what you're learning."
