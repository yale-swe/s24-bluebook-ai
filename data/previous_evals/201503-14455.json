    "For a non-History, WGSS, AFAM, ERM kid (I think the majority of the class was filled with the most left-leaning kids possible at Yale), this was quite a change. This class is exactly like what you'd imagine it to be: everybody getting together and discussing how discrimination and race are prevalent in the US. If you're looking to learn about a subject manner that you're not familiar with and try something new, I suggest you run away and try something new in a different seminar. However, if you're one of the above-mentioned majors, it's a great class for you to get in a room with other people who think exactly the same way you do and talk about how society sucks.",
    "An absolutely amazing course. Can not understate how great professor Carico is or how much I enjoyed every class. Workload is not terrible, just a solid amount of reading, but is very worthwhile.",
    "An in depth look into the history of black America, through the places people occupy.",
    "Fabulous class which will get you to think deeply about the origins of systematic discrimination in the US. Lots of reading, but truly interesting and informative works. Take it!",
    "I definitely recommend the course. Do the reading!",
    "Yes take the class!!",
    "A great look at the evolution of plantations, prisons, and ghettos, and the links that have bound them through history. I would absolutely recommend this class to anyone interested in how the history of the US manifests itself in the present. Aaron Carico is incredible, and this class is certainly worth the competition to get in. Take this class if you want to be excited for class every day.",
    "Absolutely would recommend to another student. I would also recommend a smaller class size, perhaps 15-20."
