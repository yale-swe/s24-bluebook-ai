   "comments": [
    "The course is a mix of modern philosophy that traces the rationalists, empiricists, and ethical progressions of thought from Descartes up until something contemporary. This class makes you think about some really disturbing questions--so take it. It will be good for you.",
    "A course you should take, but it's a bit different from the other two DS courses. The material is much more conceptually based as opposed to stylistically, thematically or historically (for obvious reasons I suppose). But I honestly found it much harder than other courses",
    "I would recommend the course, though, like last semester of DS Philosophy, it is a lot of work. The period of reading Kant is particularly challenging.",
    "Second semester philosophy is more focused on issues and less on specific philosophers than first semester. Only one philosopher, Kant, will be given anything like the attention that was lavished on Plato and Aristotle during first semester. Additionally, since these works are closer to our modern viewpoint, they are both more comprehensible to read and more challenging to consider rigorously.Professor Elliott did a fantastic job of clarifying the writers' ideas without trivializing them. His section was an excellent balance of student debate and professorial guidance. If you have him, you are lucky.",
    "Yes, this class is truly wonderful and always fascinating. It is well worth the work and sweat hours. It expands your mind in invaluable ways that might never be expanded otherwise.",
    "go for it. its cool. stydu hard. love kant.",
    "DS Philosophy is a great way to learn the story of Western philosophy if you've never had a cohesive look at it before, and it's a much, MUCH better idea than the regular intro sequence, where the TAs will be grad students and your classmates will be more disinterested. You get to see seven or eight different practicing philosophers - professors - lecture you about their predecessors, and have one of those people lead you through it all for two, not one, section a week. If you're going to do DS, Philosophy is a great part of the whole experience."
