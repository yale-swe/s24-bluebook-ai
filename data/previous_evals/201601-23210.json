    "As this is required to graduate with a WGSS degree, there is very little recommending necessary to take this course. But rest assured that you'll get much closer to the other majors and to the DUS throughout this class (and that you will eventually finish your thesis).",
    "Some advice to all you WGSS majors: It will be okay. Try and plan\/structure early. Don't worry about quality at first, just get words on the page! You will finish. It's just a research paper, not your whole life. It's hard and really frustrating and intimidating at times. You are brilliant, and your work is important. Remember who you are doing it for, and why. WGSS is one of the hidden gems of Yale; you will be so so glad you did it when you are done. And then you may celebrate.",
    "If you're taking this class, it's because you're a WGSS major! Yay you! You've picked the best one. You can do it-- just make a writing schedule and stick to it!"
