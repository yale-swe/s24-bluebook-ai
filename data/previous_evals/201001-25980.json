    "Mediocre",
    "SO MUCH reading--about 3000 pages for this semester (although for the main ones, Don Quixote and War and Peace, you have breaks to do it). It's easy to feel rushed. However, the books are marvelous--Goethe, Wordsworth, and Tolstoy are now some of my favorite authors. Beecroft is a very amiable and able professor who can effectively lead discussions. For the papers, stick to a conservative thesis and bolster it with lots of textual evidence--that always got me an A. Recommended.",
    "Directed Studies Lit in the Spring semester is a wonderful course. The readings are classics and usually leave you wishing more time could have been spent on each text. Still, the course is worth taking as it gives you a strong foundation for future coursework in English, Literature and the Humanities. Prof. Beecroft leads an interesting section that allows for lots of student participation. I would recommend both DS Lit and Prof. Beecroft.",
    "Great overview of western canon of literature up through Eliot, covers both poetry and prose, definitely recommend it will expose you to a lot of different material.",
    "I liked this class, and Professor Beecroft had days when he was quite interesting, but there were also lackluster days. It was hard to be able to predict which days would be good and which would not. Professor Beecroft had a different student start each class, which sometimes got a bit tedious. But the curriculum is fantastic, and many of the lectures were, too.",
    "Moves very quickly and doesn't go in depth for the books. Big works like Don QUixote and War and Peace are only looked at in pieces since there isnt time to do the whole of the novel. Even in the selections from Petrarch and Wordsworth, lots of things are skipped over. The aim of spring semester DS Lit is breadth not depth.That said, it's still an awesome course. If you enjoy the reading yourself and don't expect total fulfillment from section you'll be ok."
