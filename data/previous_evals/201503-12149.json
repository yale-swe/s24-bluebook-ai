   "comments": [
    "Take this class! It's really fun, and interesting, and important, especially if you're interested in medicine\/public health\/policy. You learn a little bit about a lot of issues, and you learn a lot about frameworks and skills necessary to be effective in Global Health. I highly, highly recommend it.",
    "It is a wonderful class that is really helpful for anyone to take simply to get a greater understanding of the world we live in.",
    "A comprehensive introduction to the field of global health, from the burden of disease to health systems to the major actors in the field. It provides an overview of the most important areas of the field. I would highly recommend it to anyone interested in global health, medicine, development, or just who want to get a sense of the challenges facing our world today.",
    "Broad overview to global health and the issues in our world. At times it seemed a bit too general but that's the nature of the class...if you're looking for a more specific class maybe I wouldn't take this one. Workload isn't awful, but because there are so few assignments you have to really try hard on each one. Midterm was actually a lot harder than I expected it to be. Also, make sure you like Prof. Skolnik's teaching style (he cold calls on people) before taking the class",
    "I would recommedn HLTH 230, especially to someone who thinks they may be interested in global health and taking further courses later on!",
    "Take it if you want to get a comprehensive, and broad overview of the main issues surrounding global health. It's a highly engaging class that doesn't require too much work.",
    "I think understanding the basics of global health is essential to being a person with some understanding of the state of the world today. That is, it feels unethical to *not* learn about issues surrounding poverty and poor health in low-income countries. This class gives you a solid overview of issues like HIV\/AIDS, tuberculosis, maternal death, and similar issues from which most of us are insulated. It is a privilege to not have to think about infant death and access to clean water; we should learn about these things in spite of (because of?) this. That said, PLEASE take this class with a grain of salt. Professor Skolnik is brilliant and well-qualified (if arrogant), but he often perpetuates harmful narratives surrounding the developing world (e.g. that African leaders are incompetent and corrupt, that African nations are pitiful, etc.). Hear what Professor Skolnik has to say - he knows a lot - but also consider the ways in which his way of teaching is problematic. I feel like I took two courses with him this semester, both of which were valuable: 1) Global Health 101, and 2) how the way we present information can disempower (or empower) the people about whom we're talking. Take this course, but be critical of Professor Skolnik and of yourself throughout the semester.",
    "Essentially a must-take for anyone interested in health or development. As opposed to other public health classes at Yale, this course is very grounded in reality-- it focuses on things like cost effectiveness and feasibility. It also has a good balance between theory, health information, and case studies. Learning to write policy briefs is a great skill to have as well.",
    "I would recommend this class to a fellow student who is really interested in learning about the global burden of disease.",
    "A wonderful class that explains the concepts and implications of the major issues and successes of Global Health. Professor Skolnik is a joy to learn from. I would HIGHLY recommend this class to anyone interested in Global Health. You will definitely walk away with some lessons that will follow you for life.",
    "I was fooled in the beginning by all of his promises. He said we would practice public speaking but that never happened. Not life changing like many others have said it was. Really didn't enjoy his teaching style because he spent too much time talking about random stuff and how cool his life is and too much time on calling on people when he could have said the information in like 1\/3 the time he spends.",
    "It really is a unique course that mixes many different subjects and is a great introduction to the practical world of global health as it is today.",
    "Yeah it's important stuff to learn. But prepare yourself to be cold-called.",
    "Yes! I would definitely recommend this class to any student who wants to learn more about global health or is interested in breaking into the field!",
    "Learn about the burden of disease around the world, problem-solving approaches to the problems many people in the world face. If you think you might be interested in global health, this is a great intro course. You write health policy briefs and learn about a whole bunch of ways you can make the world a better place. Prof. Skolnik is essentially a very competent global health-er, instructor, mentor, and grandpa.",
    "I would definitely recommend HLTH 230 to other students. It is not an enormous workload, but you learn a ton of really important and practical information. Definitely worth taking if you are considering a career in a global health field.",
    "HLTH 230 is a great intro to global health. I came into the class with a piqued interest from a summer experience, but without much knowledge of what global health was. Through the course, I came to understand what it is and what has been done and what should be done in the future regarding the different diseases that exist in the world. Professor Skolnik teaches a framework for thinking about a problem: How bad is it? Who does it affect? Why? Why should we care? What should we do about it? Based on his World Bank experience, this course helped me understand how people at World Bank think about addressing different issues that they find themselves dealing with in low and middle income countries. Professor Skolnik is also very interested in helping his students, connecting them to internships with past World Bank contacts, etc. He is a great advocate to get to know and run by thoughts on what you want to do in the future.",
    "ill be honest, i wish i didn't take this course.",
    "HLTH 230 is a rudimentary class. I learned very little about global health in this class. I would not recommend this class to anyone who actually wants to learn about global health.",
    "I think it's a great course to take if you want to have an educated conversation with anyone about health issues around the world. It in no way makes you an expert in the field, but it allows you to have a really valuable understanding of the key issues. It also drastically improves writing in any course simply by teaching the importance of being concise This carried through into my other courses throughout the semester.",
    "A solid class for learning a holistic approach to global health. Would absolutely recommend.",
    "Not a great class, but not a ton of work. Lectures weren't very interesting and the textbook was dry. I wish the class involved reading more primary literature\/research on global health issues and interventions. I thought the class oversimplified a lot of topics and while social determinants of health were discussed as contributing factors to health issues, Professor Skolnik spent very little time addressing potential solutions to these social determinants and seemed dismissive of ideas or interventions that focused less on the short-term, clear-cut medical interventions and more on issues of structural violence. The policy briefs were fun and I think I learned a lot from my personal research for them. I do think they helped improve my writing. If you're looking for a great global health class, this isn't it. If you are looking for something to satisfy a social science requirement or something without a ton of work and you are more of a STEM person, this may fit the bill.",
    "A comprehensive catalog of the leading disease issues confronting communities in the developing world, as well as an exploration of the larger world's toolkit of solutions to meet those problems. Most importantly, the class provided some formal and informal opportunities to reflect personally on our responsibility to consider these issues, and to commit to their solving. The class comes highly recommended as one of the most formative class experiences I've had at Yale.",
    "I would not recommend this course. I was very excited to take this class and had pretty high hopes for it. Looking back at the semester, I feel like I really didn't learn a lot about global health and I did not enjoy the course. It is such an elemental introduction to global health that it almost seems more worthwhile to just find some good global health books instead of taking this class. Lecture was occasionally very interesting, but for the most part it seemed very repetitive and surface-level.",
    "TAKE THIS COURSE",
    "HLTH 230 was a great course. A lot of important material was covered and I would advise that any student planning to pursue a medical career or otherwise health-related field take this course.",
    "HLTH 230 was a good course in that it adequately gave an introduction to many of the topics central to global health. However, the first half of the semester is largely a cursory over view of many topics, and it almost feels as if you haven't learned anything before the midterm. I would suggest this course to students who are already sure of their interest in global health, especially freshmen and prospective global health fellows. For other students who'd like to dip their toe into global health, I'd suggest taking a different course that is less cursory and more holistic in its teaching methods.",
    "Very interesting and important material, one of the most entertaining classes I've taken thus far - Professor Skolnik is certainly unique. I would definitely recommend taking the class.",
    "Avoid this class, whether you're deeply interested in global health or not (I had a casual interest). The professor is incredibly arrogant, the material presented is a series of basic statistics masquerading as deep wisdom, and you'd get exactly the same information by reading a few sections of the textbook as going to class. The workload is very manageable, though the TFs are a very mixed bag, which can make sections and grading frustrating.",
    "I would not recommend this course. Despite having a deep understanding of principles, it is extremely difficult to get a good grade because of the rigidness of exams and grading on the policy briefs. I wish I had not taken this course.",
    "I'd recommend HLTH 230 to another student. It's a good intro class to global health. I think I spoiled my experience because I took Christakis' Health of the Public course before i took HLTH 230 so I came in knowing many things that Skolnik talks about, but I would definitely recommend taking this course. You learn a lot and you gain a deeper understanding of just how hard the global health crisis is.",
    "I would not recommend this course. I learned a lot about the burden of disease around the world, but nothing that a little bit of independent research could not have turned up. The lectures are disorganized and not appropriate for a lecture format. The workload is light, so if you are looking for an easy fifth class with an overview of global health issues, then go for it, but if you are expecting this to be one of your favorite courses, you will be disappointed.",
    "I would recommend it to people interested in global health, but I didn't find that the exams were representative of the information that we focused on in the course.",
    "HLTH 230 is a great overview of global health. For students seeking their first exposure to the field, this is the right class. The workload is not too bad, but the policy briefs have to be done well and the multiple choice exams do not leave much wiggle room for silly mistakes. Professor Skolnik cares deeply about his students and is always willing to mentor people. I never had a professor who invests so much in the class! Take it if you can!",
    "HLTH 230 was a good introduction to global health course. In this course, we covered a lot of material ranging from children's health to neglected tropical diseases. In this way, the course provided a good overview for a variety of topics in global health. If you have never taken a global health course, I would suggest this class. However if you have already taken an introductory global health class then I would let you know that much of the material is the same, so you may not get as much out of it as others. Though, I thought the three policy brief papers were interesting and useful assignments, which made the class worth it. This taught me how to think and write in a new way."
