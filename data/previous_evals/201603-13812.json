    "Not only did we learn lyric writing and dramatic architecture by one of the best lyricists in the business, but also we learned about the business of theatre making. It's a refreshing practical class.",
    "This class begins by covering the nitty gritty and semantics (rhyming and scansion and things) but quickly moves on to more macro-level stuff about how to craft a large work of musical theater. If you're looking for a songwriting workshop, this class won't always meet your needs. If you want to learn how to write and structure a show, this is a great place to start.",

    "More assignments should be given to increase our familiarity with lyrics writing and our repertoire of lyrics. All the guest speakers were wonderful additions to the already very interesting class."

    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. Michael Korie is a great teacher, and the assignments are fun, creative, and interesting. I loved working on my songs every week, and will miss having this fun creative outlet.",
    "Take this class if you want to write better songs that fit better together!",
    "Yes. I would strongly recommend this class to students who are interested to learn and develop their craft in lyrics writing."
