   "comments": [
    "An incredible course unlike any other at yale. I highly recommend it, especially if you are a behavioral neuroscience major. I learned things one could never learn in a normal classroom setting.",
    "Great hand-ons experience for anyone interested in neuroscience. The dissection of the brain and the use of live animals was very informative and interesting. It's a life changing class if you plan on going into the neuroscience, especially research.",
    "Yes. Great experience in the labs and not too too much work.",
    "I would totally recommend this class. I was scared to work with animals at first but everyone helped me out. You really learn a lot in this course. We write our lab report as if we're writing for journals and though it's challenging, it's been a great experience.",
    "Yes if you want to pursue Neuroscience.",
    "Yes",
    "Definitely take it if you can, if you want to do neuro research",
    "Good course for those interested in this type of research. It was very well-organized, and Professor Frick is great and knows exactly how to teach the course. The papers are quite a bit of work, and somewhat of a pain to write, so starting early on them is highly suggested.",
    "Yes I would recommend it because it is fun, hands-on course that helps you to prepare for research and allows you to know how to write proper research papers."
