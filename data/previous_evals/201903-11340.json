    "I learned a ton about the HIV\/AIDS epidemic that I never knew.",
    "This course taught me so much about the intricacies of the HIV\/AIDS epidemic both in the United States and globally. Prof. Bazell does a great job of covering a lot of material really thoroughly.",
    "I thought the course was very interesting and in-depth following AIDS throughout it's history and through all different angles and perspectives: scientific, political, and social. I really enjoyed learning about it through the years, watching the disease develop in time and watching it shift in form and in who it affected the most. There was emphasis placed on how the newer generation seems to be oblivious to the threat that HIV \/AIDS poses to us, and that for me, was priceless to learn about how HIV and AIDS could and will affect my life and those around in me in my own lifetime. From an academic perspective I learned a lot about evaluating scientific studies and papers and have learned to understand the lingo and not get lost in the complicated words.",
    "I gained a lot knowledge just from his background and his experiences in the field. I learn to analyze scientific papers and piece together the history and political actions brought by HIV\/AIDs.",
    "I really learned in-depth about both the history of HIV\/AIDS and how the disease impacts us right now (which is super fascinating!) HIV incidence rates arent as low as wed like to believe, and theres a lot to be learned about it. This class was genuinely very interesting, and really reshaped my own perspective on the disease.",
    "Knowledge of the history of HIV\/AIDS, including its political and social impact. We also covered the epidemiology of the disease. It was a broad perspective on every part of the epidemic, including everywhere it affected.",
    "So grateful for this course! By focusing on a single epidemic, we learned about the interconnected nature of global health and social equity; I would 100% recommend this class to anyone interested in either. HIV\/AIDS has a fascinating history of activism, which was sometimes at odds with political and scientific leadership. As for skills, we learned how to read a scientific paper efficiently and still retain the material. The course is 90% politics and 10% science, if that's what you're looking for!",
    "I learned a lot about the political context behind the HIV\/AIDS epidemic.",
    "By the end of this course, I was able to get the main points of a lengthy scientific article in minutes, which will definitely be useful if I continue to pursue science. I also learned so much about the HIV crisis, American culture, and how politics and health are intertwined. It definitely changed the way I view health and healthcare, which is really valuable.",
    "I learned a lot about public health and social justice.",
    "I learned how to apply my previous research and biology skills in the realm of public health."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths: interesting material, small class size so you get to know your classmates well, lots of group work Weaknesses: class activities were not very engaging, I didn't like that Professor Bazell would spend all of class going through our lists of questions on the reading and asking us to answer our own question, the quizzes were way too hard and he barely curved them even though everyone got very low grades, the quizzes didn't facilitate any learning more engaging class activities, more speakers",
    "Strengths: I thought the way class discussions were structured allowed for lots of participation, the information we learned was genuinely interesting, and Prof. Bazell is really knowledgeable. Weaknesses: I thought there could have been a bit more structure because it sometimes felt like we were just having a discussion for an hour and fifteen minutes which is totally fine, except I was unsure of what we would be tested on a lot of the time. I also thought the quizzes were unnecessarily specific and pretty tricky.",
    "I though the strengths included the material learned outside class and seeing how everything was intertwined. The only thing that could be improved was having more direction on discussions in class. I liked how it was a section and that gave us the ability to speak however somedays there was little clarity or direction besides the questions we had individually asked in class and somedays I thought the class time could have used a little more clarity.",
    "The strengths of this course are in its interesting material (and theres a lot of it!) Professor Bazell did an excellent job organizing material from a wide array of sources (theres stuff about the origins of HIV, the epidemic in the US during the 80s, its coinfection with other diseases, pharmaceuticals, the whole shebang). Theres so much to cover, but I think that the course did very well at providing an in-depth understanding of those topics. The weaknesses of this course are mainly tied to its structure, which really fails to motivate people. I was really interested in the course material, but even I had lapses where I just failed to do the work (primarily readings to prepare for in-class discussions). What ends up happening is that every class you have assigned readings, you write a discussion topic\/question for the class, and once you get to class, its Professor Bazell info-dumping on you when its your topic being addressed, and then theres very little other engagement. Its great for learning passively, but I failed to feel motivated. I think the quiz questions also had issues in that sometimes Professor Bazells understanding of the material is different than how we understood the way he taught it, so everyone would get it wrong.",
    "Really good structure and teaching. Important topic. Sometimes discussions could've been more clearly structured.",
    "The quiz questions should be less specific.",
    "Prof. Bazell is excellent! He is uniquely qualified to teach this class as the former chief science correspondent for NBC news; we frequently watched clips of his reporting on the HIV\/AIDS epidemic and analyzed it within its historical context. (He also knows Larry Kramer, but he might not mention it unless you ask!) I think the class tends to draw students who are passionate about social equity, which makes for great discussions. There is also a good mix of history and addressing current\/future challenges. I like the discussion-style nature of this class. It's fun and engaging, but very low-stress, and if a question arises that the class can't answer, Prof. Bazell probably can. Sometimes, he divides the class into groups, which develop brief presentations to answer students' questions. There are many readings per class, and you'll sometimes be assigned a film to watch over the weekend, but you won't mind putting in the time if the material interests you. The only difficulty is the quizzes: they're open-note, open-Internet, multiple-choice assessments on details from all the readings. Prof. Bazell knows the quizzes are hard, and he might even give you some points back if you make a case for certain questions. What I found helpful (take notes, kids!) was creating an index of the readings and their topics; during the quizzes, I could refer to this document and I'd know where to look for answers.",
    "Strengths - Professor Bazell had really great insights from his time in the field, the readings were fascinating, many good guest speakers, the class was pretty straightforward if you put in the effort. Weaknesses - test questions were sometimes unclear, it was easy to fall behind on readings because you were formally tested on them infrequently (obviously it's still the student's responsibility to keep up with readings, though, but just something to keep in mind.) If nobody had done the readings the discussion was pretty sparse. I would have liked to learn more about the \"science\" of HIV\/AIDS, as this was touched on in only a few readings. I would also like to have a more formal and transparent grading system, as I felt I was mostly in the dark about my grade until the end of the semester.",
    "A definite strength of the course is simply the topic and material. It's impossible to be uninterested or unmoved by the discussions we have in class and the material we're assigned to read or watch. Another major strength is Dr Bazell, who is so amazingly knowledgable and witnessed so many of the events we discuss firsthand in a way that few people did. I think a weakness is that there is never really a lesson plan, which means that even if something was a central topic in the readings or documentaries, we may not get to it in class. A lot of really interesting topics go undiscussed, which is sometimes disappointing. I found the class discussions really enriching, but I also found Dr Bazell's input really valuable, and I wish there was a more even split between the two. Better organization of the class\/ a Bette class structure might help with this. \\",
    "It was strong in that it had a variety of material, from scientific to historic to anthropological, that kept the information refreshing. The course was weak in that class time was not used efficiently and felt unstructured.",
    "Strengths: Discussion based and engaging Weaknesses: Lacks structure and feedback is sometimes unclear"

   "comments": [
    "I would recommend it if they need a science credit that's easy but don't mind that the class is kind of boring. Also, they should be prepared to receive very low grades on the quizzes.",
    "Of course, Prof. Bazell is great and the course is incredibly interesting.",
    "I would recommend it! I thought it was well worth the effort and it gave you a greater understanding of a disease that deserves more attention and was an extremely interesting course. There was a lot to learn in the public health direction as well and I found interesting to see how singlehandedly a disease has completely shaped public health.",
    "Yes! I really enjoyed the material, and Professor Bazell has a really unique perspective on everything, being an NBC correspondent covering the epidemic as it was happening. It really reshaped my own understanding of something so personally impactful (as a gay man coming from the conservative parts of the US, where there is huge associated stigma between queerness and HIV\/AIDS). I wish there was more time to learn more; theres so much more to go in-depth into, but Im also satisfied with what I have.",
    "Yes! Covers a very important topic from a variety of lenses; is a great way to understand the politics of an epidemic and enhance your understanding of AIDS art and history.",
    "Yes it was fun.",
    "Absolutely! I loved this course and would highly recommend it to anyone interested in how global health intersects with race, gender, sexuality, geography, class, status as a sex worker, and so on. Great for: - Folks interested in global health - Anyone looking for an easy science credit - Non-STEM students looking for a social sciences-y science credit - Anyone interested in social equity\/inequity",
    "I would recommend this course to another student, granted they had the discipline not to fall behind on the readings (!!!) and were comfortable writing relatively long papers.",
    "I would recommend this only if you are really going to dedicate yourself to doing all of the (many) readings, keeping in mind that a vast majority of them are scientific. They're often interesting, but sometimes they're difficult to get through. If you don't do the readings regularly, you'll be lost in class, and you will get very little out of the class. Most of the knowledge I gained from this class came from the readings, so not doing them means you'll likely gain very little.",
    "Only if they are interested in social justice. The majority of the content in this course was centered upon HIV in marginalized groups.",
    "I would. It is a great way to get a science credit if you arent stem heavy and youre interested in the intersection between policy and disease."
