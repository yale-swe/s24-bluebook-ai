   "comments": [
    "A very intense class that requires a lot of dedication. There's a lot of work inside and outside of the class, but it is totally worth it since you're able to improve and practice your French so much. Skorupa is also one of the best professors out there: she cares so much about how her students are doing and really tries to make her lessons engaging and enjoyable. She'll even host dinners at her house. The class material was also very interesting, learning about different topics in the French and Francophone culture. I thought the class was a lot of work, but totally worth it in the end. There's a great connection that you build with the other students and professor from all of the time you spend with each other. Additionally, you will improve so much.",
    "Intense but wonderful course. Mme Skorupa is a fantastic, warm, invested, and demanding professor. The course curriculum is great, although sometimes it felt like extra work was crammed into an already really demanding schedule (which it seemed like everyone, even Mme Skorupa, occasionally had trouble keeping up with). But the proof is in the pudding: my French improved by leaps and bounds.",
    "This has been my favorite course at Yale. It does require hours of homework daily and class itself is rather long, but I do think it is worth it. Not only did it help my french skills, but I met my favorite professor at Yale. If Mme. Skorupa keeps teaching this course, take it!!",
    "DON'T TAKE THIS CLASS IF SKORUPA ISN'T TEACHING IT. I honestly don't think it's worth it - it's too much work. However, if she's teaching it it she will make it worth it. The only reason I stuck with the class was to finish my language requirement so I wouldn't have to keep taking language classes because I don't like them. So honestly this wasn't the class for me - it was an overwhelming amount of work and I also really didn't like most of the of the work. That said, I am SO SO SO SO glad to be done - so in a way I guess it is worth it. If you are someone who absolutely loves French and won't be bothered by an insane amount of inefficient busy work, than you'll definitely get a lot out of it and it will be worth it because you're french will improve so much. I will say though, if you're on the fence I'd avoid it. Also, it will be much easer to do well grade-wise if you take L3 and L4 separately.",
    "Over 10 hours in the classroom a week and 3-4 hours of homework each night. It definitely helped me improve my French, but the amount of time and effort basically takes over your life.",
    "I highly recommend this class, but only to students who are devoted to French and really have a passion for it. The class is a ton of work, but incredibly rewarding to those who put in their best effort. My French has improved so much this semester thanks to Madame Skorupa and this class. However, if you are not invested in doing the work it will be almost impossible to stay caught up with the pace of the course."
