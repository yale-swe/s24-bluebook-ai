    "Overview of current theories of womanism, feminism, queer, black feminist, feminism of color,, etc. theories. Reflections on the application and value of theory.",
    "Fundamental theories that are essential in understanding women's\/gender\/sexuality studies profoundly.",
    "Further understanding of feminist and queer theories. Greater insight on the national security state, immigration law, and bodies and performance. Facilitating class discussions",
    "I developed knowledge on intersectional feminist and queer theories. I learned a lot about the historical social positioning of women and queer people; the tactics used to keep them from full citizenship; and various strategies employed by women and queer people to survive, construct identities, and build a life either within or outside of mainstream society. I learned how to think critically about pathways to liberation and visions of how liberation will look in the future.",
    "I feel like I didnt gain nearly enough from this course as it was not designed as the introductory class it was tagged as, and I didnt already have the skills for an upper level study of feminist and queer theory yet.",
    "I learned a bunch about fem and queer theory- it was my first foray into these fields so I learned a ton.",
    "I learned the transitional feminist tradition of thought from different thematic perspectives. It was very rich and inspiring."

   "comments": [
    "Strenghts: Breadth of readings, opportunity to lead class discussion, versatility of the discussion style based on the student leader Weakness: Number and depths of the readings made it challenging to present and discuss everything. Partially adjusted with moving some readings to the recommended section. How could it be improved: First on second classes as a lecture style of feminist\/queer history to ensure that students will have a simulat baseline to work from.",
    "Strengths - opportunity for conversational engagement in the readings Weaknesses - meeting once a week makes it difficult to cover all material in full depth",
    "I did participate during class discussions, but possibly speaking up more.",
    "A strength of this course was how intersectional it was and how it asked its students to think critically about race, class, and disabilities, etc., as well as gender and sexuality. The roundtable discussion was always interesting, as there were various perspectives, experiences, and ideas that were heard every class. It seemed that there was too many pieces of required reading, even though Dr. Savci cut down on the original amount required. The discussion hardly ever got passed 3 readings for each session, but it was difficult to know which 3 pieces would be discussed. This either meant having to prioritize a certain number of readings not knowing which ones were going to be most important for class, or it meant putting other classes to the side in order to get through the entirety of the readings.",
    "The readings were interesting but often very difficult for a first time reader and in conjunction with the number of other chapters and articles assigned, it usually wasnt possible to fully engage with everything. I also dont think we really benefitted at all from having every session being student lead. Especially considering that many of the students were not WGSS students and that we all seemed to be struggling with the material, I believe we could have learned more with stronger instruction from the professor.",
    "The course was not designed for beginners, which I wasn't aware of before I took it. I think it was really good in terms of discussion but it wasn't super structured and I was rarely certain what the professor wanted us to walk away with.",
    "I think the syllabi was a strength. No weaknesses, but the challenge of a diverse classroom."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this course for students who have a previous background in Gender Studies. There was an initial expectation that students would be familiar with some literature in the field, which was not the case for all of the class and made the course heavier. Make sure that you have time available to dedicate to the heavy load of reading. It may be necessary to do a reading a couple of times, because the theory can be very dense.",
    "Yes, especially if the student background is not in WGSS.",
    "Yes, for those who are interested in looking at issues such as law, immigration, globalization, and neoliberalism from a feminist and queer theorectical lens",
    "Yes, I feel that it is a valuable class and I learned a lot that I will carry with me into future work.",
    "No. I believe this course could do with a serious restructuring before I could recommend it to a peer.",
    "I would not recommend it to somebody who does not already have a background in theory. But for somebody who is acquainted with theory and wants to expand that, I would definitely recommend it.",
    "Yes. It is well planned, well executed and offers a rationale, an order for addressing WGSS & Queer studies."
