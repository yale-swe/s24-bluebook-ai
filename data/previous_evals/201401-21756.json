    "I would definitely recommend this class - you learn a lot about filming as well as video art and you have fun while doing it!",
    "This is definitely more of an ART video class rather than a NARRATIVE film class, so make sure that you understand the distinction before taking the course. That being said, there is something to gain from an art world perspective on film, although I struggled to find intrinsic merit in some of the videos\/artwork pieces that were shown in class. Guest lecturers were very interesting, as was a workshop on green screen. Wish there had been more focus on practical skills, such as shooting, lighting, construction of a visually-pleasing image, etc.",
    "It's a creative process",
    "Amazing course, technically and conceptually you'll gain a lot if you put in the work and engage intimately and consistently with Sarah - which is so, so worthwhile.",
    "Absolutely! 110% yes! AND TAKE IT WITH SARAH LASLEY. Easily one of the best, most exciting, innovative, insightful and incredible professors I've had at Yale.",
    "Big time commitment when it comes to shooting and editing your pieces, not a lot of daily assignments which allows you to pace your work well.",
    "A really fantastic intro course where you will acquire a variety of skills and watch some very bizarre\/eccentric art films.",
    "Take the class if you want to learn some video basics and walk away with a knowledge of film arts"
