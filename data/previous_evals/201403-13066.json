   "comments": [
    "The first half of this class was great and the second half was pretty tough to sit through. Prof Shapiro is great but the student presentations were torture.",
    "If you care about making a difference in the world, this course can help frame how you think the best change can be made. It's an interesting course, even when the readings can get a little too mathematical and tedious.",
    "Very interesting class with a very laid-back professor. No papers--two psets, midterm, presentation, and final exam. Psets were tough but otherwise not too much work. Unclear exactly how our grade will be calculated (which was somewhat stressful), but otherwise I really enjoyed the class.",
    "first half- learn a lot of concepts about trade and public economics. second half- read lots of papers",
    "I would recommend ECON 412 to students that enjoy learning about trade and the environment and who want to understand how to read an economics paper found in an academic journal.",
    "If you're interested in environmental economics and its real world applications, definitely take this class. Limited material on trade theory. Overall, an enjoyable class.",
    "I would recommend this class. It is pretty manageable and you learn a lot about the policy implications and academic research around environmental and international economics. However, beware of the student presentations that take over the class in the second half. I hope this part of the class is modified so that it isn't as boring.",
    "I enjoyed this class, but it wasn't everything I was expecting. It was much more economics than environmental studies, and there was sort of a lot of mismatched material, but overall I feel like I learned a lot about reading economic papers, which is a really important skill.",
    "Take it if you like the environment or international economics. The class was interesting and not too strenuous. You come out of it with the ability to read and evaluate journal articles, which is useful. Professor Shapiro's lectures are great, but that's only the first half of the class. Decide whether or not you are interested in listening to your peers give presentations, because that ends up dominating the second half of the class. Overall a strong course and a good way to fulfill the senior requirement.",
    "This course starts as an overview of the major ideas in environmental economics and international trade theory, then for the second half of the course you read empirical papers that are evaluating whether those theories are true. I thought the material was very interesting and presented clearly. The class presentation format allowed students to engage deeply with a topic that used immense data and state of the art complex modeling techniques, which would not have been possible if there was a class paper instead. I came away from this course with a more honed understanding of how to interpret econometric analyses, and a much better understanding of the major concepts and frontiers of environmental economics. Econometrics is listed as a prerequisite for this course, and that is not to be ignored. You should have taken at least Econometrics and Data Analysis I, and it would not be wise to try to just take them concurrently, as you'll start to need what you learn at the end of Econometrics at the beginning of this course. Professor Shapiro was very well prepared for class and presented ideas clearly. He seems to have a dry sense of humor. Some of the students in the class were taking the course as an econ major requirement to get out of the way, and others seemed more inherently interested in the subject. The ones who were inherently interested seemed to get a lot more out of it (surprise) while the ones just taking it weren't as enthused. >> So this might not be the most interesting course to take as a random topic to explore, but is great if you're into the environment.",
    "Econ 412 is a great class where you will learn how to read and analyze economics papers, which are skills that will serve you very well in any other economics or academic context. The class will also help you learn how to discern articles and studies in news that are well-done from those that have poor evidence to back them up. The class consists of two problems sets leading up to a midterm, and then a paper presentation (about 25 minutes) and weekly reading responses after the midterm, and then a final. The workload and reading are totally manageable, Professor Shapiro is great, and the class is rewarding. Take it!",
    "Good class. Very good structure. Theory first half. Reading papers in the second half and presenting a paper.",
    "Excellent course",
    "As a senior in econ who is interested in environmental issues, I thought this would be the perfect class. I definitely could have found an easier and more rewarding senior seminar. Although this class is pretty unique in that you are actually reading research papers rather than just talking about theory, I felt like disengaged from the class because it was too large; it wasn't really a \"seminar\" feel. There lacked actual discussion; the first half of the course was just lectures and problem sets, the second half of the course were individual student presentations. The second half got real boring real quick; sometimes I skipped class because it was just too boring. Also, Professor Shapiro is a hard grader (although he is knowledgeable and is doing cool research). I would say, don't take this class if you can't bother to care about it.",
    "Yes take the class. It is especially good after taking International Econ and learning more theory before coming to this class that is empirics heavy."
