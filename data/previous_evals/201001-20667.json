   "comments": [
    "Ritual in Asia is not a survey course about different practices which fall under the category of \"ritual\"; rather, the required reading for the class constitutes a variety of short readings from a variety of scholars about the category and nature of ritual as understood primarily in anthropology and religious studies. However, students are still exposed to a wide variety of Asian rituals from in-class presentations students give on their semester-long research project, which constitutes roughly half of the required work for the course. Although sometimes the class lacked a clear overarching narrative, on the whole I would have to recommend this course to any student who's interested in the category of \"ritual\" -- either scholastically or philosophically -- or students of Asian religions in generally. And Koichi's just a great professor, too!",
    "I would characterize it as a good overview of ritual studies in general, with about half of the class focusing more on asian rituals. I felt it was a very good balance.",
    "I think it's an important class to take. We covered a lot of reading that is both challenging and important for religious studies students to encounter in a formal setting. It's also one of only a few classes that I've had that sought to give students the tools to work on their research outside of the class itself."

   "comments": [
    "Although not a graduate student, I felt as if this course was useful in that it exposed to the hidden side of religious studies scholarship: the kind that requires a lot of work and thinking to make sense of what be incredibly messy issues.",
    "It provided me with a lot of good background material upon which to construct an approach to any further research projects I might work on. I think it was important for me to get a better understanding of how to produce good scholarship, and this class gave me a great chance to do that.",
    "Approaching theoretical materials on ritual in this seminar helped me to understand them more fully and apply them more skillfully than I could ever had if I tried to read these books on my own. And the critical thinking required by the weekly reading responses, class discussions, and final paper is sure to evolve my research and dissertation work. Not only do I hope to expand the project I worked on for my final paper, but I also am inspired to employ the theoretical techniques unveiled by this course in my dissertation."
