    "My chinese vocabulary increased tremendously. It took a while, but my confidence in speaking increased as well towards the end of the semester. My written chinese improved as well.",
    "Learned a lot about chinese culture and lots of vocabulary",
    "Lots of vocab and grammar",
    "I definitely improved my Chinese language skills while talking this class. There was a lot of work on a day to day basis, with daily quizzes, but I think it was worth it in the end to see how far my vocabulary, sentence structure, and understanding of the language improved.",
    "I learned many new phrases, sentence structures, and characters in Chinese.",
    "I learned to read and write better.",
    "CHNS 152 taught me more accurate grammatical sentence structures while also talking about chinese American culture. It helped me know more than kitchen chinese",
    "I gained knowledge of more formal Chinese speaking and writing skills. I learned not only about technical terms relating to specific subjects (e.g. politics, film), but also poetic idioms.",
    "Chinese grammar and idioms, sentence structure, lots of important stuff",
    "Learned a bit of new vocab, but specific to certain topics\/situations, and a lot of the words\/grammar structures were not used in conversational or daily life. I do understand that we are learning more advanced language, e.g for books\/newspapers, but I feel like I still don't have a strong foundational or conversational base and that I can't use what I learned if I actually go to China.",
    "I learned more vocab terms and gained a little bit more understanding of Chinese culture (idioms, food, holidays).",
    "Lots of chinese essay writing practice with a focus on use of sentence structures. A lot of relevant vocabulary useful for everyday conversation",
    "Knowledge of written and spoken Chinese, cultural traditions, and customs at an advanced level.",
    "I learned Chinese at a much deeper level in a very active classroom. By learning Chinese in a very specified manner, I was able to quickly improve my listening, reading and speaking skills. I also got a glimpse into Chinese culture through the lessons we went through. Through class discussions, I better understood the role of my ethnic group in the United States, which made learning Chinese very relevant."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths - my Chinese teacher was amazing at keeping us engaged even when we were tired. The class is organized and you always know what to expect. Weakness - in terms of speaking in class, the student really has to put in the effort",
    "Strengths: words and grammatical structures are well-explained, professor is very engaging Weaknesses: course material could have been more interesting! It was very informative and I learned a lot, but I couldn't help but envy the lower level chinese course material :). I also think that the reading comprehension parts of the exams were often very unclear",
    "There are many strengths in this course. It provided a comfortable environment for me to practice Chinese. I would have appreciated it more if we covered more grammar. Perhaps because I took a native speaking class, but for some of the phrases and words covered, I was expected to know the answers by ear.",
    "S: Professors are super cool and create really intimate learning environments W: we had too many students in our section so our class would rotate professors which felt kind of unorganized, also odee work",
    "Strengths: you learn chinese, advanced characters. The teacher is really great and caring and warm. Weaknesses: Definitely the curriculum\/textbook. Honestly, in one semester I did not learn that much. I could probably teach it to myself or learn those characters in 3 weeks. And a lot of the idioms\/phrases we learned, while recognizable in China, is not often used in conversation.",
    "I feel as if the textbook could be laid out in a way more conducive to studying. A lot of the important notes and concepts that we had to differentiate were not included in the textbook. Furthermore, a lot of the subtle differences were simply explained as \"it just sounds better\". I don't truly know if I learned the connotations of each word and when to use what.",
    "Some classes can be really packed, and I feel like for a discussion oriented class (where you are expected to exercise the vocabulary and sentence structures that are taught in class), a smaller ( 15) sized class would give each student a better sense of intimacy in the class and more opportunity and confidence to participate. I do like how everything we learn is very detailedly covered (going over lots of examples and how they differ from similar vocab we learned earlier), which helps us really get a nuanced understanding of the language. I like the new system of 4 essays out of 5, instead of having to do all of them since conflicts with other classes can make it difficult. I do wish we had a little more time to revise essays though, a weekend isn't always enough, especially when we have big tests in other classes.",
    "Strengths: Instructor is very well-organized, discussions are very entertaining and educational, a lot of material presented Weaknesses: Course load can be a bit heavy at times",
    "I wished the instructions were more clear and that our instructor would remind students of upcoming assignments and due dates. There were times when assignments wouldn't be mentioned in class and would only be online. I wished that the instructor could at least mention and clarify the assignment. On the otherhand, my instructor was very responsive to emails and eagerly helped to settle any confusion I had about the work."

    "Yes! It's a fun class and you learn a lot.",
    "Yes, definitely! It was a great way to finally stop being illiterate, and I had a lot of fun along the way too. It's also great that it doesn't meet every day.",
    "Good for students who want to learn vocab",
    "Yes, I would recommend this class to another student. I believe the Chinese department at Yale in general is very outstanding.",
    "Yes. Heritage speakers will learn more proper ways to say things.",
    "If youre taking it with the intent to deepen your understanding of the chinese language yes. If youre just doing it for the language credit prob not, theres a lot of work",
    "Yes! You will learn so much in L5. Chinese seminars also encourage interactions with other students, so you'll make lots of new friends :) The workload really isn't all that bad, and Wang Laoshi is always available for help.",
    "100% if you want to improve your chinese and get to know the chinese department",
    "Hmm. From a pragmatic perspective: If you truly, really want to learn Chinese for conversation\/daily life, you're better off learning it by yourself (esp if you are heritage and your parents speak it). If you want to do business in China, then I do suggest doing this only as a prereq to go into the more advanced language classes (e.g. Business Chinese), as you will learn words\/phrases that are useful that you may not learn on your own. If you need it for a language req or to get Light, then yes. All the chinese professors are so great and warm and caring, I have nothing but positive things to say about them!! They are almost like maternal\/paternal figures. My only issue is with the curriculum.",
    "Heads-up: I placed into this class directly, so I have no idea how this class fits into the rest of the chinese sequence. My perspective is going to be mostly a comparison between this class and my previous experiences of chinese class in high school and before. For one this class helped improve my chinese immensely. I would say to give it a shot, especially if you've only taken chinese in high school - chinese here is a totally different experience. The material is gonna be a bit more difficult compared to high school, but the passages are much more relevant to college students and what they want to express as well as more interesting in terms of our identity as young american-born chinese students. I had (professor wang) and even though it was an early morning class, she tried her best to make it lively and crack jokes with the class to make it interactive. If you place into this class, don't worry about it being too difficult, the placement exam imo is an accurate measurement of your skill relative to the classes here. You'll meet a lot of other students who will have surprisingly similar backgrounds to you. Definitely shop it!",
    "Yes, I would recommend the course to the student who is passionate about learning Chinese at an advanced level and would like to study abroad.",
    "I would recommend this course to a student who wants to learn Chinese at a more advanced level."
