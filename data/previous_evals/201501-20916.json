   "comments": [
    "Behavioral Finance is an introduction to the academic work in the field. It begins with a survey of \"anomalies\" in finance, and then discusses what Nick calls the \"building blocks\" of behavioral finance - the literature on the limits to arbitrage and insights from psychology. The heart of the course is the discussion of the theoretical and empirical papers that apply these building blocks to the anomalies. I would highly recommend the course to anyone interested in deepening their understanding of financial economics.",
    "highly recommended",
    "Excellent course to learn behavioral finance and also finance in general. You can get vast and organized knowledge on the field and get into intriguing discussion in class.",
    "This is hands down my favorite class at Yale. I've taken quite a few SOM\/Econ courses during my 4 years, and none match the teaching quality or meticulous structure of Econ 672. Behavioral finance is a comprehensive survey of the entire field. The course is structured very carefully so as to naturally motivate various applications in finance. Nick Barberis teaches the course by psychology, so he illustrates different types of behavioral biases and how they apply to different facets in finance (e.g. equity premium puzzle, non-participation in stock markets, closed-end fund puzzle, home bias, etc). There is a significant coverage on work done by Kahneman and Tversky (Prospect Theory!), but this is mostly because their research on judgment and decision making has piqued the interest of many behavioral economists. Yet, despite over two decades of intense research, behavioral finance is still an emerging field. There has been little progress on macroeconomic models or unifying theories, which makes the topic especially interesting. Note that this class is taught as a SURVEY. This means that Nick does not delve deeply into the mathematical rigor behind each paper. Instead, he summarizes the main points and ties the work to a broader theme. So Econ 672 is a misnomer in that much less emphasis is placed on the model derivation; rather, the focus is primarily on tying human psyches to financial applications. That being said, the readings extensively cover these finer points (e.g. model formation, assumptions, and limitations). If you are interested in the progress that researchers like Nick have made in behavioral finance, this class is a must-take. We had a special guest speaker this year: Larry Hilibrand. For the uninitiated, he was a co-founder of Long Term Capital Management and, later, JWM Partners. He gave an insider look at LTCM's strategies and thoughts leading up to the 1998 Russian Ruble Crisis. This was a fantastic surprise and illuminating talk, which by itself made the class worth taking. ECON 672 is particularly relevant to anyone interested in working on the buy-side or thinking about getting a PhD. Nick discusses many issues that rational economists face and how behavioral heuristics are able to explain most of these inconsistencies. For buy-side investors, this class sheds light on mistakes that practitioners make when creating arbitrage scenarios. Don't be daunted by the lack of reviews on YBB. Few people notice this gem simply because of this, and it is quite unfortunate that so many AppMath, Economics, and PoliSci majors are missing out on arguably the best Econ course at Yale. The workload is what you make of it. There are a total of 3 psets, 2 of which can be done in groups of three. They are intentionally constructed to gently walk a student through the research process. The first pset had students extend an existing empirical study to a different dataset. The second pset had students derive results from a simplified behavioral finance model. The last pset had students referee an existing paper Nick requires several behavioral finance academic readings each week. Do the readings! Not all undergrads follow this advice, and although you could technically get away without doing any of the readings, you wouldn't get nearly as much out of the class. I have a MUCH clearer grasp of the entire behavioral finance field just from taking this course. It really is worth it.",
    "A must.",
    "MGMT 745 is a comprehensive overview of behavioral finance. The rational school of thought is well articulated and presented alongside behavioral ideas and treated objectively. I would highly recommend MGMT 745 to all students.",
    "I would recommend to anyone interested in behavioral finance or economics. Also appropriate for undergraduates with little economics background looking to get a taste of the field.",
    "Certainly recommend to other PhD students interested in research in Behavioral Finance, for it gives a nice overview of not only BF itself but also its relation to the asset pricing literature in general.",
    "If you've taken financial theory and are aware of basic financial instruments: yes. If you've invested before (or worked in that area): yes.",
    "Econ 672 gives a good summary and working knowledge for the behavioral finance. If you want to specialize in behavioral finance or related fields, it is a must take. Nick lays out a platform for the students to understand what has been down and what needs to be done. I would very much recommend it, and I believe that everyone will learn a lot from it.",
    "I definitely would recommend Behavioral Finance to fellow students as it is a great course with reasonable width and depth, even to those students who don't intend to work in this area.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student. The material is extremely interesting and Prof. Barberis is a great lecturer. The material is advanced, so you feel as if you're learning a lot as an undergrad, but it is approachable and Barberis is very accommodating to undergraduates. The class surveys the main ideas of Behavioral Finance, so that by the end you feel you have a good, surface-level grasp on the field. There are 3 homework assignments, a final exam and a 5-page research proposal.",
    "yes, good overview of topics.",
    "Absolutely, this course is likely to be one of the most influential course students will take in their lifetime."

   "comments": [
    "It deepened my knowledge of finance, economics, and behavioral finance. The course provided me the bedrock of my research, motivation, and general knowledge of how to do research.",
    "The course had a deep impact on my research agenda in changing my priors as to what kind of explanations are going to win out eventually. From a practical point of view, it has helped me come up with multiple ideas for papers, which are probably going to constitute a large fraction of my dissertation.",
    "This course provided an excellent summary of the facts and questions that academic finance is trying to address. The course comprehensively covered the modern theories and ideas in behavioral finance. This course opened up a very important way of addressing some of the main questions in the field.",
    "The course gave me an organized overview of behavioral finance and pointed out areas in which future research is likely to be productive.",
    "It's perhaps too early to tell, but I got a very good overview of the current research areas in BF from this course and how it relates to the broader asset pricing literature.",
    "I came out learning a lot and also with a lot of material to explore more down certain areas in Behavioral Finance should I choose to do so at a later date.",
    "The course definitely deepen my knowledge of the profession. The subject of the course allows me to better appreciate the field of behavioral finance. More importantly, it allows me to look at the bigger picture of finance in general. Everyone should have a understanding of the broader theme of the whole finance field and things well above that. It is important to understand the limits, boundaries and interdisciplinary of different subjects. It's the main driver of many important discovery of economics. It is just sad that nowadays, many researchers only have knowledge about their sub-fields and forget the bigger picture.",
    "The course greatly deepens my knowledge of Behavioral Finance, with great exposure to asset pricing and corporate finance. It is a great survey of finance research from a behavioral perspective and it will certainly benefit me in my future research and dissertation.",
    "As an undergraduate, this course deepened my knowledge of economics because I had not been exposed to Behavioral Finance prior to taking this course. Dissertation n\/a.",
    "overview of literature and topics",
    "This course basically gives you ALL the tools and culture you need to be a successful researcher in Behavioral Finance. I loved the fact it was really research-oriented, and the focus on giving us a broad culture instead of making us learn stuff by heart that we will forget two weeks after the final exam. A fantastic class!"
