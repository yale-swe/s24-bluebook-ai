    "If you're an actor you need to take this class.",
    "As someone before me said, you have to wade through a lot of bullshit, but the end result is astonishing, and Polina is brilliant, if overly loquacious...",
    "If you are willing to take the plunge (which you will have to be), it can be pretty interesting. I would probably say that taking a regular acting class would be more valuable, but if you are bored of regular stuff, give it a try. Animal work is very strange, and you will learn some thing about your body and whatnot, but if you are like me you will be pretty incredulous of a lot of the stuff that you do. Also beware of stuff popping up like a random paper at the end of the semester.",
    "A highly variable but useful acting class that I would recommend to any actor who is open to trying something completely new. The class may or may not help you to grow as an artist.",
    "Dudes...take this class and do animal work!! seriously, you owe it to yourselves to just let go of being self-conscious, cynical\/snarky Yale students and invest yourselves in a semester of this because you will learn so much about kinetics that you don't really get from other scene study courses. AWESOME!",
    "Absolutely recommended. With Polina it was unorthodox but amazing, plus there wasn't a whole lot of work outside of class. Just come and be prepared to be focused on what you're doing while you're in class."
