   "comments": [
    "It's a fine class. If you want to take it, take it. It's neither here nor there, but be wary that there are homework assignments due for each day the class meets.",
    "The course would be perfectly fine if not taught by Stephen Guerra. The material and textbook are very reasonable but the TA needs to know how to stay in the curriculum of the course.",
    "It's a very technical overview of intermediate classical music theory. The more time you've spent with music the easier time you will have, but you need to know a bit more than just bass\/treble clef and your key signatures. This class goes into some detail about the rules of traditional counterpoint (fundamental to most of western music) and of standard tonal harmony. I would recommend it to anyone who likes composing because although the model composition assignments require that you adhere to strict guidelines, getting acquainted with these rules is very helpful even if you intend to break them.",
    "Yes. I recommended it to my roommate already. Te one critique is that I wouldn't recommend it to someone who was totally sure they had a good reason to learn music theory",
    "I would recommend the class for anyone who wants to get lessons for credit or anyone who just wants a solid music theory class. It's alright. Nothing special.",
    "MUSI 210 services Yale students both as an expansion of general music theory knowledge as well as an entrance into more serious music courses at Yale University. I'd only recommend the course for students interested in seriously engaging with music throughout their lifetimes, as the knowledge base of a course like this isn't likely to help someone interested in other fields. One can still appreciate an opera\/symphony\/ballet suite without knowing all the technical fineries of the score. MUSI 210 is a course for musicians, first and foremost."
