   "comments": [
    "if you're from the south you'll love it, if you're not from the south you should take it to better understand the south.",
    "Take it. You'd be crazy not to. Great books, great professor, interesting discussions. Afterwards, I had a stronger notion of the South being it's own culture.",
    "Great way to look at some fantastic texts from a different perspective. So many fun, interesting reads.",
    "If Sarah teaches this course again, I would definitely recommend it.Imagining the American South was a great course. The reading list is incredible, and the workload is very manageable (2 5-page papers and one 8-10 pager).Sarah is an incredible teacher and a very sweet lady. You will absolutely love her after two weeks of class. She is very skilled at leading (but not controlling) class discussions and is very understanding when dealing with students.",
    "I would certainly recommend it, as a course that covers both some greats of American literature and one that offers an angle not normally covered at Yale--the ability to look at a sub-nation and an idea, rather than a period or author as guiding principle.",
    "I would recommend this course. It provides a trip -- sometimes a nightmarish, Southern Gothic one -- through a poor, but dignified, American South. Books are enjoyable and painful at the same time: so many aspects of our darker past are highlighted, but also some of the great ones are given their due as well. (Most of) thebooks are really excellent, and the conversations in class make even the lackluster ones worthwhile.",
    "Yes. The class is great. There's a good mix of different types of literature, mixed in with two more pop-culture books, which were really fun to read. Sarah Mahurin is awesome--she's engaging, energetic, and hilarious. It was awesome!!",
    "If you have any interest, or just think you might have an interest, do it.",
    "I would recommend this to anyone interested in the American South.",
    "This was an amazing class! I loved the syllabus and the way it was framed. I felt like I was given a glimpse into all walks of \"Southern life\" and in that way the class dispels any stereotypes about the region and those who inhabit it. If you've always wanted to read Faulkner, Welty, and McCullers (while still enjoying more modern novels by Tom Wolfe and Kathryn Stockett), this class is the perfect opportunity to do so.",
    "Imaging the American South is an excellent and essential seminar in American studies at Yale.Yale doesn't provide many classes on the South nor incorporate the South within Americanstudies classes, so this class is essential, but it is so much more than that. The chosenliterature and films approaches the imagined South from various angles, which encouragesthe class to develop a multifaceted view and move beyond stereotypes. We approached eachwork using traditional analysis and kept the Southern context in perspective in order for theworks to speak for themselves about how and to what extent the South is particular orpeculiar. The literature was usually short in length but dense so that we could thoroughlyanalyze the text rather than skim the surface. The selected material was organized intothematic units, but also contained themes that spanned the whole course, making it cohesive.The class resonated on a personal level for the students--if they were from the South or not--so the students were really invested in it and drove lively discussions. Professor Mahurinfostered the students' enthusiastic reading and discussion. Pardon the stereotypical analogy,discussion was like one over a Southern meal--paradoxically relaxed, free flowing, andenjoyable, but also fast paced, very frank, and intense.",
    "You read novels about the American South and learn a lot about the authors of those novels. Very interesting, totally recommend taking this course.",
    "Professor Mahurin is an angel. Absolutely take this class. Some things you have to look forward to: a pizza party, fried chicken in class day, three movies, and lots of truly worthwhile discussion about southern literature."
