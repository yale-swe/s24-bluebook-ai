    "I learned to question the inherent biases that we have in society. By looking at societal conceptions about desire through the lens of East Asian cultures far removed geographically and temporally, we stand to learn more about our understandings of desire.",
    "This course really helped me to learn more about Asian culture in general, and also about the way sexualities which differ from the norm are viewed in these societies. I have a personal interest in both of these topics, and I really appreciated having an academic approach to the topic. I developed presentation and discussion skills, and I also developed my insight into human nature and the impact which society can have on the experience of the individual."

    "The readings and films were fascinating, but I wish discussion of them during class was facilitated a little better. I also was a little bothered by the lack of feedback regarding our performance, but it was an overall chill class that I wasn't too worried about. The material we covered was very wide in terms of different cultures and areas of gender and sexuality, but I do wish we had covered female same-sex relationships and female-to-male trans people more."

    "Take this class! Professor Summers is fantastic. He may seem old and unversed in modern terminology of gender and sexuality, but he's really fantastic! He led nuanced conversations about gender and sexuality that you wouldn't believe. The reading is also very engaging and leaves you wanting to delve more into the subject. I recommend finding a couple of things that you found interesting\/confusing\/contradicting from the readings, and develop that into your discussion point for a class.",
    "Amazing seminar-sized class (not capped, but small class size). This class is a gem. Professor Summers is a nice guy, the classes were all very conversational. Interesting readings that often seemed more like leisure reading, and in-class films almost every other week (weeks when no readings were assigned!). A shame that some people blatantly didn't pay attention or engage in class, but the ones that did made the discussions worth my time. Participation and final paper (critique on two books of your choice) are the only requirements. Highly recommend if you are the least bit interested in sexuality and East Asian studies! This class should be cross listed in WGSS, would probably generate more interest in the class.",
    "If you're looking for an easy humanities credit and have some interest in East Asian studies or gender\/sexuality, take this! The readings are never too difficult, but still really fascinating, and we watch a variety of interesting films as well. Bill is really nice, and our discussions always feel more like conversations than anything high-stress. Plus he usually lets the class out a little early.",
    "Absolutely! The seminar style really allows you to dig into the literature we studied, and William Summers is really great at encouraging students to fully develop their ideas. If I could take this class again, I would!"
