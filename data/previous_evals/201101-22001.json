   "comments": [
    "This was an excellent class. The reading is pretty heavy, and it's very hard to do all of it, but it's also not necessary, as skimming is okay. The best part of the class was Professor Kamens, who is a veritable scholar on the subject of Heian Japan. He was approachable, courteous and excellent in every way. I have nothing but good to say about him.",
    "If you are at all mildly interested in Japanese culture, you'll do fine in this course.",
    "I would recommend this class if only because of Professor Kamen's commitment: I've never met a professor more willing to challenge AND help us. Just realize that this is NOT a good fifth class to take.",
    "This class is probably good for you if you're interested in reading the material or a history buff. A lot of reading, try to get ahead on it whenever you can (you'll probably fall behind). Professor Kamens knows an amazing amount about the material and really cares about helping students.Having said that, this is kind of a \"lecture seminar.\" Most classes would be about 75% lecture and 25% discussion. The lecture part is great, but as it is a whole hour late in the day it can be hard to stay engaged. Also, you never get tested on the lecture content or even have to use it in a paper, so a lot of people zone out.DO ALL THE READING (and the supplementary ones, if you can find the time). You don't have to, really, there are no quizzes and even the papers can be about all sorts of different things, but only after finishing Genji and writing my final (12 page!) paper did I really get a sense for the beauty and complexity of the work.Note that, like most classes, Genji's World is pretty end-heavy. The reading load doesn't change that much throughout, but you only have one shortish paper before break, whereas after break you have a longer paper and a longgg paper.I'd suggest shopping it, taking a look at the material. If you like it, go for it. This class has a far more detailed syllabus\/classes v2 website at the beginning of the semester than most; check it out.",
    "I would recommend this course. Professor Kamens knows his stuff. It is a confusing topic to understand fully, but reading the Tale of Genji is very satisfying. Professor Kamens knowledge of the subject helps a lot when looking for sources for paper writing, and he is more than willing to sit down to discuss your writing.",
    "If you are interested in ancient cultures or Japan, this course is a good choice. If you don't like to read, stay far far away.",
    "Take this class. Kamens (former master of Saybrook and husband to Mary Miller, Dean of Yale College) is referenced in the back of every book you read. He's such an expert on the material that it's amazing and he loves teaching this course because it is essentially the same as the course he took as a freshman at Yale that convinced him to become a Japanese Literature major, professor, and scholar. If I weren't a science major I would have 100% asked him to be my sophomore adviser. The course does truly require NO knowledge of Japanese and it comes with an awesome field trip to either New York or Japan. The class is a Wr which is great. It taught me how to use the Yale library system and the peer reviews are the most constructive way I've ever utilized to work on my writing. It's really low stress and only 3 papers (5,8, 10 pages) and a Wr. It's also really neat because it's a Humanities department class because you can write your papers from not only a literary point of view but any number of other points of view as well e.g. architectural, cultural, religious, aesthetic etc. I would definitely recommend this class to any incoming freshmen.",
    "Definitely recommend it.",
    "The class is great. It gives you a good understanding of what it was like to live in Heian period Japan. The Tale of Genji is a very interesting book, and class discussions are essential for understanding the tale. There's a lot of reading, but only 3 essays.",
    "An great class with heavy, but interesting reading. Good lectures and easy to talk to the professor. I would certainly suggest this course to someone else. Especially if they are interested in Japanese culture. This is a great course to be introduced to Japanese literature and history.",
    "I would recommend the class if you're up to DS-like reading and if you truly enjoy reading about Heian period Japan. The writing assignments are not difficult, but you need to be meticulous in your editing. As long as you're on top of things you should be fine. The class trip to NYC to see a Noh play was probably the highlight of the class.",
    "Genji's World will give you a detailed understanding of Heian Japan. In fact, you will know this time period better than any of your friends or family. If you like history and are interested in non-western literature, then read this course. You'll find that this course includes a lot of poetry, so if you like reading poems, you'll enjoy this.However, this course was not very discussion based, so if you are looking for long and engaging class discussions, I suggest you look elsewhere.",
    "If I could redo the semester, I probably wouldn't take it. But I'm not so into Japan and Japanese history, so if you are, this could certainly be the course for you! The readings were really cool. Be warned that it's not exactly a seminar; a typical class consisted of Professor Kamens talking at us for an hour and fifteen minutes.",
    "I would recommend it if you are interested in Japanese culture. Although many of us know a little bit about contemporary Japan, the ancient society is often left unstudied. They've also gone to Japan in the past and we made a trip to New York so there's also some fun and bonding time with your classmates."
