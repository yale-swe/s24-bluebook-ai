    "Yes!",
    "If you're looking at this, you probably took RUSS150. Just continue. Constantine is a great instructor and Russian has been my favorite class for both semesters. We read Pushkin's The Queen of Spades, Chekhov's From the Memoirs of an Idealist, Tolstoy's Prisoner of the Caucasus and Nabokov's An Affair of Honor. There was a focus on building listening skills this semesters as compared to last semester; we watched 10 news snippets over the semester, wrote responses to them and did a listening test. The syllabus may change, but that's what we did this time and I think it really helped me develop my listening and reading skills.",
    "Russian 151 is an L5 Russian course that teaches the language through written material, smaller writing assignments, stories, and movies. It was a great course with a great teacher.",
    "If you're looking at this, you're probably taking this class anyway! But I'd definitely recommend this class--Constantine is an awesome professor, and, especially at the end of the year, you'll really notice how your Russian skill has evolved.",
    "I loved this class, I'm sure everybody loved it. We all had a lot of fun reading Russian literature and watching movies and small video clips related to the topics of discussion. Prof. Muravnik explains grammar and vocabulary very well and is very understanding when we don't get something right away."
