   "comments": [
    "Hindi 110 is a fantastic course to take for anyone looking for a working knowledge of Hindi. The daily assignments are manageable, and the weekly quizzes are difficult but fair, and the midterm and final projects are also fun to do. Not only does the class use a great book to teach Hindi, but films, songs, stories, and other media are used to expose students to Indian culture. This was easily my favorite class this semester, and it should be the standard to which other language classes should be held.",
    "I highly recommend this class to other students. This class was very interesting and the material was even more engaging. I would definitely take this course all over again.",
    "I highly recommend this class to anyone who is interested in Hindi or in South Asian Studies. Not only do you learn the language, but you also learn about the Indian culture through songs and movies. You start out learning the Hindi script, but by the end of the semester, you will be able to write paragraphs and read stories. You learn a lot during the semester! For the midterm, you do a skit, and for the final, you do a magazine project, so there are no exams. However, there are weekly quizzes."
