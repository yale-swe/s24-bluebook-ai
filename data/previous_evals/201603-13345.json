    "Having no previous experience with wetlands, I learned a lot from this course and Professor Friedenburg. Her powerpoints were helpful, and I thought her selection of the Keddy book was great. It's definitely one of the most engaging textbooks I've ever read. She is also quite responsive to feedback, and overall a good instructor. I enjoyed her class!",
    "This class was terrific and challenging. Kealoha covers a lot of material in great detail and the reading was quite dense, but I learned so much about wetlands. Lectures were always fascinating and I thought Kealoha did a great job of bringing in current events applying what we'd learned, and the class was very well structured. All of the lectures from the first portion of the course prepared us to get a lot out of the more applied topics towards the end of the semester.",

   "comments": [
    "Wetlands in the News--Field Trips--some of the more interesting papers were the one on pharmaceuticals, the climate change test pods, and the ones on invasives.",
    "I enjoyed learning about wetlands from both ecological and management perspectives throughout the course.",
    "I thought the best aspects of the course related to the course discussions on the readings and the professor's personal experiences with wetland management. I felt that these sessions during the class provided particular insights into wetlands management and allowed the students to discuss their personal experiences with wetlands management. I found these conversations to be helpful in making the application of the readings more accessible.",
    "I thought the lectures were the best part of the course. Kealoha creates a very balanced course that is scientifically rigorous but still approachable for students with less of an ecology background. I always enjoyed walking through the experimental design and results of each of the articles we'd read in detail and getting a stronger understanding of how the trends we observe in wetlands are studied.",
    "The field trips were great -- it's so useful to be able to see examples of processes and patterns we discussed. Also, the discussion-based format of class meetings worked very well, especially since we had a couple of students with field experience who were able to offer their perspectives.",
    "Field trips and when the instructor was talking about her expertise\/research",
    "Learning about wetlands!"

   "comments": [
    "It might be nice to have more breakout discussion groups, or have someone assigned to lead the discussion each week in tandem with Kealoha. Just suggestions though, overall the structure is good!",
    "I would have enjoyed if field trips were built into the course time, as having more of them would have provided a deeper understanding of the concepts we discussed in class.",
    "I have one major recommendation for the course, which relates to the way it was structured. As mentioned above, I found the discussion sections to be particularly helpful; however, sometimes they seemed a bit rushed. It is clear that the professor recognized the importance of these discussions as she always made a point to get to them. My recommendation would be to split the two class meetings per week between lecture and discussion. This would require doubling the topics covered per class period; however, I think it would make the discussion sessions more productive. Furthermore, if the discussion questions were due on Thursday and based on the lectures from Tuesday, it might be a more effective relationship between lectures, readings, and discussions.",
    "Submitting discussion questions prior to class meetings can be useful, but I often found myself reading more to generate questions for the sake of the assignment than reading for comprehension.",
    "I think the course could be improved if the requirement for discussion questions was changed from 5 to 3. I found myself paying less attention to the substance of the readings as I was reading them because I was so focused on thinking up relevant questions. As a result I feel like I didn't absorb as much of the material. I do think coming up with questions is helpful, but 5 per student seemed like a lot. We rarely addressed more than 2 or 3 in class.",
    "Kealoha is an incredibly accomplished and smart woman! Sometimes she would apologize for running late or other minor things when in reality she really got this!",
    "Teaching method and general lecturing could be improved. Sometimes the class could be more engaging, rather than just regurgitating the papers we read."
