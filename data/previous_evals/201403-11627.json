    "The second half of the course was good - the material started at an appropriate level, and the problem sets matched the lab work. The first half of the course was more out of scope ... either the first half should be made to match the second half, or there should be a pre-req for an additional math course above introductory biostatistics. The current level of the course is too high if there is an assumption that everyone has only had one year of biostatistics; the only ones who seemed to understand what was going on in the beginning were math majors in college. The beginning problem sets were too long. The problem set answer keys should be posted online to ensure concepts are understood prior to the final.",
    "Very interesting.",
    "It's a very good intro epidemic modeling course, and this is great that EMD department offers it. I got very good basic understanding of the methods, which is what I was looking for. Labs and problem sets were extremely useful. It usually takes a couple of years to 'polish' the course content and structure, so I'm sure it will further improve in the coming years. But given that it was only the second year the course it offered, it was very well done. I was expecting some more advanced content related to dynamic modeling, so it would be very useful if EMD department also offered a separate course in dynamic modeling.",
    "I think the biggest problem facing this class is the matlab issue. We simply did not learn enough basic coding to alter the problems in the homework. Sometimes I was blindly altering things, with no idea how to really troubleshoot the problem. The class literally needs to start with \"what is a vector\". Its bee awhile since high school, and that was the last time I remember talking about vectors.",
    "I really enjoyed this course! Even though the math could get foggy at times, the concepts surrounding all the topics will be useful even in non-math settings. Personally, I would have liked to see more derivations of the formulas and methods we used. Sometimes when we were presented with a formula to just plug-and-chug, I felt like I didn't fully understand what I was doing or why. I know a lot of students don't have as much math background, though, and maybe wouldn't appreciate this as much.",
    "I think the course does a good job of introducing various statistical concepts and introducing well known papers in the field of ID epi. However, 99% of the material definitely went over most of the class's heads. Most of us had only biostats I and II (intro courses) going into this class. It is impossible to expect us to grasp the concepts presented to us with such minimal background knowledge. I spent 5+ hours every week trying to read and understand a single paper. When we had problem sets due, I would probably spend 15-20 hours on it with my partner. MATLAB is really hard, and the way Ginny taught it in class was really difficult to follow. Definitely way too fast paced. Most of the time I didn't even understand enough to ask questions in class!",
    "Better guidance with matlab",
    "I'm torn on this course. I think that it covers a lot of interesting and important material for EMD students. But it is still somewhat confusing and has a sharp learning curve. There needs to be two courses. The first should be an introduction to ID modeling, MATLAB applications, and the mathematics that go into it all. The second should be this course, where it all gets brought together for some practical applications. A lot of the more experienced MPH and PhD could just skip to the second course, but the 2\/3 of the class who were lost on Day 2 would have loved to have had a semester to learn the basics. That lecture by Ted Cohen? That should have been in week 2, and we should have built up from that. Start by doing everything by hand so that you can see exactly what's happening. Then move on to Excel so that you can do more and bigger calculations, but can still see what's going on. Finally advance to MATLAB, where much of the work is just a black box. That whole process should take about 1\/2 the semester, then you can do some fancy MATLAB stuff in the 2nd half. There were a few people in the class who had strong backgrounds in this material, and I think that they may have given the professor the wrong idea that we were all understanding it. Many of us were just too lost to even know where to ask a question. Really, if we had started asking questions about everything, we would only have gotten through about three weeks worth of material. Most of us had no background for this class, and we needed to be spoon-fed a lot of the introductory subjects. Instead we just tried to sprint and keep up. It seemed to work, but we did not learn nearly as much as we would have liked. If we could have had an introductory course before this one, things would have been much better. I understand the idea behind doing group homework and forcing us to rotate our partners. But this also allows the bottom 1\/3 of the class to hide behind the work of their classmates. Maybe giving shorter weekly homework that must be done individually will give the professor a better idea of who is learning and where the gaps are. Unfortunately that would also encourage cheating because the bottom 1\/3 will not be happy to struggle. You might think about making the weekly homework P\/F, so there's less pressure to get things exactly right. I don't know. It's a difficult balance. I would love to have this course taught from a textbook. It would help students tremendously if they were able to reference a definitive instructive source, instead of densely-worded research papers written for people who are already familiar with the material. I think that this course has the potential to be one of the best courses in EMD, but it's just not there yet. Give it a few more years and I think that a lot of the kinks will get ironed out.",
    "While all of the information provided was great, I often felt that the instructor made assumptions as to the mathematical background of the class. It may be that the course should come with either required or recommended background coursework which may improve the entire class's ability to better follow the course content. I really appreciated the matlab component and how we were not expected to write all of that quite complicated code, but that the time was always taken to walk us through the code and explain every line, even if I was not always able to follow along perfectly.",
    "The course is very good. It is better if the course reference books for people who are taking the course for the first time.",
    "Strengths: it was great that we were able to work together. Weaknesses: I learned nothing from this class, maybe with the exception that I learned how to open MATLAB. I had high hopes for this course, but it was too fast and for someone like me that hasn't taken linear algebra in over 4 years or understands how to use MATLAB, I really struggled through this course. Maybe if this course was divided into 2 semesters it would have been better and I know that a lot of people would be interested in learning ID modeling.",
    "This course was interesting and covered important material. It sometimes felt like things weren't very well organized, and the instructor sometimes didn't seem to be able to provide explanations and clarifications on material.",
    "Please excuse typos and punctuation, I am using a smartphone. Strengths: this course goes in depth in many interesting methods used in Id, I'm really happy with every topic covered Weakness: this course needs to cover probability and maximum likelihood in a better way or require a probability course as a prerequisite. We went over all the probaBility concepts for the entire semester in one class which was not very helpful since many people were lost during that lecture. I'd suggest to introduce a relevant probability concept before each lecture. Here are some suggestions: 1) Reed-frost models --> binomial and Bernoulli 2) vaccine effectiveness --> exponential distribution 3) time series analysis --> poisson distribution These are some examples off the top of my head, not be necessarily the best choices. Introducing relevant matlab functions like this might be a good idea."

   "comments": [
    "Instructor: Virginia Pitzer \u00a0Ginny is a very nice and extremely knowledgeable person. It is clear the first half of the course is around her expert area, as this is taught at a higher level. The second half, which is a bit more out of her expertise, is taught at a more approachable level. Perhaps the two halves should be swapped, so the course starts off easier and builds up; it would also be easier to start using Matlab files that are pre-made and then to switch to creating your own code. It would be good if there was more of a focus on the content and less on how to solve problems with Matlab; the use of Matlab is something that is less likely to stay with the students over time, but the content can be more readily applied to other areas. Ginny does a good job of explaining what content there is, but it would be helpful if the equations were broken down more into what each symbol was and the overall goal.",
    "Instructor: Virginia Pitzer \u00a0Very accessible. I love her class.",
    "Instructor: Virginia Pitzer \u00a0Ginny is great! Very knowledgeable and enthusiastic. She has put a lot of time and effort into making this a good course, and I really admire how much she cares about the course and students.",
    "Instructor: Virginia Pitzer \u00a0Dr. Pitzer's best strength is her ability to engage and help students. I never left like I couldn't ask a question in class. I think Dr. Pitzer is just so smart, she has forgotten how confusing the basics of the class can be to new students, and has a hard time understanding where our confusion comes from. There should almost be another class that introduces a lot of the topics much more slowly, which you have to take first before taking this class. It was overwhelming sometimes trying to both remember the mathematical concepts and code in matlab.",
    "Instructor: Virginia Pitzer \u00a0Ginny is great. Very personable and you can tell she has a lot of knowledge about the topic. I think one thing that could be improved are the conversation-starting questions used in class\/lab. Especially when the answers are in the slides or the lab document, I think people don't want to be the one to give the really obvious answer.",
    "Instructor: Virginia Pitzer \u00a0Ginny is SO nice -- probably one of the nicest professors I've ever met. However, she seemed nervous a lot, which I think impacted the way she presented information. She also went way too fast for our class's knowledge and skill base. I think she should slow down a little... She did ask many times throughout lectures and labs if anyone had any questions but half the time we were all too lost and maybe 10 slides behind her to be asking questions. By the time I understood slide #1, she would be on slide #10.",
    "Instructor: Virginia Pitzer \u00a0She's energetic, engaging, and approachable. I think that once she has this class nailed down she will be a great instructor.",
    "Instructor: Virginia Pitzer \u00a0Ginny is really a very good teacher, and has a strong command of the subject matter presented. Ginny constantly checks to ensure that everyone is following along and understands her explanations. Unfortunately, there are times when everyone is so lost that no one wants to speak up and ask for an explanation. However, she always is willing and ready to explain things again when asked, and when people seek an explanation. I never went to office hours, but would assume that the same would hold true for her approachability then.",
    "Instructor: Virginia Pitzer \u00a0 Dr.Pitzer was an excellent instructor. She was always well organized. I would suggest is she could reserve a reference for the course and\/or a handout for the lab session.",
    "Instructor: Virginia Pitzer \u00a0I really liked her!! She's sweet and very approachable, but I don't think she understands how lost her students are.",
    "Instructor: Virginia Pitzer \u00a0She is engaging and personable. However, I don't think she is very organized. Sometimes she didn't seem prepared for lectures or labs.",
    "Instructor: Virginia Pitzer \u00a0Please excuse typos and punctuation, I'm using a smartphone. Strength: professor pitzer clearly cares about her students. She is always willing to help when she is asked for it and grades in a just fashion. Weakness: Her presentation style is average. Granted these are complex topics it must be challenging to teach. However, it was quite easy for one to get lost in her lectures. I think a significant issue is that PowerPoint medium is used for everything. Yes, for many parts of the course, pp is necessary, but when really working through an example or writing likelihood equations, it would be good to go step by step on the chalkboard. This is especially true for any probability related equation. Lastly, this class suffered from students feeling not able to ask questions. If students cannot follow the course, many might just give up on the lecture and hope to catch up outside. You need a better way to assess how students are doing in the course rather than just asking \"does everyone get this\". Many students don't feel comfortable saying they are when they are completely lost and don't even know where to begin asking questions."

   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this course to a student who had extensive math background and plans to pursue modeling. I would not recommend this course to someone who had not either been a math major or taken advanced math classes, as the math is difficult to pick up if you don't have the right background.",
    "I will recommend this class to other students, because it is interesting.",
    "Highly recommended to all students in EMD department.",
    "This class is extremely challenging but useful for anyone who wants an introduction to modeling methods. Anyone considering further graduate studies would benefit from this class.",
    "A great course for learning some ways to quantitatively analyze infectious disease data. More in-depth than other courses. Also a great reinforcer for infectious disease epidemiology concepts.",
    "I would recommend it to another student only if students have good statistical knowledge or prior experience with MATLAB. I am not a great coder nor do I have great statistical background. The course was the most challenging class I've taken at YSPH because of this. It was frankly very frustrating because I really wanted to learn the material and it seemed interesting but it was just way too difficult for me.",
    "Do not take. New material on final? Was way too long. Too many questions.",
    "This is a really interesting course about modelling and quantitative analysis methods used in infectious disease research. It is not an easy course, though, and you will struggle a bit to grasp all of the concepts. As it is right now (Fall 2014), the course is probably best for PhD students who know or plan on doing some modeling or such for their dissertation. MPH students with a strong background in the field can also take it. If you think that you would like to maybe go on for a PhD in this field, this course might also be a good check on your capabilities - but you will struggle. This course is taught with the assumption that you have some preliminary knowledge. If you've never done any modeling, you probably shouldn't take this course. If you've never worked with MATLAB (and MATLAB is NOT SAS), you probably shouldn't take this course. If you've never studied matrix algebra, you probably shouldn't take this course. If you've done two out of those three, you're probably in good enough shape and should take this course. But this is a new course, and the instructor is receptive to suggestions and improvements. In another year or two this may be a really great course for everyone.",
    "Great overview into quantitative infectious disease methods. It is very reliant on professor provided code, but I was able to end the class with a great understanding of the methods and practices. The final exam was a nice experience to put everything I had learned together. All analysis is done in Mat Lab. Course covers vaccines effects and efficacy, transmission, population dynamics, SEIR models, and uses higher level mathematical techniques such as Fourier Transforms and wavelet analysis.",
    "Take this course if you know how to use MATLAB or R and know mathematical modeling. If not, beware.",
    "This course gives a good overview of important quantitative concepts. It seems to be a work in progress, but I would recommend it to people really interested in the course material, especially those who have more of a quantitative\/computer science background.",
    "I highly recommend this course if you are interested in working with numbers and computers in infectious disease. However, approach with caution if you do not have a good background in probability and coding."
