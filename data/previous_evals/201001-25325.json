   "comments": [
    "The course is a decent stats course. I would recommend it. The problem sets are long at times but they are manageable.",
    "MUCH harder than I expected. I'm taking it C\/D\/F and having a tough time. I would start with a lower level stats class first.",
    "Yes, if you have a math related major.",
    "Math 242 is an introduction to statistics that focuses on understanding the principles on which various statistical tools are based, rather than simply how they are applied to analyze data. It is very well taught. The major topics are estimation, hypothesis testing, and regression. The material depends on probability theory, which is why Math 241 is a prerequisite. The course starts with a probability review, but students should definitely be familiar with probability theory before starting. I highly recommend the course to anyone interesting in a mathematically rigorous understanding of statistics.",
    "Definitely recommend this class. Professor Madiman is great, class is very interesting if you are into applied math. This class showed to me that stat is awesome. You also learn all the stat necessary for doing data analysis for physics and other sciences and actually understanding what you are doing in why it works! so recommend this class to all physics majors.",
    "A good way to learn statistics. Not too difficult - short but helpful problem sets, fair exams, good pace. Pace was a little slow second semester but that may be because people did bad on the midterm, I don't know. Madiman is a good professor. I liked him a lot. This recommendation is probably more relevant if you are trying to decide to take another one of his classes since if you are taking this one you don't have much of a choice for intro statistics other than the very simple 100 level classes.Note to econ people: I was inan econ class this semester and from taking 242 concurrently I was much better prepared for statistics stuff than kids that had taken econometrics. So it might be a good idea to take this class as an alternative to econometrics. Especially since I hear econometrics is terrible.",
    "Take this course if you want to learn statistics.",
    "The class started off a little slow, but I guess that was necessary to solidify our understanding of basic concepts of probability. The problem sets were interesting and really built on material covered in class, which was nice. Exams were also very well linked to the problem sets.Professor Madiman was very approachable. He was not afraid of venturing into the more theoretical side of statistics when someone would demand a more involved explanation. His derivations were very well explained and his presentation of the material was coherent and easy to follow. Great class if you like mathematics.",
    "Fairly good class - I think lectures were structured fine and the problem sets generally complimented the lectures. Additionally, professor Madiman is a good teacher and usually on top of things when answering questions, which I always rank as a very important factor for any professor. However, its hard for me to give this class a \"very good\" ranking because it didn't peak my interest or curiosity as much as I hoped it would. Besides a few examples, the number of \"wow, that's really cool\" moments in this class were limited. I would have liked the professor to focus more on interesting statistical tidbits, examples, or results. Otherwise, the class was a bit dry and I came away feeling that I have improved my knowledge of statistics, but am not interested in pursuing the subject further.",
    "It teaches you Mathematical Statistics, but the style of teaching was not the best. You must do extensive reviewing on your own to get the most out of the class."
