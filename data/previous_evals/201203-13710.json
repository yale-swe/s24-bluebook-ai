    "Your grades in this class come from problem sets, a midterm, a final, and a paper\/presentation project. Aside form the paper\/presentation project, all assessment and grading is based off your ability to do high school level chemistry and physics. An example problem would be applying a formula with constants to figure out how much power or electricity a wind turbine can produce with a certain wind speed, etc. There is a lot of math and applying formulas given in the textbook.",
    "It's a good class, but can be a little bit dry at time. I definitely recommend it, though, because the class is so extremely important to society as a whole.",
    "The most useful skill you need is factor label. I would not recommend this course to another student because it is boring, and did not add to my freshman experience at Yale.",
    "For a so-called seminar, this course is heavy on lectures, which at times were boring and hard to understand. The workload is very light, though."
