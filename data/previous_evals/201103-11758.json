   "comments": [
    "French 110 is an introductory French course for those with little or no prior knowledge. The format of the course is watching a video clip once per week in French, from which one is supposed to learn the vocabulary and grammar of the lesson which are extensively tested on the weekly tests. The frequency of the tests creates an atmosphere of constant test review and the amount of material one is expected to know is excessive. Grading is also very harsh. Unless one has an aptitude for languages (perhaps combined with fluency in some other Romance language as well), I would strongly advise against taking this course. One should either take a different language or find another university at which to take intro French (e.g., over the summer) and place into L3 or higher courses, which are more helpful.",
    "You will learn French very fast and very well. You will also have to make sacrifices on other portions of your life (think 1-2 hours of work a weekday, consistently). The weekly tests are difficult and will stress you out. Professor Hoffman is kind but serious about her French, but you will learn from her. Probably not a good idea to take this class as a senior though, especially not the 8:20 section>.<.",
    "If you want to take French, you need to be willing to put in the work because the course goes really fast. Especially during the two lesson weeks.",
    "Yes because although it is a lot of work you really do learn a lot and the work isn't overly challenging.",
    "I would recommend this class if you really want to learn French. If you are looking for a super easy language requirement, this is not the program for you. However, if you have a genuine interest and are willing to put in work then it is very rewarding!",
    "Strong language program -- more work than other languages but it pays off. If you want to learn french, take it. If you want to fulfill your language credit, look elsewhere.",
    "An excellent introduction to French language. Better for audio learners than visual ones, definitely.",
    "Totally worthwhile, you learn a ton and if you put in effort will emerge with basic french conversational skills."
