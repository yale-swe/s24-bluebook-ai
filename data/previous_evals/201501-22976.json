    "Take it if you have any sort of interest in music!",
    "If you're considering taking this because you think it'll be a gut class, don't, because it's not. This course was a lot of work and it was difficult (especially not coming from a music theory background). However, if you like music and are interested in learning how it works, it will be worth the work, and you will have fun.",
    "I went into MUSI 110 without ever having played an instrument or knowing how to read sheet music. For a final project, we write a melody and harmonize it, and I had a great time doing it. The pace of learning is quite fast for someone with no experience, but I imagine it would be easier if you had some background, at least towards the beginning. The homework wasn't longer than for most classes, but it becomes difficult to focus on it because it is easy once you understand the idea. Professor Salem is also a fantastic professor to take it with.",
    "I would highly recommend MUSI 110 to any student who has little to no knowledge in music theory or music basics. This class provided me with a strong foundation in music and it was a great atmosphere for trying out new things. Also, when choosing a section, take this class with Prof. Joseph Salem. He was a great professor, was always clear in teaching, reachable by email, and an all around cool guy. I had a lot of fun in this course, and now I feel like I have the knowledge and confidence necessary to take on the music world!",
    "I have emerged with better appreciation of music so take it if you want that. It's very handy for cultural refinement."
