   "comments": [
    "Art History 112 is a great class for anyone interested in learning the basic background of a large number of pieces. Think quantity > quality. That is not to say that the evaluation of each piece is worthless. I mean that in class, the professor provides a short, but interesting, analysis of each piece, but covers a huge number of pieces. That is what a survey class is about, so if that is what you are looking for, it is definitely a great class for you! I enjoyed it - worth my time.",
    "Survey of a large number of art pieces and architecture through history ending in the Middle Ages.",
    "The class involves a lot of memorization, but fun to learn",
    "It's a great survey of ancient art. Don't take it if you absolutely hate memorizing dates, but as long as you don't wait until the last minute to study for the midterm and the exam you'll be totally fine. The lectures are always interesting, and I like how Professor Jung focuses on some of the more important, influential, or interesting pieces rather than trying to skim over every single piece in the book. Section in the YUAG is really fun, and this class is a great way to take advantage of the resources we have there.",
    "Standard intro art history class, a lot of memorization so maybe don't take it if you're not good at that. The papers are fun to write, and section really is awesome, but really boring by the end.",
    "Great overview course of Art History - part one. Definitely has an intense workload full of papers and tests. Completely worth it if you put the time in. But be prepared! Course does not discuss Renaissance art at all even though its in title.",
    "Definitely take this course if you can fit it and have an interest in discovering art as a political and religious medium that has been adapted throughout the ages to serve the needs of civilizations. I have been enlightened by this course and can't wait to take the second half in the spring.",
    "Great survey course. I recommend Credit\/D since it can be difficult to learn how to translate visuals into writing and to memorize all the dates.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student because it is a great introduction to art history. I think the course is well-done, but is certainly a challenge.",
    "I would recommend this course to a fellow student. It was fun and taught me things that I didn't know before. It very much lived up to expectations. This class does require devotion and hard work, however. How much you get out of it is dependent on how much one puts in.",
    "Do yourself a favor and actually go to lecture if you're taking this course credit\/d\/fail. It is nearly impossible to cram for the exams in the event that your attendance is not so great.",
    "I would recommend art history to anyone who wants to learn the basics of how to analyze art. Of course, you focus on the western canon. However, the lectures are very interesting and sections are truly the best part. You have the opportunity to analyze works of art in the YUAG, which was an incredible experience. Definitely take it even if you're not an art history major.",
    "A great class to do Credit\/D but the exams are very detail-heavy (name the location \/ artist \/ date of X painting, sculpture, cathedral etc.) and would be a very difficult class to take for a grade if you're bad at memorizing information.",
    "A lot of material that you hope to keep with you well after you graduate. I'll let you know in 20 years.",
    "Great intro class! Take it with Professor Jung! The most amazing lecturer I've had!",
    "I would recommend this class as long as you don't mind returning to a form of learning that is very centered around memorization.",
    "An incredible crash course to art history through the ages leading up to the renaissance. I would highly recommend it.",
    "I enjoyed taking this class Credit\/D. Lectures each week were interesting and informative, and taking it credit\/D took the pressure off of memorizing dates for the final.",
    "I would highly recommend HSAR 112 01 to another student, especially if they don't feel particularly interested in ancient art. It really gave me a new appreciation for the old stuff. As a course, it was always fun to attend lecture and section--who doesn't need an excuse to go the art gallery? It's a fun course that requires minimal but consistent work--studying a little bit every week will ensure you good grades on big projects, and the essay assignments were fun and not too taxing. Definitely if a student were considering this course, I'd urge them to take it.",
    "Great course! Lot of work though, as expected with a gut course. There are over 300 slides that you'll end up having to memorize. There's a test, two papers, and a final. Professor Jung is a great lecturer so it's worth going to lecture and you'll be better prepared for the tests if you do. The test\/exam were challenging but in a fun way. If you go to lecture and study your lecture notes and use your instinct about which slides she'll most likely include on the test then you'll be in good shape. If you have a PC you might have difficulty accessing her presentations with the slide images so be prepared to put in the time to make a lot of flashcards using the slide lists to search for the images. (studyblue.org is great a tool to use for this class)"
