    "More than either of my previous two graphic design classes, this class really pushed me as a designer. There were definitely times when I got really frustrated with my projects, but I was able to work through that and come up with something I was really happy with.",
    "Gained a more critical eye in making typographic decisions",
    "I learned a lot about design, layout, and editing through this course. The course is structured around 3 main projects: A type specimen, a book, and a short video. I found them all to be very well thought out and structured assignments, each covering a different area of typography.",
    "Typography 2 is a natural follower to Type 1. The class teaches design thinking and throught about typography through three projects: a poster, a book, and an animated video.",
    "I furthered my understanding of visual communication through the print and digital medium. I learned the importance of several iterations of a project in order to develop an effective result all the while pushing myself to allow my creativity to flow freely. I also developed a much better grasp of Adobe After Effects."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "A great chance to gain valuable feedback on three longer-term projects (compared to previous design classes with a larger volume of assignments)",
    "I loved the 3-project structure, which gave me the chance to work as slowly and be as detailed as I needed in each of the projects. Most other classes I've taken have had a project due every 1-2 weeks, so I was very grateful for having the chance to take my time on these.",
    "A major strength of this course is the fact that it is structured around 3 large projects as opposed to week to week assignments. This allowed for more refinement and a higher quality of work to be produced. Further, iterating the designs allowed for a lot more feedback on more nuanced aspects of the designs.",
    "This class has great projects. However the structure of the class (one day a week) did not allow for consistent critiques and enough feedback on work. Near the end of the course, most feedback was one on one or through email. I felt that this lacked the significant benefit of peer critique. In addition, I wish some of the prompts for the projects were slightly more specific. For example, the book project virtually had no prompt; we were just to make a book using a text that we created. Even so, half of the class used found texts. I think with a narrower prompt, it may be easier to decide on a project to commit to and more time could be spent on thinking about design rather than content.",
    "I wish this course met twice a week so that we could receive more feedback for our projects; as it was this semester it felt like the pacing of the course was slow in terms of project development but fast in terms of what was expected out of each iteration."

    "If you are interested in graphic design, I highly recommend this course. Henk is a wonderful professor and critic, and it's really fun to see everyone else's projects evolve along with your own.",
    "Absolutely recommend to those looking to improve their proficiency with type in design",
    "Yes, absolutely. But be willing to work really hard and dive deeply into your projects, otherwise it's not worth it.",
    "I would highly recommend this course if you are interested in design, books, or typography.",
    "I think this course should be taken by any graphic design student. For someone who just has a slight interest in design, I would recommend trying other design classes before this one.",
    "ART 265 helps to develop and refine one's Graphic Design skills focusing on only a few project. This course is useful if you are willing to put in the effort to work on a single project for several weeks."
