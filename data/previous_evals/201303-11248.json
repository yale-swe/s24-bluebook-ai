    "I will recommend the class. Overall it's an engaging class and Professor Watson is nice and warm and knowledgeable. And as long as you try your best your grade is usually not bad~",
    "Take this class-great readings and great professor",
    "I loved H&P this fall. I initially thought it would be the hardest DS class and took it CR\/D, but ended up switching it to A-F. There's a great deal of variety in the texts of the course -- some are event-driven narratives and then we have the more politically minded texts, but I thought Professor Watson did a great job of leading class discussion no matter the text. Discussion was formal in the class -- we called each other by last names, for example -- but don't let that put you off. Professor Watson did a great job of varying the types of classes we had. Most would be discussions, but every so often, we would do a unique group activity that gave a nice break from the usual way a DS section is right. Professor Watson also provides extremely helpful comments on the papers that not only deal with the specific paper but address writing skills and how to improve them for next time. Out of all my DS classes this fall, I think my writing improved the most in Professor Watson's H&P class.",
    "Don't expect to learn a thing about history and politics. Rather, be prepared to read a lot of Ancient historians and political theorists and understand how they approach such fields as history and politics. Don't take it if you are not prepared to put in the work.",
    "I would definitely recommend it. It's a very interesting class, and once you know the information you feel like a more competent human being.",
    "Directed Studies: Historical and Political Thought is a survey of the great thinkers, ranging from Herodotus, to Polybius, all the way to Aquinas. H&P is a demanding course, and oftentimes it has the most rigorous and lengthy reading assignments of the three DS classes. However, this is a very rewarding class, and as compared to Lit and Philosophy, H&P provides a very coherent story of change and continuity. Additionally, H&P provides you with some of the most fantastic authors on the DS syllabus! Polybius and Herodotus were personal favorites. If you can, take this class with Cecelia Watson! Professor Watson is an excellent instructor, and her deep care for her students shines through. For each paper returned, we each received an individualized typed page (single-spaced!) of comments about our essay. Professor Watson outlined key points of improvement that were necessary for our following paper, and I must say that I was certainly able to track my improvement in this class! Professor Watson is also a fair grader, and she highly values improvement. She cares so much about her students, and she is lovely and welcoming during office hours. Also, Professor Watson allows a free, though very respectful, section environment, and she really lets the students run the show. Definitely take this class if you want to improve your writing and have a warm class environment that is quite conducive to learning!",
    "I would absolutely recommend it. In my mind, there is no better way at Yale (or perhaps at any other institution) to to be exposed to this kind of thinking, and even though it can feel really difficult at times, the reward is ultimately worth it."
