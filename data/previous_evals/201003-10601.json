    "TAKE THIS COURSE!",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to any student interested in the history of the 19th and 20th century US, even if s\/he were not particularly interested in \"culture\" to begin with.",
    "AMST 731 is a excellent introduction to the cultural history approach in American studies. I would recommend it highly to those interested in American history.",
    "I would recommend this course to cultural historians and all history and American studies students who are interested in considering how to write about culture, a notoriously nebulous object of study."

   "comments": [
    "Even though I was one of the few non-historians, it was really useful for me to get a better understanding of the field of cultural history, and to think about how it compares and is different from cultural sociology. I come away with authors I want to read further, and methods of analysis I can use in the future. The syllabus final assignment looking at the culture of nonviolent social movements may very well end up as a dissertation topic. Thank you!!!",
    "Yes. The course opened up the field of cultural history and will have a positive impact on my work in religious history.",
    "This course was very helpful in considering cultural studies\/history as a discipline and in thinking methodologically. It pushed me to consider new ways of thinking about my research. I do wish, however, that we had spent a little more time in class talking about methodology as such."
