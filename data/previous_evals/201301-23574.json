He is open for teaching but also learning from students and the class turns out to be an interesting discussion with a very admirable scientist.- The class' style: with not much workload, this class was perfect to learn from the discussions and readings, and not studying for an exam"

When he did have points to make, it was usually very interesting and insightful.The class also would have been better if we actually debated the issues. As it happened, there were no incentives to do anything other than long and boring presentations.",

    "Organization is definitely an aspect that could improve. The class is rich because of the discussions, and sometimes we did not have both sides of the theme (cons and pros) because schedule was not organized in advance."
