    "this course is very enjoyable and very informative. you learn so much but without a huge workload. prof goren is great. movies are really amazing and worth watching even if you are not in the course. you learn a lot about aspects of israeli society and culture that are not stressed in the media.prof goren is amazing. she leads discussion incredibly well and provides great insights on the material. she makes all the readings come together real well. prof goren is also very understanding, very helpful, and one of the best professors i have had at yale.this class is a must take for all yalllies.",
    "TAKE TAKE TAKE TAKE! Shiri is great, the course material is intriguing and you get to take a look into the culture and society of one of the world's most talked about countries. Great course!",
    "Take it. Not too difficult with workload and you lern some cool things.",
    "This is an awesome class, you learn a lot, the readings and movies are great, the work isn't very stressful, and you're interested in what you're writing about. I would definitely recommend it.",
    "Yes, a very good class. The workload was not bad at all, but you need to do the work for each class in order to be able to participate. We watched a lot of movies and spent most of our classes talking about the readings and the films. The discussion was pretty casual and easy to follow. Background in the subject is not really necessary since the class focuses on social aspects of Israeli society, not detailed historical events.",
    "Easy, fun, and you get to watch movies. Why not?",
    "take it. great class",
    "Near Eastern Langs and Civ wasn't spectacular. While we did cover quite a lot of information, I think that the conversation got a little repetitive. I also didn't find the essay topics too thought provoking and they also didn't vary much."
