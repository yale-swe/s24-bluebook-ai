    "You should take this class!",
    "I'm glad I took this course but I'm not sure if I would recommend it to everybody. This class was the most demanding of all the classes I took this semester and definitely took up most of my energy and time. Lectures were often exhausting trying to keep up with Professor Lofton who speaks very very fast and often pretty abstractly. The material is usually pretty interesting and definitely picks up towards the end of the course which is mostly devoted to actual religions and issues rather than just sexual\/ religious theory. I went into it expecting a history course and at the beginning I was very disappointed but in the end I'm glad I took it. There are 3 papers, a midterm (which requires A LOT of studying. Study ALL the reading questions, which are incredibly helpful) and a take-home final as well as section and a reading response every week.",
    "It was a course based on abstract concepts with a philosophical inclination... it deserves at least a day of your time. It will entertain you, astonish you, and open your eyes to the way Americans engage in discourse on sexuality.The section mainly focused on the readings we were assigned. It was one hour of relating the readings to the class.Professor Lofton speaks as if she's reciting poetry. Shouldn't that be enough to enroll in her class?",
    "I would definitely recommend Sexuality and Religion to another student. Professor Lofton is an amazing lecturer and the material is very engaging and pertinent to the world today. This course is not only intellectually stimulating, but also doesn't have a huge course load.",
    "I'd definitely recommend it. The class has really challenged my views on sexuality. The readings are always super interesting and there isn't too much work. Three papers, but they're all short.",
    "It's a really good class and will challenge you to think and analyze the assumptions with surround you in everyday life. An interest in the topic is necessary and this is definitely not a gut. The papers aren't too difficult but you definitely need to work to get an A.",
    "I feel like I can't really have any complaints about this class, because it was everything Professor Lofton said it would be on the first day. Any problems I had with it I could easily have foreseen, but I decided to stick with it anyway. She does speak very quickly and \"with bombast\" as she put it (if this annoys you on the first day, know that you will not suddenly find it charming later. It can feel very condescending at times) she does not post the lecture slides online, and the class really is much more theoretical than you might guess, based less in examples of sexuality in our modern life and much more in dense, difficult texts. So I would say that there were some things about the class that really frustrated me (like how sometimes the powerpoint slides would consist only of one word,such as \"queer,\" or \"charisma\" and yet Lofton would talk for about a half hour about that slide while I tried desperately to copy down what she was saying). Know that this is NOT a gut, despite the name. However, I think ultimately it really changed the way I think about certain issues, and I'm glad to have read and thought about the texts that we did. The topics and authors we covered have come up a lot in the other history classes I've taken, so just for that I'd say it's definitely valuable. Definitely this course if you're interested in religious and American history, and if you're a history major interested in a different approach to stuff you may have heard about before but not from this perspective.",
    "If you want to be confused (in both good and bad ways) take this class. prof. Lofton is an original thinker, but in a lecture setting she will leave you in the dust and clearly doesn't want to spend time on issues where people struggle (she often encouraged students to drop out of the class, even if they enjoyed the material). But she will also take the world around us, and the dialogues and discourses we have constructed about sexuality and religion, to task. There was way more emphasis on sexuality than religion, which was a major problem for this. While I am interested in the intersection of these two things, I took this class because of its applications for religious history--I got very little of that. While I understand underlying themes about how and where the two intersect, I didn't learn much about the history of religion in America, or about how different people understand God(s).",
    "Don't take if you don't like being confused everyday--her language\/vocabulary was beyond me. Not recommended as a freshman course unless taken Cr\/D",
    "great class if only you like the material",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS",
    "It's an interesting class that you don't necessarily have to do all of the reading for. Lofton is a good, but totally crazy instructor. She also made a point of grading more difficulty this year.",
    "if you've ever thought about your sexuality, or sex, or religion, take this courseWATCH OUT FOR THE MIDTERM THOUGH! That is quite the doozy...regardless of how hard you study. take it in stride",
    "This class willblow your mind, saying that this is not a class for everyone. There will definitely be many moments where you will have no idea about what is going on in class or in your readings, Foucault is obtuse and the material is difficult, but it will change how you see the world. The topics discussed in this class are fascinating and Prof. Lofton is incredible, but be prepared to work really hard. Also as Prof. Lofton spoke about in the very first lecture, this is not a class to learn to have sex, nor is it a class for those love sex but hate religion or those who love religion but hate sex.",
    "This class is what is sounds like - a course on the interplay of sexuality and religion in America - how they affect each other, how talking about sexuality has created perceptions of it, etc. It's not as historical as it sounds - more about theory and then connecting to contemporary examples (some history later in the course). One lecture a week is theoretical, other is more example-based. Prof. Lofton is really cool and obviously super smart which makes her a little difficult to follow at times, but definitely worth it if you make it through. Semi-tough grader but she's sympathetic. Definitely recommend!",
    "sure take it, just know that its not a history so much as a theory class",
    "NO.",
    "This is a great class. Definitely take it.The professor alone makes it worthwhile. Don't get intimidated by her or the class, what you learn is worth it. She's a great speaker and she cares a lot about what she's teaching you. make sure you stay for the last lecture. It's worth your time.",
    "I don't think you have to listen to Prof Lofton's warning at the first class that you shouldn't take the class if you have strong feelings about religion or strong feelings about sexuality. Take it, listen critically, and find a good section (this depends on whether you want a History or Religious Studies slant). Entertaining, ridiculous, and rigorous lectures: don't miss them if you want to really know what Foucault is saying and how it relates to Oprah.",
    "YES YES YES. An amazing class, amazing professor, amazing TA's, amazing material.",
    "The class was great for understanding the history of sexuality and looking at how specific religious thought shapes our perceptions of sex and our societal morals today.I wish I had committed more to the class because the lectures are interesting as well as the readings and discussion section. I am sure if you have an interest in religious studies you will love the class. There are easier Humanities credits. This class has pretty high standards for the 3 assigned essays.",
    "This is a great class! It's changed my life and forced me to think in ways I never have. The first two or three lectures were difficult to grasp because of the nature of the topic, sexuality and religion, but you will come to love this course just for that reason. Also, Kathryn Lofton's lectures are well-organized, well-prepared, passionate, and poetic. I've never missed even one of them! She is one of the forerunners of the study of sexuality and religion, so if you get a chance to take the course, then I HIGHLY recommend it.Lofton is great. She's willing to meet with students, even outside of office hours to discuss the course material. She truly loves what she does, and she makes you want to succeed in the course because she works so hard. It takes a week or two to get used to her expansive vocabulary and her tendency, like many social theorists, to make up words. But I find that most professors' lecture styles take some getting used to.The readings for this course span the historical and the social, but they center themselves around the lecture. Lofton doesn't make the connections for you. You make your own connections in this course with the \"tools\" provided in lectures, readings, and discussion sections. Many students fear or dislike this independence, but I personally enjoyed taking ownership of the material and deciding for myself what I agreed and disagreed with. She also provides weekly reading questions to help guide your thinking. If you have the time to do them throughout the semester, you're in good shape for the midterm and final because she takes the exam questions straight from the list of reading questions.",
    "As an engineering major this class was my first humanities class and I loved it. I would definitely recommend the class because the readings are very interesting and the class and section-led discussions are very insightful. Professor Lofton is great and inspires confidence in everyone.",
    "I would not recommend this class to just any fellow student. While I did enjoy the class overall, I would describe my experience with the class as a love\/hate relationship. Throughout the year, I frequently found myself frustrated with the complexity of the ideas presented in lecture but enthralled by the readings every week. Similarly, though I often found Professor Lofton difficult to follow, when I finally did understand her arguments and began to adopt the analytical lens she provided the class, the experience was very rewarding and mind-blowing. Therefore, I would recommend this class to a student willing to take on a challenging, frustrating, and often stressful intellectual experience in order to reap the unbounded benefits that followed. I'm not sure if I would take it again, but the class has certainly changed the way I see the world and I will NEVER look at sexuality the same way.",
    "Words cannot describe how amazing this class is. The material itself is extremely interesting (starts off super dense, but gets better), but it's Professor Lofton that makes the course worthwhile. She is the best lecturer I've ever had the privilege of hearing.",
    "THIS IS THE GREATEST CLASS. TAKE IT. The course material is fascinating. You will become obsessed with Kathryn Lofton. She is passionate, engaging, challenging, and an amazing lecturer.",
    "I wouldn't recommend this course, it is not an easy gut class like some might think. The grading is unnecessarily harsh, especially on the midterm.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class. It really teaches you to see the world, and specifically your sexuality and faith, differently. Yes, there is a lot of reading, but almost all of it is interesting and engaging. One of the most exciting aspects of the class is getting to see all of these seemingly detached topics come together, and realizing how much in the world is linked.",
    "Religion and Sexuality is a great class. The topic is extremely interesting, although it was much theoretical than I thought it would be (get ready to read Foucault). Professor Lofton is brilliant, and an amazing lecturer, albeit a fast talker. It was a fantastic class, in that there was a lot of material that was extremely hard to grasp, but the material that was tested was very fair, and clarified throughreadings and section. If you haven't taken a gender studies or religious studies class before, definitely try this one.",
    "Hmmm, I'd think twice about taking this class. I really loved the subject matter - it was probably the most interesting class I had this semester. HOWEVER, I took it as an extra class under the impression that the readings were easy and that the professor was great. This class turned out being the most work of all, and I didn't enjoy the professor's teaching style. If you are a quick reader or can put time into the readings, go for it, because they're mostly interesting (except for Foucault - whom you will see EVERYWHERE after taking the class).",
    "YES",
    "I would recommend this course. There is a lot of reading but most of it is interesting and the reading questions help a lot. The abstractness of the course is frustrating sometimes. The second half of the class is a lot better than the first.",
    "I would definitely recommend AMST 111. You have the opportunity to read fascinating texts, be in an awesome and engaging lecture and learn about interesting topics that you may not have previously considered. We have a significant amount of reading but it is fascinating and the workload is definitely manageable overall. We have weekly reading responses, graded as check plus, check or check minus, and three main essays over the course of the semester. We also have a midterm and a final (and the final is taken online from anywhere we want to take it).",
    "I can't really summarize this class - its scope is too big. I can only say that you'll come away with an increased tendency to criticize or at least question many of the 'truths' we so quickly accept.",
    "Religion and Sexuality is an interesting survey into the interplay of sexuality and religion in American culture. The course focuses primarily on Protestantism's historical influence on US sexuality, and Michel Foucault is studied. This course also takes students thoroughly through the history and trends in the gay rights movements toward the end of the term. This course can be very difficult for a non-humanities major, and the level of writing and creativity of thought and analysis expected is very high. This is by no means a gut course or an easy humanities credit.",
    "This is a great class to attempt to think more deeply about something that can be considered a daily action or thought, I would recommend it.",
    "Sexuality and Religion was a thought-provoking experience that challenged my preconceived notions about sexuality, and the interaction between world religions and the sexual self. I would highly recommend WGSS 111 to any student interested in exploring the domain of sexuality and religion, or expanding their sociological knowledge.",
    "Amazing. Take this class if you know what's good for you.",
    "At first I really disliked this class. It seemed really abstract and pointless. Lofton seemed like she didn't really want people to take her class. However, as the semester went on, I realized I was learning so much and thinking about things in a new way. People should take this class.",
    "Best class I've ever taken at Yale. Go to the first couple of lectures and decide if you like how Lofton lectures. If you do, you are in for one hell of a wonderful experience (she is so accessible, so brilliant, so charismatic, so helpful, so cool). A very \"messy\" course in that it's hard to say exactly what knowledge I've learned, but a lot of that's by design, and the critical thinking skills this class has taught me can be used in many more contexts than this one. Might be a religious studies major as a result of how great this class was.",
    "This is a fantastic course. Kathryn Lofton is a goddess. If you have any interest in this class, take it; she not only changes and broadens your views on religion and sexuality, but also on how classes and learning should exist at Yale.",
    "I think this was a good course for those who were looking for what this course offered -- an interdisciplinary look at different areas of religion and sexuality acrosshistory. However, I don't think it was the right course for me. At the end of the course I don't think I got a lot out of it, probably because I didn't engage with the material as well as I could have. I feel that there were no ties unifying the course, and we kind of just touched on a lot of disparate topics. I don't think all courses need a \"point\" or a \"theme,\" but even at the end of this one I'm not sure what exactly I learned. Also the lectures aren't posted online, which makes it hard to pay attention in class when all you're doing is try to type down everything on the slides and everything Prof Lofton is saying verbatim since the lectures are so chockful of material. This made it hard to really try to understand what she's talking about during lecture, since you're just frantically transcribing the entire time. I think for those who take a look at the syllabus and are interested in what they see, they could take this course. For the rest of us, especially those from other disciplines who are taking a WGSS course for the first time, this may not be your cup of tea.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class! It is both well taught and very interesting, and I feel like I left it with some new techniques for approaching certain topics. Professor Lofton is fantastic, and the sections were a great supplement. Overall, a really great class.",
    "I would recommend it but would suggest keeping an open mind.",
    "Sexuality and Religion is a very well-named class: it deals with precisely that, although as its placement in the American Studies department belies the fact that it focuses almost exclusively on the interaction of those two categories in the history and culture of the United States, with several forays into other places. Lectures deals with larger, philosophical categories: ritual, charisma, family, etc., as well as the thought of Freud, Foucault and others.I would wholeheartedly recommend this class for everyone willing to put in the work. I found it highly rewarding both academically and personally, and it was one of those classes that I will never forget.",
    "It's a midsized lecture class connecting basic themes of sexuality to those seen in American religion. I would only recommend it to those who can tolerate tenuous connections, as I sometimes had trouble dealing with aspects of the material that I deemed \"made up.\" It's not like anything I've studied before, though, so the class was eye opening.",
    "I would summarize it as a necessary tool for navigating college.",
    "Guys, seriously. She is the GREATEST lecturer at Yale. People walked out everyday thinking she had read the new gospel. The course covers a lot of cool history and theory pertaining to American religious history and the formation of the construct (oh yea, its a construct) of sexuality. It makes you see our culture in a whole new way. If you're committed to doing the work (not too bad, but a fair amount of reading, a few papers, a midterm, and a final) and ACTUALLY attending lecture (crucial) you will get a TON out of this class. It is worth it just to take a Lofton class before you graduate. You'll see the awesome direction that academia could take in the next few years.",
    "Yes, History 129 01 helped me better conceptualize how sexuality functions in the world.",
    "If you are interested in the role sexuality has played in religion as well as the role religion played in sexuality, then this is a great class. It is not a class that is polarized in any way. In other words, it will not tell you that religion is more important than sexuality, nor that sexuality is more important than religion. Instead, the class analyzes the multi-dimensional interplay between the two. I would definitely recommend this to anyone curious about it.",
    "A great class for if you have any interest in religion or sexuality I would highly recommend it. You don't need any previous knowledge.",
    "I'm don't think that I would recommend it unless the student is particularly interested in the subject material. Read the syllabus and glance through some of the readings before you decide to take it if you can. Especially Foucault.",
    "The professor's lecturing style was difficult to deal with at times for me, but the readings were very interesting and on a topic I wouldn't have normally thought about. I learned some pretty interesting things, but I would consider taking it credit\/D.",
    "The class itself was enjoyable but did require a lot of academic reading which was difficult to synthesize on your own. The lectures also required a lot of work in terms of understanding what was happening. The class is meant to be enjoyed by a very particular type of student that is interested in religion and has minimal difficultly drawing comparisons between difficult works of academic literature. If a student enjoys making these comparisons, then this class is for that student.",
    "I would definitely recommend it to someone and would describe it as a course that is a conflation of religious studies, history, and philosophy (with the core being Foucault).",
    "If I had a little more background in WGSS before I came to this class, I think I would have enjoyed it more and understood it better in the beginning. However, I still think Religion and Sexuality is a good introduction to the WGSS major, albeit a fast-paced and challenging one. WGSS is a very interesting major which covers a spectrum of relevant issues, including gender, sexuality, queer history, and all the forces in the world that interact with it, including religion, pop culture, politics, and more. I would recommend WGSS to any student interested in studying the forces that affect gender, sexuality, queer culture as well as studying those subjects themselves.",
    "If you doon't give up on it for being too vague and abstract at first, I guarantee it'll change the way you thing about topics of sex, religion, power, and politics. I'll be quoting things from this class for years to come. Couple that with an awesome professor and it can be an amazing class. Papers aren't graded harshly at all and you get plenty of hints about the tests which makes studying for them not too bad.",
    "THIS CLASS IS AMAZING!! PROF. LOFTON IS THE BESSSTTTT",
    "The evolution of religion and sexuality through time and how it has played out in different contexts.",
    "I would not recommend this class. See above.",
    "A wonderful class, the kind you don't want to end. I highly recommend it. At least shop it if you're not sure at first, Prof. Lofton might really sway you one way or another.",
    "This isn't actually a class. It's a semester-long indoctrination ritual for the cult of Kathryn Lofton. But don't be afraid. It's a great cult, and you really want to be a part of it. Believe the hype.",
    "Sexuality and religion was an excellent course. Kathryn Lofton is not only a great lecturer, but also very in tune to ways in which she can relate the course material to popular culture. During lecture, it was not rare to watch clips from Oprah, music videos, or movie trailers that were somehow relevant to the course. There was a significant amount of reading at times, but they were almost always interesting. The three writing assignments were very reasonable with regard to length. The midterm was a fair test of the material we had covered up to that point. However, if I remember correctly the class average as a B-. The final exam consisted of 3 essays (there were 5 choices) and all of the prompts were fair and well-written. I thoroughly enjoyed taking this class."
