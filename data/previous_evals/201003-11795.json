    "Professor Smith sincerely wants the students to learn and that shows. However, the grading system is not made clear. Just make sure you ask those question because they are not on the syllabus.",
    "Yes, I'd definitely recommend it! You learn so much about the weather- very appropriate for New Haven and its fickle weather patterns. However, if you don't like lots of equations and problems, then I'd avoid it. It's definitely not an easy science credit. It's also a requirement for the EVST major, so students majoring in that can take the class seriously.",
    "Required for EVST majors. Poor class set up. The book only gives vague background info and the course material is difficult to find anywhere besides the notes, so you must go to class. A good portion is focused on equations. Problem sets every week, 3 exams, and a final.",
    "Speaking from the perspective of a graduate student with a keen interest in many of the topics covered by the course, I found the material presented in G&G 140 engaging and highly relevant. Many of the basic concepts are critical to later study in the climate-related fields, and I wish I had taken a similar integrative course as an undergraduate.",
    "Not really. This course is a very general overview to the subject matter. I don't know if this is an artifact of that fact, but it was not very well organized which made it difficult to assimilate the material. Also it was very difficult to ascertain what material you needed to know and would be held accountable for on exams. The material in the book didn't align that closely with the lectures. Then the lectures sometimes weren't detailed or in depth enough to really understand what turned out to be pivotal material. All that being said, I did learn a lot from the course, but it really wasn't until the end that I started to truly understand how all the pieces fit together.",
    "Yes, it is a good class but you have to attend lecture. He doesn't use powerpoint for most of the lectures, and the ones that he does, they don't actually contain the important information. Essentially, you learn concepts from the book and the equations from class. Since 2\/3 of each test is quantitative, those are really important. Obviously take it if you are an EVST major, or if you are interested in atmospheric science, but go to class!! Its fairly easy.",
    "If you're an EVST major, you have to take this course, but I would recommend taking it early and with friends. It's a fun class, but it's better if you take it when you know you can be on top of it and if you have a good study group. If you're interested in learning about the mechanics and processes behind meteorology and climate change, I would also highly recommend taking this course, though it might be wise to take it credit\/D.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. It is at 9.25am in the ESC building (next to the Peabody), but I was happy enough to go to the course to get up at 8, eat breakfast, and make the trek to almost every lecture.",
    "YES. TAKE THIS CLASS.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this to everyone of all science\/math skill levels. The course has quantitative components but it is nothing that you wouldn't have learned in high school (basic physics, chemistry). I really enjoyed his lectures, which were well structured. It really makes you re-examine and appreciate the natural phenomena that you see around you everyday. Take it!",
    "Good class if you're interested in a general overview of how our weather system works. I would definitely recommend it because the workload is not high and the material is applicable to the understanding of everyday phenomena.",
    "This is a great, comprehensive study of the environment. It's a decent amount of work, but you get to learn about relevant topics in atmospheric science from a great professor.",
    "This is a great general introduction to meteorology, oceanography, and climatology. It doesn't get bogged down in the mathematics, so it is easily accessible, and the material is very fascinating. I would say that the midterms were too long, but on the other hand, each of them is only worth about 10% of your grade (there are 3, so they comprise about 1\/3 of the final grade). Also, problem sets are very manageable. Lastly, Professor Smith is FANTASTIC. Overall, I'd say if you enjoy science but aren't a science major, you'll find this class fun and very relevant to many issues today.",
    "This class basically uses mathematical modeling to understand weather patterns, air circulation, and ocean currents. We also learn about broad environmental studies themes like El Nino and Hadley Cells. It was an ok class; the weekly problem sets are a good way of testing your knowledge and bumping up your grade, and the exams aren't too difficult.",
    "It is a great class. However, at times it seems deceptively easy- don't underestimate the amount you need to study. If you do study, it should be pretty easy. At the end of the term you feel accomplished that you have learned so much about meteorology and global warming. TAKE GOOD NOTES because most of the information on the tests come only from class material and isn't covered in the textbook",
    "This class is very hard for those who haven't taken at least a physics or very quantitative type class beforehand, the class is very quantitative. Readings aren't particularly connected to the classwork, you'll need to pick and choose which chapters to read. Work in groups, not alone for the psets and labs in this class.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS. You will learn so much about the world around you. It's by no means an easy A, but the math and physics will not kill you. If you're looking for a QR, pick this class hands down. If this is for the EVST major, it will be your favorite class ever. It's organized, Ron Smith is personable and an expert in his field, and you'll come away feeling academically satisfied. This class is truly a gem.",
    "I would totally recommend this course. It's easy enough to take without previously taking any science classes at Yale (thought a grounding in high school sciences is helpful, so remember your most basic physics equations), but hard enough to require effort on the problem sets and especially on the tests. Again, do keep in mind that this is an easy class only if you are willing to put in all effort required to accomplish the work. These problems sets are not the kind you can start Thursday night, finish Friday morning, and get a high A on.The subject matter was excellent. It has changed the way I think about the world, and I mean this in all seriousness. I'm definitely not a science person, but this was an excellent choice for a science credit. If you're taking DS, though, the additional workload of the lab can get annoying.",
    "This class was great. I learned a lot of important information, and the technical concepts were not that difficult to grasp. The information is very relevant to today's world, and even if you are not an environmental studies major, everything in the class can be applied in everyday life. I would definitely recommend this class!",
    "The class is relatively painless and interesting. Unfortunately, the lab was frequently rather tedious. I would be wary of taking this class unless you want to major in the subject.",
    "Atmospheres is a course that covers material everybody should know, including how the weather works, the nature of El Ni\u00f1o, and what humans are doing to accelerate global warming (this, however, is not the only class at Yale that teaches this material). The classes are generally interesting, the Professor is great, the problem sets are reasonable, and there isn\u0092t too much reading (the textbook is nice and easy to read). It seems initially that this is a gut science class, but be warned that the tests are fairly difficult and require a lot of mathematical calculations. In general, I think that this is a useful class that anybody interested in talking about the environment should take. If you are a science major or mathematically inclined, this should be an easy course. If not, be warned that you will probably struggle and have difficulty finishing the exams. Also, before you sign up for this course, read the reviews for the required lab, which I found both time consuming and boring.",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone who needs a QR requirement fulfilled , but also to those who want to discover a little bit more about this field of study. Beware, it does focus have a mathematics and chemistry aspect to it, so don't be tripped up by it when asked a lot of quantitative questions on the exams. The topics and material is relevant and interesting.",
    "I would absolutely not recommend this class to another student. Seriously, don't waste your time unless you need it for your major. I needed a QR credit and wanted to take an EVST class, so despite similarly negative reviews I decided to focus on the positive reviews and try the class out. I regret it. Sure, I learned some interesting things, but the professor either didn't seem to care or didn't know what was going on, because the class was disorganized and difficult to do well in, mostly by virtue of the fact that the tests focused on calculations while lectures focused on descriptive material. There are much better courses to take for a QR credit, and much better classes in the EVST department to take for fun.",
    "This is a cool class, and by the end of the semester you will have a good, broad understanding of how the earth works as a giant system. Currents, climates, weather systems, prevailing winds, global warming... it all fits together and you leave the class knowing the basics of how these things work.I will say that the class seems pretty easy at first, but it gets to be real work. Based on the first few classes and problem sets, I thought the class would be a sure gut, but problem sets got harder, and the tests were HARD. The best advice I can give is to start studying for the tests early, and know how to do all of the equations you did in class WITHOUT AN EQUATION SHEET, because unless he changes it for next year, the sheet you get is basically useless and contains as much misinformation as helpful formulae.ProfessorSmith is a really cool guy, and it's clear he loves the material he's teaching. He also makes a big effort to help students learn, from asking any\/all questions in class and hosting review sessions for tests (rather than having TAs do that like in every other class you'll take at Yale) to learning dropping into each lab to answer questions and memorizing the names of everyone in the course by the first midterm. Professor Smith is a great guy in every respect, and makes the class that much better.Though the problem sets and labs can be VERY frustrating and the exams a VERY HARD, this class is still one worth taking if you're interested in the science behind how the world works.",
    "A great overview of the key fields of environmental studies. The meteorology segment was really fascinating! It's early and it can feel like a trek up science hill, but I really think it was worth it. It was my favorite class this semester. The one downside is that much of the course is oversimplified and it doesn't go too deeply into the physics or chemistry behind the topics of study.",
    "I would highly recommend this class.I have thought about being an EVST major but don\u0092t think I will be--even so, I\u0092m really glad I took this class and would strongly recommend it to non-EVST majors. It\u0092s a fairly practical science class\u0097you use what you learn when you go outside or look at a weather map in the newspaper. The tests are definitely challenging but that should not deter you. The professor is a fantastic teacher\u0097he really knows and clearly cares about what he is teaching. I loved being able to understand the weather better\u0097and I especially liked learning more about global warming, and the urgent need to reduce our carbon emissions to avert it, and\u0097at the end of the semester\u0097about energy sources of the future. This class included a great smattering of subjects (but it still held topically together)\u0097it was a great introduction to the oceans, the atmosphere, clouds, daily weather, pollution, global climate and climate change, and energy technology. The problem sets can be somewhat challenging but I actually thought they were a lot of fun--and they help you absorb the skills you're learning in class. A very fun class.",
    "I took it because it is a requirement for the Environmental Studies major but I'm glad I did. I learned a lot of practical things about meteorology, ocean currents, and climate change."
