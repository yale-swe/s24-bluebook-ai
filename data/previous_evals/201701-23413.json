    "If you are interested in epidemiology within hospitals or the medical field, I would highly recommend this course. It is taught by two MDs that have experience in controlling infections within the hospital setting. The lessons I learned from them are topics that I wouldn't have been able to read about anywhere else. Very good course, and the workload is very fair.",
    "Good topics on hospital infections. Some topics overlap but overall good course.",
    "This course was a really great introduction to healthcare epidemiology and was taught by professors and guest lecturers that were so knowledgeable in the field. My only real critique is that a lot of the assignments had wording or questions that were confusing--it was hard to tell what the question was asking.",
    "I found the course to be lacking in structure and I was often confused with what was required.",
    "The hands-on aspect of the class was very well done, with a variety of in-class case studies, group research\/presentations, and the tour of the hospital. I believe the balance of assigned readings, informative lectures, and more applied activities made this class both engaging and valuable for any student interested in healthcare epidemiology",
    "Improvement: the course can be more interactive. I think group case studies really help in understanding the concepts in the classes.",
    "It is a good course"

    "Instructor: Louise-Marie Dembry \u00a0Dr. Dembry was a phenomenal professor. She really knows everything about this field, which came across in her lectures. The only thing I wish is that she didn't use slides so much. I got much more out of her just talking to the class. Perhaps chalk talks would be more engaging for student participation?",
    "Instructor: Louise-Marie Dembry \u00a0Extremely knowledgeable and was able to provide interesting insights from years of experience in the field.",
    "Instructor: Louise-Marie Dembry \u00a0Extremely knowledgable",
    "Instructor: Louise-Marie Dembry \u00a0Great! Very responsive to emails and questions and very knowledgeable in her field. She was always an engaging and interesting lecturer.",
    "Instructor: Louise-Marie Dembry \u00a0Dr . Dembry was a great instructor and was very attentive to her students. She provided great insight into Healthcare Epi!",
    "Instructor: Louise-Marie Dembry \u00a0Professor Dembry is a phenomenal instructor, often sharing stories and insight from her own professional experiences to help enrich course materials and topics. She made herself available to her students, supporting them in and outside the classroom. I truly appreciated learning from her this semester.",
    "Instructor: Louise-Marie Dembry \u00a0She's very good in explaining the concepts.",

    "I thoroughly enjoyed this class - it was an exciting opportunity to see a practical side of healthcare epidemiology and the challenges associated with managing infectious disease spread within healthcare settings. The Yale New Haven Hospital tour was a rewarding, hands-on learning experience.",
    "Focus on hospital infections and prevention.",
    "I would recommend this to other students. When I took it we had an interesting mix of MPH students, clinicians, and even hospital infection preventionists that audited the course. It was really interesting to hear all of these different perspectives and learn from not only the professor, but my peers as well.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this class!",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to any student interested in the topic of healthcare epidemiology",
    "This course is good in understanding the concepts in healthcare epidemiology.",
    "Recommended"
