   "comments": [
    "History and Politics is the best foundation in political thought you could hope for; it is a rare opportunity to become a better thinker, writer, and reader, and it is worth every late night and 20-hour day in the library. Strongly recommend this course to anyone who wants to consider what humans really are and why they do what they do.",
    "Take it. Best class I've taken at yale. Historically, thematically, stylistically significant to writing, reading, and just general understanding of the philosophy of politics and its evolution.",
    "Absolutely\u0097it helps one understand the modern political conversation with such greater depth of understanding. Further, and perhaps more importantly, these are works which will prompt deep personal reflection, about human nature, politics, rights, ethics, and ones place in all of it. While there is a lot of reading (at times too much, in this course particularly), one certainly needn't do all of it (although the experience is much richer if one can!). The DS experience can vary greatly with professors, and while that is a danger, Prof Thompson (and most of the spring faculty, as I came to understand it) is excellent.",
    "Brief overview of Western political philosophy. You can't go wrong with DS!",
    "Really interesting texts that remain pertinent. The most interesting reading in second semester. So cool.",
    "Second-semester DS H\/P is a wonderful course - a ways better, in my opinion, than first semester H\/P. Professor Thompson is an extremely talented section leader who knows when to jump in and when to butt out. She also gives very helpful essay feedback.",
    "I would absolutely recommend Directed Studies. It is about as much work as you can assign yourself freshman year, but more than worth it. Also although it is time consuming the work itself is not particularly strenuous-- a lot of reading, that's all, and a 5 pg paper that you whip out by the end of the year. The professors and the small seminars make it all worthwhile. The Directed Studies environment is incredibly intellectually stimulating and makes you feel part of a community instantly at yale.",
    "Prof. Thompson is a masterful section leader - with just slight nudges she can get the discussion moving in exciting directions. Don't expect very much input from her.",
    "you know if DS is right for you. But I loved it and I'm really glad I didn't drop, although I almost did.",
    "A great introduction to some famous western political works. However, spending so little time on each, don't expect to understand any of them in depth. Instead it lets you see the development of certain themes over the course of history. It'll also really help your ability to write good essays under a time constraint. Worth doing, but be prepared for a ton of reading every week that you won't always be motivated to do.",
    "Yes. It is a lot of work, but well worth it.",
    "Thompson is one of the great DS professors. She demands good thinking and good writing. Don't miss out!",
    "It's a reading intensive course and the history\/politics are a bit more difficult to understand than 1st semester but it's definitely worth it to learn about the more modern politics. I would recommend this class but warn the students that it definitely isn't a walk in the park."
