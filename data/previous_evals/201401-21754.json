    "TAKE THIS CLASS. It is so wonderful. It's a lot of work but so worth it. It feels like you're procrastinating because the projects are a ton of fun. This was my first art class and I loved it. This isn't just about learning how to use InDesign and Photoshop. You use them- but learning them is mostly on your own time. (Don't worry about it- there is some in class introduction.) This class is about learning to think visually and express yourself logically in a very creative form. I really wish I could take it again...",
    "Good class. It really got me to think carefully and intentionally about graphic design -- rather than just try and put nice looking stuff together on a page. I also really liked all the exacto-knife action that was going on. It is a lot of work though, and critiques get shoot-yourself-in-the-foot-just-to-break-up-the-monotony boring, so go prepared for that. There are very high standards of craftmanship and composition -- which are good for cultivating good practice as far as design goes, but sometimes hard to meet when you're taking four other classes. Also, classes would regularly go late, which gets a little annoying.",
    "Yes, but you learn as much as you put in. Have a great interest in the subject material. The class is also a requirement for upper-level, more helpful courses.",
    "A good way to challenge your way of thinking in regards to design and art. It would benefit all people, I think.",
    "This class is great, especially if you study art, because it forces you to think about the messages you send when you use any visual elements, which is related to all forms of art, not just graphic design, but something I had not thought about with regards to my medium, photography.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to those looking to get a thorough crash course in graphic design. Note, though, that this class emphasizes ideas over technique, and focuses on enabling students to express ideas graphically rather than teaching them to use certain software. It did, however, make me see the world in a slightly different way and become more keenly aware of how information is transmitted to us.",
    "I would recommend this class if someone has an interest in photography - this is such a significant portion of the class that the class becomes difficult if you are not interested in taking photos. Otherwise, it is a good design intro class. The InDesign tutorial was especially useful.",
    "Definitely worth taking. Just be aware that it's especially true of this class that the more you put in, the more you get out."
