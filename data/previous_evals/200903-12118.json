   "comments": [
    "Professor Manley is a kind and relaxed English Professor!I enjoyed the class discussions, and they were accessible given my limited knowledge of Renaissance Poets.Not a bad choice for an elective!",
    "Not excellent, not terrible. Pretty much reading and essays for a poetry class, and we never had lively discussion. But Manley knows a lot, so if you're really into Renaissance it could be great.",
    "It's a introduction to lyric poetry, very broad and covering a lot of authors. I wouldn't take it again because I didn't like the subject, but if it's your thing then it's probably great.",
    "This class gives you a good introduction to Renaissance poetry of all forms. The part about early Renaissance poetry is especially strong.",
    "There's a little bit of a gap in Yale's course offerings when it comes to 16th- and 17th-century poets (not including Shakespeare, obviously), and this survey course does a pretty good job of filling it. Wyatt and Sidney in particular were revelations, as were Marvell, Jonson and Herbert. If you're interested in Renaissance poetry but a little tired with Milton and Shakespeare, this is a good way of getting a look at the lesser-known (though still pretty awesome) poets of that epoch.Professor Manley is incredibly knowledgeable, and he is an able leader of discussions. Generally speaking, it is better to read only a few of the poems he assigns and get to know them well than to skim all of them. (In an ideal world, obviously, everyone would read everything).One more thing: don't be put off by Spenser. I still haven't really understood why he's such a big deal (like everyone else, I suffered bitterly at his hands in English 125), but he only takes up a day or two on the syllabus. Power through!",
    "Manley is very knowledgeable and a pretty cool guy. There's a slightly higher than normal amount of reading and the reading for the first week or two is somewhat boring, but after that it picks up lovely. It's also a very comprehensive course and one you should take, just to explore the canon and develop a god background.",
    "Renaissance Lyric definitely fulfills a pre-1800 requirement. Class discussions were lackluster at best. Minimal preparation was needed for class itself though there were quite a few papers. Take it if you have to."
