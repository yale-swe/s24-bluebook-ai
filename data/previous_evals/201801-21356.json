    "A natural extension of ITAL 110. After taking this course, I have become a much stronger speaker, reader, writer, and listener in the Italian language. I now know all of the major verb tenses in the Italian language, many of the nuanced grammatical points, and have a much wider set of vocabulary.",
    "I have built on my knowledge of Italian from my first semester in L1. This semester, we learned more about the country and its culture (along with an amazing art gallery visit)!!",
    "I learned italian",
    "Italian language and culture",
    "I learned how to keep up with material and keep building off prior knowledge to form complete thoughts in Italian."

   "comments": [
    "This class is excellent. The Italian department has amazing professors, the material is interesting, and the grading and assignment schemes are fair. One weakness is definitely pace. There were some times in the semester where we had exams and quizzes each week, three weeks in a row, and other times when we wouldn't have an exam for a month. I think this class would be much more enjoyable if the exams and quizzes were spaced out more evenly. Nothing was ever excessively difficult, but a bit burdensome.",
    "The weekly writing assignments increasingly got longer in word count and, towards the end of the semester, became more of a burden to finish than an opportunity to explore the language through creative writing. Aside from that, I have really enjoyed this class and this language!",
    "There was a lot of material to cover and I struggles a little towards the end",
    "Textbook isn't organized very well; supersite is overpriced; otherwise good",
    "This course was very engaging and fast paced. It could be improved by maybe slowing down in the last couple of weeks when we had about two or three days per chapter."

    "I wholeheartedly recommend this course. Not only is Simona an amazing professor, but also the rest of the professors in the Italian Department. You will learn so much in L2 and really feel like you have a strong grip on the Italian language as compared to L1. Take this class! You will not regret it.",
    "Yes. I would recommend that other students who take the course have Simona as their teacher. She is a wonderful teacher.",
    "I would absolutely recommend taking Italian! I have loved learning the language and the Italian department is great at Yale!",
    "I took the intro italian courses as a senior looking to learn a new skill during my last year. Would recommend.",
    "If you want to learn Italian, take the class",
    "Yes if they want to learn Italian",
    "Yes, this course is incredibly enjoyable while remaining challenging. The professor wants to see you master the language and you feel supported in that endeavor."
