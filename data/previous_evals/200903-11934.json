   "comments": [
    "It's a good course. The professor definitely gave me some eye-openers on the Quixote, and you could tell that he is one of the world's leading scholars on this work. Sometimes I felt treated like a child though: attendance was taken at every lecture, and the professor frequently dropped phrases like \"as explained in Elliott's Chapter 6; which you should have read by now\" or \"the argument is given in further detail in my casebook; which I am sure you have read\". But apart from that, good course.",
    "This class is the best literature class I have ever taken, coming from a LIterature major. The professor is the best I have had at Yale. I would not only recommend this course to other students, but I would go as far as to say that if you end up not taking this course and you are interested in Spanish or LIterature, you are definitely missing out on a huge part of what Yale has to offer. A great book taught by a great professor.",
    "Take this class if you're prepared to do a lot of reading and write a bunch of short essays, which is harder than you think",
    "Take it. It's one of the most important works of literature, and there's no better way to approach it than in this class.",
    "Don Quixote is an amazing book and there is really no better way to read it.",
    "This class was fantastic! Wonderful teaching team. Professor Gonzalez is probably more knowledgeable on this topic than anyone else in the world. The novel is genius, the lectures were intriguing, and the TA's were fantastic.",
    "Take it. Do not be worried about reading only book-Don Quixote is worth it!",
    "This is one of the best classes I have taken at Yale. Professor Gonzalez is a wonderful lecturer, and his comments about the Quixote are insightful and exciting. It is an incredibly enjoyable and worthwhile class. Basically, all you do is read Don Quixote and then listen to lectures about it. There are other supplementary readings, which are not all necessary. And you write 4 two-page papers (of which the topics are very broad, so you can decide what you want to write about), and then there is a take-home final. The reading load is about as much as any literature class, but the actual work load is much less. Take this class if you have any interest in the subject, or even if you don't. Everyone should read Don Quixote at some point, and this is a great way to do it!",
    "GREAT COURSE! A lot of work, but definitely worth it. I am a Spanish major, and this has so far been my favorite course. Just make sure you'll have time to read not only the Quixote, but also the supplemental books on the syllabus. They really give you a better understanding of the historical and figurative aspects of Cervantes' text.",
    "THIS WILL BE YOUR FAVORITE CLASS AT YALE. Definitely take it--you will NOT regret it!!! Professor Gonzalez is OUTSTANDING. you will learn so much from him, and Don Quixote is the best novel ever--it will change the way you read, period.",
    "Don Quixote covers the entire text of Cervantes' timeless masterpiece, as well as some of his other shorter works. In addition to these readings, the course covers relevant aspects of Spanish history that provide greater understanding of Cervantes' themes and writing style. Alongside the reading assignments there are several short papers, a midterm exam, and a take-home final. The grading is very fair across the board and the work is actually very enjoyable.I would absolutely recommend Don Quixote to a fellow student. The reading, professor, and TAs are all wonderful and the work is fun. I was a bit intimidated going in to the course because I had never taken a literature course\/done any college-level close-reading but I found myself loving the course and enjoying the challenges that the assignments posed. I fully intend to download the podcasts from the course when they are made available (the course was filmed this semester) so that I can listen to them again in the future. I truly believe that it is one of the best courses offered at Yale. Take it!"
