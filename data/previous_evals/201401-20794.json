   "comments": [
    "It is a class that focuses more on literature than on history, and you do need a very good level of Spanish, since most texts are in Spanish and discussion is entirely in that language. I would recommend the class.",
    "I would recommend taking this course if you are interested in reading a fair amount of novels dealing with the Spanish Civil War. I found it interesting, but it may be less so if you only have a mild interest in the topic.",
    "I would definitely recommend it. It's such an interesting course! You learn so much about the complexities of the Civil War and it's the farthest thing from cut-and-dried history.",
    "Spanish 367 is a complete study of the culture and art surrounding the Spanish Civil War. I would recommend this class, but I would caution the student to honest about his or her level of Spanish proficiency. This class demands a very high level of Spanish. The length and depth of the papers and the difficulty of some of the books required for the class were occasionally difficult for non-native speakers such as myself. That being said, if you are willing to devote the time to the class, it is absolutely possible to succeed.",
    "Spanish was half history class and half spanish. A lot of the books we read were in English so it wasn't a super intensive language class. I would recommend it, especially if you have an interest in Spain and the civil war.",
    "A great course overall, well-composed in terms of themes and other threads, but some of the Spanish reading is quite tough. I've lived in Mexico for some time, but I just don't have the vocabulary to read the books without a dictionary nearby. If you're going to do all the reading, it's time-consuming. I'd recommend the course regardless, though. Personally, it gave me much more insight into the nature of international relations prior to WW2, the reason for modern American interventionism, the attitude of the Third Reich pre-WW2 and Germany's relations with Italy, the malleability of the international presses and how people view wars in other countries as a result, how the residues of internal strife afflict countries, etc.",
    "If you have interest in the Spanish Civil War you have no reason not to take the class. The reading might get heavy at times but it is so enjoyable that it doesn't feel like a burden. You will truly learn a lot from the course.",
    "Pretty good class, if a bit dry on occasion."
