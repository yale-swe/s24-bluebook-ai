   "comments": [
    "This class is a typical grammar course, but it does have a lot of work. If you want to learn the language, this course will definitely help, but it does take up a decent amount of time.",
    "Advanced Spanish Grammar is not glamorous, but I would recommend it to anyone who wants to strengthen their Spanish. The class demands a lot from students in the way of written homework and being prepared for class, but this translates (no pun intended) to great improvement in language abilities. I'm not sure how valuable this class would be to people who grew up speaking and writing, but it was a great transition from high school Spanish at, for example, the IB level, to university and conversational Spanish. Take it with Juliana, if you can! The 9:25 time slot was worth it.",
    "I would recommend this class for anyone looking to improve their grammar. The content is actually very much review for a proficient Spanish speaker, but I still learned many new things. The class moves quite quickly and you have to make sure to stay on top of your comprehension, as the class is almost strictly and purely all grammar.",
    "Essentially, you go through the major topics of spanish grammar in a lot more detailed, nuanced way than you did in high school AP spanish. It's super interesting and I definitely recommend it.",
    "I would definitely recommend it to another student if they wanted to take more Spanish classes. It really solidifies grammar.",
    "I would summarize the course as one that is heavy in spanish grammar. There is an emphasis put on grammar and writing skills and less emphasis on speaking and conversation. I would recommend this course to another student as I feel it helped me to improve my grammar and this will be useful if I go on to take other spanish courses in the future.",
    "This is a class focused on the mechanics of writing, and less so on speaking. While students will get the chance to speak during class, there are other classes that will allow students to practice their presentation speaking. Nevertheless, this class is extremely valuable and worth taking if a student plans to pursue Spanish in any capacity in the future.",
    "It's essentially AP Spanish Language condensed into 1 semester. It's a course that requires you to do a lot of daily work that seems like busy work, but if you pay attention to the exercises, you learn a lot. I would recommend this course to a student that wants to brush up on their spanish skills, but as a fair warning, I would tell them that it is challenging, and that this isn't a blow-off class of any kind. However, as long as you put in the work, your grade will reflect what you've learned and worked for.",
    "Advanced Spanish Grammar is not the easiest course, but the expectations are very clear and well-coordinated. The workload can be quite a lot and it's easy to underestimate how long any given assignment might take; that being said, I still would absolutely recommend it for anyone looking to boost their Spanish writing abilities. Since it's a grammar course, the speaking expectation is not as great, though I imagine it's much improved over previous years with the addition of the speaking partners from Ecuador - that was intimidating at first, but incredibly rewarding as well. It's a solid language course and great for people coming fresh off of high school\/AP Spanish; plus, Professor Ramos-Ruano is an absolute delight and will be your number one supporter throughout the semester!",
    "Lots of work, but worth it if you're looking to improve your spanish."
