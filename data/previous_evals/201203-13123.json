   "comments": [
    "This is a brief political and social history of ancient Egypt. We covered the political history through the New Kingdom and then finished up with some social history. The class was excellent and Prof. Manassa is a very good lecturer. I would highly recommend this class to any student interested in ancient Egypt or in cross-cultural comparisons of social lives. A must-take for any the scholar of the ancient world.",
    "Sure! It's always good to have knowledge of some more esoteric subjects, and it's really fun at the end of the semester to look at the difference between your knowledge of Egypt before and after taking the class -- there's a large difference. This class is also very useful for dispelling some of the more common misconceptions of Ancient Egypt.Doing the readings is very helpful for understanding what's being taught in the class for the week, but it's not absolutely necessary. Reading responses are basically graded on whether or not you wrote them, and the one midterm isn't too much to handle, but taking notes in class is very important, because most of the slides aren't labeled. Final term paper is very open -- you can pick any topic you want.",
    "Yes, this was a great course! Absolutely fascinating material and Professor Manassa is wonderful! The reading responses and midterm aren't too bad, and the paper is definitely doable. I was worried that it would be difficult for me, since I had no experience in this kind of paper writing, but Professor Manassa and Maria (our TF) were very helpful in guiding me through that process. Definitely take it!",
    "This class is just what the name suggests. It is a peak into past Egyptian lives by means of ancient texts. It is a great way to learn general Egyptian history as well as more specific details about people's lives. I highly recommend it!",
    "The course is a fun and interesting way of getting acquainted with the ancient Egyptian culture and practices. I would highly recommend it to all those students, be they egyptology majors or not, that are interested in learning a bit more of these fascinating people.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course; it's a great overview of a less-commonly studied angle of ancient Egyptian history, and the Egyptology department at Yale is wonderful."
