Computational tools: Mayer-Vietoris sequences and cellular cohomology. Cup products and the Kunneth theorem. Applications to manifolds: orientations and Poincare duality.

   "comments": [
    "The course was very well-taught overall. The homework schedule was slightly inconsistent. It would have been preferable to have a week's notice before each assignment (although, the flexibility\/chances for extensions were appreciated).",
    "Paul is an outstanding teacher. He is energetic, engaged and clearly puts in a lot of effort into conveying the material to us. I appreciated his efforts to be personable. However, I don't know if it was because of the amount of material that needed to be covered, but the course progressed at a breakneck pace, which severely hurt absorption. There was no time to understand and absorb the material of the course because we were onto a new topic already. To a certain extent I think Paul also grossly overestimated our abilities. This was sort of reflected in the midterm - the median was in the low twenties, out of sixty three. And while Paul was perfectly reasonable about the grading itself, he curved very fairly; no one writes midterms with the median at thirty percent. He had clearly misjudged our ability to handle the material - something which continued through the duration of the course. And even if you know that technically, you're above the median, and doing well relative to the class, just seeing the score in absolute terms can be incredibly demoralising. There were several points in the semester when I questioned whether I should continue with the course given how out of my depth I felt, though it is to Paul's credit that his strengths kept me from dropping the course. Homeworks for this course are long, and extensive. I have probably spent more time on AlgTop PSets than on those for any other class in my time at Yale. What's particularly disappointing is that all of that effort counts towards only 10% of the grade. Given the amount of effort associated with doing the PSets, it would be nice if the reward for doing them was more proportional. I would strongly encourage someone, either Paul, or the department, or perhaps both to sit down and have a serious think about this course, because the way it is being offered right now isn't helping. I am reasonably certain that I speak for most if not every member of the class that if we were given even a little more time to grasp what was going on, our understanding of AlgTop would increased a lot.",
    "This class covers a lot of material in a short period of time, and I have learned a lot. That being said, I believe the class requires great changes to its structure. First of all, this class moves way too fast and assigns way too much homework, especially for someone who has not seen algebraic topology before like me. I found it difficult to really enjoy and internalize the material because I felt like I was always playing catch up with the pace of the class and because I did not have enough time to really think about the problems because there were too many. It was especially detrimental to assign so much homework over Thanksgiving break: it came out to almost 30 problems from Hatcher's textbook over break. Many people had prior commitments over break, and this was an unreasonable amount of work, especially given the qualifying exam the week after which I would have wanted to study more holistically for over break rather than doing homework problems. I believe it is more productive to assign fewer homework problems so that students may focus in on a few core concepts rather than stressing about completing all the homework in time. Also, there were several occasions where material we were assigned for homework was only covered after the homework was due. The most noticeable case was when the last few problems of Homework 1 covered CW complexes, which we only covered the week after the homework was due. This puts an unreasonable strain on students to learn said material on their own, which takes away from reinforcing material already covered in class. Finally, I felt that the midterm was too long to finish and likely hurt morale when average grades where in the 40%'s. Such an exam also seems an inaccurate way of measuring mastery of course material and more like a way of measuring who has the best strategy to score the maximum number of points on the exam.",
    "Strengths: Paul is a fantastic lecturer, and genuinely cares about his students. He does a great job of supplying intuition for the concepts we discuss in class, which is especially important for a subject like algebraic topology where its extremely easy to get lost in the weeds of a long, technical argument (the excision theorem for homology comes to mind). He also emphasizes concrete examples and generally approaches the subject through a classical, more geometric lens (as opposed to the modern viewpoint, which is more algebraic), which I found extremely helpful. Weaknesses: The class moves at a breakneck pace, and homework is quite heavyour last homework, for instance, had 28 Hatcher problems. This isnt necessarily a weakness, but you should know what youre getting yourself into. Also, the proofs Paul gave in lecture (and even those in Hatcher!) were often not very rigorous, and expectations for the level of rigor on psets and exams are similarly lax. If you try to do everything 100% rigorously, you will drive yourself insane."

   "comments": [
    "The course goes through a lot of difficult material at a fast pace, and though Professor Apisa teaches it well, it can still be hard to keep up at times. That said, it is a rewarding class and algebraic topology is a fundamental course for any mathematician, so take the course if you're willing to diligently go through many exercises and if you have a strong grasp of point set topology. It also helps to have seen some basic category theory and some homological algebra beforehand, though not required as they are covered in the course.",
    "I would recommend this course to a student who is very passionate about the subject matter and is willing to devote the majority of his or her semester to it, as the course moves very fast and there is a lot of homework. If a student is willing to commit, that student will get a lot out of the course.",
    "Absolutely. The class is brutally difficult, but youll come out with a very solid grasp on algebraic topology. More importantly, the ideas that come up in this classespecially homology and cohomologyare ubiquitous across modern mathematics, and algebraic topology is probably the best place to get a grasp on these crucial concepts. Algebraic topology has a very different flavor from any other area of math you generally see as an undergraduate, and will require you to think in completely new ways. Naturally, the class is going to be challenging, but Paul does a great job helping you navigate the waters. Definitely the best math class Ive taken at Yale so far."
