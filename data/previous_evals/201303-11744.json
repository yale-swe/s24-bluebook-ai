   "comments": [
    "The class doesn't have an overwhelming amount of work, but I would not want to take the class again. I wouldn't recommend the class, unless you are passionate about international economics.",
    "It was a pretty good class. Interesting and not too broad",
    "This is a great course--a nice mix of theory and real-world examples, with a very manageable amount of math thrown in. It's not at all like International Econ (schotts class)--much more focused on political economy. It's quite refreshing to take an economics course that delves into models of political economy. Great professor, great ta-- highly recommend!",
    "Great follow-up to International Economics. If you enjoyed that class than you should definitely take this course. All of the lecture notes to the class are posted online. The psets take a bit but are fair, as is the final. Professor Maggi is also a great lecturer as he is very engaged in the class.",
    "It's a great class! The material is very interesting. There are a lot of readings but it's not exactly necessary to read any of them. I've learned quite a lot in this class. The presentations during the last few weeks are a good way to conclude the course.",
    "Definitely take this course! People are usually scared by the notation in the first two lectures, but if you pay attention, you'll realize that those notations are actually just abbreviations for super-easy stuff that you did in micro, and it only reviews the prereq trade course. The real stuff begins after the first two lectures and is super-fun. Maggi is probably the best professor you'll ever learn from!",
    "Definitely recommend for economics majors"
