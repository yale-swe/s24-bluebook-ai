    "The most valuable aspect of English 455 is the amount of energy Professor Fadiman puts into each of her students. You meet with her one on one for an hour of editing every two weeks, and you'll hear from her via email much more often. If you ever have a question for her, she'll email you back within minutes. Whether you get along with her or not, you will come away from the class with a relationship of some sort with her. She takes a great interest in her students as people outside of the classroom, and that's very valuable.",
    "Reading amazing writing and writing essays on the things about yourself you've always wanted to explore through writing. Don't take this class if you don't like writing--it is demanding--and don't take this class if you get uncomfortable with introspection--you are writing about yourself, after all. But yes, I would recommend this class a million times over to anyone who is interested and would be willing to really give themselves to the class wholeheartedly. NOTE: Do not take this class with a million other classes! Take it in a semester when you have the time and energy to really commit to it.",
    "If you get in, TAKE IT, TAKE IT, TAKE IT. Anne is a wonderful human being probably the kindest, most brilliant teacher (or, really, mentor) that you'll ever have at Yale. That being said, this class is a lot of work, even if you take it Credit\/D, as I did. Make sure you apply during a semester when you know you'll be able to handle serious introspection and a lot of writing. And don't be fooled, this is one hundred percent a WRITING CLASS. Yes, you write about yourself, but make sure that if you're applying, you realize that the writing part is the most important part (the yourself part is important, but not as much). Your writing will get so much better in this class. One on one conferences with Anne are amazing. This was easily my favorite (and most worthwhile) class at Yale.",
    "I went into this class very suspicious of the mythical aura that Anne has secured on campus. Now, on the other side of it, I can say with confidence that she really is the most dedicated professor at Yale. Im sure of that not because Ive taken every class at Yale, but because I truly cant think of a way she could have been more dedicated. She is a one-of-a-kind teacher, and she has put so much thought and care into designing this class. In it, youll read two pieces each week, complete a report on one author, critique other students work, and write a lot of your own: four 1,000-word essays, a revision of one, and a 2500-3000word identity piece + revision. Anne will read all of it. Shell also meet with you for an hour about each piece, discussing macro issues and then moving line-by-line from the beginning until the hour is up. This isnt her correcting you--its a collaborative process designed to make you write as well as you can in your own voice. If you give this class your all, you will certainly become a better writer. Thats not to say your last essay will be better than your first (although on a sentence-level it will be, unless you willfully ignore Annes advice). Part of the class is about taking risks, and they wont always be successful. But youll be a better writer in that youll know yourself better--your strengths, your weaknesses, your process. Youll also learn a lot about yourself personally--and a lot about 11 other really wonderful people. Don't take this class if you're just interested in yourself--you won't enjoy it--but if you're also interested in writing, and willing to put in the work, then absolutely apply.",
    "Past evaluations and hearsay have made clear that this class is brilliant so I'll try to add my two cents. I remember coming in freshman year thinking that I wouldn't take this class. Writing about Oneself? I didn't have enough life to write about, was not narcissistic enough to believe that my life have something worth spending an entire semester going on about. The several things that I realized were: 1) There is always something beautifully universal about what it means to be human to write about, and the tricky part of the craft, is figuring out that small funnel, that metaphor, that 1000 word windowpane to capture its essence, to make it comprehendible, relatable, understandable. Which leads me to 2) Sure, this is a class about yourself, but first and foremost, this is a class about writing. The very materiality of language itself, its tricks and rules and how you can use it. Anne will sit down with you after each of the 6 pieces that you write for an hour long conference and go through each piece sentence by sentence, and wring out every last extra word. When it comes to craft, there is always something to learn, and Anne is the master craftsman.",
    "Writing About Oneself (aka WaO, pr. Wow) is the best writing workshop experience you are likely to experience in your mortal days, bar none. I can't imagine how any other workshop experience, even at top programs like the Iowa Writers Workshop, could compete with Anne. Warning and challenge: WaO will almost certainly be the class that takes up more time than any other that semester, and perhaps at Yale. If you're doing the class properly, each week you will be 1) reading amazing works by historical and contemporary authors of autobiography and memoir, 2) writing your own 1000 word essay about yourself, or writing a structured critique of a peer's essay, 3) editing your own past pieces, 4) reading and commenting on your peers' past work that's been uploaded to the Classesv2 server. If this sounds overwhelming, it can be -- but in the way that having a demanding, thoughtful, detail-oriented (and kind!) editor can be. The hour-long biweekly in-person writing conferences with Anne, editing line by line, are some of the most rewarding moments of the course. Anne thoughtfully advises you to take the class Cr\/D\/fail, which certainly takes the grade stress off. The real reason to work hard at all the various aspects of the class is to develop your technical writing skill, better understand yourself, and build an amazing portfolio of personal essays. You will grow together as a group, share secrets you never thought you would, improve immensely as an author, and read great works, from James Baldwin to Oscar Wilde to Mary McCarthy. I could not recommend any class more at Yale -- just know that you should take the class for its immense value, not for any ancillary prestige. If you devote yourself fully to all aspects of the course, you'll get back so much more in return.",
    "Take this class for SURE if you get to. I loved getting to read work from such amazing writers every week and it really opened my eyes into the literary\/english\/writing world. It was such a fun time, although you'll probably not have a life anymore\/ever because writing (at least for me) is a major time-suck. But Anne puts in so much effort that the class like can't possibly turn out badly. You'll learn a lot about writing and it's totally worth all the hours you'll put into it."
