    "ER&M is a gateway course with a lot of breadth. If you're interested in the major, I'd actually recommend taking a more focused course, as the material oftentimes felt surface-level. This class does expose you to histories & narratives that will shock you, move you, & broaden your worldview. Professor Camacho & the TFs are fantastic in presenting this material & guiding students. Though the reading is heavier some weeks, the class's expectations & attitudes are not stressful: section\/participation, an in-class mid-term exam, a paper or community service project, & a take-home final essay exam.",
    "A strong course I would encourage people to take, especially as a freshman.",
    "Important content and a very chill class structure. One open-note midterm (25%), a take home final (two 4-page papers-25%) and one 5 page paper (25%, which can be substituted for a Community Based Learning (CBL) project. Finally 25% is attendance and participation in section. The CBL essentially gives you a chance to volunteer either at some cultural events, or as a weekly volunteer for a tutoring center, food bank, or other non-profit. Getting 25% of your grade from tutoring children two hours a week and writing a 1-2 page reflection paper is pretty great, and I really enjoyed my CBL. Also, section was great.",
    "This is a very good intro course to ER&M. It is broad-reaching but somehow also cohesive. Lecture was engaging and did a wonderful job of communicating real-life significance and relevance of the themes we covered. Very happy I had this class to contextualize current events this semester. Would definitely recommend as it gives you a perspective on history you probably did not cover in high school and raises individual awareness on the jobs we hold as aware college students. Definitely take it!",
    "I would highly recommend this course because the topics are extremely interesting and of great import not only because they are little talked about topics of history, but also because they are very important in shaping our understanding of why the world is as it is today.",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend this class to everyone. It is very interesting material and the professor and TAs are very approachable and helpful. This is an excellent class that everyone should take.",
    "Everyone at Yale (in the United States, actually) should take this course! Although the readings can be a bit too much and dense, the material itself is very interesting and important to know. This said, you don't have to do all the reading to do well in and learn so much from the class!",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS. This isn't another stupid intro lecture where you will read some stuff and write a paper and learn minimally. This class has cool projects like the global playlist and the community based learning, which allow you to learn by doing and apply what you know to your everyday life. I could sense myself growing as a critical thinker in class, and I think everybody should take this class.",
    "This is a class you should take for your own good. There are things you will learn that you probably wouldn't be able to after you leave Yale.",
    "I would recommend ER&M 200 if you think you would be interested in this kind of material and thinking. The best part of this class is the students that it draws and the discussion that emerges as a result. Professor Camacho is not the most engaging lecturer, so it can be really easy to get distracted or not fully follow along in class. However, discussion sections are always enjoyable and interesting.",
    "Absolutely take this course. Use this opportunity to educate yourself about issues that you or millions of others face in this country, and to be able to be part of the kinds of conversations that drive change in our country at this very moment. Professor Camacho's passion is tangible and engaging, and you will leave each lecture with a deeper understanding of historical and current issues, and a feeling that you are a part of them (Prof Camacho places great emphasis on the role her students play in the course and in society). This course will fill the gaps that most US history curricula fail to cover. 90% of the readings are really excellent, though occasionally incredibly long (don't need to read everything for the course, but you'll want to if you're interested in the specific topic at all). Exams are open-book, and you can choose either a Community Based Learning project or a brief midterm paper.",
    "A wonderfully unique eye-opening journey across history about race, racial formations and deconstruction. a 75 minute lecture is kind of long, but on most days the materia is so interesting that it is impossible to lose interest. Come in with an open mind and don't be afraid to challenge the material and engage with it. Should be required for all humanities majors tbh.",
    "Very enlightening class if you've never taken a class on race relations before. Illustrates other perspectives that you may not have heard of before.",
    "This class is a survey of the construction of race and ethnicity and how it relates to migration and systematic inequality. Professor Camacho is really wonderful! The topics in this class are really interesting and I learned a lot but it really is a big survey. Every time we got to an interesting aspect of a topic, we had to move on to the next one. But thus is the nature of survey courses. I would definitely recommend this class to anyone who wants to look into the issues of race, ethnicity and identity from multiple perspectives.",
    "ER&M is the best class I have ever taken at Yale. From the AMAZING professor, Alicia Schmidt Camacho to all of the TAs, to the engaging and intellectually stimulating the students this course attracts, this class teaches and equips you with the knowledge and tools necessary to discuss historical and modern-day race isssues. Not only that, you begin to unpack daily experiences in your life, and learn about the historical context that gives this one instance meaning. You are also encouraged to engage with different mediums - say music, video, publications - and incorporate these into what you are learning. Everything I read for the class was so engaging that I would never want to stop reading, and the lectures are so packed with info that you want to just keep learning more. A DEFINITE class to take at Yale - 100% recommend.",
    "I think this class will give you a very good introduction to ER&M. However, I do think that if you're not into the subject some lectures will be extremely dull and the readings may be a pain to do. On the other hand, if you are very into any aspect of ER&M you'll probably adore this class.",
    "Take it!",
    "Take it. Your world will be turned upside down, but in the best way.",
    "Intro to ERM is about the significant ethnic, racial, and migrational phenomena that greatly shaped America but are skimmed over in most high school US history courses. It focuses on the effects and practices of slavery, colonialism, and power dynamics along with focusing on the perspectives and identities of African Americans, Native Americans, Latin Americans, and Asian Americans.",
    "One of the best classes I've taken at Yale! I'm a senior and would recommend it to everyone who still has time to take it! Professor Camacho is so wonderful and kind and the TAs were all so passionate about the class and their work as well. It's a course that covers intertwined topics of racial and ethnic relationships that are extremely relevant today and also (in my opinion) critical to a part of a Yale education.",
    "Definitely take it. Will make you rethink race relations in this country and in the world in a way that is sorely needed in these times.",
    "Very interesting class that discusses the creation of race as a concept and how migration and the interaction of different ethnicities has manifested throughout history. This class really allows students to discuss topics that are very contentious but are inextricable from the media, our every day lives, history. Professor Camacho is an excellent lecturer who provides multiple sources to really help students understand what it was like to live in previous time periods and how current events and forms of identification shape communities and global perceptions. She takes the time to reflect on films, quotes, poems, and various artistic expressions from people who were actually involved in various conflicts, using these time capsules to portray the actual views of different groups over time and the real consequences that they have resulted in. Definitely take this class.",
    "Despite the large amount of praise for this course, I found that it is really not for everyone. The material is very important, and I was keyed in to the malleability of history and the persistence of racial problems in our society today. However, I would only recommend the class to people with a strong and personal interest in the history of racism. My chief complaint is that the lectures seemed disorganized, unfocused, and longer than they needed to be at 1 hour 15 minutes. Professor Camacho had a script for each of her lectures, and it often felt like she was just reading an essay out loud to us, which I did not find engaging. In addition, there never seemed to be a clear thesis or method of organization to her lectures, and this made it very difficult to predict where she was going. The readings were interesting for the most part, although they could be quite long: as much as 100 pages of academic writing assigned per lecture. Other than the readings, there is a required blog post each week, a midterm, an option to write a paper or complete a community service project, and a take-home final.",
    "A simply remarkable course. Intro to ER&M is a course that everyone at Yale should take, but it retains its high quality from the mere fact that only those motivated to learn about others will want to take it. Given the recent events, it is critical these issues are discussed and I am grateful that there is a safe space at Yale to engage in meaningful conversations around these issues. If you haven't already, I strongly recommend everyone to take this class and to get in touch with your activist side.",
    "This is a great class, but only if you do the work and take it seriously. You can get away without doing the work, but the class will be meaningless. If you take it seriously, it can be one of the greatest classes at Yale! Also, make sure to seek out Professor Camacho. She is incredible!",
    "Take this class only if you like it during shopping week (it doesn't change) and only if you are willing to put the time into doing the readings well. What you get out of this class is very much based on what you put into it. I would recommend not taking it freshman year, I would have gotten more out of it had I already known how to handle a college style class.",
    "Eye-opening! A must-take class at Yale. I learned so much about real-life issues.. Truly a valuable experience",
    "Yes a very interesting class and approaches very current issues. The work load is doable and it the assignments and readings are enjoyable.",
    "A great class that turned from my 5th class to my favorite very quickly. very pertinent material to the present moment with a great teacher.",
    "It was boring.",
    "This is a class that everyone at Yale should take. It gives an alternative history that completely shook the foundations of what I learned in high school. I understand race in a way that forms how I respond to current day events. Professor Camacho is super nice and cares a lot about the class!",
    "This class does a good job of surveying relevant race issues in regards to various ethnic groups. The scope is much wider than I anticipated, and was one of the bright spots of the course. The readings are really interesting as well. The only knock on the course is Prof Camacho's lecturing style. She's very soft spoken, making it difficult to concentrate. Definitely a class to shop.",
    "It is an essential course that will shape my Yale experience for years to come. Do it.",
    "There is a lot of reading, but some is interesting.",
    "I would recommend this course to any student regardless of their academic area of study. Having completed the course I feel more aware and sensitive to the issues discussed in the course and I have learned to think and analyze history and current events in a different light.",
    "This class was one of the best classes I have taken at Yale. Simply put.",
    "I would recommend this course to students looking for a straightforward, at times interesting course about race relations and its origin. Be aware that you probably already learned everything that will be covered in this class in high school.",
    "I STRONGLY suggest this class to every student at Yale. It asks you to face difficult questions, and troubling\/often unaddressed aspects of the history of relations between people in the US and around the world, helping students to understand dynamics that shaped and continue to shape our reality. Lots of reading, great lecture, fair grading, and the option of a community based learning project OR a 5 page paper evaluating a document. I chose the second option because I was interested in using a primary source and had a great time researching and writing the paper.",
    "This should be required for every student. Seriously, take this class. You'll see the world in a new way and you'll begin to understand a lot of the injustices around us today. I wish I had taken it earlier but it's great to see the class and program grow. Professor Camacho is an AMAZING lecturer and she's assembled a great group of TA's that shared her passion for these topics. The guest lecturers are also great and provide insight into their own areas of expertise. One of the best classes I've taken at Yale without a doubt.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS. Easily the best class I've ever taken at Yale.",
    "I strongly recommend this course!",
    "The first question summarizes the course, and yes, I would recommend Introduction to Ethnicity, Race, and Migration to every other student who can fit it in his or her schedule. I plan to become a physics and applied mathematics double major, and I absolutely loved this class! At the point that students specializing in disciplines on the opposite end of the spectrum love a class, that probably says something important about the value of the class.",
    "I would wholeheartedly recommend ER&M 200 for any student. I believe it is a course that everyone should take. If everyone took this course, I believe this world would be a much more understanding, kind place.",
    "Would definitely recommend. Good humanities credit. Good information to know about the world. Professor Camacho is the sweetest lady ever and really cares about what she does. The lectures can get a little dry, Powerpoints are sparse, and the readings can be long. However, great class overall.",
    "The best lecture I've ever taken. Camacho is incredible. The material will blow your mind. You'll learn how to think like you've never thought before. If you have a great section leader, this will only make that experience even better. The assignments are manageable. There's nothing to lose. This should be a required class for all Yale students. Take it now! (This is all coming from a senior so hopefully, this makes you take this a little more seriously.)",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS. Your knowledge of the world and of the United States will be widened, and you will be better for it. The course beautifully connects various narratives of race, power, and culture across centuries, highlighting the threads that run through it all, giving students a clearer portrait of humanity itself by the end of the course. Sections and small-group discussions added\/greatly\/ to the class as well, providing an exciting place to discuss and unwrap the facts and themes of the class (I looked forward to mine each week). Professor Schmidt-Camacho is the cherry on top; she is a truly beautiful person as well as an amazing professor, treating her students with love and sincerity while treating the topics of her course with gravitas and elegance. Her skill with words turned lectures into a storytime of sorts, hitting you hard with tales of genocide or discrimination while not forgetting the beauty of humanity hidden within them. The readings can be a bit hard to manage at times, but are extremely interesting and important - definitely worth the work. Take this class, tell your friends to take this class, and the world will become a little less ignorant."
