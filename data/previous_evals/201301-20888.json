    "I do believe better Macroeconomics classes can be found on campus, however, if you are not too proficient in the subject, this might be a good course choice.",
    "I am annoyed that I had to take this class instead of an elective that might have been interesting and useful. We learned some models which I had mostly seen before. Everyone got 100% on the homework as long as they turned in a piece of paper with writing on it. I spent an hour each week reading the lecture notes online, instead of 3 hours listening to the instructor read them to me word-for-word.",
    "I would not recommend, but there is no choice since this was one of the core courses.",
    "It is a core course so there is no choice over whether to take it but I would not recommend it. The instruction is poor and there are no insights given which are not available through reading through a textbook on basis macroeconomics",
    "I would recommend the course.",
    "take it because you HAVE to for IDE. no choice.",
    "I would not recommend this course. I believe Yale has some excellent professors in economics that are leaders in the field of macroeconomics. If a student at Yale wanted to learn macroeconomics, I believe they would be very well off learning macro from one of these professors.",
    "It is not a standard macroeconomic course, but draws on very interesting models which extends the learning of those who have previously taken basic macroeconomics courses.",
    "This is not a class that I enjoyed going to, but it is a clear presentation of a number of models in macroeconomics for anyone interested in learning about them.",
    "i would recommend it if someone is interested in classical macroeconomic models",
    "The class is a good introduction to macroeconomics. Sometimes the teaching style and the accompanying problem sets were a bit sup-par.",
    "The course is truly graduate level, be prepared to put in additional effort"

    "It definitely helpedbolster my interests in macroeconomic policy and international finance.",
    "I learned a few odds and ends about macro, but in general I did not find the class useful.",
    "I loved this subject before I took this course, but I was just disappointed after taking this course. Maybe I will study this subject by myself afterwards.",
    "The content of the course was useful but it would have been a lot more useful if it was held before our core international economics classes as in previous years.",
    "it did not deepen knowledge of discipline.",
    "Definitely! It was a good blend with Macro-theorem but in a specific context.",
    "I learnt several new models, which are extensions of basic models learnt in undergraduate courses."
