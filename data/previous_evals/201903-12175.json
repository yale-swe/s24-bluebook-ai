   "comments": [
    "I learned a lot about recent history, particularly in the Middle East, and its global ramifications. I feel a lot more informed on global politics and affairs, and the urgency of many issues going on today.",
    "I learned to speak intelligently about the most pressing problems facing society today, the implications of a fourth industrial revolution, challenges to international peace, as well as the disparity between economic and cultural frameworks.",
    "Walking out of the course, I learned a lot about fundamental international relations with topics ranging from China, Russia, the Middle East, to Climate Change, Negotiation, and IR theories",
    "I learned an incredible amount about Middle Eastern politics and the problems that plague international affairs. I learned, essentially, that I do not want to work in diplomacy but that I do want to learn more about how interconnected the world is. For instance, I learned about the gap between political rhetoric and reality when diplomats and politicians try to fix issues in countries abroad whose culture and context they simply do not understand.",
    "I gained a much richer understanding of many current geopolitical problems and how they relate to one another.",
    "I learned a lot about the Middle East and now feel comfortable having educated and thoughtful discussions on a region and series of events (the Arab Spring) which I previously had minimal information on.",
    "I thought the class was really great in providing me with a great opportunity to see a variety of interesting speakers. It made me more aware of the opportunities Yale has as well as the different kinds of opportunities in the field of global affairs.",

    "An awareness of global affairs, and how they oftentimes relate to each other.",
    "This course was excellent, would absolutely recommend it. The course stimulated thought and discussion on some of our world's most pressing issues including climate change, Middle East conflict, US foreign policy, etc. This course helped me develop my academic writing on critical subjects, namely expressing opinions in a clear, concise, and well-supported manner.",
    "This course starts as Middle Eastern Politics 101, where Professor Sky leverages her strengths and extensive personal knowledge to describe in detail the events leading up to and through the Iraq war and Arab Spring, and the consequences they created. Once that has been exhausted, by about the second half of the semester, Sky retreats to the auditorium herself and almost exclusively invites guest speakers to speak about things outside of her expertise, from emerging technology, to national negotiations and beyond.",
    "I learned a tremendous amount about international relations and got to listen to some amazing guest speakers.",
    "I gained a fundamental understanding of what is going on in the world.",
    "I gained a basic understanding of international politics and global affairs through this course.",
    "My perspective of the world was changed and I learned how to evaluate media reports and middle eastern policies.",
    "An in-depth understanding of different cultures and systems in place to deal with conflict",
    "I learned how to analyze geopolitical situations happening in across the world. Reinforced my insight into how the world is so interconnected on issues like climate change, poverty, and war.",
    "I learned about many various topics in global affairs, in a variety of disciplines.",
    "Basic knowledge about global matters and current affairs around the world. There was a major focus on Middle East.",
    "The main focus was the middle east but we also talked about Russia China and south America",
    "A holistic review of current topics in global affairs.",
    "In the lecture I learned about the different areas of the world as well as the different problems we face today. In the discussion section, I learned about news events, how to discuss and view a problem as well as how to write a policy brief and a good essay.",
    "It was honestly a good overview of middle eastern politics.",
    "I developed a greater understanding of world affairs, as well as the balance of power in our world. I can now think more critically about what I hear reported on the news!",
    "Much better insight on the context of historical and current struggles in the Middle East",
    "Learned a lot more about the global climate and international politics. Was fascinated to find out about global diplomacy and how that works in to the worlds largest most pressing problems of today.",
    "I was able to develop a comprehensive outlook on the wide range of topics and issues the major of global affairs touches on.",
    "Insight into current international issues",
    "Wider understanding of the global geopolitical landscape and how countries make decisions",
    "Learned about several international issues and current events that are very relevant in todays world.",
    "I learned knowledge about global affairs.",
    "I liked how the class always had a great deal of speakers, all very distinguished within their fields. It greatly expanded my understanding of the Middle East.",
    "I gained a better understanding of world cultures and how to look at problems from angles other than my own beliefs",
    "I thought that some of the speakers were amazing and provided really valuable insight into their respective fields and their life experiences. I learned how to write a policy memo as well.",
    "Through this course I was able to establish a deeper understanding of current events surrounding the world. This course also allowed me to develop my public speaking skills in a safe environment, that was created through weekly section discussions and presentations.",
    "I was able to learn about a variety of the world's pressing issues and the importance of global collaboration. I learned how to syncretize research to comprise solutions to different problems.",
    "It was amazing to gain so many unique perspectives about the world from both Professor Sky and guest lecturers.",
    "Learned a lot about the Middle East and everything that is going on around the world.",
    "How to read lecture readings.",
    "I learned how to approach global affairs through multiple perspectives."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "We mostly had guest lecturers, and they were all either hit or miss. I wish we could have interacted more with our professor and had more lectures by Professor Sky, but nonetheless I still learned a lot in the course about global affairs.",
    "Strengths: fascinating array of speakers; timely, relevant material; mixed media approach (ex: Ted Talks for homework) Weaknesses: 1. disproportionate amounts of time allotted to different regions (how can we honestly spend half of a global affairs class discussing the Middle East while giving entire continents a single lecture?) 2. bias (rarely did we confront the perspectives of non-American actors. I feel the class might more appropriately be labeled \"The United States in Global Affairs.\"",
    "This course serves as a tasting platter of different areas of international affairs and it was advertised as such. However, I disliked how disproportionate the classes were. Half of the semester was focused on Middle Eastern affairs but then the other half raced through a plethora of random topics. There was one class devoted to \"Latin America\" which is highly insulting after we spent an entire two months looking at the complexity of a different region. The second half of the semester featured classes that were not connected and had no central theme or overarching idea. This class should be renamed to \"Middle Eastern politics\/affairs\" or \"Global Affairs with Middle East focus,\" because the current title is misleading.",
    "Strengths: my TF was great and I really enjoyed section discussions, there were many interesting guest lecturers throughout the semester Weaknesses: sometimes the lectures were hard to follow",
    "I enjoyed most lectures, but I felt the course focused much more on the Middle East than I had originally anticipated. I think more lectures dedicated to topics outside of the Middle East could have added to how interesting the course was overall.",
    "I think Professor Sky is a really amazing person who has a lot of valuable insight into international politics, and I wish she would have lectured more. There were some really great guest lecturers and some not so great ones that felt like they were a little unprepared. I think it would be helpful to screen the lectures before since I felt like I sometimes came away from a lecture not having learned much.",
    "Each lecture seemed somewhat standalone in my opinion. There was little continuity holding the course together so I'm not sure I received some sort of overarching messages. That being said, I did not know that much about global affairs before this course, so the standalone lectures explaining different world happenings were actually great crash courses that helped me get my bearings.",
    "Strengths: Wonderful TAs who make all the difference. Weaknesses: Although it is not a very large lecture, I felt a very impersonal connection to Professor Sky. She taught very few classes herself, and was did not seem to make an effort to connect to students. A majority of the class was guest speakers--some being very good and others not.",
    "Strengths: Lecture by Emma sky herself were very good, but she only gave around 5 lecture, and the remainder of the course was guest lectures which were less engaging.",
    "More engagement with lecturers and readings. Discussion sections were great, though I felt like lecture engagement and attendance fell throughout the semester. Would have been nice to have some more methods of engagement\/reflection with guest lecturers.",
    "The only real weakness of the course is that after the course moves on from the Middle East, and outside of the realm of Emma Sky's expertise, the quality of speakers has a tendency to drop considerably. While the class is focusing on the Middle East, Sky and the relatively few guest lecturers she invites are pointed, well-spoken, knowledgeable, and incredibly fascinating. After the class moves on, Sky has less material with which to vet lecturers, and each lecture is about a 50-50 chance of being good. Some lectures are fantastic, some are laughably useless.",
    "The strengths of this course are the guest speakers and world fellows. The weakness of this course is that it is too easy.",
    "Strengths: Lots of topics covered Weaknesses: Kinda superficial. Didn't delve too deep",
    "I signed up for this course because I knew that Emma Sky was the professor. I did not realize that she would only lecture for two of our classes. I think this course would've been much more engaging had Emma Sky lectured for more than two classes. I often found that lectures led by World Fellows were difficult to follow and disorganized, and I feel as though I would've been able to learn much more about global affairs if Professor Sky had just taught the class herself.",
    "Was made extremely interesting with the number of guest speakers from diverse backgrounds and experiences. Sections allowed the content to be reinforced in a less formal setting",
    "Strengths: The amount and quality of speakers that Professor Sky brings is unmatched by any Yale course. Students are able to hear from experts in their field and people who have wileded power and influence across the world. Weaknesses: Not much interaction between the Professor and students, but that is supplanted by interactions between TF's and students.",
    "Although the guest speakers were interesting, I would have liked to hear from Professor Sky more.",
    "Strengths: variety of interesting speakers, interesting discussion in section. Section was my favorite part of this class. Tiffany is INCREDIBLE. We debated, discussed current events, shared our thoughts regarding past lectures. It's definitely the most engaging part of the course and I highly enjoyed my time with my section. Weaknesses: the final group project is horrible. I did ALL of the work and just had to suck it up. There was no rubric for this assignment and it appears to be highly subjective grading.",
    "The course could be improved by organizing it, and by having Emma Sky actually lecture more often. The guest lecturers were interesting, but often the world fellows lacked organization in their presentations and just talked about their experiences, as opposed to structuring a lesson on a topic of their choosing. The lecture on Russia by Thomas Graham, a Yale professor, was by far the more engaging and interesting, as opposed to the random international representatives selected by Professor Sky. There lacked a cohesive goal of this course and of the material assigned and taught.",
    "Many amazing guest speakers! There was also a lot of interesting subject matter in the readings. Section also provided a good opportunity to discuss current events and go over topics touched on in class. The lecture set up was boring and the class could easily be skipped. Possibly a more interactive lecture and more geographical diversity in the subject matter would improve the course.",
    "Strengths were the interesting lecturers brought in. Weaknesses were the relative level of disengagement with everyone in the class from the professor to the teaching fellows. Attendance heavily dropped as the course progressed and there was no accountability.",
    "I think the biggest strength this course has is introducing students to different speakers from all different facets of Global Affairs. It allows its students to dabble in various areas which I think is good for people who are just trying Global Affairs out or complete beginners to the subject. I liked that it presumed no previous knowledge of the subject. I think it could be improved if Professor Sky lectured more as while I did enjoy the guest speakers, I would have liked to learn from her more. I also think a theme would be useful in terms of weekly lectures.",
    "Lectures on the Middle East were extremely strong, those on other topics were hit and miss.",
    "Strengths: diverse lecture series Weaknesses: lectures did not count towards anything so attendance dropped off",
    "Lecture could be more engaging. Great class though. Emma Sky rocks.",
    "Strengths - I have so much more knowledge of global affairs than I started with Weaknesses - I wish we had more lectures by Sky herself, there were often too many guests and not all of the guests were good lecturers, the second half of the semester was very choppy and it often felt like we were learning each unit as an isolated event",
    "There could be more emphasis on the lectures. Potentially one midterm exam would be good for this course.",
    "Strengths was its breadth of topic however the weakness was that, other than the readings, there were little opportunities to go deeper into some of the topics.",
    "Strength- interesting guest speakers Weakness- too many guest speakers",
    "I enjoyed the guest lecturer format & thought that section was organized very well",
    "Several very relevant topics were covered which was great however some of the guest lecturers were not very engaging which made it hard to learn about certain topics.",
    "A strength was that it covered a broad range of topics.",
    "A strength of the class was definitely all of the speakers that we got to hear from during the class, and their different perspectives and insights that they got to share with us. Although I like the speakers very much, I would have loved to hear more from the professor herself and her experience in the Middle East as I found that it would have been very interesting given her history.",
    "Some of the guest lecturers were really great and I thought that Prof. Sky's lectures at the beginning of the term about the Middle East were really great. As the class went on, it started to seem like just random speakers that didn't relate to each other almost at all. It was hard to feel like you were getting a strong base in any of the subjects they lectured on since they were all over the place.",
    "The strengths of this course is that its not an overwhelming course that stresses students out to the point where they are too busy working, making them not have the time and energy to reflect on the bigger picture of what is being taught. The weaknesses are that many of the students wanted to hear more from Emma Sky and a little less from guest speakers. Sky is a fantastic professor with so much to say.",
    "Strengths: The guest lecturers were very interesting people, and the set up of the class allowed students to engage as much as they wanted to with the material. Weakness: All the topics were touched on superficially, and there was not a clear structure to the class.",
    "I think we could go more in depth into big events that have happened economically over the years.",
    "Lecture attendance is not mandatory or needed for assignments. This course should incorporate lectures more.",
    "Some strengths of the course come from the wide variety of experience in both professor Sky and the guest lectures who come from so many different backgrounds. However, the sheer number of guest speakers made the student experience a bit chaotic and many students wanted professor Sky to give more lectures herself.",
    "The strengths were the diversity of perspectives offered."

   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this course because you learn so much about recent history and its global ramifications. I feel a lot more informed on global politics and affairs, and the urgency of many issues going on today.",
    "I think it's a fine course in that it introduces you to several regions, fields, and professors in a short period of time. I do feel I have a better grasp of the Yale Global Affairs landscape now. However, if you have even a moderate understanding of global politics, you are unlikely to learn a whole lot that is new.",
    "Yes. Interesting course with next to no work and easy grading.",
    "Yes, if you are into international relations. The workload is also very reasonable with short weekly reading responses, a mid-term assignment, a final paper, and a group presentation. You have to show up to the weekly section as well, which is a fun 50 minutes of discussions of materials in class.",
    "I would not, unless the student is interested in an easy, lecture course about random global affairs topics.",
    "If you are interested in current events and talking about them in section, you should take this course.",
    "I would recommend to a student who would like an introduction to the politics of the Middle East, considering that was the primary focus of the course.",
    "I think its a good intro course to global affairs, but I dont feel like I came out of it having gained a lot of valuable insight into the field, perhaps because students didnt have to be very engaged in the class to success. A little more direction or attention on the students would have been helpful in making the class feel more worthwhile. I would recommend this class if those changes were made or if a student was interested in the field or could stay engaged with the material.",
    "I would recommend this course to someone who simply wants a crash course on modern global events.",
    "No. I left the class not knowing much more than before, even though I attended every lecture and section and did all of the readings. Could be summarized in",
    "I would recommend this course, especially if they are considering a major in global affairs. This was a great way to get exposed to a lot of great concepts and consider potential future courses of study.",
    "Absolutely take this course. It's not a ton of work, and if you're at all interested in global politics, even if it's not your major, absolutely take this course. It's overall fantastic and although some lectures are better than others, the ones that are good are often fantastic and extremely worthwhile.",
    "I would recommend this course to every student at Yale. it is incredibly interesting. If you are interested in anything related to the material, it is a great starting point. If you are not interested in the material, it is an easy credit where you still get to listen to some wonderful speakers.",
    "Yes, I think it makes for a good class if you are taking a rough schedule.",
    "Yes. The lectures were fascinating, usually given by guest lecturers who are experts in a particular field, and there is very little work.",
    "I don't think I would recommend this course to another student. I came into Yale thinking that I would apply to be a Global Affairs major. This class made me change my mind. I thought it would be significantly more engaging than it was; I felt disconnected in the World Fellows' lectures and wish that Professor Sky had taken more ownership over her class by lecturing for more than two class periods. I also thought that the midterm was graded in a rudimentary fashion that did not take into account nuanced arguments and instead reduced our work to just fulfilling a rubric's requirements.",
    "Without a doubt",
    "Yes. Regardless of interests this is a good course for people to take to gain an understanding of the world and what is occurring in different states.",
    "Yes! The course covers a wide variety of subjects that are relevant to the political current events.",
    "This class is a fairly easy and interesting course. It covers most international events in the geopolitical sphere in the Middle East, Russia, US, and the UK. I enjoyed the variety of guest speakers, and section is super fun. This is not a very challenging course, so I would recommend it more for STEM or Humanities majors looking for a social studies credit. As a SS major, I felt as if this course did not hugely contribute to my present knowledge or enlarge my current interests.",
    "I would recommend this course as a fifth class to a student interested in learning random tidbits about global affairs. I would not recommend this to a student who actually wants to understand the inner workings of the international order.",
    "If the student is interested in taking a very basic, introductory course in global affairs, then yes. This course is great for a basic understanding of international relations, but for someone already very into the field (in terms of being up to date on the news) this course might seem elementary.",
    "Yes if students are looking for a relaxed course for their social science credit.",
    "Yes I would. It introduces students to Global Affairs through various speakers and is very interesting.",
    "Yes",
    "If you're looking for a gut.",
    "If youre looking for a low stress class, this is a good one to take. Great TFs",
    "Yeah if you want an easy class that youll forget youre enrolled in. The workload is literally just 2 papers and a presentation for the entire semester. Lecture is extremely optional, you just have to go to section. Easy class.",
    "Yes! If youre interested in global affairs, this class is an easy introductory course, and its very interesting!",
    "Yes, as long as theyre okay with the course being fairly disorganized.",
    "Yes! Not very much work and very interesting material.",
    "Yes it was highly intellectually rewarding.",
    "Yes, very interesting discussions and opportunities to meet incredible people from throughout the world.",
    "Yes, anyone interested in getting exposure to global affairs or looking for a better understanding of world",
    "I would recommend this class because I learned a lot about what was going on in the world right now but there was not too much work necessary so I could really focus on enjoying what I was learning.",
    "Yes, it covered a broad range of topics.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this class to another student if you feel as though you could benefit from a speaker-based, lecture class.",
    "Yes. This was my favorite class of the semester and was very engaging",
    "If you want access to amazing lectures done by the visiting fellows and are looking for a pretty mellow class, then this is for you. If you're looking for something that covers the topics more in depth, then I wouldn't recommend it. I think that the majority of what you learn from it will be depending on how your TF runs your discussion section.",
    "I would highly recommend this course if one is looking to greater develop their world view.",
    "It depends on how much knowledge they have on global affairs. If a student does not have any knowledge on this topic, then yes I would recommend this class because it will give them a good introduction into the subject. However, if a student already has a good amount of knowledge on global affairs I would not recommend the course because they will probably think it is boring.",
    "Yes, especially for a first or second year student who may be interested in Global Affairs as a major... but still interesting even if not",
    "Yes absolutely. Gives you a great assessment of the world around us.",
    "Yes, a good overview of global affairs.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student. It is full of amazing speakers and the knowledge you can get from hearing them is really amazing.",
    "I would recommend this course if you are interested in current affairs."
