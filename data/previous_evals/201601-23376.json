    "Instructor: Laurene Petitjean \u00a0Laurene was an excellent teaching assistant. She was always available to answer questions. I attended many of her office hour sessions and she was always willing to explain the concept over and over again until I understood it. However, there were two other \"teaching fellows\" that supported the class as well. I felt that the teaching team was not proportional to the size of the class. On average there were about 15 people in the class. For this size there was a professor and three teaching fellows. When there are that many people \"responsible\" for the class - the responsibilities are diffused. I am sure (and well aware) that it is difficult to structure a class like this, however, for the amount of \"teachers\" there was still a large disconnect between them, the material, and us.",

    "I am very interested in this subject and wanted to take this class to gain a better appreciation for green chemistry. I understand that it is very difficult to teach a green chemistry class to undergraduate and graduate students with a varying level of chemistry and environmental backgrounds. This class is very valuable to all students remotely interested in pursuing this field. However, some combination of factors made this course difficult to enjoy. First, the teaching team was too large and not proportional to the number of students, making it slightly disorganized and unrealistic (it is somewhere between a flipped and not flipped class). Second, for people who have not had chemistry in a few years, the introduction part of this course assumes you have some familiarity with the subject. Third, you don't have regular assignments which makes it difficult to test (and demonstrate) your understanding throughout the course, besides a midterm. Lastly, even with so many \"teachers\" I felt like they still did not have a handle on whether and if people were not on the same page with the material."

    "Organization. The teaching team tried to pack too much into each lecture. First, you had to watch videos + read ahead of time (like a flipped class), then there would be a lecture, and sometimes a group activity -- which we would never be able to finish or make the most out of because we would run out of time. Clarity. For the basic chemistry part of the class, the practice work was not indicative of the actual content that we were expected to know. We were given packets of examples that were full of errors and \"cross out because you don't kneed to know this\" etc.",
    "i wish we used more case studies and didn't just talk about the issues with recycling or sustainability. there could have been assigned background info for non ES students and we could've focused on the real nuts and bolts in class.",
    "Class seemed disorganized at times, the chemistry section of the course was taught too quickly,lost a lot of people in the beginning of the class, even with TA help, The entire semester was needed to work on the final project because it was very detailed and should not have been left to the second half of the semester, the structure of the class was very demanding at times - assignments and homework and project"
