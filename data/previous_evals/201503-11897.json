    "I would definitely recommend it! I've written poetry before, but honestly I think that any student, regardless of background, can take this course and benefit greatly. David is an amazing professor, really supportive and engaging. The small community and the relaxed environment were perfect for me to explore other poets' styles, improve my own, and benefit from the critiques of my peers.",
    "ENGL 135 is a terrific class! It's organized by elements of craft--one week'll be about \"abstractions and concretions,\" another about \"sonnets,\" etc., which means that we got to read a huge variety of work. If you want to expand your repertoire of poets, and fall in love with some contemporary poetry, this is absolutely the right class. David is an incredibly devoted professor who will have you thinking critically about your own writing. You do get out of this class what you put in: the workload can be pretty light or can take a long time--it's basically doing the reading and writing one poem a week, so that is whatever you make of it.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS! I started thinking about poetry everywhere -- it consumed my semester in the best way possible. David is an amazing teacher and friend; he is caring, kind, and very dedicated to making the class as best it can be. I loved the readings, the assignments, and the other people in the class. What fun! Please take!! Even if you're not an experienced writer, the assignments are very assessable and fun to do.",
    "Definitely take this class!! I was so, so terrified of taking a poetry workshop class, but I'm so glad I took the risk. This class is so good for you. It's a popular class, so definitely show up on the first day and be very thoughtful in your application. In terms of work, there are poetry and prose readings every week, as well as a writing assignment (which you post in a class dropbox). Typically, class time is split between discussion\/instruction and workshopping the poems of two classmates. This class is great because it focuses primarily on contemporary poetry. You will go over the more formal mechanics of poetry, but you will also learn a lot about, simply, what works, what feels good in your senses. I also love that I now know which poets I am interested in exploring more-- David is a great source of direction. And David is an amazing teacher!! So articulate and thoughtful. His critiques always feel constructive, and are delivered in a way that is firm but kind. He was much beloved by our class. The members of the class, too, were very close by the end of the semester. I definitely feel that my own writing has improved greatly. You will absolutely not regret it!",
    "ABSOLUTELY would recommend!",
    "I would highly recommend this course to anyone who is interested in poetry. David is an incredibly generous instructor who puts in a ton of time to meet with each student outside of class. If you can, take it!",
    "This was a great class for personal emotional development. I confronted a lot of things about myself that I hadn't prior, and learned things about myself, which is the kind of thing that poetry is supposed to help you do. David gives you an incredible amount of personal intention (3 meetings, each an hour long) and is really invested in your own personal progress as a writer. Seriously, this was an amount of individual attention that is really rare to get from an instructor anywhere.",
    "A wonderful, wonderful class. Advertised as improving your writing; actually about improving you-- with the writing as a side-effect. I've found that the best courses I've taken are best because of the instructor, and this was no exception. David was an incredibly caring and gifted teacher who worked extremely hard to make this the best learning and growth environment there is. I feel deeply lucky to have been part of this. I loved how close our class became, and I loved how we shared our writing and thoughts on it. The reading chosen for the course was delicious and relevant-- perfect for a first course in poetry. Weekly meetings were so helpful in improving my writing. If you don't get in this year, just write next term and try again. Important for students, regardless of what you're studying. Overall: wow."
