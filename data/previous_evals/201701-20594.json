    "Some math and understanding of natural resources!",

   "comments": [
    "This class was very boring. The problem sets had little to do with what we learned in class or what we were tested on.",
    "The lectures themselves were interesting for a 9am lecture. My biggest frustration with the class was that the problem sets didn't seem to have much to actually do with what we talked about in class, what could be found in the textbook, and required a lot of random googling, which was very time consuming for no clear reason. Additionally, it seemed like to get to the answer, which in theory was supposed to reveal something about the content of the class, there were chemistry\/physics principles required that were not necessarily explained. Also, the questions were basically about whether or not you could do unit conversions. Maybe this is useful for the G&G majors in the class, but it's basically worthless for anyone else.",
    "Professor Ague was great! I think the biggest weakness would be that the problem sets involved a lot of looking up random stuff online which was not necessarily so conducive to learning",
    "Strengths: Broad subject Weaknesses: Reading materials",
    "The material is interesting and Professor Ague is clearly brilliant but he is not the most dynamic lecturer and the 9 am class time made for some difficulty focusing."

    "Don't take this class if you don't like doing really, really annoying problem sets. The class seems easy. The problem sets seemed like they would be easy. Next thing you know, you're on a wild google goose chase for the most random pointless facts that are essential to the stupid question. It will take hours and you will have no clue if you did any of it right. Enjoy",
    "No. Very boring, random problem sets, and too early in the morning.",
    "Ague is a wonderful human being and engages with the subject matter passionately enough to make others (of all scientific\/non-scientific predispositions) excited about it as well.",
    "Yes, easy class, hardish midterm",
    "I would be hesitant to recommend this class to someone who doesn't do math regularly outside of this class. A lot of the pset problems are tedious and frustrating if you haven't done math in a while. That being said, I took the class because I felt it was important for people who are interested in going into policy to be scientifically literate in this area, and I do feel like I have a better grasp on the concepts.",
    "Aadvark. This course is pretty interesting if you haven't had much background in G&G or learning about natural resources. I think that the psets were sometimes graded pretty harshly and without much backing up, but besides that the workload is very manageable and if you go to lectures you'll learn a lot about the future of energy and the planet.",
    "This course actually does a really great job of teaching you about relevant topics in natural resource sustainability. Some might say that it is on the easier side, but I think that is a strength because it doesn't bog you down in the specifics but rather is able to cover a wide variety of topics.",
    "Midterm is hard, everything else is easy.",
    "A great science credit for non science majors!",
    "This course is a great introductory course, especially for non-stem majors.",
    "Honestly, as long as you do the work, it is an easy gut science in an interesting subject. Would recommend."
