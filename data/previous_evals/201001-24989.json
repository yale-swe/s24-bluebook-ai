   "comments": [
    "I enjoyed this class and thought it provided a good chance to understand materials and how their properties relate to underlying structural changes. The lab reports are written in scientific paper formate. My lab partner was great too, make sure you tag along with a friend that you feel will turn out quality work.",
    "If you can use this course to cover some lab requirement, go for it. The assignments are very straight-forward, and this is the only lab course at Yale that legitimately felt like a half-credit course. The instructor (Prof. Schroers) is pretty laid-back. The lab reports were a bit long (15 pgs., single spaced), but you always had ample time (2 weeks+), and the grading seemed lenient (though no letter grades were given). The reports were styled like scientific journal articles, so Prof. Schroers also took care to help us practice with scientific writing. This was much better than the other MENG Labs and PHYS Labs.",
    "Decent class to take. Don't expect too much accuracy with the last couple labs. First half of the term is just lecture, which means that you don't get any grade feedback until after the drop deadline. Be weary of procrastinating on writing the reports-they're fairly lengthy and require planning with your partner. Recommend that you take it concurrently with 285, though you don't need it to understand the class (since lecture covers everything you'll need to know). Be prepared for the workload to dramatically peak towards the end of the semester.",
    "Would recommend. Not heavy workload, the experiments are interesting, and improves your writing.",
    "This is a fairly easy, low work class (for once in this major). It's not all that interesting though and I didn't get much out of it.",
    "This is a good laboratory class, which teaches you how to write long labreports. You have to write 3 lab reports (15 pages each). For each report you get 1-2 meetings with the professor. During the meetings you discuss the drafts, which are supposed to improve after every meeting. The workload is worth the half credit, but is concentrated in the second half of the semester. It will helpful to take before you continue with other mechanical engineering lab classes.",
    "This course gave students the opportunity to explore material science principles through hands-on application and encouraged them to produce refined reports through multiple professor conferences and revisions."
