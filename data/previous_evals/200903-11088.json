   "comments": [
    "Yes - highly recommended. The course material is supposed to be about strategic thinking, which is very had to teach in a seminar style. but the two large assignments of the semester - the marshall brief and the crisis simulation - are really effective exercises. they require a great deal of work and aren't easy to get through by any means, but they are two of the best assignments I've had at Yale in terms of how well they teach me. the course much more about toughening yourself up as a leader and working strategically in a collaborative environment than exploring strategy in the us-china relationship.",
    "Definitely - students are challenged in ways no other course has done that I have taken or know of.",
    "There is no class like it at Yale. The Professors do not settle for b.s. Yale students are notorious for spurting out, and the Marshall Brief, aptly called 'murder boards' are an excruciating experience. I have never spent so much time on a single project in my 4 years at Yale. But it is totally worth it.",
    "I would recommend Grand Strategy for anyone interested in working in the government or the business world. The course helps you learn how to analyze and approach difficult issues and improves your presentation skills. Grand Strategy is both an intellectual and practical experience.",
    "I will recommend this to anyone. The readings and the interaction with the professors are what make this course great..."

    "This course has helped to prepare me for my career (Army) after graduation.",
    "1) In significant but subtle ways. Ultimately I believe that keeping the big picture in mind is paramount. Not all the details are important, but you need to figure out the ones that are and master the nuances.2) I did my summer project on topic of my senior essay. The opportunity to get a leg up on research, and take a unique angle over the summer that is not possible with my thesis was great.",
    "This course made me realize the complexity and difficulties of international and domestic politics.",
    "I have more questions than when I began...",
    "This course is exactly what I need for my profession. I am a serving Army officer currently detailed to West Point as an instructor, and I will go on to other positions of strategic importance in future assignments."
