    "What an amazing class! This course provided an overview of many of the body systems and their physiology from the cell\/molecular level to the tissue\/organ level.You should take it if you have time to study the material.",
    "good general overview of physiology, especially of the renal system. Strengths: Caplan and Aronson and Saltzman's lectures.Weaknesses: Honestly, Dr. Boulpaep's lectures are terrible.",
    "THIS IS A HARD CLASS! Lots of reading and way too much information in the book that is required for the class. If you take it, buy the Costanzo text and try to get Jenny as your TA. The book that we use goes into way too much detail that isn't relevant for the class and might just confuse you. The Costanzo text is a great supplement and Jenny was an awesome and helpful TA. There is an online quiz every week and about 60-80 pages of reading every week. It was an informative class, but also very stressful.",
    "Only if you have to.",
    "A really interesting bio course. Makes up for all the annoying introductory ones you have to take.",
    "Definitely take the course if you want to learn more about how the body coordinates different functions.",
    "Definitely recommend for pre-meds; essential information covered and very useful material for biology in general. Lots of memorization, but exams are fair. Just keep and no slacking and you will do well in the class, despite the heavy workload.",
    "Very information intensive course! The tests are fair, however, and if you put in the time to study and get enough sleep before the test, you should be fine. Probably better if you had some bio background. Also, this is the perfect preparation for the MCAT considering half the MCAT bio material is on physiological systems. Be sure to shop the TA sections because your TA will be your lifesaver. From what I have seen, Jenny, Enping, and Christoph were all very good.",
    "If you don't need this class for your major, I would recommend either taking it credit\/D or not taking it at all. The material is very interesting, but there is a lot covered in the class and it goes quickly. However, if you want to gain a general knowledge of physiology, this would be a good course to do so in. Just be warned that there is a lot of information to remember.",
    "This class is a LOT of work, but you'll get a lot out of it. It's a great grounding in physiology and if you're pre-med or majoring in biomedical engineering, there's probably not a better course. Be ready for the workload though; preparing for midterms and the final was absolute hell. There's just way too much material.STAY UP TO DATE WITH YOUR READING.",
    "TAKE THIS COURSEif you are interested in the topic. Yes it is a lot of work, yes there is a lot of reading, but at least for me it didn't feel like work. If you truly care about this topic or are even think you might be interested, this course is a fantastic way to figure out if this is what you want.Also, by far the most important thing I can tell you is ifSASCHA KOPICis TAing for this course, take it with him. He is the best TA I've ever had and he really shows a genuine love for this material and a caring for his students. You won't regret your decision.",
    "Take this class if you are strongly looking at medical school; it's a requirement for biomedical engineers, but I'm pretty sure it's the closest thing Yale has to an anatomy class for undergraduates. If you do well, you do well. If you don't, you can evaluate why you didn't and perhaps re-evaluate medical school.",
    "THIS COURSE IS AWESOME! It's the closest you'll get to med school while an undergraduate and I loved all the material in it. It's definitely NOT easy \u0097 there's a lotttt of information, and midterm and final season will be PHYSIO PHYSIO PHYSIO. But in the end realizing how much you've learned it worth it.",
    "If you're interested in the minute mechanisms of the bodily systems, definitely.",
    "Yes, a great course. Great review for the MCAT. And just really really interesting. But a lot of work. Plan to spend many nights with your physio textbook and notes.",
    "I would recommend it to a premed student or someone really interested in physiology. It is a TON of reading, and a lot of work in general, but you learn a lot too. As close as you get to med school as an undergrad.",
    "Yes, take it if you are interested. I took it as an elective and found it to be enjoyable. A bit of work around tests, but not too bad all-around.",
    "Yes, I recommend this class. Yes, it is hard. Yes, it covers a lot. Yes, it is doable, even if you have a tough schedule. You just have to keep on top of your work. Don't read from the textbook unless you need to supplement what you didn't understand in lecture (and it's much better to go to lecture than read the textbook). Many seniors take this, but you cantotally take it even if you haven't taken upper level biology classes.",
    "Physio is an amazing class. It put together a lot of information that I had learned in high school and other classes and built upon it, connecting thoughts and filling in so many of the gaps I had in my learning. It was thorough, straightforward, and I feel like I understand the human body much better now.The class rotated lecturers periodically depending on the topic being taught. Every lecturer was an expert on the topic, and for the most part they taught in the same way. Testing was also consistent between exams, and they were all multiple choice. This was great so my studying style didn't have to drastically change between teachers.Everything was clear and understandable in lecture, and you just had to remember it all. If something wasn't totally clear in lecture, the book was wonderful and correlated perfectly. The book had the best diagrams, and pretty much a diagram for everything. Some guest lecturers which didn't follow the book closely had their own handouts or the powerpoints had enough detail that reading would be unnecessary.",
    "it's an amazing class and i learned so much! just expect lots of competition for grades, as the class is curved and most people are dead set on med school. i would still recommend it to non-pre-meds however. great class overall and a subject that can benefit everyone.",
    "I would recommend it.",
    "take it if youre pre-med or need it for requirement. too much memorization and a killer curve. be prepared and keep up with the enormous amount of reading",
    "You should definitely take this class. At least if you can put in the time. It's required for BME majors, so you'll definitely run a tough curve. However, I learned so much from a great team of professors. I walk out of the class really feeling that I understand the information. Therefore, I would definitely recommend the course. However, it is a lot of work, and you won't get much out of the class if you don't put consistent time in (although I am sure it is possible to cram for exams). I actually thought it would be a lot worse when I started the class, though. Also, use the Costanzo textbook to supplement Boron and Boulpaep. It basically condenses all of the information, making it really helpful to know the important concepts.",
    "MCDB 310 is one of those intense-but worth the work--courses. You will know so much more about basic human physiology, if you're interested in learning about that subject. Two multiple choice, T\/F midterms, and a similar final. Great lecturers",
    "The class gives you a really sound understanding of physiology. It's super interesting, but it is difficult to demonstrate your understanding on the exams since they are multiple choice. The reading is impenetrable but can supplement the lecture really well if you can do it. Take it!",
    "Tons of information, and a lot of memorization, but a fantastic course! The professors are all wonderful. If you are interested in medicine, this is a good intro course to major medical concepts, and the professors often bring in clinical examples. Be prepared to study a lot before the exams.",
    "BENG350 is the perfect course for someone who feels very comfortable in their biological background and has always been curious about the hows and whys of the processes that are frequently glossed over in more basic bio courses. The material goes into incredible detail at the level of contemporary research in those mechanisms and processes covered in class, often coming down to the same basic, universal molecules and reactions, regardless of the system being examined. I would highly recommend this course to students who have more than a basic working knowledge of biology, as the more you know going into this course, the more you can take away from it.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class as a biology credit. The tests are not too difficult, all multiple choice, and the weekly problem sets are not too timeconsuming. Lectures are not boring, especially if you have an interest in the human body, and almost all of the professors are great.",
    "Take it after taking Cell Biology. Do the reading - it really helps. Go to section because the TAs really want you to succeed and are very knowledgeable. Go to class, especially if you don't have time to do all the reading thoroughly. This class it is a lot of work but you walk away feeling like you learned a lot and it gets you thinking about what specialty you might want to pursue (for those who are pre-med).",
    "Great course. It's weakness is that it's taught by so many professors that you never get to adjust to a single professor's style. That being said, it's nice to skip around and hear a bunch of different professors. Dr. Saltzman is great. Take it if you're interested in medicine or biology.",
    "MCDB 310 is a fast-paced course that covers many of the organ systems in the body in a short time. You will be presented with material of great breadth and depth. Thankfully, you won't have to know every little detail for the tests, which, if they haven't changed, are exclusively multiple-choice and true-false. That doesn't mean less study time, though, since there is so much material to sort out.Each organ system is presented by a different lecturer, and their lectures vary in pace and depth. For Professor Boulpaep's lectures especially, it is best to do the readings before the lectures, as he tends to go into significant detail. In general, all the lectures are very interesting, and you should not miss them, since they often pull out major points from the textbook, which is very dense.The material taught in this course can provide a foundation for anyone who will be working with the human body, whether as an engineer, a researcher, or a doctor, and I would recommend this course to anyone who falls into one of those three areas of study.",
    "I recommend it",
    "You need to work hard, but unlike a lot of other science courses, this class makes you feel like the hard work is worth it. You learn awesome stuff, and the work you do pays off. You don't need to always read the book (although it can be helpful, especially for the sections Boulpaep teaches) but you do need to go to class.Overall, highly recommended. I'm not a science major, by the way.",
    "i would recommend it with caution. You'll learn a lot of really valuable information about the human body, which is fascinating. The amount of material is overwhelming though, and it's very difficult to know what to focus on when studying for the tests. I think ideally this class would span two semesters so that the systems could be covered more clearly and in more detail, but as they try to cram it into one I would say take it and get out of it what you can, but don't overdo it.",
    "While the material for this course can sometimes feel like an overload (think trying to get a sip from a firehose) you will learn a TON and have a much deeper understanding of how the human body works. It is a really interesting class witha mix of majors and levels of students. There is a rotating professor lecture schedule, so each professor is an expert on what they cover. The book is much more than you will need to know for the test, so it's good to refer to but not worth doing the reading for each day.",
    "It's a lot of studying\/reading. But the class is very good.",
    "It's a wonderful class, a lot of work, but you learn more than you could have imagined, and more information that is relevant to your future field of study than most other science classes. I would highly recommend this course to anyone interested in medicine.",
    "This class was difficult, but rewarding. I would recommend it for students interested in medicine.",
    "It's a class about the body, and I'd definitely recommend it.",
    "Physiological Systems covers an incredible amount of information. Do not take it with another reading-intensive class unless you don't have much else on your plate. I really liked the multiple choice, T\/F exams.",
    "this is a fast paced overview of the different physiological systems. there is a great deal of material. however, the TA\"s are very helpful. if you are willing to put in a lot of time, you can get a lot out of this class.",
    "Yes! One of the best courses offered at Yale! Take it even if not BENG major : )"
