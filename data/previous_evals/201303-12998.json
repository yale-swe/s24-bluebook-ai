    "I would.",
    "The course engages with a fascinating mix of ideas, objects, and scholars and provides an opportunity to think about themes of travel and representation from a variety of standpoints. However, it sometimes suffers from a lack of focus and an attempt to cover too much ground. Overall I would recommend the course.",
    "Yes, especially because of the sustained use of and focus on primary source materials."

   "comments": [
    "This course provided exposure to a range of theoretical approaches and questions, which helped deepen my knowledge of the extent of current questions in art history. However, more focused discussions, more historical context for the topics of each class, and more in depth examination of how to evaluate the different approaches offered would have been even more helpful for my own research.",
    "It definitely helped with primary source work and use of archives\/rare book libraries. It was also outside of my main area and thus allowed me to engage with new topics as well as hear from others."
