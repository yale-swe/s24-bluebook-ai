    "I would say that taking Hebrew at Yale has been one of my best decisions in college. It is a wonderful program. All of the professors are truly amazing and you are really given the tools to succeed in learning the language.",
    "L4 Hebrew with Ayala was absolutely amazing. It was a great transition from L3, and I believe that I learned more Hebrew in this semester than in any other single semester. A large amount of material is covered and much homework is given throughout the week, but the homework was very effective at drilling the grammatical concepts into our heads. The conversational sections with Yevgeny were enjoyable each week. Overall, this is a must take class if you have made it this far. DO NOT STOP AT L3. L4 is so much better, and you can really feel your Hebrew ability move to another level.",
    "This course is an intensive grammatical advancement of your Hebrew knowledge. There is a lot of work but by the end of the course you will find that you have significantly improved from L3 and are ready for an L5 course.",

    "This class is a great continuation from L3. If you just keep up with the weekly assignments you will do well. Poems,songs,reading,writing,listening,speaking-all are beautifully incorporated into the class and add to the richness of the class. This is a class that will be of much profit to your Hebrew. And you know Hebrew is wonderful."
