   "comments": [
    "This was a great course! Take it take it. No matter what level you're at, you can get something out of it...the course is run like a masterclass, and you learn a new song every 2-3 weeks. Papers sometimes seem like extra work but are usually fun to write--this semester we got to interview and write a profile on a different broadway star, each of us (Andrew connected us with people he knows) and go see a show on Broadway. An overall awesome class! Andrew critiques honestly, and doesn't beat around the bush, but its to the level of each person.",
    "Yes.",
    "Yes, It's great to work on songs, and perform them. Further, You'll get to meet composers and collaborate with them.",
    "This class helps you to learn about musical theater history, gain more control over your singing voice, work with professional artists, and recognize your special and ingrained tendencies as a performer. It is helpful for musical theater actors and actresses who are interested in how to construct riveting, focused performances and will help you hold yourself to a higher standard when delivering lyrics",
    "I would! It was a great way to get to explore the combination of singing and acting in an in depth seminar, and I loved the class. It does meet for an hour longer than listed in the blue book, however.",
    "Sing songs, tell stories, get feedback, be part of a community of singer\/actors. Yes, I would.",
    "A fresh breath of air amongst lecture classes. Those who hope to pursue musical theater as a career will probably get the most out of this class, but those who simply enjoy performing the genre will learn a great deal as well. Students will learn through their own performances and one-on-one time working with the instructor, but also through professional performances, both recorded and live. Highly recommend!"
