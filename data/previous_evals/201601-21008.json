   "comments": [
    "This is a great class. Definitely made me think about a lot of things I had not encountered before in my life and introduced me to a whole range of new experiences.",
    "I would most definitely recommend this class to another students, even a student who has never taken a theatre or arts course before. One of the things that I enjoyed most about this class is that it was a diverse group of students. There were theatre majors, chemistry majors and people who had never heard of alternative theatre. Ultimately this eclectic group engendered a lot of hot debates about what constitutes art and theatre.",
    "This class is basically an intro to Polish Theater and also the avant garde. I came into it with only a knowledge of traditional theater and have walked out with my eyes open to the possibilities of avant garde and ensemble-based performance. This is a great class to fulfill the foreign language requirement of the THST major.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class! The theatre works we watched and read were fascinating. Our class discussions were also really enjoyable. The professor is knowledgeable, and I am very glad I took this class."
