   "comments": [
    "It's a required class for HSAR majors, but don't let that get you down or make you skeptical. I think this was one of the best classes I ever took at Yale and I feel that my way of approaching art history has become so much more well-rounded.",
    "I really enjoyed this class, it helped me understand my major as a valuable area of interdisciplinary study. You read quite a few great essays, the work load is not bad, and the discussion in class was led in an interesting way.",
    "good readings, take it with prof rizvi if possible because she's great.",
    "If you are planning to major in or study art history, then you should definitely take this class (not only because it's required for the major). If you are not, then you will probably not enjoy it. It is good for a person seriously interested in studying the history of art, and I thoroughly enjoyed it as such, but if you are not interested in this then I would not recommend the class.",
    "Probably to other HSAR majors or people who are interested in art and methods.",
    "Yes. Though it is a required course for all History of Art majors, I would recommend it to non majors as well. Some of the readings are tough, but in the end most of them were very rewarding. I have already come across many of the authors of the articles that we read in other courses, and certainly have a more nuanced understanding of what they are writing about after taking Critical Approaches.",
    "I would definitely recommend taking this class with Professor Rizvi to any art history major, and majors will be happy they took the class. For other students, the class was often technical and in some moments, boring. We didn't necessarily look at art as students do in other art history classes, and students learn more about art history as a discipline than learning actual art history. Professor Rizvi was very approachable and kind, and the best way to take this class is with her."
