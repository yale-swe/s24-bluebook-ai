    "If this class is offered again as a seminar, I highly highly recommend it. The class dynamic was fantastic and I've never felt so emotionally invested in a class.",
    "Yes. Take this class to learn about comfort women, Korean history, Japanese history, and see how they all connect.",
    "This class was great. The teacher is really passionate, smart, and approachable. I loved that she really cared about the subject matter. If you are interested in the subject matter - I recommend the class. But its important to look carefully at the syllabus. The class is a combination of the history of comfort women and theories about social repair. Its somewhat philosophy heavy, so if you dont like the theory behind trauma, public apology, monuments etc. I wouldn't recommend the class. Its not policy based. It does, however, provide students a great place to process through ideas about social and individual healing, human rights abuses, theories of justice etc. Sometimes it was a little hard to stay engaged the whole class because it was 2 hours after dinner. But if you like the material, its a really cool space to discuss your ideas with other really cool students. It was also really nice that it counted as a writing requirement. Overall, I recommend the class.",
    "in our weekly seminars, we discussed trauma, reparations, memory and forgiveness using the case study of the comfort women. we had several hours of readings a week for which we had to do 300 word reading responses. we wrote a midterm and final paper.YES! tammy is awesome and runs a fabulous class! she really cares about student input. she is understanding (if you need extensions) and runs smooth and thought-provoking discussions. the material is fascinating and the trauma and reparations framework is extremely applicable. TAKE IT!",
    "Yes, I would recommend the class.",
    "I definitely recommend this course.",
    "CSES focuses on the \"Comfort Women system and the broader psychological and reparations issues that surround and contextualize this atrocity.I would recommend this class to anyone interested in human justice.",
    "You will learn a lot about reconciliation, reparations, forgiveness, etc. Those who are interested in human rights issues should definitely take this class. It is really good."
