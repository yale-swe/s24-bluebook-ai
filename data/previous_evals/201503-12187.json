    "TAKE IT TAKE IT. You will have to work, don't get me wrong. But this course will be so enjoyable and rewarding if you put the time in.",
    "Although a few lectures were a touch dull, this is a must-take course, especially for queer students. Many lectures will overwhelm you with emotion, especially the AIDS lecture and the final lecture. Professor Chauncey is amazing.",
    "Must take if you're LGBT++ in any way. Or even if you're not. It's a great intro course for people who have never taken a history class before too.",
    "OH MY GOD TAKE THIS CLASS. No reservations, I wholeheartedly recommend this class. This is one of the classes you absolutely must take at Yale. The workload is very reasonable: two papers, a midterm, and a final. There is also weekly reading, which really does end up being kind of a lot of reading, but if you space it out throughout the week effectively it shouldn't take more than an hour per night. I think there are a lot of students who get by without doing much or any of the reading, but I think you definitely should do the readings if you want to get a better understanding of the content and truly immerse yourself in gay history. Overall, TAKE THIS CLASS.",
    "Can be a gut if you want it to, can be the most informative and inspirational you've ever taken if you want it to. Moderate amounts of required weekly readings that aren't entirely necessary, but you need to at least skim them to say anything in section. This is such an important topic that most people have no idea about at all. So glad I took it, and glad I Credit\/D'd.",
    "TAKE THIS COURSE! it is fantastic, organized and incredible",
    "This course is a good course. It's not life changing, but it's a really good survey of a history that is, unfortunately, not given the justice that it deserves. If you're interested in learning more about sexuality and the LGBTQ movements in the United States, take it, but don't expect your life to be transformed.",
    "The best lecture offered at Yale, hands down. I absolutely loved every single minute I was in class. Chauncey is a star. There is a sense in the room that everyone feels unbelievably lucky to be listening to and learning from such a funny, brilliant, and compassionate teacher. He made everyone feel so comfortable, and he explained time and again with such wit and grace how important history is in our daily lives. I was into many of the course concepts such as history, intersectionality, identity, power, belonging, community, and difference before I took the class, but now I have a more profound appreciation for them and the way they have and continue to operate in American society. The readings (especially Audre Lorde!) were killer - books and articles that everyone should read. I will always remember this class. :)",
    "Be cautious, because it is an excellently taught class, but it's more about les\/gay history in select cities in the East and West Coast, and mostly about white gays, as hard as Chauncey tries. I know the documentation is sometimes lacking for PoC and trans* people, although I wish there were more than two weeks on PoC.",
    "Take this class!!!",
    "This course is amazing. Everyone says it's life-changing, and that's true -- it's totally changed my perspective. But what's most special about the class is the way it's taught. The readings are so well-curated that they really add to the addition of the class, the films add to the experience, and all the lectures are of course wonderful but also fun (Chauncey plays music before and after them!) I would say, however, that you do get a lot more by putting a lot more into it. I wouldn't recommend it as a fifth class or even as a Credit\/D -- the assignments are so pedagogically helpful that you'll actually want to do them to the best of your ability. Take it in a semester where you can actually get the most out of it.",
    "It was an amazing class that will force you to think critically about your identity and american history. I cannot recommend it highly enough",
    "This is a class every Yale student should take. Professor Chauncey is easily the most dynamic lecturer I've had here, and brings a level of personal investment to an already rich material that cannot be matched by any other class I've taken. Do not miss this class.",
    "Great history class. Great Credit D: just go to lecture and read the interesting and paper related readings. Chauncey puts his all into this class and it shows. 20th century american history is interesting generally and this is an important and nuanced perspective on that history. Great for freshmen or STEM ppl looking for variety.",
    "TAKE IT. Why wouldn't you? This material is crucial to your understanding of contemporary America and the class is beyond fun. Not too much work, and even better if you Cr\/D!",
    "LesGay! It's a legendary course, and for good reason. Chauncey's lectures are captivating, and the material itself is fascinating. Even the readings, generally, didn't feel dry (although they could be pretty extensive at times.) Very reasonable workload -- an introductory assignment, two papers, final, and required section -- that compliments what you do in lecture quite well. It's a must take!",
    "Great class! Will teach you that most things you think about gay life before the 70s is probably wrong. Chauncey is a highly engaged lecturer. He cares a lot, and that made me care a lot.",
    "This was my first history course at Yale, and I really enjoyed it. The material is so interesting, and you end really getting a sense of the field, which is relatively new. Chauncey is an excellent lecturer, and the workload is completely manageable.",
    "One of the most understudied and under appreciated areas of history-take the course. Should be required for history major. The beginning of the class is fantastic-probably the best look at New York in the twenties is Chauncey's book. Papers are fun to write, especially the last one. Highly recommended.",
    "Learning about gay history. It is a class everyone must take. It is eye-opening and though-provoking. I feel like I have so much more insight about the world.",
    "I honestly only took this class at first because I had always hated history courses and wanted to try just one at Yale to see if it would change my mind. This course had the best evaluations (they ALL insisted that I take this class before graduating), and so I took it on a whim. I had an amazing experience! Every single lecture was truly interesting, and not only did I come to all of them, I never fell asleep even once. I'm now advising you as last year's class advised me via evaluations: TAKE THIS CLASS.",
    "This course live up to its hype. The lectures are always engaging, and the subject matter is really interesting. It does a very good job of showing how the things we see in the present came to be.",
    "PLEASE TAKE THIS CLASS. Drop everything else that stands in the way and take this class. Chauncey is a wonderful human being; the course material will blow your mind; the readings are almost all very engaging and a joy to read; and the two papers and midterm and final are fair and interesting. This course is a Yale gem. Listen to these evals and go for it, no matter what you're interested in-- you will love this class.",
    "This is one of the best classes at Yale. Professor Chauncey is really the funniest, most intelligent, and most impressive professor I have ever had - you will not have a better teacher than him - and the material is incredible. You're literally learning about American history in a way that you never have before, from the point of view of a group of people that have been underground or so heavily silenced for so long you had no idea how they experienced such famous events like the Roaring 20s, WWII, the McCarthy era, etc. It is not that much work and it is a class you will WANT to go to every day, so whether it is a credit D, a history requirement, or a senior year last-chance class, take it.",
    "This class manages to be simultaneously fascinating and somewhat problematic. Although I thought I knew a bit about queer history, I learned so much in this class and feel it's something of a must-take. Professor Chauncey delivers extremely polished and engaging lectures and the readings are usually very interesting. At the same time, the class doesn't do a great job incorporating diversity: although Chauncey appears to make an effort to incorporate QPOC and trans history, it sometimes feels somewhat sidebarred. Also, Chauncey doesn't always know the right vocabulary to use to talk about trans people and there were some very questionable moments. I'd highly recommend this class, but just warn people to take it with a grain of salt and to know going in that it has some major flaws.",
    "Simply put the best taught most interesting lectures you'll find at Yale. So much fun. Two papers, two exams, weekly readings that you don't really have to do. Great great great course.",
    "Take it!!! It's as\/more amazing than people say. Don't take it credit d tho--you'll want to do the work. I really regret doing it credit d",
    "Yes, I wholeheartedly recommend U.S. LesGay History to a fellow student, no matter what you think you know or like about the subject. Great class, great professor, great material.",
    "THE ONLY COURSE AT YALE THAT YOU MUST TAKE! Amazing!",
    "I would recommend this class to literally everyone and anyone at Yale. As much of a history course as it is, the course speaks directly to major sociopolitical issues of today and offers a more informed way of thinking about them. Furthermore, the class is just amazing. It was a pure joy to go to everyday.",
    "This course is amazing! Lectures are a pleasure to attend and you learn so much about an important but often disregarded history. The readings and films supplement the course perfectly. Professor Chauncey is one of the best I've ever had. Definitely take this class!",
    "I would easily recommend this class to anyone at Yale! It's not too difficult a class and the subject matter is super interesting. The readings can be a bit lengthy, so if that's a concern, then take the class credit\/D\/fail because the class is so worthwhile.",
    "TAKE IT!!!! TAKE IT TAKE TAKE IT, do not graduate without taking this class, and do the readings b\/c they are worth it!!!",
    "SO SO SO INTERSTING! A MUST TAKE! I HAD NEVER TAKEN A HISTORY COURSE AND I LOVED IT!",
    "A must! It's a great course if you're straight, and potentially a life-changing one if you're gay (but seriously). I took it mostly because of the reviews, and it doesn't disappoint! Prof Chauncey is really passionate and a real expert of this topic.",
    "This is one of the classes I think every student should take at Yale. It contextualizes so much about modern society, and is so incredibly taught.",
    "Believe the hype! Professor Chauncey's lectures were the highlight of my academic week. The reading is manageable, the tests are easy, and the experience of learning history from a minority viewpoint is invaluable. Queer history is so much more than coming out and marriage equality. This class goes as far back as Puritan England and added a new layer to my understanding of American history. Chauncey is basically the ideal professor, making an effort to get to know everyone in his 200-person lecture. If you're looking for a fun class to balance your schedule, or even the slightest bit interested in the topic, take it!",
    "Still an amazing course!!! A perfect way to round out your schedule. I would recommend taking the class Cr\/D\/F, so you can simply enjoy the lectures without worrying about the midterm and final, which do require a good deal of preparation. The papers are very simple, as one would expect of an introductory course, but the class is worth it simply for the content and the professor who delivers it!",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS. An incredible experience. I've never taken a class that is so consistently as engaging and incredible as this. Every lecture, I found myself sinking into my cozy red seat in the YUAG auditorium and just absorbing Chauncey's words for 50 minutes without distraction. It'll make you laugh, it'll make you cry, and you'll come out feeling much richer.",
    "As far as Chauncey goes, I can't besmirch the legendof course, his lectures approached perfection, his performances on stage never failed to mesmerize, but the most remarkable thing was his uncanny ability to make each of the 200-odd people in the course feel a kind of personal, almost familial closeness to hima closeness that commanded our attention, admiration, and, most importantly, adoration. The problem with this course was with the assessmentmy TA spent almost no time explaining them. In-class closed-book exams are a totally ridiculous form of evaluation for a history survey coursethis class ought to be papers only. In the end, this just encouraged me to waste my time memorizing facts and dates, which I think was a pretty poor use of my time.",
    "I would summarize HIST 127 as a thorough history course about gay and lesbian people in America and how they influenced cultural practices and norms over time. I HIGHLY recommend this class to everyone. It should be required.",
    "What is a \"gay agenda\"?",
    "Take this class!! It's a wonderful way to learn more about a different aspect of US history that is not really discussed in AP history class. Chauncey is a great lecturer, and the workload is really manageable.",
    "If you're interested in the subject and the content, this is a tremendous class. Professor Chauncey is legendary and your exploration of your own family's relationship to the LGBT world will allow you to really connect the course material to everything you've ever known, and you'll be surprised. Perspectives on LGBT Americans are shifting incredibly quickly, and this course provides all the context and much, much more.",
    "TAKE IT. This evaluation, like so many others, is that this is one of the best classes I have taken so far at Yale, and I would definitely recommend it to another student. The material is very interesting and relevant, and Chauncey's well-organized lectures make it easy to learn and synthesise. There are two 5-page papers, a midterm and a final. The final can be tricky, and the other assessments are fine. A very manageable workload for a great class.",
    "YES! amazing class!",
    "TAKE IT TAKE IT TAKE IT. Such an incredibly moving, inspiring and important class. It is so rare to find a near-perfect lecture at Yale and this is it. Every class was an adventure and the best part of my day every day. A must take for all Yale students no matter their major. Chauncey is superhuman. Believe the hype.",
    "Great lectures--you absolutely have to take this class! I gained a lot of perspective on gay and lesbian history, but also history in general. Not too much work.",
    "MANDATORY CLASS THAT POSITIONS AND EXPLAINS THE QUEER HISTORY OF THIS COUNTRY.",
    "PLEASE take this class! Not only is the history so important, but Professor Chauncey is such a gem. He makes a huge effort to get to know as many students as possible, and he cares so deeply about his students and about the material, which makes the experience of taking this class distinct from any other lecture. While you can definitely take this class CR\/D (I did), or even take it for a letter grade and do pretty well without slaving over the readings and assignments, I would also say that I would have gotten more out of the class if I had been able to do more of the readings. It's worth the time, and you get more out of it the more you put in. DEFINITELY a must-take while at Yale! It is spectacular.",
    "Take this class. Best class ever. Learned so much",
    "Definitely take it! Wonderful class and you learn so much that isn't available elsewhere.",
    "This was a great course. I would absolutely recommend it. I learned so much from Professor Chauncey, who was a dynamic and engaging lecturer throughout the semester.",
    "Take it. You must. No excuses. If you're a history major, it will be one of the best lectures you've had. If you're not a history major, it will be one of the best lectures you've had. I cannot say enough good things.",
    "A class that everyone at Yale should take before they leave. As a first-semester senior taking this as my first history course, it was awesome! Lectures were a joy to attend and Professor Chauncey made an effort to know everyone's names, which made the class feel more personal. Definitely take it.",
    "An amazing class.",
    "AMST 135 traces the meaning of sex, gender, and lesbian and gay history from the 1600s to present. Chauncey engages the class every lecture, and makes each class more interesting when he talks about personal stories and experiences. Reading the books\/course packet is really important for fully understanding the narrative Chauncey paints in class, and the essays require a lot of thinking. There is not the best chronological structure to the courses, but it's still really interesting. Get to class early, because every lecture starts with music!",
    "This course is for any student, whether they are a senior or a freshman, straight or queer, a STEM major or a humanities major. The content of this course not only provides students with hard facts of the history of a people that is not normally taught or discussed in the traditional classroom, but students learn how to dissect various cultures (e.g.: the culture of cities, of sexuality, of gender expression, etc.) in a way that most people are not accustomed to. Definitely a class worth taking.",
    "U.S. Lesbian and Gay History focuses on the history of queer individuals and how the idea of queerness has changed throughout United States history. It is an amazing class, and I would recommend it to anyone, regardless of whether they think they are interested in the subject. Queerness weaves itself into so much of U.S. history--it's eye-opening to learn about this relevant subject from an amazing professor.",
    "Must take. Chauncey is wonderful and the subject matter is important for everyone to know.",
    "Great class but be warned that the grading is harder than you think",
    "Please take this class because you'll be a better person.",
    "This is the most amazing class! It's popular for a good reason. Absolutely take this class, but make sure you give yourself enough time to attend lecture and do the readings. This class isn't very hard, but don't write it off as an easy fifth class. You'll regret not giving your time to this class.",
    "would recommend it",
    "Yes- a must take before graduating; where else will you learn this stuff?",
    "An amazing, Yale must-take.",
    "A very powerful class in many ways. A perfect first history lecture for anyone, and also a must-take for anyone. Prof Chauncey is amazing. Take it!",
    "U.S. Lesbian and Gay History explores the history of politics and culture in gay society in America over the past few hundred years, focusing on the 20th century, and leading up to the modern marriage equality debate and victory. The course incorporates readings, both historical and contemporary that supplement and enrich the facts taught in lecture. Paper assignments focus on engaging with the material on an analytical level, placing personal accounts within the broader historical context of the course. I would recommend this class to ANY student. EVERYONE should take this course at some point. This is an integral part of American history that most people, myself included, have never learned before.",
    "Absolutely. The history is extremely important for everyone to know, and Chauncey an incredible lecturer.",
    "The lectures are very well done and do a nice job summarizing a huge swarth of history. It is a survey course, and a very very good one at that. I was consistently fascinated by the material; I found myself a little sad at the end of each lecture because I knew it was over. This class is probably best taken Cr\/D\/F because the sections are just not nearly as strong as the lecture, and the grading was pretty arbitrary. Overall, I highly recommend. Professor Chauncey is a great lecturer and a treasure that Yale needs to hold on to.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course 100x! It is a fantastic look at the history of a particular people that is truly moving and personal. I learned so much from the course and Chauncey really facilitated that. Fell in love from the first lecture.",
    "Wonderful class. Must-take at Yale. We are lucky to have his subject taught at this school",
    "Yes take it! A history of gay and lesbian life with an emphasis on overarching themes.",
    "This is one of the best classes I've taken at Yale: I've never enjoyed a lecture more! It's fun, you learn a lot, and the workload is pretty light\/interesting.",
    "YES YES YES",
    "This is the best lecture I've taken at Yale. I would recommend it to anyone and everyone who is a student at this school.",
    "Take it. Good luck trying to learn this material as effectively as you would have in this lecture. Chauncey is amazing and knows how to make it a fun course for anybody. I don't even like history that much and I thought this course was incredible. 10\/10 would recommend.",
    "I had a love-hate relationship with Lesgay. I loved learning the material and hearing all the lectures, and Professor Chauncey is just delightful. However, there was so much reading and, as a science major, I felt like the grading was very hard. I dont regret taking the class, as I learned so much interesting and relevant history and it really has made me think about things differently, but I dont think its necessarily the right class for everyone.",
    "US Gay and Lesbian History is a wonderful course that you should take. Just take it.",
    "I would not recommend the class to another student unless I knew that student would never take any time to learn about important American history.",
    "Insanely awesome. A must-take, for anyone at Yale before they graduate. Not only does it expose you to an important history that otherwise you would probably never learn about, it also forces you to reflect about your identity (whether LGBT or not), sexuality\/the meaning of sex, conception of family, society and culture. TAKE IT.",
    "Highly recommend this class for anyone who wants to take a US history course that you don't hear much about at all. Eye opener even if you think you know a lot about queer history in the US. Well balanced and Chauncey is darling.",
    "Really interesting, and the professor is great. Not only do you see lesbian and gay history differently, especially the recent developments in gay marriage, you also look at your own family's history in a new way. 10\/10 would recommend to a friend.",
    "Take it. It's a gem of a class you can't take anywhere else right now. Great history class, great american studies class, great WGSS class.",
    "Definitely take this class. It is a must. Best class I've taken at Yale. Important history to learn about. Your education and historical perspective will not be complete without it. Chauncey is amazing. Best lecturer I've ever had.",
    "Absolutely take it! I learned so much I didn't know about gender and sexuality and the lectures are really engaging.",
    "U.S. Lesbian and Gay History is a great class, especially as a first history class. The material is interesting and unique; I had never heard of most of the stuff we studied. There is a lot of reading that was a bit of a struggle to keep up with, and if you start on the essays early you can usually get help- though even if you don't, they're not too bad and the professor provides some helpful guides. The lectures are a bit fast and cover a lot that ends up on the exams, so it's a good idea to study with other people to fill in gaps. Professor Chauncey is amazing, and most (if not all) of the TFs are also amazing, so it's very enjoyable both in lecture and in section. Overall, this course felt like a very valuable part of my Yale education, not just for the history I learned but the way I think about history and especially about marginalized people's histories.",
    "Amazing, amazing, amazing. Best class I have taken at Yale and I'm a senior. So fun and you learn so much and not too hard.",
    "It was certainly an interesting class and I'm happy I took it but I didn't think it was quite as fantastic as everyone made it out to be.",
    "If you're interesting in this topic, definitely take this course. US Lesbian and Gay History is a great class that is not too difficult and you'll look forward to going to class each day. Take this class.",
    "I 100% recommend this course. The daily workload is very manageable (read: minimal to none), I loved going to lectures everyday (Chauncey is a must-have professor at Yale), and the midterms\/papers are easy and rewarding to study for or write. Chauncey is very organized with his lectures and weaves together 2 centuries worth of gay history into a cohesive course. The oral history paper really makes you think critically about HOW you (and your parents\/grandparents) think about the gay community and WHY.",
    "This was an amazing class and one of my favorite classes I have taken at Yale. As a science major, I took it credit D and it was just like listening to a story each week. Chauncey is amazing, and the readings are actually pretty great. This is a must take at Yale.",
    "This class is a classic Yale course, and for good reason. A number of history classes will talk about topics that you have some measure of familiarity with, but Professor Chauncey covers topics that I had never been introduced to. The work is incredibly manageable, the readings are interesting, and again - the topic is so interesting. Take it take it take it.",
    "AMST was one of my favorite classes. Professor Chauncey has an eloquent knack for crafting a story when talking about LGBT history. It was a fascinating class and I'm extremely glad I took it as it opened my eyes to the experience of communities that typically don't have their stories told. If you want to look at history in a different manner, this is the class for you to take. Great class to take with other friends, as well!",
    "Of course! This is an engaging, well-taught class that gave me a new perspective on the cultural and sexual history of the United States. I enjoyed all the lectures, and my sections were interesting, too. I learned so much in this class, as I think every student in it did.",
    "Take this class! Must take before you graduate. Really amazing and really eye-opening and really really worth it. A lot of reading that you must keep up with, but not difficult to do.",
    "Take it take it take it.",
    "You must take this class sometime during your time at Yale. It will change your life.",
    "If you are at all interested in this topic then by all means take the course you will not be disappointed. This course cannot be found in other places and really is a great way of understanding history. I for one learned so much about American history of the 20 and 21st centuries. The lectures are dense but in an amazing way I have never seen before. Great course.",
    "This is redundant, but one of the best courses I've taken at Yale, and I'm a CS major. I think everyone gets something different from this course depending on what other history\/anthro\/etc courses they have taken and what kinds of issues they engage with outside the classroom, but one thing I was relieved at was this: This course will not just be a list of dates about the gay liberation movement. This is a course about how human sexuality and perceptions thereof evolve in a political and historical context, and as such it reveals deep truths about human nature, racial politics, class politics, etc. It sounds sweeping, but Chauncey manages to bring together big ideas with detail and nuance. And the history itself is really quite good, it isn't just a bunch of Yalies kicking around big theories based on thin evidence. Lecture was the highlight of my week.",
    "A must-take! Readings and lectures are amazing, and the workload isn't too stressful.",
    "Do it! It's one of the best classes that I've taken at Yale. This class illuminates not only LGBT history but how it plays in the frame of larger American history and culture, giving a new perspective in the current culture we live in. The workload is not too bad. Show up to every lecture; they make up the bulk of the exams and they are not posted online. There is a fair amount of reading, taking two hours or more per week. However, some is skimmable, and the later readings are shorter and more insightful on current events.",
    "10\/10 would recommend.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to others."
