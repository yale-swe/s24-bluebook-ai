   "comments": [
    "Loved it. As a non-science major taking the course because I wanted to learn biochem (and I had heard that the class was really great), it definitely went beyond my expectations. The lectures were very interesting and Koelle\/Engelman were great lecturers. Problem and exams were not bad at all and I learned a lot of really applicable material in class. I would definitely recommend taking this class, even if you aren't a premed.",
    "Yeah, it's a very interesting class if you're at all interested in the topic.",
    "MB&B 300 is a run through the structure and function of biological molecules and how they work together in your body. It's a great class. I've learned a lot both on the molecular level and on the practical, macroscopic level. This course was REALLY well put together. Professors\/TAs were very organized. It was clear what you needed to focus on and what you didn't. The midterms and grading were fair. This was probably the best organized course I've taken at Yale.Definitely recommend if it's the sort of thing you're interested in. The workload is pretty heavy but both manageable and rewarding. I read almost all assigned pages of the textbook and found it to be really helpful. I know people who've had success just using the textbook as a reference as well.",
    "take it if you need it for a major or premed, good science course",
    "This is exactly as described by all the other responses that I read when reviewing this. The people taking this class tend to all be the type such that the distribution of test scores tends to be very high. Its a good class though",
    "Take this course! You get to learn a lot of cool things, although watch out because there is quite a bit of memorization involved. The professors are great and work really hard to make things understandable.",
    "Take it! I was debating between MCDB biochem and MB&B biochem and I am SO GLAD I took this one! It is much less about rote memorization, focusing instead on comprehension and synthesis of ideas. The material is fascinating - it was a great combo of cell biology and orgo, but without the horrible synthesis chemistry of orgo. The tests were fair - there was always a page of fill in the blank - the memorization aspect, then the rest were questions asking us to use the material in a new way. I'm definitely taking the second semester as well! This is all coming from an art history major pre-med.",
    "It's a very well-organized, well-presented class. Professor Koelle is a great lecturer. The curves in this class are rough though - be prepared for a lot of intense premeds raising the curve. But you'll certainly walk out with a better understanding of biochemistry if you put in the work, which I'd say is necessary for any future doctor\/biomedical researcher.",
    "You probably don't have a choice, but if you did, I'd still recommend it. Legions above the MCDB version. Better lectures, you learn more, also more competitive.",
    "Great biochem course. Looking forward to the next semester.",
    "Take this class over the MCDB one. Koelle is a phenomenal professor, and you will learn so much. Yeah, it's hard, but it's totally worth putting your time into. Not just rote memorization like most bio classes, but also teaches you to integrate things together, which is the real secret behind why bio is exciting.",
    "This class is really interesting and a good introduction to looking at cellular processes in a biochemical perspective. Some of the lectures go into excruciating detail, but it all makes sense at the end. The tests were sometimes frustrating. I guess you will probably take this class because you are premed or an MB&B major, so why are you reading this?",
    "MBB 300 is a class that I would highly recommend. The class definitely emphasizes an understanding (rather than memorizing) of biochemistry. Admittedly, memorization is necessary for the class, but this only accounts for part of the work that goes into the class; the rest is putting all of the pieces together and integrating all of the information. Also, at the beginning of the semester the professors emphasize staying on top of the material; since the exams are written to test for understanding, last-minute cramming and memorization typically won't cut it.",
    "Great class. Interesting material presented well in lectures. Weekly problem sets made up of questions from old exams. Exams can be challenging but are fair and pose interesting questions. You will do fine if you study well and understand all the material. At the end of most lectures there's a ~15 minute supplementary material section during which interesting topics that won't be tested are presented.Pay attention in class. I never really opened the textbook except to clarify a few spots on slides that were confusing\/unclear or if I was particularly interested in a topic and wanted to find out more. That being said, if I had more time I would have done the readings for every lecture (it's a good book).",
    "Really hard and challenging but best science lecture I've taken at Yale.",
    "It is a good class that is well taught, and I would highly recommend it if you are looking to learn biochem well. It isn't straight forward memorization though and asks you to go beyond and apply the concepts you learn in the tests. Overall, I recommend it if you are truly interested in learning.",
    "Difficult but interesting biochem course. Be prepared to keep up.",
    "Yes. If you are hard worker and intellectually motivated",
    "Fabulous biochem class that teaches you how to THINK like a biochemist, not just memorize pathways. It really tied in concepts from genchem, orgo (not as much as you'd think, though!), physics, and cell bio for me. Koelle is one of the best scientist lecturers at Yale. The psets are manageable and the two midterms + final format is fine. Don't take this if you don't have the time to put into it though; cramming won't really help with conceptual questions on the test.",
    "This class is alright. It's kind of like freshman organic but easier.",
    "Good class, tough material made only worse by ridiculous TAs. Hopefully they will be kept on a shorter leash next fall.",
    "I would recommend this course, especially over the MCDB version of biochem, which only lasts a semester. The MB&B version of biochem is a year long, so you get to spend more time on the material and you don't have to cram it intoone semester. The homework is pretty easy, and it's a great preparation for the exams. My only complaint is that the grading on the exams is really nit-picky, and sometimes it's hard to determine what the question is actually asking you for, or how much detail you need to go into. You kind of get used to the exam style by the time the final rolls around though.",
    "This is a great course, and Professor Koelle is wonderful. The material is really not that difficult - in fact, so many people do well on the exams that the curve is actually very steep and the TAs end up having to grade very harshly. That being said, I thoroughly enjoyed this class.",
    "This class is difficult but well worth the work. It is the best-taught science class I have taken at Yale, and I learned a lot. It is well-taught and well-structured. Make sure to keep up with the readings to enhance your understanding, because the tests are really hard whereas the problem sets aren't that bad.",
    "This course provides an excellent introduction to biochemistry through a series of lectures on the nature of proteins, carbohydrates, lipids, and basic metabolism. The lectures have been fine-tuned by years of tweaking and also benefit from the addition of daily supplements, fifteen minute mini-lectures at the end of each class session that deal with interesting material not on the syllabus (prions, drug development, etc.). Michael Koelle in particular is an engaging lecturer, and helped make this my favorite class out of the fifteen or so science courses I have taken at Yale. The questions on tests and problem sets are well-constructed puzzles that force you to really engage with the material beyond simple memorization. (That said, without the memorization component, you won't be able to make sense of the test questions.) Unlike the second semester, students with no background in a biochemistry lab are at no real disadvantage.",
    "Yes, this class is amazing. If you're choosing between MCDB and MB&B, I recommend MB&B. It's very conceptual, but you take the final and realize that you have an understanding of the material that goes far beyond memorization. Koelle and Engelman are also extraordinary lecturers.",
    "It was a good, interesting class. It was a lot of work. You cannot just know everything from class to get an A (even though they tell you simply to know what is discussedin class). From what I have heard, I would recommend this class over the other biochemistry offered because this helps you understand the basics\/concepts\/problem solving skill more and is less about just memorizing cycles.",
    "Yes, if you are deciding between this and MCDB biochemistry, take this course",
    "Do it. 2 midterms plus final, all memorization so review the material every week.",
    "Wonderful course which provides a good intro into Biochemistry - especially metabolism. A good level of memorization is involved though, so pick carefully.",
    "It's mandatory for MB&B, and soon will become mandatory for premed. If you're one of those crazies just taking it for fun, it's a lot of work come exam time. Problem sets aren't hard, but the TA's are erratic in the level of specificity they want in your answers, and how many points they take off when you miss something.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. It is challenging, but worth it. The course is similar to Cell Biology in terms of some overlap. It emphasizes concepts instead of rote memorization which was great. It really teaches you how to think in new situations. The problem sets are fair, and so are the exams. Everyone I've talked to about this class has enjoyed it, while many of the people in the MCDB version don't particularly like it, so take this one!",
    "i needed the course for my major, but it was interesting nevertheless. be prepared for the crazy curve though...",
    "The content of this course should be clear: the chemistry of life. It is worthwhile knowledge that is taught clearly. Professor Koelle was particularly energetic and enthusiastic. Concepts are not difficult, but all the small concepts put together creates the challenge.",
    "Awesome class, difficult but highly recommend it. Michael Koelle!!!! and Don Engelman were both amazing lecturers, and the material is very interesting and effectively presented.",
    "Take it if you're interested in biochem. you will learn a lot, but it is an overwhelming amount of material (though not an overwhelming amount of work).enjoyed it. happy i took it but lots of memorization",
    "Great course! Workload is alot, but if you keep up (don't fall behind!) and study hard, you'll be fine.",
    "This is a very rigorous and fast-paced course that really gets the students involved in the material. The supplements were a great addition in that they contextualized the lecture material with contemporary research and interesting applications. However, there was a lot of material and there was a stress on memorization.",
    "It's not a great class but many have to take it. Shop both this course and the MCDB biochem to make the best choice for your schedule.",
    "If you have to take biochem, better this one than the other",
    "This class goes over A LOT of material. It's not a ton of chemistry. You can take it and be fine if you haven't had an intro bio course. A lot of people taking the class are super intense, so either expect to study more than you'd like to or stop worrying about your gpa. This class was great, and though",
    "A very good class, if you pay attention and take good notes, you will learn a lot about biochemical processes. Reading for the class will help for the first half of the class about proteins, but for the latter half of the class about complicated metabolic metabolism, I found the reading less helpful, and even confusing. Grading is pretty harsh in this class, a good credit\/d if you don't actually need this class for requirements.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to anyone who is interested in biochemistry (or biology) and is willing to put in the time it takes to master the material. It was a great class, but also very difficult. The professors are very engaging, and they really try to explain things in a way that makes them make sense. You learn so much about biochemistry and its practical applications. If you take this class, make sure to follow their recommendations and try to master the material immediately after the lecture. This class is not at all difficult because of the workload, but because of the material and the amount of detail that you're expected to know. At the end, though, you will have learned a ton of concepts that you will be able to apply in a lab.",
    "It'sdefinitely not an easy class, especially if you're trying to balance other science classes like Physiological Systems, working in a lab, interviewing for medical school and playing a sport. I constantly felt like it was the kind of class that required many hours more of studying just to do marginally better on exams, and that was time I didn't have unfortunately. I learned some really valuable information though, and would recommend it to any student looking for a challenging, comprehensive approach to biochemistry.",
    "MBB300 is a very interesting course, just be aware that it is very time intensive. To do well in the course, you must keep up with the reading. If you get behind, it is extremely difficult to catch up.",
    "You probably don't have that much of a choice about whether or not you take this, but I would still absolutely recommend the class! If you're debating between this and the MCDB biochem, take this one! There is some rote memorization, but for the most part, the course is very much about understanding and synthesizing information, which makes it very rewarding.",
    "I would recommend this class if you need it for your major or future studies.",
    "Highly recommended IF you have the self-control (and the time) to keep up with the material",
    "This is an exceptional class. It's an incredibly fascinating topic, and Engelman and Koelle are absolutely incredible lecturers. The powerpoints are all easy to understand and follow, and as long as you put in the time to do the problem sets, read the textbook and review the lectures, you can succeed and learn a lot.",
    "Overall a very good course. It's more intense and comprehensive than the MCDB option. The professors definitely know their stuff, and lecture is very helpful. Not an easy course, but rewarding. You'll learn a lot.",
    "This was an interesting class and both Koelle and Engelman were good. The lectures can get a bit tedious with the amount of information present, but at the end, I feel that I've learned a significant amount. In fact, a lot of the material seemed to be like AP Bio plus some more detail, especially with regards to the concepts (which were basically the same).",
    "It's a good class, but definitely not my most favorite medical related class I've taken. It's too heavily focused on the chemistry for my personal tastes. I like the MCDB approach more.",
    "Let me say first that I am not a fan of biochemistry. I believe that it is a necessary body of knowledge for any biologist to know. I'm taking the class even though I don't need it for my major. As a field of study, though, it has a lot of focus on proximate versus ultimate questions. That may tickle you, but it doesn't tickle me.That being said, the class is quite well taught. Both professors are highly knowledgeable and add new dimensions to the material. And oh how much material there is. The professors continuously said that memorization isn't everything -- that we should learn how to apply concepts. Whether this was mere pedagogical lip service, I don't know, but I succeeded in this course through pure memorization. I made flashcards for the minutia in every lecture. Probably had>2000 by the end of the course. Was it perversion of the teaching style? Perhaps, but it was only necessary because the exams are based on minutia.Take this course if you're intending to become a biologist. It will probably be difficult and it will probably be unpleasant. But it's still important and necessary and you'll come out of it a more intelligent biologist.",
    "MB&B 300 is a fantastic introduction to biochemistry, covering proteins, membranes, and metabolism and its regulation. The lecture portion is interesting and well-taught, and there are weekly problem sets, two small quizzes two midterms and a final exam. The problem sets are fairly light--maybe an hour and a half a piece, but you do have to think in order to do well on them. There is also a little memorization (amino acids and glycolysis steps) in order to understand later lectures and do well on the quizzes, but this wasn't particularly arduous. The exams were fairly challenging and the problems were actually pretty interesting; they did a good job of making sure you fully understood the material, so you do really have to study for them. I would definitely recommend the class to another student-- I found it fascinating and worth the work--I took it even though I'm not a major and don't need the science credit.",
    "This is a very interesting, albeit difficult class. The material is not conceptually challenging as in courses such as organic chemistry, but the sheer volume of information can quickly become overwhelming. I would recommend it, but only to people who can keep up with the consistent workload.",
    "This course was definitely a challenge, but I learned an incredible amount. The curve is generous (top 20% get A's, next 20% get A-'s, next 20% get B+'s, etc.), but being in that top 20 percentile is a bit tough. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND reading the corresponding parts in the book. And when studying for the exams, PAY CLOSE ATTENTION TO ALL THE MINOR DETAILS. Every point matters, especially when you're on the borderline for a grade.",
    "MB&B 300 is an excellent class. It is a LOT of work (you WILL study for hours and hours and hours for the exams), but it is also EXTREMELY well-taught (both professors are great, for different reasons). The topics are interesting and make you want to learn more about biochemistry and how the body works. While some of the readings are long, the book is actually quite helpful. Also, the problem sets are short (less than an hour per week), but are great resources for understanding the types of questions that will show up on exams. Also, go to section! -- the TAs are great at pinpointing topics that will show up later on exams.I would definitely recommend this course to anyone who is interesting in gaining a comprehensive understanding of biochemistry. Just keep in mind that it is a lot of work (plan your schedule carefully). But don't shy away from a GREAT class just because it sounds hard. It's worth it!",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to anyone who is interested in biological science. The class is very well organized and taught, and the instructors make a lot of efforts to improve the lectures, as can be seen from their meticulous notes under the powerpoints. The 15 min supplement has offered many useful real-world knowledge outside the course material and has always been something I looked forward to.",
    "MB&B 300 was a wonderful experience - I really, really recommend this class for anyone interested in how life works. There's a strong emphasis on the concepts and not just rote memorization of facts, but this allows you to leave the class with a much more thorough understanding and appreciation of biochemistry. I suggest this course over MB&B200\/MCDB300 for any premeds just wanting to take care of 1 semester of \"general chemistry\", because I find it hard to imagine that any science course could be taught better than this one.",
    "In general, the course was entirely memorization-focused. There was precious little that needed more than a brief flash of thought, and the vast majority of the time was spent memorizing pathways and mechanisms. Which is not surprising, as this is a biology class.You should keep in mind that the audience is dominated by premeds and designed for them, so understanding their mindset would do wonders to your approach towards this class.",
    "Absolutely. The competition is tough but you leave the course with a wealth of information. I feel ready to take on med school biochem.",
    "Science lecture survey. I would recommend this course if you need to take biochem. The grading and the tests are difficult, but the professors are great and you really learn it.",
    "MB&B 300 is an excellent course. I know most of you reading this are required to take this course and probably don't care much about this evaluation, but seriously, this is a really good course. It focuses on protein structure and function in the first half and metabolism in the second half, and treats each topic with a good level of detail, but not so much that it feels rushed. The problem sets and tests are mostly based on applying the principles of each lecture, and are very reasonable in difficulty. The professors alter and improve the lectures every year, and they were quite good in my year, so they should be even better now. So, on the off chance that you're reading this and aren't required to take this course...take it anyways. It's not too challenging and it'll build a foundation for any other molecular biology you might wish to study.",
    "The TA Leslie Wolfe is the most unhelpful TA I've ever had in any Yale class. Just knowing she will be a TA for the class is enough not to take it. Be careful!",
    "Great class! This class is so well run, homework assignments every week that do not consume your life, two midterms, and a final. If you have to take biochem, TAKE THIS ONE. That being said, this is a very self-selecting class, and it was often very difficult to get better than an average grade on exams, as everyone in the class is really on top of their game. The professors are both great, and I was always really engaged in class. Also, I took Cell Bio before this and think it made biochem a lot easier, and it seemed like in many instances they kind of expect you to have that Cell Bio background as they are going over things really quickly. Seriously though, it's great -- take it.",
    "Great course. Great professors. Great material. I learned so much from this course and it's probably one of the best taught science classes I've taken at Yale. You have pretty short problem sets every week, 2 midterms and one (cumulative) final. The exams required a lot of studying but were doable.",
    "An intense class that probably requires more work from the average student but if you are interested then it is totally worth it.",
    "you learn useful information for science and for medical school. More useful than 90% of Yale classes.",
    "If you are interested in Biochem and really want to learn and understand, definitely take this class. You do have to work for it, but you will learn a lot.",
    "This is a truly wonderful course, whether you're an MB&B major, pre-med, or just interested in the topic. Definitely take this one and not the MCDB course! You can take just the first semester of this one and it's sufficient information - but the class is so great and taught by such amazing professors that you might end up taking the second semester anyway, just because you love it. The information presented is difficult theoretically, but taught in a way that greatly simplifies it, and you come out of it knowing a whole lot more about your own body and how it digests food, does all sorts of other things, etc. You will never eat a Snickers bar the same way again...",
    "TAKE THIS COURSE!!! And take it sooner rather than later!!! You only need 1 semester of orgo to take it, so if you have taken the CHEM118 route, TAKE THIS COURSE YOUR SOPHOMORE YEAR!!! It is an amazing introduction to the world of biochemistry and will help you decide what you want to major in or what field of science best suits you if you were like me and still very undecided. This course is also really really helpful for learning how to read science papers, since it presents all the different techniques (like MALDI-TOF and types of electrophoresis and how to name amino acids in proteins). It's also a great review of MCAT biology and should be taken AFTER or instead of physiological systems if you are deciding between the two. Physio gives a macromolecular understanding of the body, and you gain an appreciation for the biochemical workings (with a whole-body system perspective from physio) in this course.",
    "Take it. You probably have to anyway. Don't dread it though, it's lots of fun. I found the lectures to be fascinating.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course as long as someone is willing to put a lot of time and energy in to studying, not just before the tests but throughout the semester. Metabolism is very interesting! I find myself thinking about things I learned in the second half of the course nearly every day.",
    "Yes, I would highly recommend this course to anyone. It really changed the way I think about the way the human body works, and the course is extremely well-taught.",
    "If you are really interested in biology, you will be disappointed by this class; instead, find a research lab position where you'll get your questions about biology answered. The material coveredis really interesting, even for people who might not like biology to begin with, but this will not be a journey to gain a better understanding of biochemistry; it will be a competition with an overly grade-conscious population to see who can memorize the most minor details. Section does not expand on material covered in lecture; rather, most of it is taken up by people asking what material to study for the next exam and to what level of detail. Questions about material irrelevant to coming exams are either given a painfully cursory treatment or dismissed completely, even if they are completely relevant to material covered in lecture.",
    "I would definitely recommend MBB 300. It's a well taught class, and I think it's the most enjoyable big science lecture I've taken so far because of its organization and the reasonable exams. You learn a lot of information, but it's really interesting.",
    "This is a very good biochem class. The professors are experts in the subject and do a great job teaching their respective halves of the course. The problem sets are very reasonable as are the exams. If you're considering taking biochem, definitely take this course!",
    "It's a large science course that basically splits the class into quintiles for grading. Take it if you feel confident that you can get into the upper quintiles.",
    "This is a very good course\u0097I\u0092d definitely recommend it. Professor Engelman and Professor Koelle were both good. Koelle is a little more experienced and more energetic, but they were a good balance to one another. The German professor (don\u0092t know his name) guest lectured once, and I thought he was awesome, so that\u0092s also a plus if he\u0092s teaching the course (he has in the past). Every lecture ended with about 15 minutes for questions and a \u0093supplement\u0094, which is not tested but talks about the history of the science we\u0092re learning, or an application of it, or some funky way that it was discovered. It\u0092s a nice way to shorten what is a long lecture (but not that bad because at least this year it was at 11:35 and only twice a week).What\u0092s cool about this course is that biochemistry uses the tools of organic chemistry, physics, general chemistry, and biology. This course made all of the others seem worthwhile. As a premed student, the obvious relevance of biochemistry to medicine was exciting, and as a student interested in biomedical research in the future, I loved the level of analysis (more macro than Orgo, more micro than cell bio) that this course used. It felt like it really unlocked many of the important biological mechanisms\u0097at least as well as possible given the time restraints\u0097without getting bogged down too much in the movement of electrons and without too many leaps of faith, either. I\u0092m planning to take next semester\u0092s course too.",
    "Amazing class! MB&B 300 is without a doubt the best science class I've taken at Yale. The professors this year (Engelman&Koelle) were both really good and engaging lecturers. You have weekly problem sets which are pretty straightforward, two midterms, and a final. Unfortunately, the downside of the class is that it is also the most competitive class I've taken at Yale. The TAs are really picky when it comes to grading, and the curve is extremely tough. But if your goal is to really learn and understand biochemistry, then take this class!",
    "Take this course!",
    "MBB 300 is a great course to take if you are deciding between biochemistry courses. It goes a bit fast, but all science courses do. What makes it great is the professors and the layout of the material. You are rarely asked to memorize, and you walk out really knowing material. The tests are extremely hard and the class is difficult, but it is enjoyable for once!!",
    "Think hard before taking it if you don't have to for requirements. There may be better uses of your time. The course is at times torturous for someone who has not been numbed to the premed distortion of science education.",
    "Class is a lot of work and a lot of memorization. Only take it if you have to. You do learn a lot though",
    "Biochem is a well-organized and well-taught class. Although the material is challenging, the professors are very enthusiastic and knowledgeable. I would recommend this class over the MCDB Biochem, which I have heard is rote memorization and not very interesting. If you are planning to major in MB&B or are premed, definitely take this class.",
    "If you are deciding between this course and the one offered in the MCDB department, take this one. I shopped both courses for two weeks and realized that the MB&B course is much more well-organized and has stronger teachers.",
    "The class covers a lot of interesting new material that you definitely don't encounter much in the more intro biology courses. You don't really spend any time reviewing genetics, transcription, translation, or other introductory topics. You basically memorize the 20 amino acids once and then start learning new material completely.I do recommend this class to another student since much of what you learn, especially metabolism, does help you better understand much of how nature and human physiology works on the level of proteins. If you think this class might be too hard, perhaps the MCDB version might be easier, but I don't know at all.",
    "Good course. Liked Engleman, Koelle wasn't my favorite professor, but it was well-organized and a lot of people did like him. The grading was very \"pre-med\" and the tests were good, but not \"fair\" in some ways. It was a good course all around though. : )",
    "A great, solid science course about biochemistry with really great lecturers. I've heard it's much better than the MCDB biochemistry, and after taking this, I wouldn't be surprised. This one is supposed to be a year long (although you might not have to take the second semester), so that could be one thing you want to take into account and you might want to shop both.It's definitely quite a bit of work, and you'll have to keep up. Grading can be a bit nitpicky, but I think it's something you'll get used to. All the students in this class are generally pretty smart, so the curve might be difficult to beat, especially if you want to be in the top 20%to get an A (not A-). Regardless, though, that shouldn't really put you off since it's a great class.",
    "MB&B 300 is without any doubt the best science course I have taken so far at Yale and one of the most well-taught classes I've ever seen. Professor Koelle is amazing: he is incredibly knowledgeable but also extremely dedicated to the class and to his teaching, and it shows in every detail. The PowerPoint slides are the best I've seen, and they integrate seamlessly with the lecture. The class requires a huge amount of work in order to stay on top of the reading and the lectures, but it's entirely worth it and extremely rewarding in the level of understanding and knowledge that you will gain from this course. The curve is brutal, unfortunately, because of the particular crowd of students that this course attracts, but in the end, you'll be so glad you took this class.",
    "I would recommend this course based on the fact that it has really interesting material and takes material from prior biology classes to another level. The portions on metabolism, in particular, were really interesting. However, the course engenders are sense of competition, specifically derived from the stiff curve. Also, the exams expect extremely specific answers to vague questions, which was also frustrating given the sentence limits. Overall, however, I would recommend this course."
