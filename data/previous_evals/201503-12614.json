    "10\/10 would recommend. Why? - Professor Granoff is AMAZING. She probably is the most knowledgeable academic on the material she teaches. She is hilarious and passionate. - The readings, texts from Jain, Buddhist and Hindu schools of thought, are well-chosen and super interesting. By the end of the course, you will actually have the appropriate vocabulary used in debates on Indian philosophy! Karma, omniscience, rebirth, the nature of knowledge, temporality, emptiness, soul, modes, and on and on. - The timing is amazing. Just a 2-hour seminar once a week. Amazing. - The workload is super manageable. Readings per week took about 2-3 hours, accompanied by a reading response that took about 1 hour. There was a 3-5 page midterm paper and a 5-7 page final paper. - If you have gotten to the end of this, you should be enlightened enough to take this course! JUST DO IT!!!",
    "RLST 189 is superb. It does a great job of teaching students how to immerse themselves in and engage with a philosophical system that is very different than those to which most have been exposed. I really enjoyed all of the readings, and classroom conversations were rich and productive. Professor Granoff challenged us to grapple with complex philosophical ideas in a thoughtful, systematic way. She guided discussions just the right amount, helping to lead us to deeper understandings, while also encouraging us to articulate our own ideas and engage with those of our peers.",
    "An Introduction to some of the main schools of Classic Indian Philosophy. I would recommend this course because it is an excellent way to begin a study in this field, or to get more direction and focus in current studies.",
    "YYYYAAASSSS! i would definitely recommend this course. ONly take it if you are actually interested in the material, course you do read a good amount of it, which is great if you are ACTUALLY interested in what indian philosophers and philosophical-religious. Prof. Granoff is absolutely amazing, she is so warm and welcoming. She is also very clear which makes the material much more available to you with her guidance. The weekly reading responses, please take them seriously! it actually works in your favor to get into each reading comprehensively, as in the final when you bring it all together it is much easier. I loved it a lot, and i felt it was a good course to counter the euro-centric philosophies taught at Yale. Enjoy! And have fun with Nagarjuna (you will soon know who that is)"
