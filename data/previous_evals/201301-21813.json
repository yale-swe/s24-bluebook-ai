    "You learn a lot about Eastern Europe during the cold war.",
    "I really enjoyed the class and I would highly recommend it.",
    "This class has a fantastic syllabus: Heidegger, Husserl, Sartre, and Eastern Europeans you've not heard of but who really really are worth reading. Required weekly journal responses are a helpful way of keeping track of the readings each week.Downsides: Prof Shore does not offer much structure or feedback as a teacher. Our class discussions were pretty aimless; the objectives of weekly discussion, weekly journals, or the paper were not made much clearer than just to say something smart. The course also doesn't really succeed in presenting the methods of intellectual history. Since no one in the course knows much about Eastern Europe, you end up reading these thinkers as if you were in a philosophy course.",
    "See question 1.",
    "This class was good, the readings were really good, and I learned a lot when Professor Shore spoke. The class discussions weren't great though. People, myself included, talked just to say things sometimes. It's surprising, because people on the old Marci Shore reviews talked about how the class is so unpretentious, so it was probably just us who were in the class that caused it to be that way."
