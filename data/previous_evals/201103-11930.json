   "comments": [
    "Take it if you're interested in obscure\/fun works of the High Middle Ages! We read Abelard's Historia Calamitatum (which tells of how he slept with a girl and got castrated by her family for it), The Romance of Tristan and Isolde, Erec and Enide by Chretien de Troyes, and much more. Plus, Prof. Bloch is hilarious, and his remarks are very enlightening.",
    "Don't take it unless you actually like reading medieval lit. I found this class to be insanely boring.",
    "Renaissance of the Middle Ages was a fantastic course on the literature, history, and culture of thelate Medieval period. Topics included cathedral construction, courtly love, monasticism, chivalry, and the delightfully vulgar fabliaux. Professor Bloch is an excellent lecturer \u0096 he\u0092s very funny, knowledgeable, and provides great PowerPoints to help you visualize what you\u0092re reading about. Don\u0092t take this class expecting it to be a true discussion based seminar, but treat it as a small lecture where you\u0092re welcome to comment or question. The workload is very fair \u0096 just readings, a few in-class presentations, a 2000 word midterm paper and a 2500 word final paper (the final exam was cancelled this year because it fell on Bloch\u0092s birthday). I would highly recommend this class!",
    "The course was very interesting, though given the size, I think there could have been a better balance of lecturing\/discussion.The reading is great (though I must say the second half was my favorite!)",
    "This is clearly one of the treasures of Yale. Prof. Bloch is a great lecturer whose command over the literature is awe-inspiring. The texts may seem daunting, but they are really very entertaining and very interesting. I found my reading assignments for this course to be consistently the most interesting out of all my classes -- there are quite a few gems written in the 12th Century that do not get nearly the attention they deserve. The sections on the Bayeux Tapestry and the gothic cathedrals is very close to a life-changing aesthetic experience. Did I mention that the books are very fun to read? In our class we only had a midterm paper (5-6 pages) and a final paper (8-9 pages), and we were supposed to have a final exam (which was cancelled). The midterm paper was graded fairly and definitely not too harshly. Even though there were few enough people to fit around a table, Prof. Bloch conducted this as a lecture class, which was for the best, since he is the most knowledgeable person you can ask for on this subject matter. There is no reason for you not to take this class."
