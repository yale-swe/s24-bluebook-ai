   "comments": [
    "French at Yale is A LOT of work. Five days a week is no joke. Luckily, in L3 the tests are only once every two weeks, but they are still pretty difficult. It is certainly not a joke class, because you have to put in A LOT of time. You leave knowing a lot of French, but you also leave never wanting to speak French again because you're sick and tired of all the work associated with it.",
    "I would recommend the course to anyone who took L1 and L2 and wants to continue in french, as well as any incoming student who tested int L3. The class is much more interesting that L1 and L2 since the assignments are all reading interesting french books and stories as well as watching french movies. There isn't a ton of new grammar or tenses, its mostly just learning how to put it all together.",
    "French 130 is a standard language class, but you read entertaining books (especially Le Petit Nicholas and Monsieur Ibrahim et les Fleurs du Coran), which makes it feel a little less like the required step between 120 and 140. Theres a pretty demanding workload (of about 45 minutes of audio worksheets and 20 pages of reading) per night but the work becomes easier the more you understand how the class works.",
    "If you want to learn French, take this course\/",
    "FREN 130 is a fabulous class for the intermediate\/advanced French student. The course is extremely well taught and the professors are all fabulous. All major grammar principles learned in FREN 110 and 120 are reviewed over the course of semester. However, instead of just focusing on bland grammar and vocabulary exercises, the course incorporates interesting books and movies that make learning the basics so much enjoyable. I would highly recommend this course to anybody seeking to improve their French."
