   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. It exposes students to a variety of different thinkers who profoundly influenced the way historical and political ideas evolved. The class was absolutely fascinating, and well worth the amount of time and effort it required!",
    "Yes! The texts are great as is Emily Greenwood. Prepare for great discussions and a sublime accent.",
    "Awesome course. Worth it.",
    "DS History& Politics really lets you know some of the most mind-inspiring works in human history",
    "Yes. You want to have a basic understanding of the basics of Western thought, and this class helps you do it. You want to take Directed Studies. If your at all interested in this kind of thing your going to regret not taking it.",
    "You will do a lot of reading and very little of your questions will be answered but you will be exposed to some good insights from your teacher.",
    "This class is really hard. It's the section with the most reading, usually (or even if Lit has more, this reading is dryer), and at times it's hard to keep up with the litany of names. That being said, if you do all the reading, the class discussion makes it worthwhile, since Professor Greenwood is SO intelligent and really listens to one's opinions. She definitely has her own, but will let you voice yours and consider it if you express yourself well and have clearly closely read the reading. She is also very interested in the parallels between the different books we read, which I really loved, since it makes these books that span thousands of years seem much more closely related. I would definitely recommend this class to someone who is willing to work hard.",
    "Directed Studies History& Politics, Fall Semester is interesting in that you really do focus on both history and politics. I came into the course thinking that it was primarily going to center on political theory, but the majority of the works we read first semester were historical. This course probably has the hardest workload of any DS course, but it really is worth it - not only will you learn a lot of historical background you may not already have known, but you'll also gain a really interesting perspective on the mentality behind writing history or political works. If you have Professor Greenwood, don't switch out; she's a great section leader who draws upon a lot of external knowledge to bolster your understanding of the texts, and is also really nice and accessible when it comes to working on your papers.",
    "I would recommend it, you don't really see how much you're learning until reading week when you review all you've read and realize you've learned a tremendous amount which is very gratifying. I think the three directed studies courses overlap very well together and the connections to be made between the three different subjects are pretty cool. I also think to understand modern politics, you need to have a basis of understanding in how it originated and its useful to see how Athenian democracy originated and how different governments evolve. As a citizen of any country, its important to attempt to understand howyour government works."
