   "comments": [
    "-Course is dynamic and covers a breadth of information -Students are given ample opportunity to develop their own interests and critical reading\/writing skills -The class could benefit from more structured discussion to allow all students to participate over the course of the semester. The classes that had group elements were exciting and enlightening.",
    "strength: great discussion with lots of different opinions from students studying across the campus at undergrad and graduate levels, great professor weakness\/improvement: the op-ed response i wish could have been a topic of our choosing rather than one of the three assigned",
    "I cannot express how incredible this class was. Best class I have taken, ever. It was so refreshing to be learning this material and having such fabulous discussions.",
    "I thought it wa great. professor was initally worried that class size would prohibit discussion but that was not a problem. the readings were a bit much but i did enjoy them. i felt that i learned a lot about the topic and that the legal background was presented in a way that was understandable to people without law degrees. interesting to hear the different perspectives and to be in a class that covered all the disciplines.",
    "An incredibly insightful course spanning a broad range of topics in sexuality and its human rights linkages, Miller's class is tour de force of the critical moments in advocacy and engagement with public discourses around sexuality. The course gave me a much more nuanced understanding of sexuality (both from a theoretical and and a legal perspective) and the ways that policies marshal and control this construct to further their aims. The only minor improvement I would note would be to cut down the readings (not because they weren't useful) but just so that the discussion could have been a bit richer because we would have been able to go into more depth in each piece.",
    "Wonderful course overall. Loved the theoretical discussion on different frameworks for understanding sexuality, gender, and rights (many of these concepts were new to me), and I felt like I learned a lot. Professor Miller was extremely knowledgeable and engaging, and I appreciated her wealth of insight into the aforementioned topics. The assignments were fair\/reasonable. The amount of reading was a little excessive at times (perhaps due to the breadth of the course). Also, as a public health student, I would have liked to dive deeper into the health policy implications of sexual rights advocacy and sex\/gender theorizing (but perhaps this is my own disciplinary bias). Lastly, for those individuals who may be encountering some of these topics for the first time, perhaps a short explication of concepts\/terminology during the first class would be helpful (ex. differentiating \"gender\" vs. \"sex\"; distinction between gay identity and gay acts; etc.). Would definitely recommend the class to anyone interested in the intersection of sex, gender, health, and human rights (topics which are becoming increasingly salient in the world of public health\/health policy)!",
    "I would appreciate if the facilitator spent more time discussing the readings and creating a classroom space that allowed for student participation in the topics.",
    "A great class that goes very in depth into the areas of sexuality and human rights. Ali is very knowledgeable and can really get you thinking about the topics discussed in class. The first half can be a bit high brow and theoretical, but there are case studies in the reading that helps put the theory into context, which is very useful, especially as the second half gets into more practical and applied topics.",
    "This course was a really great overview of issues related to sexuality and gender in an international law context. However, I felt that at times the course tried to cover just too much material, and as a result I didn't obtain as much in depth or specific knowledge as I would have hoped. I also felt like the class discussions were not as focused as I would have hoped. I enjoyed the selection of readings and the variety of writing assignments we had. However, it would have been helpful for Professor Miller to provide more of an overview of different writing styles that accompanied each writing assignment and her expectations especially for the final paper. The final paper proved difficult especially for those without a legal background.",
    "The class was an excellent overview of some concepts in sexuality and human rights. It was illuminating of a field that isn't often discussed or understood, specifically on the side of public health\/medical professionals, but is paramount. The format of the class was great, reading the documents and papers then discussing proving to be a great way to sift through the several topics we had to cover. My only hesitation was around the amount o speaking time the students were allotted. The mix between lecture and discussion was good, but it should definitely be advertised as such, or the class size reduced to offer students greater ability to input."

    "Instructor: Alice M Miller \u00a0Professor Miller is one of the most passionate and inspiring professors I have ever had. Her teaching style reflects her dedication to the course topic and to the overall success of her students. She challenges her students to excel in order to realize their own potential but also out of respect for the important issues covered in the course. We are lucky to have this course and Professor Miller.",
    "Instructor: Alice M Miller \u00a0strength: so much knowledge",
    "Instructor: Alice M Miller \u00a0Truly inspirational.",
    "Instructor: Alice M Miller \u00a0Great. came from multiple angles to explain the background behind discussions. you could tell that she was very knowledgeable about the subject. allowed the students to talk but jumped in when necessary to fill in gaps.",
    "Instructor: Alice M Miller \u00a0Ali brought herself fully into each course--sharing her own work, insights, and experiences in a meaningful and engaging way. I found the outside readings to be interesting and diverse. I often left the class feeling full of reflections, arguments, and inconsistencies which I take to be a marker of a truly thought-provoking seminar. I think Ali could have spent a bit more time in class on the implementation of SHHR policies, given that theory formed a core component of the course.",
    "Instructor: Alice M Miller \u00a0See overall assessment.",
    "Instructor: Alice M Miller \u00a0I think Ali Miller has a strong head on her shoulders, but I simply wish she could create a little more space in the class for students to also share their opinions. I also would like to recommend building a few elements in her teaching that match different learning styles. The class is entirely lecture based and for visual learners, it becomes incredibly difficult to follow the course content.",
    "Instructor: Alice M Miller \u00a0Professor Miller's experience in human rights is the biggest asset of the course. Being able to question how the things we learn about are applied in real world scenarios really grounds the topics we discuss. She's very engaging and helpful in breaking down student questions to help us think about things from novel perspectives.",
    "Instructor: Alice M Miller \u00a0She is very passionate and enthusiastic about the course material. I learned a lot from her during class discussions. However, she could definitely make herself more available to help students outside of class and also provide students with more adequate and timely feedback. She should provide more guidance and expectations for the final paper assignment--maybe even hold workshops for the type of writing and research style that she is expecting.",
    "Instructor: Alice M Miller \u00a0Professor Miller was phenomenal in her knowledge of the course material and expression, and I enjoyed her teaching strategy, especially when referencing items we may not have known very well. She offered time outside of class to explain concepts that could further interest students. Besides the one critique above, I loved the course."

    "This course has a great deal of strong readings on human rights and a once per week lecture where Ali Miller shares her experiences and perspectives on human rights.",
    "It is a great overview of sexuality and gender issues in a international human rights law context. However, the course was a bit too high-level and abstract at times. For those without a strong legal background, I think it is easy to feel lost or fall behind.",
    "This class is a crash course in sexuality, gender, and human rights and offers you an in depth look into specific areas which are both argued now or foundational to the discipline. I recommend taking the course, but emphasis that choosing a few topics to delve into in depth would perhaps be most useful, as taking in all of the material may be overwhelming without prior experience in the field or the study."
