    "The experiences in the course are largely dependent on the placement. The best way to get the best experience is to be present at the placement as much as possible.",

    "Seeing the health policy process at work was quite simply fantastic, and a useful way to integrate the lessons learned in class.",
    "Practicum was a great way to get involved in health policy in the community. It was nice to apply the theories learned in class to daily life. I would highly recommend this course to future first and second years.",
    "I really enjoyed the dinners where we debriefed with Shelley about our practicums. It was great to hear, and learn from, the accounts of other practicum experiences.",
    "awesome, I loved the autonomy we got and how we were thrown in to the internships. I feel like I learned so much!",
    "Excellent opportunity to get hands on experience with public health. Shelley is incredible thoughtful with her placements and the dinner discussions were a highlight."

    "Instructor: Shelley Geballe \u00a0Shelley is a fantastic instructor. She cares deeply about her students.",
    "Instructor: Shelley Geballe \u00a0As always, Shelley was an incredibly attentive, passionate, available, helpful professor. She prepared us well to work in CT government with a training at the beginning of the semester, and then gathered us monthly so that we could compare notes and get more out of our practicums than just our own placements. I recommend doing dinners in quiet locations so that it's easy to talk! Mory's and Shelley's house were great options this year.",

    "Instructor: Shelley Geballe \u00a0PERFECT. GOD LIKE. super helpful and always available.",
    "Instructor: Shelley Geballe \u00a0One of the best instructors at YSPH. So knowledgeable and you can tell she cares deeply for her students. All YSPH students should take a course with her before they leave."
