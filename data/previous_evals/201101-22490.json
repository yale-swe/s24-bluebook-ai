    "Introduction to Psychology was great! The lectures were fun and enjoyable and the textbook was well written. All of the examples that are provided in class are incredibly helpful and bring the topics to light.I chose to take the class Credit\/D\/Fail, which was definitely the right decision given my course load. It was a lot of fun to take this class, but not worry too much about the grade or getting every single bit of work accomplished.I would highly recommend that every single undergraduate in Yale College take this course.",
    "no. forces you to memorize common sense and pretends it teaches you the human condition. obviously doesn't.",
    "Lecture is interesting and fun, but the textbook reading is dense and most of it doesn't even appear on the exam. Read the text after the relevant lecture so that you can skim sections of material you've already learned. Or, if you're like me, read everything in the three days before the exam and still be getting an A- because you paid attention in lecture and did well on papers.Marvin Chun is hilarious and really loves what he does. Sometimes he gives a few too many examples or doesn't realize the intelligence level of a college student, sometimes explaining things as if we were in high school. Overall though, great lecturer.",
    "This is a great class especially taught by Professor Chun. He is always interesting and funny in lecture. I feel like of all the classes I have taken here at Yale, this is the one that I use most in my everyday life. It has really opened my mind to all of the strange mindbugs humans have and is a must take class for any Yale student.",
    "definitely would recommend this class to anyone even not interested in the major",
    "YES. This is the most amazing class I have ever taken. Very engaging in class and useful in real life.",
    "You must take this class!",
    "YES! Take it. Fantastic introductory course.",
    "Yes totally. I'm a second semester senior so I took this Credit\/D. It's the kind of class that's great for credit, d, and everyone needs to take it at some point during their Yale career.",
    "A great survey of a really important - and interesting - subject. If the choice is still between Bloom and Chun, take it with Professor Chun. He might not be the superstar that Professor Bloom is, but he's no pushover. Also possibly the nicest professor at Yale. Lots of material but exams were fair and relatively manageable if you did the reading and were generally interested.",
    "Take it! It's awesome.",
    "Take this course. You will regret it if you don't.",
    "Yes, Professor Chun is really engaging and knows how to make psychology interesting. Professor Chun is also funny and a great guy to talk to after class and to get to know. I highly recommend this class.",
    "Yes!",
    "Intro to psych is exactly what it sounds like. You shouldn't be surprised when you're enrolled. read the textbook, go to lecture, its a straight forward class. I would recommend it if your interested in psych in any way or if you plan on pursuing a psych major.",
    "Yes, if you find the subject matter interesting.",
    "Take it. It is perfect for everyone.",
    "Intro to psych was a fun and interesting course! I really loved all the real world applications and how the course really helped me understand myself and even the world better. I definitely think it's a class that everyone should take because the content is useful and very applicable. I felt like the class was too hyped, but it was nonetheless very enjoyable. The tests are fair, though sometimes extremely specific so know everything in the powerpoints.",
    "TAKE IT TAKE IT TAKE IT! It's not a gut course, but as long as you put in the effort, the results will be satisfactory. Make sure to keep up with the reading. Marvin Chun is an amazing lecturer.",
    "Yes, definitely! Material very relevant to everyday life!",
    "I would not recommend this class to another student only because the curve is very difficult and the material can be easily learned through independent reading.",
    "I would recommend this class, it was not that difficult of a class, but still a memorable one where you will learn a lot of interesting and new facts.",
    "One of the best classes I've taken at Yale. An essential part of a full liberal arts education. It will change the way you think and make you a better person.",
    "YES. By all means worth it. It's an unbelievable class and actually lives up to the hype!",
    "I would recommend this class even if you're not considering psychology as a possible major.",
    "I recommend it, though after Intro to Cog Sci with Brian Scholl there was a lot of overlap. Still an important class I think for anyone to take.",
    "Prof. Chun is a beautiful man. Take this class with him.",
    "If you took every person who would get a 5 on the AP Psych exam and made them compete for grades you would have this class. It is difficult to get an A; the tests are hard and it can be challenging to figure out how to get good grades on the papers. If you're taking this class just for enjoyment, start it Credit\/D\/Fail in case you don't do well on the first exam. The information is interesting and worth knowing. It is nearly impossible to get all the reading done, however.",
    "Take it with Chun. I've heard great things about Bloom, but Chun's class has a better paper system and tests that are more fair. This has been my favorite class of the year.",
    "This was a great overview of introductory psychology. I would definitely recommend this class to other students, as Professor Chun was an excellent teacher and the class was fun.",
    "Intro Psych is a class where you learn about everything. It is so fascinating to go into class and learn about things that affect you and that you can observe in other people on a daily basis. This was a class where I genuinely enjoyed reading every word of the textbook because it was all so interesting. You will not look at other people the same way ever again after taking this class, and I truly believe that an understanding of psychology is essential for anyone that has friends or plans on working with other people in any capacity. In other words TAKE THIS COURSE! Honestly...just do it.",
    "This course is good, not great. It is definitely over-hyped. Also, it is not a blow off, and grading is pretty messed up. Intro Psych is enjoyable, especially with Marvin Chun, so take it if you want to learn about tons of important topics.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class! Everyone should take it, it's interesting and fun!",
    "Absolutely, it's a really interesting class. I looked forward to lecture.",
    "I would definitely recommend taking this class, regardless of yur major. Actually, I strongly believe that the knowledge acquired in this class can be applied in virtually any field, from the medical sciences to the social sciences and so on.",
    "Best class I've taken so far. Marvin Chun is basically the coolest person on the planet. Take it whether or not you have an interest in psychology - it's a course that is truly relevant to everyone. I actually looked forward to the lectures. And the workload isn't bad either. All in all, its just a great class.",
    "Yes, a little challenging but very interesting",
    "I would recommend this course. It is really fun and Professor Chun really cares about the class. You do have to prepare for the exams though, so don't fall behind on the reading. if you do the reading before each lecture, it's not bad, but putting it off can be a nightmare.",
    "I would recommend it.",
    "Absolutely take it.",
    "This is an excellent class; it's one of those staples that everyone should take before graduating. Chun is also the best lecturer I've ever had in college. Warning though: this class is easy and interesting, which means that everyone does well, so don't expect to get an A unless you are a premed grade grubber.",
    "YES! Taking Intro to Psych with Master Chun is like getting credit for entertainment - just take this class Credit\/D. It'll be a lot more fun that way.",
    "Take it if you are interested in psychology. Start out by taking it credit\/d though just in case if you don't like it too much, because it is a lot of reading and studying if you want to get a good grade.",
    "Strongly recommend. Interesting, engaging, loved Prof Chun.",
    "This is a great class. Interesting material and fabulous professor- take it with Marvin Chun. He is adorable and hilarious.",
    "Good survey course of modern psychology, basically a memorization class. Definitely take it if you're interested in psych, or if you just want an interesting elective. Master Chun is a terrific teacher, and the three papers are actually a very small amount of work because they're less than 750 words each. Plus it doesn't have a final, which is terrific.",
    "Definitely take this course if you're the least bit interested in psychology, and take this course even if you don't think you're interested in psychology. You learn about all aspects of life -- emotional intelligence, love, morality and sin, psychological disorders -- in social-scientific language that's easy to understand. Also, take it if only for Professor Chun, who is just amazing and so nice as a professor. It's not common to find a professor who is so approachable and friendly as Professor Chun. The exams aren't too difficult, there are no sections, the short papers are very manageable -- so, all in all, the workload isn't too bad at all.",
    "YES, TAKE IT!",
    "I would recommend it to a fellow student only if they wanted to be a psych major. It was a good class but because of the difficulty of the tests and the somewhat large amounts of textbook reading I wouldn't just take it for enjoyment, unless you think you may be interested in psych.",
    "PYSC 110 is a great introduction to a very important area of academia and human life. Prof. Chun is also awesome - definitely take the class with him!",
    "I would definitely recommend Psych 110 to another student. Psychology is fantastic because it is applicable to everything, no matter what your major. It is always useful to understand more about how people think and why they think about what they think about.",
    "Yes. You should take it.",
    "Yes!",
    "Sure. But don;t be fooled. It isn't all that easy.",
    "If you are interested in the way people think and why people do the things they do, it is an interesting class. I found it necessary to split up the readings with a group of friends and share the notes, because the readings were just too long and too tedious.",
    "Great class, take it. There's a fair amount of work and it's not necessarily easy to get an A. I'd recommend taking it credit\/d if you just want to get an intro to psychology and take it with an awesome professor. If you're a prospective psych major and take the class seriously, you should do fine.",
    "very interesting class. I wish I had more time to read the book because the book and subjects were actually very interesting.",
    "I would recommend taking it, Credit-D.",
    "TAKE IT. One of the most interesting courses you'll take, with an excellent professor (slightly easier than Bloom), and feels easy while not being a gut in the slightest.",
    "A pretty interesting introduction into psychology. Some very neat things were taught. Take it CR\/D if you don't want to obsess over grade breakdown because competition for an A can be tough with hardworking freshmen. I took it CR\/D and it made the class so much more enjoyable.",
    "It's very interesting, i recommend it, but if you are not a psych major, Credit\/D the class. You'll be surprised by the curve.",
    "My favorite class at Yale so far. Everyone says this class is good. Believe them.",
    "Entertaining lecturer. Though lecture was a great fit for wide-eyed freshmen, the way he styled the case studies was disappointing. There was no analysis done on the papers we looked at in class, just a result summarized in one sentence. Sure, I know a cool fact now summarized from some new study, but I didn't learn how to learn. I didn't learn about the scientific process in psychology today and how to critique these types of studies. That was probably the most disappointing part of this class (maybe Bloom's class in the fall is better about this). Otherwise, for fact-collecting\/story-collecting, awesome. Also, Provost Salovey's guest lecture is a must-hear.",
    "A basic intro to psych class. I would recommend it to anyone even remotely interested in the subject. Even if you aren't, you should take it. Definitely a necessity if you are aspiring to be a psych major. Helps to get your basics down first.",
    "This was a great class. Definitely take it with Marvin Chun, although I hear Paul Bloom is great too. He guest lectured one day and personally I preferred Chun. The work is definitely manageable, with just three 500 word papers and 3 exams. The textbook reading does not correspond heavily with the lectures but DO IT! Otherwise you will have a lot of cramming to do before the exams. It's fun, interesting reading so it is not that bad.",
    "yes if you need to do a social science, or you can do it credit d for the ultimate chill class while still being engaged by interesting material",
    "okay class. kinda hard",
    "I would definitely recommend Intro Psyc. Professor Chun is amazing and the material is very interesting.",
    "Definitely take this class at some point! And if you can, take it with Marvin Chun! It's a great intro to the field, but even if you don't want to go into psych (I'm not, although this class definitely opened up the possibility) it's so relevant and interesting. The book is hilarious and informative, and Marvin Chun is amazing! People say Paul Bloom is better, but that's only because they didn't have Marvin Chun! He's funny and kind and engaging and very personable! It may be best to take this credit\/d\/fail if you can't stand to not get an A though, as only 30% get A's (including minuses).",
    "If I had taken PSYC110 earlier in my academic career, I probably would have changed majors.",
    "I would recommend this class for a student who is going to take this class credit\/D\/fail. It was a little difficult to finish the course for a grade.",
    "Fantastic course. I absolutely loved it and I think Marvin Chun is truly wonderful.",
    "I would recommend it to anyone who needs it as a psych requirement.",
    "Great class, super interesting. Grading and exams are harder than you would think though. I took it credit\/D\/F and found it a lot more enjoyable",
    "I would recommend it to all students...There is a lot of reading, but it is all very interesting, and a great, entertaining, informative class.",
    "Intro Psych is a delightful safari through the field of psychology with an amiable guide, the impossibly-hard-to-dislike Marvin Chun. If the interesting facts on the facilities of humanity don't keep your beta waves oscillating, then you must pay attention during the videos, clicker questions, and other varied successes that Professor Chun uses to elaboratively encode information and to make one of the biggest lecture classes at Yale engaging and interacting. Most classes begin with music and end with students laughing at the punchline of the lecture. Marvin Chun once brought a dog to class. At some point, candy! Take this class to be happy and be happy now!",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to other students. It's very interesting, and Professor Chun is a great lecturer. If you don't want to do a lot of work, C\/D\/F this class, but it is a must take class at Yale!",
    "This is a fine class, though pretty intuitive and gets somewhat boring toward the end. Especially if you are a freshman its probably worthwhile because it is a Yale tradition.",
    "MARVIN CHUN IS AWESOME. The force of his personality alone motivated me to take this class, and I loved it. He is so funny!! The textbook is also the best, most down to earth and humorous textbook I have ever read.",
    "Great class. Many will say take it with Bloom-- I disagree. Chun is a fantastic professor, a really cool guy, and has obviously invested a lot of energy in this course. He cares so much about it. And unlike Bloom, he is quite modest as well.",
    "Take Psychology 110 with Marvin Chun! The class is not a gut, but if you do the readings, you can certainly do well. It's also just so interesting and applicable to everyday life! I also found Marvin Chun more accessible than Paul Bloom.",
    "Take it with CHUN!. It's the best.",
    "TAKEIT",
    "It is one of the best classes I have ever taken. I loved being in class and I am not someone who always says that. Prof. Chun does a great job and I cannot imagine taking this class with someone else. Psychology is very interesting and very fun, and I consider this class essential for you to take in your Yale career.",
    "good class, recommend it to people who are really into psych",
    "An overview of all areas of psyc. Enjoyable lectures, easy to do well on tests if you put in the time to memorize everything, but if you do not work fairly hard it will be very hard to do well.",
    "Great class to take. The workload isn't as hard as it's made out to be - just keep up with the readings as you go along. If you study the textbook strategically, keep your own notes, and research the short papers well, it's actually pretty easy to get an A.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class specifically taught by Marvin Chun to another student. Even if they don't need this class for distributional requirements or as a class for their major, they should still take it. It's an incredible class and he is a fabulous professor.",
    "This class is amazing, if I have not emphasized this enough. There is a lot of reading that you do actually need to read because about half of the exam questions come from readings not directly covered in lecture. But the reading (although it seems hefty) is fairly easy to get through and very interesting\/relevant to the course.Take this course.",
    "I think that it is a great class. A great instructor, a great textbook and a great syllabus. Be careful though - there is A LOT of reading for each midterm and it is almost impossible to get an A without working your ass off before a midterm. Also it does get a bit dry at times and reading from the textbook is not as arresting as listening to lectures.Having said that, take it with Prof Chun. He is amazing!!And something else that is really nice about the class is that there is no final exam\/paper due which reduces one's load during final's week.",
    "I would definitely recommend Psychology 110 to another student. It was a really great and enjoyable class.",
    "Great class. Lots and lots of reading. If you don't plan on doing the readings, take the class Cr\/D\/F. Marvin Chun is an excellent lecturer, he makes it really interesting, and the content is pretty good. Makes psych pretty applicable to real life; first few lectures are kind of like tips for life or something.",
    "Intro to Psych was probably my favorite class this year. All of Chun's lectures were interesting, funny and engaging. The reading is a little heavy, though.",
    "Yeppers.",
    "If you are at all interested in why people behave the way they do, take this class. If a B+ on your transcript will cause you excessive anxiety, DO NOT take this class.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to anotherperson, but probably to take it credit-D-fail, so that you can enjoy the class more than get bogged down with reading and tedious memorization.",
    "I only recommend this class if you plan to take it CreditDFail. It is not an average Yale course. The test are extremely had and require that you attend every lecture and do ALL the reading. Beware. Even if you take this for Credit, the course is still hard. I know a lot of people who were worrying at the end if they were getting credit. Chun is fabulous so definitely take the course and take it seriously. Psych is fun!",
    "JUST TAKE IT. You will have the best time of your life as a Yalie.",
    "Highly recommended for any major. A great course and Marvin Chun is the man.",
    "ONLY IF YOU TAKE IT CREDIT D. LISTEN TO ME.",
    "AMAZING! Take it! It is definitely not a gut class (there's 3 short papers, 3 midterms, and lots of reading) but it is most definitely worth taking while you're at Yale!",
    "There is a lot of hype about Psyc110. Yes, most of this is justified. Marvin Chun is fantastic, and the lectures feel more like entertainment than class. The guest lecturers are also great. If you are looking for a fun and relatively laid-back class then this is for you.My frustration with the class is that there wasn't really enough substance. It's perhaps the nature of an introductory class, but I felt like we were skimming a lot of topics and not discussing the deeper issues. If you are really interested in psychology, my recommendation would be to shop other pscyhology classes and to see if there are any with a narrower focus.",
    "It's an interesting course and doesn't take up too much of your time.",
    "I would recommend this class. It is interesting and a good class to take if the rest of your schedule is very hard.",
    "Marvin Chun is the man. Fascinating stuff.",
    "Yes. If you are taking a lot of hard sciences, its a good addition; gets you to think in a different way.",
    "An interesting course that has a relevant day-to-day relationship with everyday life. Not too much work, except for all the reading...",
    "Great topics but the exams were difficult; need to read the book",
    "Must-take course at Yale for sure.",
    "One of the \"must-take\" classes at Yale, and from the comparisons I've heard, you MUST take it with Marvin Chun.",
    "Favorite class taken at Yale so far. Every single lecture is engaging and interesting and most importantly, coherent even if you have not done the reading. I love that this class kind of stands independent of the textbook and you can just sit in lecture and absorb information. Marvin Chun is the best. Tests are fair, but for those you do have to do the reading. Not easy to get an A, but I learned a lot and really enjoyed myself so I really don't care at this point.",
    "AWESOME CLASS TAKE IT!!!",
    "Psych 110 is an introduction to the study of the mind - it covers topics such as learning, memory, personality, sleep, disorders, perception\/sensation, intelligence etc. You learn a lot about yourself that you don't know and it makes you start analyzing the people around in a whole different way. Three exams, three short papers - very manageable as long as you plan to do the work ahead of time. TAKE IT!! People say it's really hard, but as long as you are willing to devote some time to the class before the night before the exam, then you will be completely fine. The reading is fun and interesting, so do it! Chun is an amazing professor, so you'll love it. Just shop it and you'll see for yourself.",
    "I would DEFINITELY recommend this course!Professor Chun is awesome! Lectures are actually fun to go to and you'll learn a lot of interesting stuff about psychology. There are only 3 short papers and 3 non cumulative exams. So on a daily basis there's really not that much work, you just need to do a lot of reading before the exams if you haven't been keeping up. But even so, since they're not cumulative it's not too bad even if you leave the reading till a few days before. This is a great class!",
    "Amazing lecture class - no wonder Marvin Chun is a legend. He's hilarious, approachable, but also extremely intelligent. I would recommend taking it Credit\/D\/Fail though - the reading really piles up before each midterm, especially if you cram it all 48 hours before, like myself.",
    "Makes you understand that psychology is 100% relevant. Even as someone who hates sciences, this course is pretty much a life-knowledge class, should be taken once by every student here.",
    "TAKE IT. It will change your life. It made me internalize the locus of control and change the way in which I viewed stress. It also helped me overcome a very troubling relationship.",
    "Intro Psych is a lecture that I never ever missed. I always looked forward to going, and I always had a wonderful time listening to Professor Chun's jokes and investigating the real reasons why we do and say the things that make us human. YOU MUST TAKE IT BEFORE YOU GRADUATE.",
    "Definitely take it. Credit\/D is a good option if you don't plan on being a psych major. It was my favorite class of the year. You have to take this class before graduating.",
    "The things one learns in this class can be applied\/ helpful for ANYTHING or ANY major. Or just life in general. Take it.",
    "No doubt, its a great class.",
    "I highly recommend taking this class.",
    "Absolutely take this class! A great intro to psychology. The lectures are some of the best I've ever seen! Marvin Chun is hilarious-- you should take it with him if you can!",
    "reading, lectures and short papers. it's awesome. recommend it.",
    "I definitely recommend it, but maybe take it Cr\/D\/Fail. I switched from that and probably would have enjoyed the class even more if I hadn't.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. It's a lot of fun, but is by no means an \"easy class\". Paul Bloom gave a guest lecture this semester, but honestly I prefer Marvin Chun's teaching style to Bloom's - so don't assume that Bloom>Chun.",
    "Yes. I strongly recommend Psychology 110 01.I really had fun this class and learn not only about psychologybut also about other thing.",
    "I would most definitely recommend this class. It is a lot of important material taught in a fun, interesting manner. Professor Marvin Chun definitely earns his title as a campus celebrity. I've taken other large lectures on campus, but this was the first to successfully engage the entire class.",
    "Psyc 110 is a great class. Completely painless to attended, interesting, and you end up with a great base of psychology.",
    "A lot of reading, about 200 pages per exam, but do them the night before and you're still fine. Easy reading.",
    "Definitely take intro Psych and if you take it, take it with Marvin Chun. He is a brilliant lecturer! He is incredibly funny as well. I never once skipped a lecture because going to this class was that enjoyable. This is MUST TAKE class, at least sometime before you graduate.",
    "fun course - but the midterms do require time to prepare for",
    "Take it if it's with Master Chun! He makes the class so interesting. For eg, for the pavlov experiment, he brought his dog to demonstrate. He also uses a lot of optical illusions and videos to demonstrate his points so you'd rarely be bored. The class was definitely taught very clearly as I could understand it without any psych background. Workload is pretty decent - only 3 papers that aren't too difficult to write and 3 midterms that you can cram a few days before and still do pretty well. Just be warned, even though it has a reputation as a class that many take credit d fail, the average for the class is still pretty high, like a B\/B+",
    "TAKE IT CREDIT\/D.",
    "Interesting, broad, funny",
    "Exactly what it sounds like, an introduction to psychology. Take it sometime during your time at Yale, preferably early. Even if you go no further with Psych, it will provide a very entertaining respite from your other classes, and will inform almost anything else you're doing to a great extent- I thought about and applied concepts I learned in Psych in both the English class and the Physics class I was taking at the same time. Professor Chun is great- engaging, funny, clear, thoughtful. He cares incredibly much about his students. The one thing I'd say is beware your TF and try to get a different one if yours seems negligent or grades the first paper strangely.",
    "I recommend it. I believe it gives a base knowledge about the influence of psychology in every human action.",
    "Yes! No matter what you want to study at Yale, you should take intro psych, and from what I've heard you can't go wrong with either professor (Chun or Bloom). The class is entertaining and interesting, and you'll probably be taking it with a lot of your friends too. Starting out as Credit\/D\/Fail might be a good idea, and you can always change it to a letter grade later in the semester if you want.",
    "It's really good, I'd highly recommend it. Chun's is easier than Bloom's. I looked forward to all the lectures, great mix of information and entertainment.",
    "This is a wonderful class. If you're interested in psychology at all, you'll enjoy the topics, and Professor Chun is a great lecturer. I can't really think of any weaknesses and recommend the class. It's not a gut class - you have to do the readings and go to lectures if you want to do well on the exams. If you want to take the class but not bother doing the readings, you should take it Cr\/D\/F. But again, I really enjoyed this class and if you like the topic or are interested in the psychology major, you should take it.",
    "You have to work hard but it is a class you must take wrote graduating. Professor Chun is incredible!!!!!!",
    "Yes! Lots of fun, and probably my favorite course this semester.",
    "You have to take this class! Seriously, the subject is super interesting, and you'll love Marvin Chun. He's so nice and funny! I think this is the only class I've taken where I never felt even remotely bored. We also had three guest lecturers - Susan Nolen-Hoeksema, Paul Bloom, and Provost Salovey - who were all great. The class isn't very hard as long as you read the textbook. I think a lot of people took it Credit\/D, but you really don't have to; it's not that hard to get a good grade.",
    "Fun class. Definitely worth taking with Chun. Take Credit\/D if you don't want to worry about lack of\/difficult curve.",
    "This is a great introductory course!",
    "It is a very easy and interesting course. If you need a so course this is a great one to do it in.",
    "Take it.",
    "Lectures are great - paper grades are heavily dependent on the TA.",
    "Psychology is an introductory course that is very interesting and informative. The material is relative and taught well. I would recommend this course to any student who is even considering psychology or wants to attend an interesting and engaging class\/lecture.",
    "If you ever consider taking PSYC 110, take it with Marvin Chun. He is the best lecturer I've had. His sense of humor is unique and enlivens every single class. He listens to us and considers our needs, and seriously makes an effort to be the best he can be. His lectures are also very well structured. The course material is also very interesting, and leaves me thinking about things I've never thought of before.",
    "Psych is an intro class to psychology, providing an extensive array of knowledge about cognitive science and social behavior. I would definitely recommend this class to anyone, and I would say that any Yale student should experience this course.",
    "Yes, it's good general knowledge and it's not much work, even if your final conclusion like mine is that psychology is kind of a joke.",
    "Psyc 110 is one of the best courses at Yale, even if you are not planning to major in psychology, you will learn a lot about yourself!Recommended!",
    "Take it with Chun! I loved lecture and Chun is hilarious.",
    "I'd definitely recommend it, but not as an easy credit. It's an interesting class, but Prof Chun covers a lot of information and there's a lot of reading.",
    "Take it-- preferably C\/D\/F if you've already got a lot on your plate. It's not an easy course but it's very interesting.",
    "Everyone has to take this class because everyone is an inherent psychologist, so this class is applied",
    "Truly excellent course that expands your look on the world. Reading the books he recommends in class as fun reads really are fun to read!",
    "Yes, I would recommend this class.",
    "I would definitely recommend Psych 110 to another student, whether or not they are interested in pursuing psychology. It's just such an interesting class on so many levels; I think everyone should take it just because it's applicable to your life and just good information to know living in the world and interacting with others. Also, the professor was so charismatic, knowledgeable, and entertaining in his lectures. The class is so engaging, and the workload is manageable. Definitely recommend!",
    "This is a fantastic class! I found that it was not difficult, but I would recommend keeping up with the readings. The textbook is tremendously entertaining (actually funny where so many others have failed), but becomes significantly less entertaining the night before, cramming for the exam.Marvin Chun has a great sense of humor and clearly knows what he's doing. He is certainly equal to or greater than Paul Bloom.",
    "Yes take it, you will enjoy each lecture. Take it with Chun.",
    "TAKE IT. It's fantastic.",
    "YES. If you are at all interested in psych take this class. The short papers and 3 tests are constant, but nothing is too much and it is so nice not to have a final. Marvin Chun is so endearing and engaging, making the class even more interesting than it would already be.",
    "A great class to take Credit\/D because you can learn a great deal from just going to lecture and not reading.",
    "A extremely entertaining and interesting class. Professor chun is charismatic, smart, and caring. He will do everything he can to get you to understand his passion. The class is very difficult, and so it is advised to take it credit D.",
    "The best class at Yale.",
    "Psyc 110 is worth all of the reading.",
    "Chun is amazing. The lectures are fascinating. This class is a must take for just about everyone. DO IT.",
    "Take this class!! Professor Chun is so awesome and you really do learn a lot. It's so much fun and you'll laugh every lecture. Make sure you don't miss Salovey's lecture!",
    "This course is definitely a great pick. Please take it. Just remember to read the book alongside the lectures, as the professor may not stress enough the importance of reading the book in preparation for the tests. This is a course you might be able to successfully cram for, but it's much preferable to read ahead. Also, it's imperative to go to every lecture, and every one is highly interesting, if only for the engaging style of Professor Chun.",
    "It is a fascinating class for Yale students of any major to take, because it involves the basic question of how we think and the lectures are intriguing and entertaining. However, keep in mind that it is not a gut class because the three tests require adequate studying and there are also three papers that you have to write throughout the semester. Take it with Chun!",
    "Good class. You might not need the textbook though.",
    "Seriously the best class I have ever taken. Take it with Marvin Chun. He is fantastic."
