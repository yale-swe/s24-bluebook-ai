   "comments": [
    "YES. You get to study Horace's Satires (they're super fun) with a Horace expert, and the workload isn't bad at all. If you're a Classics major who is studying for the Latin comprehensive exam as well, there's also a good chance that you'll see some Horace on there.",
    "This class is perfect for Classics majors or those with a very confident grasp of Latin - the material is definitely challenging and thrown at you in pretty large chunks, so you need to be able to keep up. That said, this class is fantastic, not just because of the wonderful material, but largely because of Freudenburg, who is pretty much the authority on Horace and also an incredibly relaxed and entertaining person, making this class very enjoyable even when the material got tough. The fact that there are small quizzes and two papers, rather than terrifyingly large exams, is a pleasant change from most Latin classes and made this one far more manageable at the most stressful times of the year. Take anything Freudenburg teaches, and you won't regret it.",
    "Professor Freudenburg is very engaging in class, so yes. The Satires are really very funny; the epistles are okay. Be aware that Horace's hexameters are a lot harder than, say, Vergil.",
    "It is a great course. The material is (mostly) interesting, Professor Freudenburg is excellent, the workload is reasonable, and the grading is fair. Horace's Satires and Epistles are very rich poems which can be read on many different levels. Too few people read them carefully. The one downside to this course was the enrollment; there were simply too many students, and it would have worked better if the class had been capped at 10 or so students.The Latin is difficult, though; make sure you are confident in your abilities with the language before you take this course.",
    "I'd recommend this class. I am not a Horace person or a poetry person more broadly but still enjoyed this class. It is extremely rewarding to study Horace with Prof Freudenburg since he is a leading Horace expert and has spent years thinking about these poems. His lectures fleshed out allusions and details which I would have never noticed or cared to notice myself. The passion he has for the material is apparent and contagious.About a hundred lines were assigned per night.",
    "There is a fair bit of reading in this class, and a times it kinda seems like a lot of it is saying the same thing. Overall, however, I really enjoyed the course, and the analysis that Professor Fruedenburg offers in class greatly enhances the literature.",
    "This class was exactly what its name suggested: Horace - Satires and Epistles. We read 100-150 lines a lesson. The Latin is difficult, but the material is enjoyable.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to anyone who is interested. The work is super chill and laid back, as is Professor Freudenburg's teaching style. I really liked how both the midterm and the final were take-home, which really allows you to engage deeply with small amounts of text, while still covering extensive material throughout the course of the semester.",
    "This is a great course to take on Horace! KF really is the expert in this field and opened up our eyes to the funny details and interesting nuances in Horace's satires."
