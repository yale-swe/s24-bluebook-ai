    "I highly recommend this course if you are interested in contemporary social movements and socialism.",
    "A seminar class that focuses on postcolionialism theory, feminism, issues pertaining to socialism\/marxism, issues of intersectionality, and social movements. Students research two social movements by looking for primary sources for that movement, creating a blog post for other members of the class to read, and by writing an essay regarding that movement.",
    "A strength of the course is that Denning knows a lot, and it is always interesting to hear him lecture. Additionally, this class drew a very intelligent and critical thinking group of students, so it was sweet to take a seminar with so many smart, smart people. The material, also, is very well chosen and fascinating.One problem was that the course was not sufficiently structured for me. I didn't feel like we were tracking historical themes, or particular lines of reasoning that new theorists were adding to. Instead, each class felt like a new, very interesting topic that was only tangentially related to the other topics. Especially with so many student presentations about a million different social movements, the course felt very chaotic and unfocused for me. I think I could have gotten much more out of the course\u0097especially the theoretical material\u0097if it was better structured and presented in a more coherent narrative way.",
    "I recommend this class. The readings are wonderful, the professor is brilliant, and it has the capacity to not only engage intellectually but promotes an engagement with the world and social justice generally."
