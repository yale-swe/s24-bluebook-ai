   "comments": [
    "Voice lessons are fun and rewarding.",
    "Pretty straightforward. If you've taken 205 or are concurrently enrolled, you can audition for lessons for credit (in the fall). It's low-stress and you get out of it what you put in, for sure.",
    "Free voice lessons with amazing faculty FOR CREDIT...... yes I would recommend them.",
    "This class is an incredible way to re-learn how to sing so that you can better excel at your natural abilities. Very glad that I took it and I hope that you do too!",
    "You get weekly voice lessons for credit. I would recommend this course for hopeful performers or students that want to continue taking lessons seriously.",
    "MUSI 360 is private lessons for undergraduate students. Not much to be said really. If you're serious about music and want to keep your performance skills sharp in your primary instrument, definitely take this course. Make sure to take MUSI 205\/210\/211 (2 of these courses) early on as they are prerequisites to taking lessons for credit.",
    "Awesome class. Get better at singing for credit. Do it.",
    "MUSI 360 is an excellent way to dive headfirst into learning music from semi-professionals\/advanced students in various instrumental fields. Since most instructors are graduate students, make sure to poke your teacher when necessary to get the most positive experience you can!",
    "If you have done the required theory co-requisites, there is no reason not to take Lessons for Credit. It's all the work you would be doing to improve yourself musically anyway. That being said, Janna asked too much of herself this past semester, taking on a much larger number of students to her studio than she could actually handle because of a shortage of voice teachers in the program and wanting to ensure that all deserving students had good teachers. Janna is an excellent teacher. But she simply did not have enough hours to devote to all 17 of her students, and as a result, each of us had sporadic at best lessons schedules. She also tends to prioritize her senior students (because they have auditions approaching), and her new students, and she never managed this semester to establish an official lessons schedule on which we could rely. This made it very difficult to make consistent progress, with technique or repertoire.",
    "Voice lessons for credit. Experience totally depends on what teacher you get. Still, if you're doing other singing at Yale like a cappella or musical theater, it's good to have an outlet for classical singing just to be able to be conscious of what is and isn't good vocal technique.",
    "This is a good course for people interested in music lessons, and for students who are planning to be music majors. This is a very versatile course and it is really just what you make of it."
