    "This was easily one of the best classes I've taken at Yale. I felt like I left seminar every week with more questions than answers, but still gained an immense amount of knowledge that will serve me throughout my life and career. I would recommend this course without reservations to any Yale student.",
    "I STRONGLY recommend. One of the top three classes I have taken!",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. The material is important and relevant, and Professor Grieger is an incredibly dedicated, engaging and passionate professor anyone would be lucky to take a course with. If you're in any way interested in exploring issues of poverty and social welfare policy in the US, would definitely recommend!",
    "Absolutely amazing class! Especially with a good group. Professor Grieger is a fantastic seminar leader.",
    "Lloyd Grieger is AMAZING. So kind and really cares about students. I would take a class about literally anything if he was teaching it. Take this class because you know he's about to become a Vida Maralani and his seminars will be impossible to get into except for senior sociology majors.",
    "I would not recommend this class, only because I think it fits a niche interest of academic policy debate that is suited to a less policy-oriented audience. I would recommend that students take another class with Prof. Grieger, however.",
    "Yes, definitely take this course! If you have any interest in public policy surrounding poverty and its many dimensions, this is the course for you.",
    "This is a fantastic course with a fantastic professor. It doesn't feel like a high-pressured seminar, rather the conversation flows naturally and energetically. Its material spans the history of welfare in the U.S. and brings you up to date on currently pressing issues. The blend of sociology and policy provides a unique lens to look at the material.",
    "This class cannot be passed up. It's a 100% must take for anyone on this campus. You'll learn a lot and be humbled in the process. It'll wake you up to the reality of people's lives in the US. There is a lot of work to do and the learning curve might be hard at first, but it's worth it in the long run.",
    "This is a great survey course on poverty policy in the US! If you haven't taken any classes in urban poverty or poverty in the US, this could be a really informative class for you! We talked about measurements of poverty, the changing perspectives on poverty and welfare from the 1960s through the present day, changes in welfare policy, the role of the recession on poverty, sociological perspectives on low wage work, the inner city, incarceration, and marriage on US poverty. Each week, the discussion is facilitated by a group of students. Generally, discussions tended to be pretty interesting, although, at times, the discussion was a little bit unbalanced with more contributions from the professor than the students. Sometimes, discussions did not always seem to have clear takeaways, which sometimes made the content of the course seem less grounded. The course load was manageable; there were 6 reading responses (1.5 pages), 2 group presentations, and a final essay. Overall, this was a pretty good class! However, if you are considering other courses on poverty policy (courses with Professor Horan or Welfare States Across Nations), maybe shop around a little bit to see if this is the right one for you."
