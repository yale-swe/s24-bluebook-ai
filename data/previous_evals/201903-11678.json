    "I got a nice overview of broad areas of neuroscience. I got practice asking questions and reasoning about scientific concepts.",
    "I loved this course! I really enjoyed this broad exposure to different areas of research within neuroscience, and hearing from experts in each domain was amazing. I would take it again in a heartbeat! I felt like I developed a greater appreciation of the wide variety of research methods used in neuroscience, and how research questions are being answered multi-modally through research with cell and animal models as well as humans. I also loved getting to learn more about the ongoing research of professors in the department!",
    "Deep fundamentals of neuroscience in a variety of topics. This helped me learn about different subfields and modern research so I can be better informed for grad school.",
    "Basic knowledge of neuroscience.",
    "I gained a wider understanding of the field of neuroscience and its application in the various domains of psychology",
    "Being new to the field of psychology, the course was helpful since it approached psychology from the PoV of neuroscience and evolution.",
    "a rather thorough understanding of research in the neuroscience"

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The quality of the lectures depended on who was presenting. Personally, I preferred the ones that were more about the history of science and early seminal work rather than about the lecturer's current line of research. Since we are all capable of looking up papers in a field and reading them, it seemed silly to me to focus on results of individual studies and papers. I much preferred the lectures that focused on theories over time. I thought the more interactive lectures, where we were asked to think or come up with explanations ourselves, were better (like Avram's and Ty's lectures). I thought it was great how Avram and Ty would present us with some paradox and then ask what we make of that. I didn't like the lectures where the professor raced through, throwing data up on the slides without labeling or explaining what the axes on the graphs were, and telling some story about what this data says without giving us a change to interpret it for ourselves. Some of the slides and graphs really wouldn't have flown in colloquium, and I didn't appreciate that.",
    "Strengths: Different professors team-teaching the courses, great content, helpful textbook and readings! Weaknesses: Some lectures more helpful than others - in particular lectures 7 and 8 were a bit hard to follow.",
    "Its perfect how it is.",
    "I really enjoyed that so many different topics were covered and that each session was held by an expert",
    "The team taught nature of the course is very effective and gives an opportunity to interact with different faculty in the department. One weakness that might be improved is that instead of having 4 papers to write for the final, they could have been broken down into 2 for midterm and 2 for final.",
    "Given the inherent heterogeneity of the topics, some of the lectures felt less relevant than others. The contents of all the talks were very interesting, but in some cases, it felt like two lectures were too short a summary to get a grasp of the basics of the topics they discussed.",
    "It was taught by lots of faculty members in the psychology department, which is really cool; the lectures can be a little more organized"

   "comments": [
    "I would recommend it to a student without a background in neuroscience. I took quite a bit of neuroscience coursework in undergrad, and this class seemed similar in content, style, and format to the introductory neuroscience class that I took freshman year. It only felt like a graduate level class to me when it became more interactive and discussion-based, as I mentioned above, like when Avram or Ty engaged us in developing explanations of seemingly paradoxical findings.",
    "Definitely! Overall I thought this was an excellent class!",
    "Yes-the final was hard with the 4 essays, but I got a lot out of them and out of the lectures. Definitely made me feel like more of an expert.",
    "Yes! It was a very interesting course and encouraged me to learn more about the topics",
    "Absolutely, it is a great course that provides a holistic understanding of the field of neuroscience with respect to its application in psychology. All the instructors were very engaging and covered a breadth of content.",
    "Yes! It is a good intro course.",
    "Yes. It provides a supreme guidelines for getting to know a varieties of areas of current neuroscience researches"
