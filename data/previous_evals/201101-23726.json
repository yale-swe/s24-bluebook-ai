   "comments": [
    "SPAN 120 was a great course! It was well structured, organized, and a perfect elementary level spanish course. Although the Centro lab assignments can be tedious, I truly felt like my grasp of the Spanish language improved over the past semester. In addition, one of my favorite things about this course is that there are a lot of small assignments that add up to your semester grade. So if you do poorly on your first quiz, don't worry! There is plenty of time to make up for it.",
    "intro course",
    "Intermediate course in beginner Spanish. Mostly written, but includes listening and speaking components as well (presentations). Take it if you want to improve your spanish--it's fun too.",
    "Absolutely! It is taught in a very logical progression and you learn so much.",
    "I absolutely recommend this class, it is a million times better than any Spanish you might've taken in high school. Sometimes it's hard to get into a section, so make sure to be there really early or you might not get in or you might have to take a less convenient section. It's important to have a good instructor too, so see if you can find good evaluations and talk to people who's taken it before. Even if people like someone, if you go and don't like the person, try to find someone else because it's really important to be compatible with someone you're trying to learn a language from because you want to want to speak to them. Otherwise you just won't learn as well because it will seem like a chore.I though L2 was really fun, and the grammatical stuff wasn't that bad even though people like to complain about the subjunctive just because we don't have it in English.",
    "If you like Spanish and need to fulfill your foreign language requirement then definitely take it."
