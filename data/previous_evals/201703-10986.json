    "My writing skills were improved as I learned how to recognize the passive voice and other writing habits that should be avoided.",
    "This class was the favorite course I took this semester because I learned so much about writing an excellent essay but also about so many other topics like AI or start-ups. Mainly, I developed strategies of how to write a good and well-structured essay. Besides that, I also learned very much about AI and gained many insights into being an entrepreneur.",
    "I learned a new way to look at writing my essays. I also developed my ability to analyze critically.",
    "This course taught me about the rhetoric of entrepreneurs and persuasive writers, as well as the written work essential to businesses. I gained much more insight into what claims are, how persuasive writing is efficiently accomplished, and how entrepreneurs develop their companies."

    "In my opinion, this course had no weaknesses. The fascinating topic and the selection of the books and article we read were strengths of this class.",
    "The professor was amazing. Would take another English classes just because Dr. Klemann is teaching it.",
    "This course has no weaknesses. The strengths are a discussion-based learning environment that encourages contributions from everyone, extremely interesting material, and real world tasks as assignments, just to name a few.",
    "The course was heavy in reading material, and I wish I had been in the know on that before taking the course because it ended up being overwhelming at times in conjunction with my other coursework."

   "comments": [
    "Yes absolutely, mostly because of Professor Klemann. She has so much energy when teaching and makes herself available for office hours whenever you need to go over a paper or a reading.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student because Professor Klemann is a great instructor who accessed the difficult topic of AI excellently. Moreover, the experiences I gained outside the classroom were unique memories.",
    "Yes! I felt like my writing improved tremendously and I am not capable for college level writing.",
    "yes",
    "I would very much recommend this course to another student. The topics discussed in the course are very thought-provoking and relevant to the future of humanity and it's interesting to approach technological advancement and innovation from different vantage points and to rigorously argue about them in writing and in-class discussion. The course helps one to develop a systematic approach to academic writing that aids in one's clarity and persuasiveness. I would recommend the course to anyone willing to put in the effort to better their writing and is genuinely intrigued by the topic.",
    "I would recommend this course if you are very interested in the existential and philosophical questions of artificial intelligence and\/or entrepreneurship because a lot of the reading is based on the former and we skyped and interviewed many current entrepreneurs with their own businesses. The range of companies we looked at was vast, with interviewing the 1 person Tigress Ventures to the 800 person Yext.",
    "Yes, this class helps you gain more confidence in writing. The professor of the section I was in was very organized.",
    "Yes, for sure. You cannot go wrong with this class. There is a lot of work, but it is all worth the effort when you are able to apply it in class to the engaging subjects that will encourage you to work even more.",
    "I enjoyed taking this course because my professor, Heather Klemann, was amazing, but because of the heavy reading material and extensive writing I would not recommend it to someone that wasnt totally obsessed with the topic."
