    "Lots of research, still going!",
    "I am very excited that I decided to write a senior essay for Economics. I am exploring a subject that I am very passionate about and challenging myself by doing forms of research and evaluations that are out of my comfort zone. This semester, I learned a lot about the process of writing a thesis--choosing a topic, exploring the literature to come up with a unique idea, and collecting data.",
    "Senior essays are very useful!",
    "It definitely allows you to use most things you've learned in the econ major and apply them on a real project, so it's definitely a learning experience.",
    "Research, data analysis, STATA, evaluation",
    "Economic research skills: evaluating research questions, collecting data from a variety of sources, writing literature reviews, developing theoretical and empirical models",
    "This semester, I've learned how to devise an answerable research question and started learning skills about data analysis.",
    "Super rewarding process. You own the project from start to finish and learn research the hard way.",
    "Thesis writing",
    "how to use data, papers, and interviews to construct economic hypotheses and then test them",
    "I developed a lot of useful skills through out this course. I learned about coding, theoretical economics, and econometrics. Additionally I learned thinks like thinking independently and pushing myself academically. I feel like this course really helped me thrive and I am excited to continue my work next semester.",
    "I learned data skills, Stata skills, and how to think about economic problems and come up with a research idea."

   "comments": [
    "It's great!",
    "I cannot think of any areas where the senior thesis could be improved--my engagement with my advisor and the TAs through section, etc. has been incredibly helpful.",
    "It's very open ended, but that is also the point of doing a senior essay.",
    "More help with potential topics and how to choose them would have been nice. I went in not knowing what I want to do, and I'm still a little confused on that end. However, the new classes that help with stata are very helpful, so overall, it's pretty good.",
    "Engaging process",
    "It allows students to follow their interests, but can sometimes feel like a real stab in the dark.",
    "Depends on your engagement with your advisor. The department provides sufficient tools.",
    "Independent course",
    "The strengths of this course are definitely the focus on letting you pick topics you are interested in and exploring them thoroughly. I always felt very engaged and responsible for my own success in the course which kept me motivated the whole semester. It was a pleasure working with my professor and grad student who were extremely helpful and always available to give guidance. The only weakness I can think of is lack of guidance in terms of what the economics department expects from the thesis. This might become clearer next semester, but I felt a little directionless when I started writing.",
    "Sometimes I feel lost while writing my senior essay, even though my adviser is very helpful. I guess it just comes with the territory. Sometimes I wish there were more regular checkpoints throughout the semester to make sure I'm not falling behind, like a recommended date when a certain thing should be done etc."

   "comments": [
    "Yes it's fulfilling.",
    "Yes, I think it's a great idea to start your Econ thesis in the fall already to get some backbone to your work and to start making real progress.",
    "I would absolutely recommend that all seniors majoring in Economics write a senior thesis if there is at topic that intrigues them. It is a great culmination of four years of studies in Econ and also a challenge to apply econometrics skills to an area of intellectually curiosity.",
    "Its a great opportunity to study exactly what you want.",
    "If you have something that you're passionate about studying, do it. If you're just doing it for distinction, maybe think again, because it's not so fun spending all this time working no something you only marginally care about. That being said, it does allow you to put all the skills you may have forgotten that you learned in the econ major to good use, and this is a huge positive. I'm learning more from this essay than I have in most individual econ classes.",
    "yes definitely",
    "Yes! A senior essay is a very important component of engaging with a discipline!",
    "required for 2-term essay!",
    "Definitely.",
    "Yes",
    "Writing a thesis is a great academic exercise and certainly worth it. Try get an adviser who can give you time, rather than a brand-name professor - it will make your year infinitely easier and more rewarding.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone with a passion for economics who wants an opportunity to do research.",
    "Yes because it gives you a glimpse of what being a real economist is like."
