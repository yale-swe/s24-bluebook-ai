    "a great class to read a lot of books that i'd always wanted to read anyways. one book a week is really not bad when you enjoy the readings.",
    "Discussions were generally interesting and covered important elements of each book, including comparison of different novels to each other. Novels covered wide range of topics and countries in Africa. I recommend taking the course if the book list is appealing or if you are looking to interact directly with a professor.",
    "Amazing. Definitely take. Interesting and not stressful."
