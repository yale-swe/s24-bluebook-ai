   "comments": [
    "Yes, Latin 464 is a very enjoyable class with significant but enjoyable reading, as well as writing assignments that encourage a greater appreciation for the text.",
    "This is a really great class--it is amazing to come to know a work like the Metamorphoses in depth and to read it in its original language. Professor Solodow is awesome and the assignments in the class are genuinely interesting and enjoyable. If you love Latin literature, definitely take this class.",
    "This class is definitely a lot of work at times, and focuses more on the interpretation of the text instead of the mechanics of the grammar. This was my second L5 Latin course at Yale so I was able to manage, but I could see being a little overwhelmed if I hadn't already taken the Aeneid course which hammered in grammar technicalities. Additionally, Professor Solodow offers extra translation sessions to help figure out the kinks of the translation if you are lost. I also appreciated the three smaller papers and polished translation assignment as opposed to a long paper, though I think having a longer paper at the end with the prompt up to our choosing (or from a selection of suggestions) might be a good place for us to really explore ideas that had interested us over the course of the semester.",
    "I would recommend this course to any student of Latin; an examination of Ovid's Metamorphoses is valuable to any student of the language, and Professor Solodow's teaching of it is enjoyable, thorough, and insightful.",
    "Good class. Professor Solodow really knows his stuff. Most of class is spent discussing the material rather than translating. For that reason, you should be comfortable translating large amounts of poetry on your own, but help is available if you need it. Several small essays form much of your grade -- not too challenging if your manage your time. Would recommend if you're already confident in your language abilities; if not, it might be good to take another L5 or two first.",
    "This course was a truly illuminating overview of one of the great works of Latin poetry. I cannot emphasize enough how wonderful it is to closely study a text with which one is familiar, as I was with the Metamorphoses, in the original language. Professor Solodow has high expectations when it comes to daily preparation. It is not enough to simply read and understand the Latin: one must also have a grasp of the text's grammatical and linguistic nuances (I never knew there were so many uses of the subjunctive and the ablative until this class). And Professor Solodow's expectations are just as high for the writing assignments as well, though his comments will helped me become a better writer, both on the mechanical and interpretive level. Two caveats about the class: first, the writing assignments are short (about three pages), and there is no final paper, so one may not have the opportunity that one may wish to have to expound at length about the text. Second, we spent far less time simply translating the Latin than I expected, so one really has to hold oneself accountable for preparing the daily assignment well. That being said, if one was having difficulties with the text, Professor Solodow was happy to set aside time, both in class and outside of class, to simply translate. Overall, I would recommend this class to anyone who, first of all, wants to read one of the great poems with a true expert and, second of all, has at least a modicum of confidence in their ability to read Latin.",
    "I would recommend the class to someone seeking to gain a lot of exposure to Ovid, and who is willing to put in a tremendous amount of time.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course: its an introduction and a survey of the wonderful world of the Metamorphoses...the class makes you love Ovid.",
    "Very solid literature course. You will obtain a good grasp of Ovid. Solodow is both eloquent and learned. Take this course if you like books and\/or knowledge.",
    "Yes. LATN 464 is a very strong and comprehensive look at the Metamorphoses, and by the end of the class you'll be able to draw threads throughout the entirety of the epic (as well as know a lot more Ovidian Latin). Professor Solodow deftly balances the many threads of the class (translation, grammar, discussion on English readings, analytical\/literary discussions on the Latin); somehow we almost always have enough time for each section while never feeling particularly rushed. The class requires a not-insubstantial amount of work, particularly if you need to brush up on your translation abilities. There are some weeks when it can feel that all you're doing is Latin translation, which is a blessing and a curse, depending on your perspective.",
    "Latin 464 was an extremely heavy course with regard to workload. It consisted of a great deal of translating every night in addition to a somewhat moderate portion of both reading and interpreting that, at times, went hand in hand with the translating. The course grade is determined, essentially, by exams and essays. I would recommend the course to another student provided that they have a very strong background in latin and manageable schedule otherwise, as the time commitment for this course is not miniscule. With that being said, it is a very intellectually stimulating course, one that encourages a great deal of learning."
