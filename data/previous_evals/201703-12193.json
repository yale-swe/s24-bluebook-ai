    "Great course overall. Would recommend less emphasis on the textbook for daily instruction and a slight variance in the homework assignments.",
    "Strengths: Daily homework, numbers practice Weaknesses: Practice speaking I feel as though I've improved in writing, reading, and listening, but I don't think I've improved my speaking very much. Speaking is the most difficult part of learning a language for me, so I think it would benefit me to have more opportunities (both formal and informal) to speak for extended periods."
