    "Reading scientific papers (and critiquing them), working through psets, data interpretation, writing grant proposals, and the mechanisms underlying hematological diseases, diagnosis, and treatments -- turns out there's more of a reason to be optimistic about curing cancer than I thought before.",
    "I gained insight on what it means to be a scientist. Besides the actual information learned in class, I feel as though I gained many vital skills in learning to read and think critically in terms of scientific literature and experimental design.",
    "I learned how to read scientific papers, apply scientific knowledge to new problems that I hadn't seen before, write a grant proposal.",
    "I learned how to write a grant proposal and how to read scientific papers. I also learned a lot about hematology and how to discuss the material with my peers.",
    "I feel that I have gained a comprehensive understanding of various blood cancers and disorders through taking this course. Skills acquired through the course of this class include being able to understand scientific papers, determine the identity of a blood cancer\/disorder from patient symptoms, and write a grant proposal.",
    "Was introduced to a number of leukemias and other blood diseases, and gained an understanding of the mechanisms of actions of each treatment. It was really satisfying to get through the semester and then look back on the work I'd done and know that \"goodness gracious I know all these medicine things.\"",
    "I began to develop an understanding of the thought process of a physician-scientist through learning about a selection of heme diseases. I learned how to interpret primary and review papers, how to answer conceptual questions, and how to write a short grant proposal.",
    "I developed a deeper understanding of molecular pathologies and some biotechnology that has been developed to treat them.",
    "I learned how to read scientific journal and review articles. A lot of these pertained to cancer and diseases of the blood. I also learned a lot about the road ahead if I want to continue going medical."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "How it was taught. I wish every science class was taught like this. I loved having lectures on Monday and then discussing psets as a class on Wednesday (though beware that this is a kinda fast turn-around time...they are challenging psets!) -- it allowed me to fully understand the psets and also brought up a lot of new ideas because everybody approached the questions so differently. I also really liked having two different professors with different teaching styles and different pset styles. The professors are so invested in the students' success. Even though diving into the class at the beginning is difficult if you don't have a lot of previous bio experiences, reading the papers and understanding the lectures gets easier. I wish that the lectures were more explicitly integrated, though; sometimes it's hard to see how all the different diseases connect to one another.",
    "This course was fantastic. I felt as though the information, although initially complex and advanced, was presented and taught in a manner that made it all very understandable.",
    "It was a really fun and challenging course that helped me grow a lot, and the layout of assignments really emphasized our learning. The lectures were also very interesting and I liked having a discussion every week. The only feedback is that sometimes receiving psets further in advance would have made the workload more manageable.",
    "I very much enjoyed the style of this class. I think the course could benefit from having a lecture in the beginning on how exactly to tackle the information and maybe some tips on how to succeed in the class. I also think that the lectures are sometimes hard to understand since the material is complicated, but office hours were very helpful. I very much loved how close you get with dean Chang and Dr. Rinder.",
    "Strengths include rigorous study of various but nonetheless interrelated blood cancers and disorders, instruction on how to write a grant proposal, and a high level of engagement from the two professors. I would have liked to have practice tests to prepare for the exams (I understand the psets were meant to prepare us but I still felt it was a bit of a jump from the psets to the exam questions).",
    "If you enjoy biology (and plan to go into medicine in the future), this class is a must-take. Work is very engaging and challenging; you'll be reading many landmark medicine papers and learning the mechanisms of various blood diseases, as well as their treatment. The p-sets are only 10 questions or so, but are challenging and take up a good amount of time; this is NOT a gut class. The grant-writing unit of this class is easily the most valuable part of the class; feedback is very helpful and I was very pleased with my final draft. Another warning - this unit is also no joke. Unless you have experience with writing grant request papers beforehand, you WILL need to go into office hours and you WILL NOT get a good grade if you rush through the first draft right before the deadline. It is an invaluable experience, though, and I'm happy I was able to take this class.",
    "I think this was truly an inspiring and well-taught course!",
    "Weaknesses: The course in my opinion was attempting to teach very niche subjects in a very broad manner. I ended this course feeling unsatisfied with what I learned. However, I did enjoy rigor and the challenge it posed, I wish I could have about molecular medicine not just certain pathologies. Strengths: the student-professor engagement in this seminar was unlike that in any other class. Both Dean Chang and Dr. Rinder were heavily invested and took pride in getting to know their students.",
    "One strength is that you get a really good sense about what your life will look like as a researcher or doctor. One weakness is how everything was sent out by email, including the lecture slides and p-sets. This left it up to the professors to send things out in a timely manner, which wasn't always the case. To improve this, it would be best if everything were posted and organized in Canvas so that I wouldn't have to waste time searching through my inbox. I also wish this class was more discussion based. I felt as though it was taught more like a lecture, when it should be seminar style."

   "comments": [
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. I never once had a day in that class during which I was not intellectually stimulated. This was one of my favorite classes and I learned many useful skills regarding entering the field of science.",
    "yes, this class explored really cool topics in a fun and engaging way. and the field trip to nyc was a lot of fun as well.",
    "yes I would. This is a great course if you are interested in medicine or even if you aren't. It is very bio heavy but you don't need much prior knowledge. You take many fun trips and have really fun office hours too. It was a great class and I learned a lot.",
    "Yes if they are very interested in the topic and have at least some prior advanced knowledge in biology as I didn't have that rigorous of a biology class in high school and I found it difficult to keep up sometimes.",
    "I would recommend this class. If the student isn't taking a particularly heavy courseload alongside this class, it's a thoroughly enjoyable experience. There is a good deal of work to be done for each class, which will take up a lot of your time between Monday and Wednesday class (in addition to the grant-writing period of the class, which is no easy feat).",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to anyone interested in medicine or basic science research. The tools introduced in this class are invaluable for a career in medicine or research.",
    "I would not recommend this course. This course did not teach me as much as I wanted to learn about molecular medicine nor did it help define whether or not medicine and research are the path for me.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to students who want to get a better sense of what its like to work in the medical field."
