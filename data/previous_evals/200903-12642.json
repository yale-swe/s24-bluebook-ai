    "Though entitled Sex and Gender in the Black Diaspora I figured this class would be more about gender representation and expression in specific region comparisons. Though we did not focus on specific region comparisons throughout the class, it was good to get a sense of different areas within the Black Diaspora.",
    "Yes. take it. don't get frustrated by the format because although a little chaotic it is a lot of fun also.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class.",
    "I HIGHLY recommend this class to anyone who likes to get good greats while participating in laid back conversation and class projects.",
    "This class had some great readings and movie-screenings, but at times lost a bit of structure. Nevertheless, I really liked the ambience of the classroom. I especially liked our final class with the graduate students, because there are often times very few opportunities for such interactions, especially academic ones.",
    "I definitely would, but only if the class becomes better structured."
