    "Great class. Lots of work. Start problem sets early. If you don't already know how, learn to use LaTeX with the first problem set. (the first one shouldn't be that bad, so you can focus on learning the formatting). Go to class and go to office hours for help with the material and\/or psets.",
    "This is a great class with a fairly heavy workload. Definitely take, even if you don't have the prereqs, but not with lots of other pset-focused classes.",
    "Would definitely recommend this to anybody interested in learning more about the topic. While difficult, definitely worth it.",
    "I would recommend it because it teaches you great problem solving skills and interesting problems in computer science.",
    "Great course. In case there is any confusion, you will be writing proofs rather than code, but it still was probably my favorite course in the major, largely due to Professor Spielman (who prefers to be called Dan) and the organization of the course. I learned a lot, and even though I spent a decent amount of time on problem sets I didn't dislike doing so. Even if you don't need it for your major (you're not a CS major), it's still definitely worth taking.",
    "Highly recommend. Especially if you wanna interview for tech jobs. But it's also just good for your brain.",
    "Excellent course. Take anything that you can with Dan Spielman.",
    "You must take this if you are CS major. You don't have to be CS to take this course.",
    "If you want to think about methods to solving hard problems quickly, this is the class. You'll quickly become familiar with proof writing, and you'll learn some neat ways to solve problems. The course load is not too bad with the new collaboration policy and fewer number of problems.",
    "Algorithms was a great experience. It's not easy by any means, and it probably took up almost as much time as did 323, but I felt like I learned a ton. Professor Spielman is great, the material is very interesting, and the homeworks - though frustrating at times - can be fun and cool. Just beware: for each problem set (which are a little less than weekly), it does not take very long to solve all of the problems (maybe 3-5 hours), but writing\/typing up solutions can take forever (5-8 hours).",
    "This course is fantastic. Dan Spielman is literally one of the best professors I've ever had in my life. He is an incredible lecturer who has clearly demonstrated that he cares about both the course material and his students. Make no mistake, the course is difficult, but you gain so much out of it. And do not underestimate how hard this class is. It was the most difficult class I've ever taken in my two years at Yale (even more time consuming and difficult than CS323). You have problem sets almost weekly that will challenge you to think of crazily innovative solutions (and were taking me over 20-30 hours every week, but that's because I was extremely rigorous in typing up my proofs thoroughly). Make sure to go to the Zoo for office hours with the peer tutors! This class has a lot of support and the best part is that it really builds an amazing community. All those late nights in the zoo and the CEID will forge a bond between you and your classmates. Definitely worthwhile though!",
    "YES. TAKE IT. Daniel Spielman is amazing. This is my best class this semester. Take it Cr\/D\/Fail if you're worried about grades, but it's a fantastic experience. Or just sit in the lecture.",
    "You probably have to take this or are a math nerd. I personally didn't love theoretical CS, and I only started to enjoy these psets when I found a group to do it with. I initially resisted collaboration, but learn from my mistakes and don't. Find a group or even just one other person with a similar skill level and think through psets together after spending a bit of time thinking on your own. It will make the course so much more fun and you will learn more and get a better grade too probably. Midterms are fair, lectures are great, and if you follow that advice you'll like the problem sets too.",
    "Cool CS class. You don't do any actual coding, more proving of algorithms and run-time. You have to think creatively and the problems can be hard, but manageable.",
    "I would recommend to majors and non-majors alike. Learn how to think computationally about a problem, create an algorithm and prove it works and prove it runs fast (yes, this is a proof-based math course). Possibly my favorite course at Yale based on material alone. Spielman is a great professor who understands how his students are doing and is easy to talk to.",
    "An extremely interesting class that teaches you new ways of thinking and solving problems. It is very rewarding to watch your arsenal of algorithmic and proof tools expand, and there is nothing like the moment of realization when you have that key insight on a problem you've been banging your head on for a while. It is a fair amount of work and requires developing a process for tackling difficult and often undirected problems, but there is support in classmates and the teaching staff, and the experience is very rewarding. Even as a non CS major I got a lot out of this class.",
    "Although I took CPSC 365 because it was required for my major, I'd definitely recommend that you take this class if even if it's not required, especially if you are majoring in or planning on working in a field that focuses on problem solving. The problem sets for this class are not impossible but they do make you think about how to approach a problem and how to recognize patterns in problems. Dan is an amazing professor and an great person to talk to about computer science in general. He's designed the class in a very specific way to maximize students' experience, and he really takes feedback seriously.",
    "15 hours\/week on problem sets, about. Really cool material.",
    "Great for math majors too!",
    "Challenging, but definitely rewarding.",
    "I would recommend this class. If you want to just learn and have a great time, take it. It'll feel painful at times, but it's ultimately so rewarding.",
    "This is the hardest class you'll take at Yale.",
    "Great professor. Interesting material. Problem sets creative challenging, and worth one's time. Undergraduate graders were... slow and problematic. Dan Spielman is truly a gem of the computer science department. It is remarkable that such a brilliant, active researcher puts in this much time into teaching a course.",
    "It's hard--harder than 323 for me, anyway. The more you put in, the more you get out of it. Learn LaTeX",
    "Don't do it",
    "People seem divided on whether 323 or 365 is better, and I'm definitely in the former group. That being said, this class is incredibly useful and you will hug yourself once your done. If you're not CS, beware.",
    "365 is a hard class, but definitely worth it. Start your problem sets early, and the class will become more manageable.",
    "This is a great course if you enjoy thinking mathematically and learning about clever solutions to problems. I took it because I enjoyed Math 244, and that was definitely the right decision.",
    "Amazing class that your probably have to take. You will learn a lot and be challenged.",
    "Great class but extremely difficult. This class will take over your entire semester, so try to avoid taking it while also taking other difficult classes! The tests are fair and are only on material from class, but the problem sets are unfairly difficult - they take many many hours to finish, and sometimes only 2 of the 3 questions can be gotten on your own. He allowed collaboration this year, but if you don't have friends in the class, that just means that your grades will be lower than everyone else who is able to collaborate - beware of that!",
    "Good course but problem sets are very difficult. The problems don't take as long to finish as 323, but they are often harder to solve.",
    "Best class I've taken at Yale. Dan is a legend; he is so kind and thoughtful, and he is a good lecturer. The problem sets are very challenging. I spent 20-50 hours on each one., but Dan allowed collaboration this year, so I actually had a lot of fun working on them with other people. It was very difficult and time consuming, but I feel like I learned more in this class than any other I've taken at Yale, though 323 is on par, but it's much more fun because most of the time you're working with other people. It will be very rewarding and you'll make some great friends.",
    "One of the hardest classes in the CS core, but definitely deeply rewarding. I would recommend above all else to attend office hours frequently, as they were paramount to successfully completing all the problem sets. Also try not to fall behind in lectures, as missing a single one quickly makes consecutive ones confusing. The class is a lot more theoretical than the typical CS course, but I liked this -- it allowed us to discuss and describe algorithms without getting bogged down in the code.",
    "The best core class for the major. Incredibly rewarding and extremely challenging. Make some friends in the class and struggle over psets together late into the night\/morning. Beware--not for the faint of heart.",
    "Overall, this was a phenomenal class and I would highly recommend it to any student at all interested in math or computer science. The topic itself is interesting and Spielman makes the class experience great. The time and effort he puts into making the class fair and accessible is really admirable. Even for those who are not interested in any computer science related field, the problem sets in this class are extremely fun and interesting, and require a different type of thinking than more traditional math classes. However, the workload is a big time commitment, and one that should definitely be taken into account when deciding whether or not to enroll in this course.",
    "A great preparation for interviews and lots of fun if you have the time to think about them.",
    "This is a fantastic course, and you should definitely take it! But be warned, it can be hard (although it's not as crazy as many will say), and at times you will feel like you are spending way too much time on the p-sets. Spielman is a great lecturer, and the psets are actually fun most of the time. Be warned that the grading is a mess - it was inconsistent, slow, and asking for a regrade of psets was a frustrating experience. Hopefully this problem will be fixed in the future, but consider at least starting the class Credit\/D. Even if you excel in it, there is no guarantee this will be reflected in your grade.",
    "Dis class is hard, takes a lot of commitment.",
    "This is an incredible course and a must-take for anyone who wants to do any form of applied math or computer science in the future. Spielman is easily one of the best teachers at Yale, and he teaches everything so clearly, and because of him you should take this class. However, be warned, this class is not an easy class. The p-sets are difficult and take time (but at least the tests are easy and worth 25% of your grade only). Designing algorithims and then developing a mathematical proof that they work is simply not easy even for myself (a math major). It is definitely rewarding and you learn a lot. Another thing to remember is that the pre-requisites arent that important. I was missing the pre-requisite (CPSC 223) while I had the pre-requisite (MATH 244) and there was very little struggle adjusting to not having taken CPSC 223 and I only found my MATH 244 background to be slightly helpful.",
    "This is the best class I've taken so far at Yale. The work is definitely not trivial, but definitely worthwhile and interesting. Dan Spielman is an amazingly clear lecturer and really seems to care about his students a lot. Definitely a class worth considering at the very least!",
    "Essential material for any computer science major.",
    "Absolutely recommend. Thinking about the problems took a while but the eureka moments were well worth it. Talk to someone early about how to write concise proofs if you think you're spending way too much time on your write-ups--i think especially at the beginning I included way more information than I needed to.",
    "Algorithms is a great class. If you are seriously interested in computer science, this is a must take. You learn how to really think about problems. There is no coding but knowing how to program is definitely a helpful prerequisite. The problem sets are quite difficult but the tests are quite easy. Dan is a good lecturer and the textbook is also fantastic. Definitely try to work in groups. I am an applied math major if that is relevant.",
    "It's a great course if you are interested in alg.",
    "Hard class, one of the core classes for the major. Useful to see relevant material.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to any student, even if you're not a CS major (I'm not!). The problem sets were very difficult but fun and rewarding. Also, Spielman is probably the best professor I've had at Yale. He's incredibly intelligent and knowledgable about the material being taught, extremely fair, and supremely passionate. Make sure you allot time for this class in your schedule, since problem sets take a lot of time to work out, but it'll be totally worth it.",
    "This was an enjoyable class to take. Definitely opens one's mind to a whole field of computer science. Reasonably difficult and takes a while, but very satisfying problem sets.",
    "Brilliant course. I took it without 223 or 201, and was relatively okay (though I did have to put in some effort to develop a working knowledge of data structures, especially for trees). Dan is a brilliant professor. The problem sets, though challenging, are very cool, and really help you grasp the material.",
    "Don't slack off on this class just because there may be significant overlap with classes like EENG 202 - full-blown mathematical proofs with time optimizations are more detailed that what some other classes cover. You'll learn a lot, but prepared to set aside a good amount of time so that you can finish your psets promptly and write the solutions comprehensively enough that you won't get points docked off unexpectedly. Also good to make friends, because some psets can be basically unsolvable within the time given if done entirely individually. This time round the grading of psets went a little slowly, so it was hard to know how well I was doing in the class till near the very end, but hopefully next time round it'll be better.",
    "Great class. Basically you get a bunch of puzzles to work through every week. Can be stress inducing the night before they are due, but you will really enjoy the process if you like quirky puzzle solving",
    "CPSC 365 is a really great course that truly lives up to its reputation as one of the best course in the Computer Science department. Prof. Spielman is a brilliant instructor and really cares about his students. I personally preferred the implementational side of CS, so I enjoyed CPSC 323 more than this class, but 365 was really enjoyable nonetheless. My one piece of advice is to really throughly think through the psets on the day that they're handed out; Prof. Spielman only holds weekly office hourse the day after the psets have been handed out, so if you want to ask meaningful questions, you should starting thinking about the psets early.",
    "This is a difficult course. It's hard to do really well, but that said, it's not that hard to pass. Take advantage of the help sections and talk through the problems, not just with the TAs but with fellow students. Use the collaboration policy as hard as you can."
