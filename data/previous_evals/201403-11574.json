    "Instructor: Alexandria Moore \u00a0Alex was helpful in efficiently and effectively moving through in-class assignments. I felt that when my colleagues and I presented, she had interesting and thought-provoking questions and feedback in response to our research projects. She was very helpful in this regard. When presenting, My only area of development to mention for Alex would be to speak a bit more slowly when presenting. But overall I felt like she created a casual enough atmosphere for folks to share their opinions and contribute to discussion and was an effective facilitator.",
    "Instructor: Alexandria Moore \u00a0Alex was approachable, helpful, and carried out her responsibilities really well. The only feedback I would have is that she seemed more like a peer than a teacher, so could have been more assertive with taking control of the discussion\/exercises.",
    "Instructor: Alexandria Moore \u00a0Very accessible, knowledgeable, enthusiastic",
    "Instructor: Alexandria Moore \u00a0Alex was very organized and patient with our questions. She also gave great feedback about proposed research.",
    "Instructor: Colin MacKenzie Donihue \u00a0Colin was a super helpful TA! He really knew how to help students formulate their research questions, and was very accessible to meet outside of class. I have nothing but good things to say about Colin.",
    "Instructor: Colin MacKenzie Donihue \u00a0His experience working with students in this class previously was extremely valuable. I feel like he had seen enough work from previous students to really be able to know what successful projects looked like and to give very constructive advice.",
    "Instructor: Colin MacKenzie Donihue \u00a0Great facilitation of discussion, it was a great balance between lecturing and asking questions. I really enjoyed this class. On the other hand, a bit more guidance on the proposal outline would have been useful, since the average grade was apparently a 10\/15.",
    "Instructor: Colin MacKenzie Donihue \u00a0Colin was organized and very helpful. He was encouraging and this helped quieter students participate well with the class.",
    "Instructor: Colin MacKenzie Donihue \u00a0Colin was very knowledgable, but perhaps not as firm as he could have been with his constructive criticism. He did a good job of mediating discussion in class, and was very approachable for help outside of classes.",
    "Instructor: Colin MacKenzie Donihue \u00a0I think my teaching assistant is very helpful, he is very good at organizing the group discussions and give useful recommendations according to his own experiences.",
    "Instructor: Colin MacKenzie Donihue \u00a0Colin took a patient and balanced approach to helping students refine their projects. He is quite good at understanding where someone is trying to go with an idea and bringing that out in their development."

   "comments": [
    "I thought at times the instruction was confusing. The course as a whole was very valuable for planning research projects. The instructor could have asked more clear leading questions during lecture. His lectures were well organized, but his teaching style was slightly intimidating which made participation uncomfortable.",
    "It inherently makes sense for a natural science course at an environment school to be focused on ecology, however numerous students in the course were not specifically focused on ecology and the readings poorly catered to their interests. However, Os and Alex were excellent (assuming Colin is as well, but had little interactions with him).",
    "This course was very useful, and provided a good structure for students writing proposals for research in the natural sciences in the upcoming year. Os was approachable and very helpful, and I would highly recommend this class.",
    "Sometimes I felt that the professor was very defensive. While I like him as a professor, I felt that he really did not like me at all and did not want me to talk in class. I also think that he does not explain what he wants out of students well. The hypothesis class needs to be improved and there should be explicit instructions for the outline (not just read the proposal).",
    "Overall a very useful course, but pitched towards students who are less experienced with doing science. For students with more experience, this made certain parts of the course (like learning the scientific method) seem a bit redundant. This might just be necessary to reach all levels of people who entered the course. I would have enjoyed looking at experiment designs from a variety of fields and discussing different approaches in more depth, or doing more readings on this subject."

    "Editing my research proposal.",
    "Going through the process of writing a research proposal was very helpful for me. It gave me very specific things to think about when writing grants, and helped me develop simplistic language to describe my project to folks outside of my field.",
    "I found the course very valuable for guiding me through the process of preparing a proposal, and providing the space and time to do so. It was also valuable to learn how to critically read scientific work.",
    "I really enjoyed the peer review panel. It was a very realistic representation of scientific peer review processes, and I thought it was a nice way to end the course after our proposals had all been submitted.",
    "Being forced to write a pretty decent draft of my proposal within the first term of my master's degree was great, and certainly a better approach than a lot of other master's programs.",
    "Developing own project\/paper.",
    "The course was a rigorous revelation of my research project goals. Things that I never thought to consider were important were highlighted and I was grateful for this.",
    "The structure of the course, which gave students an opportunity to work over their research proposals, and the peer review of proposals was also very useful and helpful.",
    "This course gives a systematic introduction to scientific research, including both methods and related funding applications. These information can give me a overall integrated perspective of researches should be done.",
    "Writing the proposal and doing proposal reviews. This was a very useful exercise.",
    "Even though the course was fast paced and forced us to make decisions about our research, which in the end was the best for me.",

   "comments": [
    "This course does not use the allotted time appropriately. Much time was spent on covering topics that most of the class already was familiar with. Comments and feedback on assignment are extremely negative and not motivating. There was a lack of openness to students' perspectives and input.",
    "I think the evaluation of outlines and proposals could be improved. There were many comments on my proposal that I did not receive in my outline regarding the efficacy of my methods. Had I been given the opportunity to work on areas of my outline, I would have improved my proposal even more, but I wasn't aware that I needed to improve my methods.",
    "The class was more a venue for this process of writing a proposal than it was for learning new material. There were very few lectures, and the ones we did have were spent going over materials posted online (that we could have reviewed ourselves or in a much shorter time), and learning basic skills such as how to conduct a literature search. I felt like that lecture time could have been used a bit more effectively to discuss the readings or engage in a dialogue about new material.",
    "I didn't find much of the discussion or lectures to be very helpful. I would have prefered more examples of bad\/good proposals and research designs, rather than talking about these things in the abstract. The one class where we did this was very helpful for me. Also, there was an excessive bias towards ecology (and I was an ecology major in undergrad) that seems unhelpful for the rest of the class.",
    "I think more information\/insight can be given to a future in science.",
    "Some of the readings can be a bit dry but useful nonetheless.",
    "The most important improvement of this class should be the connection to each student's own subject and research. Everyone's project is different from each other, some of them are completely not overlapped! This leads to the problem that peer review sessions are not as helpful as they should be. Also, although there are lots of common methods and structures of scientific researches among various subjects, there also exist great differences, which should be noticed and emphasized.",
    "Overall the course is great. Maybe make it more clear if the course is about writing a proposal for an idea that the student finds independently interesting, or if it is about writing something about the project that they have already been assigned to with their advisor. This can be a confusing aspect of the course.. perhaps giving a little background on how to navigate this balance, since balancing between one's personal goals and those of the lab is a common challenge in writing a proposal.",
    "If possible, it would be helpful to provide the reading material and syllabus over the summer so we have a chance to start reading, prepping and thinking in more detail about our research question. Perhaps a few short video lectures that we could watch over the summer would help prep the class. Since this is required for all MESc's interested in natural science, it makes sense to provide it ahead of time.",
