    "My favorite class at Yale. Students should definitely take this course. It's a broad survey of the various topics impacting environmental studies. Each class meeting is a different topic taught by one of the 4 instructors. Course work isn't that difficult and I always wanted to go to class.",
    "Yes.",
    "different topics in environmental sciences- geosphere, hydrosphere, biosphere",
    "This is a survey course on topics ranging from physical anthropology to geology, from atmospheric chemistry to biology. I highly recommend this course for students who do not have a background in environmental sciences. It is a great introduction to some interesting topics and the quality of hand-on instruction is awesome! There is ample opportunity to pursue areas of interest in research papers and there is a chance to learn how to write grant proposals for scientific research that could come in handy later in life. Take it! Especially good if you need a science credit, don't want to kill yourself trying to understand highly complicated topics, and want to be exposed to subject matter in many different disciplines within environmental science.",
    "Highly recommended. Take this class, especially if you're a non-science major interested in learning -- REALLY learning -- lots of important, interesting things about environmental science writ large. This year's class also benefitted from a stellar student-teacher ratio!"
