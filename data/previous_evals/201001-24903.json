   "comments": [
    "Only take it if you have to. The material is important but the syllabus isn't really that comprehensive, and the lectures can be really dry and incomprehensible, as well as unhelpful ...",
    "Yes. But it's pretty dense. I wish I had spent a little more time doing the readings- like two times might have been good for some articles, although you can also get by ok without doing ALL of the readings, especially if there are as many as this semster.Overall, pretty engaging course that is weel taught. Great intro. to several different approaches to analyzing literature, including a historical twist. Soemtimes it felt like we rushed over concepts and readings a little too quickly though, which is the price of breadth I suppose. Also, take really good notes. They will come in handy for the final at the end. Maybe even consider writinga little summary of key points after each reading you do because 1) that will help you understand the reading at the time and 2) you will totally not remember the theoretical article that you raced through before section very well several weeks and hundreds of pages later when it comes time for the final.",
    "Prospective lit theory student: you should be sad that you didn't come to Yale soon enough to take this course with Paul Fry. Haun Saussy is a nice man, but his lectures were often rambling and they did a consistently poor job of elucidating the most relevant parts of the reading. Lit theory is a complicated subject, and in order for a person to understand it, it really needs to be explained well. This course did not increase my understanding of the subject material nearly as much as I would have expected.",
    "By all means take it. It will give you a solid foundation for your further literary study, and it will immensely sharpen your critical and interpretative skills. So your best bet is to take it sophomore year. Saussy is great, very witty, funny smart. If you attune yourself to how everything he says has usually two layers - a jocular and a profound one - you will come to enjoy this class a lot. Do the reading though.",
    "A class you need to take if you are a Literature major, but i would say it is essential to anyone who wants a good education. It is mind blowing, but Prof. Saussy is a liability to the material. Check out Open Yale Courses for a great version of this course, but nonetheless I would take it again and so should all of you.",
    "Only if you ABSOLUTELY have to for the sake of grad school. Otherwise, NO.",
    "REALLY don't take it unless you're a Lit Major...except, I feel like that's always the case anyway so...you're just gonna have to fight through it!",
    "If you're interested in literary theory, this class is a good gateway to the topic. The (considerable) readings are practically all works of seminal importance, and the lecture and discussion sections are a good way to begin to grasp what is going on in the minds of Foucault, Derrida, Barthes, etc. However, I was disappointed by the lack of cohesion shown by the course as a whole. By the end of the semester, I thought I had improved my knowledge significantly, but felt as though I was a long way from really grasping a lot of the theories covered.",
    "This class made me a Literature major. The material is dense but engaging and Professor Saussy is fantastic as a lecturer (he's both very good and hilarious in a very subtle and very ironic way). The stuff you read will make you challenge everything you've ever taken for granted about language, society, and literature. I can't recommend it highly enough.",
    "ABSOLUTELY. Such a great great great course!!! You learn so much, and Professor Saussy is so wonderful and nice and interesting. He's always willing to help. I would absolutely recommend this class-you won't regret it!! Take it with Saussy--he's so amazing.",
    "Paradoxically, this class may be better after having taking a few classes that look closely at one or two lit theory movements. There's a lot of material, and it's helpful to have a strong reference point. Lit theory is always fascinating though!",
    "I would summarize it as a sweeping survey of literary theory and relevant philosophy.",
    "No.",
    "I would, because taking a survey in lit theory is INCREDIBLY useful to have as a tool for understanding texts. That said, I wouldn't recommend this class because of the lecturer."
