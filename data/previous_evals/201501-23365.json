    "A good number of the lectures had already been heard by most of the first year students in other classes.",
    "good speakers, but due to presenters of YSPH faculty in other EMD courses, many presentations were identical (I think 20-25% were presentations we had seen already 1-3 other times already)",
    "A great diversity of topics, maybe sometimes a bit repetitive.",
    "Interesting seminars with interesting research. I enjoy them!",
    "Many great lectures. Less redundant lectures between PID and seminar would be appreciated by first years that are attending both.",
    "Interesting array of speakers on a variety of topics.",
    "The seminar was generally interesting, although about a third of the time, the speakers had already given nearly identical talks in our courses.",
    "I enjoyed many of the seminar speakers this semester. I particularly enjoyed some of the speakers that were brought in this semester that were from practical public health positions, such as the CDC and EIS, which bring an interesting perspective besides the traditions research roles. My only complaint is that there were some speakers that gave lectures for Infectious Disease (which all the first years take) that also gave the same lecture for the seminar.",
    "Really enjoyed speakers this semester- perhaps even more than last semester. However, centennial lecture was kind of a dud. I'm not sure what sort of prompt people get when giving these lectures, but it seemed as if the lecture was very much geared to a lay person rather than someone with a public health background. There was nothing new or novel about the lecture.",
    "Interesting lectures. I don't really have any issues with content. More choices for lunch would be nice (maybe Thai food or Indian food once in a while?) rather than just pizza or Nica's every other week, but I understand there might be budget restrictions or other limitations to this.",
    "Overall, I thought the speakers were pretty good - I remember being more interested in the speakers we had this semester than some of the ones from last semester. So an improvement overall.",
    "The course overall was interesting and informative."
