    "A survey course about Japanese history from 1550- 1850.",
    "Good lecture, but did not live up to the hype. Professor Drixler is very nice, but the names and exam structure is not for the faint hearted.",
    "Take this class if you want learn about something you have never learnt before. I am taking this cr\/d and I think it is a good decision to start it cr\/d and see if you want to convert.",
    "History 307 (Japans Great Peace) was an excellent course. Having previously had little opportunity to learn about Japanese history, I took the course primarily to indulge my curiosity, and it did not disappoint. Professor Drixler is an extremely knowledgeable and engaging lecturer who not only provides insight into the Edo period but also uses it as a lens to examine how humanity remembers the past and looks forward into the future. The workload is not excessiveweekly readings for the discussion section plus two essaysand the exams are fair. In summary, I highly recommend this course.",
    "More lullaby than lecture, with Drixler's soothing voice and pseudo-philosophical asides making for an enchanting spectacle to the uncynical youngsters. The syllabus was well-crafted, the readings interesting, the anecdotes well-placed, but somehow I feel immensely unsatisfied, with the organizing themes of the class touched on with way too much subtlety, the musings from the lectern more distracting than provocative. Underclassmen only.",
    "Professor Drixler's lectures are great, the material is thematic and very interesting, section was bearable. You can get by without doing the readings, especially Credit D Fail. I just took it CDF because I wanted to learn some Japanese history. I took this class, had to write two essays but besides that wasn't stressful, and I learned some awesome Japanese history.",
    "A great history course.",
    "This is an excellent history lecture that I would absolutely recommend to everyone. Professor Drixler's lectures are always engaging, the reading is interesting, and the workload is reasonable.",
    "It's a good course if you're interested in Japanese history. I took this class because I needed a pre-industrial course and a non American or European course for the history major, and this class satisfies both requirements. I found it interesting and am glad that I now have a better understanding of Japanese history during the time period that we studied. I would recommend it if you need it for history major requirements and\/or if you are interested in Japanese history. Professor Drixler's lecturing style was not quite to my taste--he tended to speak a bit quietly and had a tendency to go off on tangents. Something to keep in mind if you have a difficult time paying attention in those kinds of lectures. Overall a pretty good class though.",
    "This was a wonderful class! Take it! Professor Drixler is an excellent lecturer, and even when you don't find the day's topic particularly interesting, he finds a way to make it so. The workload is quite light - one paper, a midterm, and a final, readings are not too long, and sections work well with the class. I learned a lot!",
    "This course covers the history of Early Modern Japan, that is, after the Warring States Period until right before the the Meiji Restoration. It provides a great overview of the period through different perspectives such as demographics, environment and culture, and you can get a balanced understanding of pre-modern Japan. Professor Drixler is fantastic, and he really cares about his students. The essay topics are interesting, the grading is fair and he holds review sessions before exams too. I definitely recommend this class to other Yale students!",
    "Japan from sengoku to the Meiji restoration (without the restoration). It is fantastic.",
    "I highly recommend this course. Professor Drixler's passion for the subject made every lesson into an unfolding story.",
    "A must-take history class. The workload is easy and the class is a lot of fun. It's kinda a niche topic, but if you are interested in Japan at all you should take it. I also began to think about history differently because of this class. Drixler is great and the TA's are awesome. I had to drop another course to take this class based on its prior reviews but I am so glad I did.",
    "This was a fantastic course. Professor Drixler provides an excellent overview of Japanese history, and brings such a love and enthusiasm for the material that all students get caught up in it. The readings are interesting, the lectures are enjoyable, the exams were fair. The course features different angles of approaching history, including documentary, demographic, and artistic\/cultural methods. I highly advise this course to history students and others.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS. YOU WON'T REGRET IT. One of the best classes at Yale, taught by one of the best professors. The best Yale decision I've made.",
    "This is a fantastic course by the best professor I, a graduating senior, feel I've ever had at Yale. Professor Drixler is knowledgeable, interesting, generous with his time, and above all a teacher I can't recommend highly enough. He makes the subject even more interesting, and it's already got plenty to recommend it -- professor Drixler explores a wide range of angles on a unique period in Japanese history.",
    "It's an awesome class, and Professor Drixler is an excellent professor. Even if you don't think you would have any interest in Japan or this time period, I highly recommend checking this class out. Professor Drixler is a great lecturer, sections were a highlight to my day, and you'll be surprised at how unique and interesting this period of Japan is in many ways. As a STEM major who wants every non-STEM class I take to be worth it, I am very happy I took this class.",
    "Take it. If you aren't a history major, take it Credit\/D. But take it.",
    "I would most definitely recommend Japan's Great Peace to anyone with even a marginal interest in learning about Japan. I myself came into this course knowing next to nothing about Japan, and I came away feeling like I had a thorough and rather nuanced understanding of Tokugawa Japan (a period that inevitably informs much of Japan's modern development). Professor Drixler is an incredibly engaging and thoughtful lecturer. If I had taken this class prior to junior year, I think I would've been a History major."
