It was a great balance of learning writing skills and getting to read about a very interesting topic. I would recommend English 114 because it is so useful to work on writing skills.",
    "This is an interesting section if you're interested in the material and how consumerism affects society. Prof. Winders is actually very insightful and also very nice and understanding. I feel like my writing greatly improved and she helped me break out of my high school ways of writing. I would definitely recommend this section to anyone considering English 114. Also",
