   "comments": [
    "It was very engaging, technical, and involved a journey of developing a personal relationship with the materials\/process. It will be easy for the detail oriented, organized, and methodical and difficult for the spontaneous and undisciplined.",
    "ART 122 is an excellent course for students who are more interested in making work than in discussing it, and in process rather than concept. Jon is an excellent resource in and of himself; he is incredibly knowledgeable, helpful, patient, and understanding, but is also clearly excited about what he is doing which comes across in class. The sessions seem long, but if they were broken down and class met twice a week, the same amount of work couldn't be as easily accomplished.",
    "It is a class dedicated to learning about different types of molds. Definitely take it if interested in sculpture.",
    "I would recommend this class to art majors who need the skills taught in this class for their work. You have to be willing to come in outside of class to finish up projects or redo failed attempts. It's definitely unlike other art classes here in that it's entirely skill-oriented.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. It was really hands on and provides you with an interesting set of new skills. Not too much work outside of class. Very cool materials and subsequent products."
