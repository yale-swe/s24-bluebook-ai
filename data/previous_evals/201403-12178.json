   "comments": [
    "Problem set every 2 weeks, no midterms, but there is a final. Problem sets this year were only 2 problems per pset. Class is pretty entertaining since Aspnes is often easy to follow and the class laughs a lot as his jokes. Sometimes Aspnes will go too fast, but its ok because all the material is going to be in the online notes.",
    "I wouldn't if I don't have to, or if I am not interested. The first few lectures of the course covers probability, and then goes on to algorithms. It's kind of a hipster course to take because you only use randomization for your algorithms and then spend a lot of time analyzing the output and the runtime, so it really depends on how much you like dealing with that sort of stuff.",
    "It's a solid theory course. Don't expect it to be useful outside of improving your thinking.",
    "Absolutely take this class! You need these techniques to solve real-world problems, and the section on probabilistic data structures (treaps, skip lists, bloom filters, hashing) is really important too. Don't leave the problem sets to the last night (it can be done, but it isn't fun) and definitely go to Aspnes's office hours. All the problems have really pretty solutions if they're approached the right way, and he's really good at helping you see them without giving too much away.",
    "While there's a lot of interesting material covered, the teaching of this course was frustrating and sometimes unstructured. Prof. Aspnes's online notes are a godsend; look them up if you're considering the course, as they basically contain everything covered, as well as assignments, etc, from previous years.",
    "A wild romp through a zillion topics. Very confusing at times",
    "Hard, fast, interesting. Only if you are really good at stats\/math",
    "Take it if you like algorithms analysis and probability. Be prepared to spend a fair amount of time on the psets.",
    "Aaabsolutely amazing! Be prepared for really hard work on the problem sets-- they may seem easy and only two questions long, but sometimes you will go through 10 subtly wrong answers before coming upon the right one and it will take all night long. The lectures move really fast but you do learn a lot about how to understand and analyze randomized algorithms that you may encounter later on in life.",
    "Learn about how the exact answer isn't always necessary because sometimes cleverly randomized output can suffice to satisfy your specifications.",
    "The course sneaks up on you. The first few weeks its basic probability, then all of a sudden you need to know exactly how to use a bunch of new tools we learn about. Staying on top of the material is important. Perhaps most important is just understanding the appropriate and inappropriate conditions for each tool you learn about. Also, grading seemed somewhat arbitrary.",
    "A hard, math-heavy CS course.",
    "Randomized Algorithms is a great sequel to 365. We learned how we can apply randomization to create algorithms to solve challenging problems, developed tools to prove bounds on expected run time, and discussed randomized data structures like hash tables and trees. The workload was a total of 6 problem sets of 2 questions each (3 in previous years). We had 2 weeks for them, and they were worth 60% of the grade. We also had a final that was worth 40%. Professor Aspnes is an excellent teacher who makes learning an enjoyable experience. My biggest suggestions for those taking the course: 1) Start early :), 2) Read, reread, and reread the notes to try to understand the concepts, 3) Visit office hours often. For those who like theoretical courses, I would highly recommend this.",
    "Interesting class. You learn to analyze a lot of probability bounds to show that randomly picking things can actually lead to good results. Lectures can be interesting but are often confusion. You're usually better off just studying his notes, which are very comprehensive.",
    "Would only recommend if you really like this stuff.",
    "Good introduction to randomized algorithms funny stories tricky problems sets. If you are interested in the material then take the class.",
    "Randomized algorithms is a great class to further your understanding of algorithms after cpsc 365. The lecture notes for this class are excellent and clearly explain the material covered. I recommending forming a study group early on in the course in order to study topics covered in class because many of the topics are relatively advanced and take a lot of time to digest. The problem sets are relatively sort in length, but they are very challenging and often take a long time to complete. Nevertheless, the problems are very interesting and teach you new ways to think about things. Professor Aspnes is very quirky and I recommend that you ask questions in class if he goes too fast or if you feel like you don't quite understand a topic he covers."
