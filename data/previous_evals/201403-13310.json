   "comments": [
    "a very broad survey that touches on important issues here and there, mostly at merrimans whim. merriman is great, but the course was too broad to get that much out of it. I would recommend France since 1871 instead",
    "Hist 202 assumes a basic knowledge of European history, but this can be obtained by reading the textbook ahead of lectures and section if you haven't taken AP Euro already. Easy exams and little work; the only real assignment is an essay (which may be required to be longer than the original syllabus states). Recommended, unless you have an aversion to instructors discussing their personal views in class.",
    "I would describe the course as one with truly fascinating material, with a fun, smart yet disorganized professor, and with a fair amount of reading and assignments. I would highly recommend the course to another student.",
    "I would definitely recommend!!",
    "European Civ is a rather standard lecture, but Professor Merriman definitely seals the deal. He often provides a light, humorous atmosphere, but maintains gravity where it is necessary; his lectures definitely leave students thinking about the information they were just presented. Overall, it makes a great introductory course to European history, though a bit of background in the subject wouldn't hurt (especially outside of the 1648-1945 timeframe).",
    "A crazy course in European History. Take it for the experience of Professor Merriman!",
    "Great survey class.",
    "It's not a bad course, but it's not great. I took it because I wanted a refresher on European history, but if you don't want that, you may want to look elsewhere.",
    "I only took the class because I was scrambling for a 4th class during shopping period and the first lecture was interesting enough. I regret taking it, but it wasn't a bad class overall. The grading isn't too bad and the material (books and films; not the textbook, the textbook sucks) is interesting enough. There's not much more to say because it was underwhelming class in general.",
    "will be pretty repetitive if you are ap european history or are well versed in European history. If you want just the exposure, it is a good class.",
    "Great class; go to lectures, you'll derive more value than watching them online. Professor Merriman clearly loves the French and is very well-traveled. A chill midterm, an essay that is graded harshly so just put in a lot of effort, and a final that was kind of hard and worth 40 percent of our grade. Make sure you learn the terms and general trends, and in doing so you'll learn a huge amount about the History of Modern Europe.",
    "Solid European history survey course with a French slant.",
    "Not the best history class, but good for a broad overview of Europe and how it got to where it is today.",
    "I would recommend it to a freshman interested in European history",
    "Awesome course, would recommend",
    "Take it as a chill Credit\/D, especially if you know little about the history of Europe. If you are a history buff or have taken Euro History AP this class is probably not for you.",
    "Basically AP euro. Take it if you want to learn a lot of relevant material that applies to today. But don't take it if you're not prepared to dedicate a lot of time.",
    "How well you do depends on your section. Merriman is an interesting lecturer, though his lectures sometimes sound like ramblings and aren't always necessary. Depending on the TA's expectations and willingness to help and your work ethic, the paper can be easy or incredibly difficult. Section will be the most helpful part of the course. The readings and movies are usually not feasible with the amount of other work an average student will have from other classes. Not a completely easy class, but not too hard either.",
    "Good course if you want a review of European history from 1648-1945. Since there is so much material to cover, you move quickly from one event to the next. Wise to take your class notes based around the terms that Professor Merriman emails you before class.",
    "Yes, important course for students to take to introduce them to critical events in modern history.",
    "This overview is very broad, but if you're looking to fill in the holes in your overall picture of European history, this is the way to do it. Merriman is definitely one of the legends of Yale College, and both his textbook and lecture are great. Also, not too much work, so a good 5th class.",
    "Interesting survey course of modern European history from the Thirty Years War to the end of WWII. Would recommend if you haven't studied this area of history before.",
    "If you are not already familiar with European history it will be very important to read the textbook before lecture. Keep in mind that Professor Merriman covers only a small glimpse of the textbook in his lectures. In order to grasp the bigger and important themes, you will need to do the reading and critical thinking on your own.",
    "I would take this class if you've never had a European history course before. If you took AP Euro in high school, this class will probably feel very similar. The reading is interesting (particularly the secondary texts) and not more than any other historic course. Be sure to do the reading for discussion sections and the midterm\/final as the lectures, while incredibly entertaining, tend to have a particular objective and it doesn't always cover the course material.",
    "The lectures are great, and you should definitely go see them in person rather than online. If you've taken AP Euro, you shouldn't take this course unless you're genuinely interested in learning about some of the same topics but more in-depth. I enjoyed writing the essay. You're allowed to pick your own topic, so be thinking about what you want to write about starting the first week. Make a list of ideas. The tests are fair as long as you do the reading and pay attention in lecture. Choose your section carefully. Overall, I highly recommend this course.",
    "If you want a broad survey class where you don't need to attend class much and you aren't really trying to learn very much\/think very hard, then take this. But, otherwise, take something with more specific of a focus. This class was too rambling for me, and I didn't learn anything I couldn't have Wikipedia-ed on my own time. Merriman is cool though.",
    "Fantastic reading. So so class experience.",
    "Good overview of European history from 1648. Would recommend to fill in gaps and tie together an existing knowledge of European history.",
    "From what I've gathered talking to my friends, this class is basically AP Euro. It's a pretty interesting and decently entertaining way to get a broad introduction into the countries of Europe, especially France. Not too much work, and the exams are reasonable.",
    "This class is a great overview of European history. It might be repetitive if you took AP Euro. The reading isn't too heavy, and lectures are engaging. Movies and supplementary reading are fun, and give a little more color than just the textbook."
