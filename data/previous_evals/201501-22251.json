    "Take this class.",
    "Definitely would recommend. It's a great class overall and offers a completely different perspective of current and past U.S. involvement in the world. Professor Van Vleck is a great resource to have and is very knowledgable about the field. The workload is not heavy at all!",
    "Definitely take it. If Cindy is TF, try to get in her section. Make sure to be 100% clear on what a primary source analysis is especially if you haven't written one before.",
    "Sure, why not. Can't hurt, but also probably doesn't help.",
    "Interesting course that goes beyond high school history. Same facts for the most part, but explores connections between different events and people more thoroughly. Very interesting lectures, and fairly straightforward (but not necessarily curved) test and assignments. Sizable amount of reading.",
    "Yes. It's a very interesting class that offers you a new perspective in thinking about history.",
    "awesome class. van vleck really knows what she's talking about. it's like a US history class with a foreign policy lens so you learn about general events you've already heard of but with all kinds of new stuff attached. definitely take.",
    "This is a solid class. Professor Van Vleck is a superb historian. She is careful in her analyses and interpretations, and she is engaging in her lectures. Everything about her course is incredibly organized; her attention to detail cannot be overstated. If you're of the 10% of Yalies who identify as conservative, and you're worried about a liberal professor teaching American history, fear not! As a conservative myself, I had my hesitations early on in the semester. But Professor Van Vleck is very upfront about her views; more importantly, she is always explicit about the interpretive nature of doing history, and she is always careful to distinguish between historical facts and historical interpretations. Regardless, she is a very compelling historian with intriguing, insightful arguments who really makes learning and doing history a joy. Also, the workload is pretty standard. I heartily recommend this course.",
    "I would recommend it! Really good survey class of US History through an international lens. Van Vleck makes it a big point to also examine the link between domestic affairs and foreign policy, so you also will learn about some interesting cultural movements within the US. As a survey class, it doesn't delve too deeply into one specific topic\/era, and at some points does feel like just a more in-depth, interesting version of APUSH. However, I really enjoyed both the readings, lecture, and section for this class!!! It's not too difficult, though there is a lot of reading. Professor Van Vleck is an engaging and really well-prepared lecturer. The midterm and final are very manageable, as are the two primary source papers. Interesting class that offers a a lot of good perspective on American exceptionalism and national ideology.",
    "This is an extremely comprehensive course. I'm impressed by Van Vleck's lecture style--it's very smooth, and she is unique in her ability to present a thesis every lecture, which helped tie disparate events together. In addition, she didn't just focus on white history--she was very cognizant of gender and race politics, and the readings reflected an extreme consciousness of these underlying factors. Highly recommended.",
    "Origins was a fairly interesting class: AP US History with a focus on foreign policy and international relations. A solid background in US History helps a lot with memorization before tests, which are a combination of IDs and essays. Not a ton of work but also not an easy A because grading is very subjective. Also the class seemed to have a tougher curve than most history classes. Definitely a good class to shop and see if you click with Professor Van Vleck's lecture style. A lot of reading, but there is a fair amount of choice for exam essays and papers, so you can pick and choose a bit according to what interests you most.",
    "Very well taught course. Prof. Van Vleck clearly has passion for the material, which made the class interesting and invigorating. The material itself is very interesting for those interested in U.S. History. The main dig I have with this class isn't really about the class: the exams were significantly memorization-based, which felt to me like high-school-history-class. They were not primarily conceptual; the final elicited some interesting thoughts, but other than that...",
    "Difficult but interesting",
    "One of the best history courses at Yale. Take this for a fresh look at US history.",
    "I would definitely recommend Origins of US Global Power to another student! It started out as a fifth class but ended up being one of my favorite classes this semester. You learn a lot, even if much of the material makes you question beloved U.S. historical figures, and I now feel like I have a more complete picture of U.S. influence in the world up to the present day.",
    "HIST 122 is a very engaging course that will give you a well-rounded overview of American history and its impact on the world. There are several aspects that could be examined in additional detail, but I believe it would require additional courses to get that level of detail. Even so, this course raises several interesting questions that serve as good motivation to examine them in greater detail in the future.",
    "I think it was a pretty tough class with a lot of memorization, but definitely interesting and made me think about American history in a different way. Would recommend.",
    "A lot of review of AP U.S. History. If you have taken APUSH, the class is pretty gutty - just know the terms before the tests and write two essays about readings. If you haven't taken APUSH, this might actually be a great chance to examine U.S. history - going from the colonial period to the end of the Cold War - through the lens of international relations.",
    "I really enjoyed Origins of U.S. Global Power this semester. The class spans throughout American history, beginning in colonial times and continuing through the end of the Cold War. It is not merely a repeat of AP U.S. History, but rather covers American history from an international perspective. I thought it was interesting that the course covered not only the well-known events, but it also had time to go into detail about very interesting people and organizations that are more obscure, yet of equal importance. There was a significant amount of reading, but I felt that it helped me get a feel for current writing in the field of history. I enjoyed that the class took not only a factual approach, but it also focused on historical interpretation. My TA, Arielle, was great! Overall, a very interesting course, and I am sad it is over!",
    "The class is a survey course with the unique slant of analyzing America's history in the context of its role in the world. It does a fantastic job of bringing America's inconsistencies to light, and is an important course for those to take who are interested in history but have gotten the watered down AP version of US history in high school (or if anyone wants to be an informed American or citizen). The workload is manageable and Prof. Van Vleck makes the lectures interesting with a mixture of relevant and obscure, text and pictures, and movies as primary sources along with required reading. I would strongly recommend this course.",
    "Great class, great instructor, good credit D but you could also take it for a grade and do fine.",
    "A good survey of US foreign policy and international relations! Prof. Van Vleck is very articulate and very approachable. Take it!",
    "Challenging but great class",
    "This is a wonderful history class. Professor Van Vleck is a god, and she totally reframed the way I view American history and contemporary social issues. This class made me want to be a history major. It is a perfect lecture, and Van Vleck is a perfect lecturer (and professor)."
