   "comments": [
    "This class is extremely interesting. I felt I learned a lot from the course, and I would definitely recommend it!",
    "This is a reading\/discussion focused course with one midterm paper and one final seminar-length paper. The quality of discussion really depends on the others in the class. Oh, and it's more theoretical than you'd expect. Think \"how does public vs. private diplomacy influence audience costs\". That was interesting but sometimes got a little dry.",
    "Would definitely recommend this class if you're interested in diplomacy and how nations decide to go to war. It's very much grounded in strategy and decision making. Note that the class is very discussion focused, so if that's not your thing you may want to look at another course.",
    "This class gives a good theoretical basis and introduction into political science studies on diplomacy. Professor Trager has a strong grasp on the material and often punctuates class with funny anecdotes from diplomatic moments in history. I would recommend this class if you have an interest in diplomacy, do not mind reading long papers and do not mind that participation is very closely tallied.",
    "Great weekly seminar, with lots of reading per week but not much work (the final paper is worth 50% of your grade). Prof. Trager is a very interesting professor and I really enjoyed the discussions. If you are interested in the topic, you need to take this class.",
    "Biggest word of wisdom to others is that you should take the disclaimer seriously: \"Students are assumed to have had a prior course in internationals relations theory and to have some knowledge of diplomatic history.\" I didn't enjoy this course, but I think a lot of it had to do with much of it going over my head because I didn't have the same background in history that my classmates had. I'd advise a really strong knowledge of WWI, II, and the Cold War especially (I'm talking specific battles, territory lines, speeches, etc), and American and Euro IR history in general. If you have this, you'll probably enjoy the discussions and readings way way more than I ever did.",
    "Highly recommend, especially for Global Affairs security track folks."
