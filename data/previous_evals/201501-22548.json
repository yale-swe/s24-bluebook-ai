   "comments": [
    "This is a great course for someone looking to consider general philosophical questions related to a 3-O (Omniscient, Omnipotent, Omnibenevolent) God. It is not a theology course, nor does it consider the sacred texts of any religion. It examines questions such as the problem of evil and the traditional arguments for God, as well as things about the nature of faith from a rational sense. Altogether a great course!",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to any student who is interested in learning more about religion (and its critics).",
    "Amazing class--highly, highly recommended. As a science major who had never taken a philosophy or religious studies class before, this one was remarkably accessible and also super interesting. John Hare is a fantastic lecturer, and the readings were always relevant are not too much to handle. The two papers were both short, and the four quizzes were based completely on reading guides that Professor Hare provides. Overall, one of the best classes I've had at Yale. Take it if you can!",
    "The course was a survey course which covered a broad range of material. On the plus side it was like getting a taste of the many numerous subfields of philosophical inquiry, and good for someone who wants to pursue further exploration. The topics were engaging and pertinent for anyone who has given serious thought to the question of religion. The possible downside is that so much breadth was covered that it was sometimes hard to go in depth or continue to grasp the overall course narrative, and things felt slightly piecemeal.",
    "Take it if you like Philosophy and have had some experience of the subject matter. I didn't Credit\/D, but it's probably a good idea to do so if you haven't done much Philosophy before.",
    "Professor Hare is an excellent professor and really loves what he teaches. He made the class worthwhile. I would only take this class if you like abstract thinking instead of concrete facts and logics. If you don't, it can be frustrating.",
    "This is the best class I've taken at Yale so far. The workload is manageable, especially because the material is so interesting. I recommend this class to everybody, including non-philosophy majors. If you want to develop a decent understanding of major theological issues and current thinking on questions of religion, definitely take PHIL 326.",
    "Yes, would absolutely recommend! It's good soul food and not that much work.",
    "Class covers the major themes and topics in philosophy of religion. Choose a good section then you will be able to go deeper into each of these themes.",
    "Awesome course! No prior knowledge of philosophy needed though it obviously helps. Hare is the best and the work is very manageable.",
    "A survey course in the worst sense: doesn't give you a satisfying understanding of any one aspect of the discipline, but certainly \"introduces\" you to enough issues that one or two might stick as interesting. To the extent that there was a focus, it was on the rationality of religious belief, with a rather extreme (and not especially enlightening) emphasis on Bayesian approaches. So if you're into Bayesian epistemology and want to see how it may apply to Anglo-American Christianity, take this class; if not, you're better off without it.",
    "A good survey of the PHILOSOPHY of religion, but not at all the way I think anyone should really approach religion. It's not something to prove analytically, which is what this class attempts to do (or not do). It's analytic philosophy, but what is attempted to problem be is God - is religious experience authoritative? How can you reconcile the existence of God with the existence of evil? Interesting questions, but approached through SUCH a dry and analytic lens they fall flat. I think this would be much better as a seminar - philosophy as a lecture feels so impersonal that it is almost masturbatory. Would not really recommend - doesn't teach much about either philosophy or religious thought. More of an introduction to the religious teachings of several thinkers, but there is no real room to grapple with the text (because it is not a seminar; because it is taught through proofs). That being said, Hare is a delightful lecturer and loves his material - very avuncular. Maybe worth shopping to just enjoy the academic performance, but would not take the class.",
    "A survey of the philosophy behind mainly Abrahamic faiths and some occasional non-Western religions, ReliPhi goes in depth to discuss all the major arguments for and against God's existence. A great philosophy class, it is perfect for anyone with even a marginal interest in religious studies.",
    "An amazing class for anyone who thinks they might be interested in religion or philosophy. Hare is an animated, funny, caring professor, and makes interesting but sometimes confusing material easier to understand. Would absolutely recommend. Reading is a bit time-consuming sometimes, but it's worth it.",
    "Great class that really makes you think in subjects we don't usually explore at Yale.",
    "Philosophy of Religion tackles some really interesting questions. If you're interested in reading a lot about some complex topics in religion, this is a great class. I was frustrated by the amount of memorization that was required; I think I expected to spend more time on our own interpretations rather than on memorizing the arguments of other philosophers. Professor Hare is a great lecturer, but his quizzes are very difficult. I think I went into this class not quite clear on the structure, and that was frustrating. However, I think it could be very enjoyable for someone who wants to study the tradition of religious philosophy, and who isn't afraid of a course where they have to learn a lot of specific facts and be able to repeat them back.",
    "This is a great class for anyone interested in rigorously engaging with the questions of religion in a philosophical environment. Non-philosophers could engage with the discipline in areas that have immediate importance which could make things more interesting for someone without that general taste. The class addresses some of the most important questions possible and does so with a variety of readings that present really powerful ideas. This class makes people of all different religious backgrounds think and reexamine their assumptions. I would pretty much recommend this to anyone with an open mind.",
    "I took this class after having finished DS, and loved it. It's still a survey course, but it is more focused than DS, and it puts philosophers like Anselm in context, shows a side of Hume that doesn't get explored in DS philosophy, and has readings from lots of other philosophers who DS doesn't get around to. (Obviously you don't have to have taken DS to take this class--Hare doesn't assume any prior knowledge, and I get the impression that the class is very accessible as your first course in philosophy.) Professor Hare is wonderful--he is the most clear lecturer I've ever had, and his lectures are very enjoyable. The workload is reasonable: 2 short papers, a few quizzes, and a final. I highly recommend this course!",
    "This is an awesome course. Very good for both philosophy majors and non-majors. A rigorous approach to a good range of important topics. I highly recommend this class.",
    "This class is a great solid class. Professor Hare is really enthusiastic and the lectures are organized really well. I enjoyed this class a lot! Stephen Ogden was an amazing TA, too. The readings were short and many, and we discussed them very well. Thumbs up for this class!",
    "Take this class if you want to, it's pretty interesting. It's grounded in the Western Tradition, there were only like one or two readings on Hinduism and Buddhism and not really any mention of any tradition from the non-Abrahamic tradition. Still, a great way to wrap your mind around some of the hard questions in religion. I took it Credit\/D\/Fail but maybe you should take it for a letter grade, since then you would be motivated to do all the readings, which are actually super helpful and interesting.",
    "Interesting class even if you don't have background in philosophy"
