   "comments": [
    "This is a good class (which you are presumably only taking if you are some sort of physics-esque major). The way Skiba taught it, you'll need to know multivariable calculus going in, and have some basic understanding of how differential equations work. Some basic linear algebra is also useful. You can certainly get by without having taken one of the linear algebra or differential equations courses, as long as you read up on the relevant topics as they come up. Problem sets were not onerous at all: 4-5 hours a week, in most cases.",
    "If you can handle the work then its definitely worth taking since you really learn a lot.",
    "This is an advanced physics course covering nearly all of classical mechanics and some special topics--relativity and chaos theory. Professor Skiba is a wonderful instructor and makes every effort to liven up a subject that, quite frankly, is rather dry. His lectures are thorough and provide a good working knowledge of the material. Furthermore, he is very helpful in office hours and will always stay late to answer questions whether they're specifically about the material or physics in general. The problem sets are honestly constructed at the perfect level in terms of workload and depth. Some weeks take longer than others, but I'd say I never spent more than 15 hours in a week, and for a course of this level, that's about what one should expect. The exams are more conceptual than the problem sets, as expected. When preparing for them, do not worry so much about the mathematical details; know the concepts cold. This semester we used Taylor's book. In my opinion, it's a great book, but I feel the class could have benefited from supplementing it with a slightly more advanced textbook. Goldstein is probably a bit too advanced for some people in the course, so my suggestion would be Landau. I used it in addition to Taylor for certain topics and it was immensely helpful. One last note: on the Saturday before the final exam, Professor Skiba held a last-minute review session in Bass Library at 8:45 PM. He stayed until roughly 11:00 PM with us, answering questions and discussing the material. That is true dedication, and I don't think you could ask for much more from a professor.",
    "Mind-broadening experience, but keep up with the work or you'll flop.",
    "Difficult class. You will spend hours upon hours on problem sets. But the problem sets are always filled with interesting problems and the lectures are always entertaining if far up science hill.",
    "Hard, but Skiba's good. Do not take if you struggled in 260\/261.",
    "This class is pretty challenging. The book is really good, but I didn't get that much out of lecture.",
    "Physics 410 is a tough class - the material is covered very quickly and the homework assignments can be difficult. But it is enjoyable and if you're a Physics major or a chem\/math\/engineering major looking for an advanced science class, definitely take it.",
    "Skiba makes this class very entertaining. Exams&homework are challenging but fair, and definitely not diabolical as they have been reputed to be in years past.",
    "A really good course. Difficult, but Skiba was excellent. The material is difficult because it's actual physics--they aren't trying to make something easy difficult. Classical Mechanics is really interesting. A particularly good course to take the fall after PHYS 260.",
    "Comprehensive survey of the topics and methods of mechanics. I would highly recommend this. After this course you will understand mechanics.",
    "This course is a challenge, but it shouldn't be the reason you choose not to be an intensive major. It's a great, interesting course. I learned so much from it. Also, if Skiba's teaching it, definitely take it. He's one of the best physics professors Yale has to offer, and you don't want to miss a chance to learn from him. The psets are not that bad, just don't try to start them the night before their due. They are doable, but they take time. Definitely go to class. Skiba's lectures make the arcane comprehensible. Take this course over 401-it's just as interesting and it opens so many doors for later courses.",
    "Physics 410 offers a introduction to the more formal framework used in Quantum Mechanics, Statistical Mechanics, etc. Some topics are familiar while others are brand new. It can be a challenging course, but problem sets did not take an absurd length of time (compared to the past horror stories of this course). Most of the time spent in this course is spent understanding the material fully - it's particularly important here since everything in this course will show up in future courses. Professor Skiba is the best professor I've had at Yale - intelligent, concise, humorous, and always helpful. He will actually get frustrated if you don't ask enough questions rather than the other way around. If you are interested in the intensive physics major, jump right in.",
    "I have no idea what the other class (401) is like, but this one seemed okay. It didn't feel like a world-shaking revelation of any kind, but we learned some of the major things that weren't covered in the intro classes. I don't feel like we put in enough work to develop our intuition much more, but the homeworks were usually pretty good (not just drills and applications.) Take the time to go through everything on your own, think about it, and come up with serious questions, because otherwise it doesn't feel like you do much (and there are awkward pauses in class when Professor Skiba waits for questions and tries to gauge whether you are bored or can't follow.)",
    "The class is bearably difficult. Whether a student is an intensive or otherwise physics major I would recommend it. Mostly anyone can take something new and interesting from it. I would also recommend the course to a math major interested in physics or an engineering major who'd like to take a physics class with more rigor than the introductory level."
