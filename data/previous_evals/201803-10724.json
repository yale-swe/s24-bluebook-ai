   "comments": [
    "I learned a lot about political science, which I never expected I would say in college.",
    "I learned about the various questions and answers that historical and political thinkers have been grappling through time such as the characteristics of good leadership or the relationship between religion and philosophy.",
    "My writing improved so much.",
    "I developed my essay writing skills and note taking skills.",
    "I learned a lot of valuable background on the basis of politics in society. It was a fascinating course.",
    "This course was the most novel one for me in Directed Studies, as though I studied Literature and Philosophy in high school, I'd never been taught History & Politics before. Therefore, all the texts were new to me and I thoroughly enjoyed exploring questions of citizenship, custom, religion, and the many other themes of the class. I am probably most proud of the improvements I made in writing my papers and of the number of political ideas I was able to grapple with throughout the semester.",
    "I learning how to think about and evaluate texts within their historical and political context within the canon, and the way in which these text speak to the role of the intellectual in a power\/thumos driven society.",
    "Greater understanding of political thought, ways to relate the ancient authors to current political happenings, much clearer writing",
    "I gained knowledge of the major schools of recording history in the ancient world as well as the foundational blocks of political philosophy. More importantly, I gained insight into how to read historical texts (i.e., paying attention to how the historian constructs the events and what their purpose is in recording such events) and how the big thinkers based their models off of pre-existing ones."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Too much reading. But great class discussion.",
    "The strength of this course was the seminar. I always left the classroom with a deeper understanding of the text.",
    "I think one strength of my section was its good discourse and class discussion. However, I also think we would have benefitted by our discussion being less moderated. I came from a school where we didn't have to raise our hands in discussion, and we had to learn how to discuss civilly and not interrupt each other. Such an independent moderation system I think would have enhanced even further our level of engagement with each other.",
    "There was just a ton of reading that was hard to keep up with.",
    "I found, especially as we reached finals period, that I would have benefited from spending more time thinking about the connections and comparisons between the works as we progressed. However, I did learn a great amount in the limited time we had and truly enjoyed getting a sense of the work as a whole as well as closely reading some passages.",
    "Great class overall, no complaints",
    "I thought that the course did a great job at going over a great number of texts in a short amount of time and still imbuing the students with the main points and essentials of the texts. My only gripe is that sometimes the reading was too much to go over in a couple of classes (e.g., City of God) but other than that, I have no complaints."

   "comments": [
    "Yes. You can learn a lot about history through reading sources and seeing how people thought back then. It's surprisingly applicable to current life.",
    "Yes. I loved the way that the class challenged questions that are still relevant today.",
    "Yes. Prof. Smith was amazing and in general Directed Studies has been a great experience.",
    "Yes, this course offers a strong basis in how government and politics play out in society.",
    "Yes - I found classes engaging and I really enjoyed the way my professor ran the classes as well as the energy of the other students. I found everyone interested in the material and excited to discuss it.",
    "Absolutely.",
    "Yes, but only to those who are interested in the subject. It requires a great amount of dedication to plow through the reading with everything else going on but to the naturally inclined, it is engrossing and well worth the amount of work."
