   "comments": [
    "Only take this if you have to. Probably better than math 115, but still a giant pain and a hard class. Taught to the smartest student, this class skips the basics and goes straight to thinking you already understand things. Rolf is nice, but his lectures can get really confusing and scattered at times.",
    "I would, and have recommended Math 118 to several of my friends, because as far as math classes go I found it enjoyable.",
    "Take it if you have to for your major. Other than that, boring and useless. Mostly matrices and barely any multivariable on the exams.",
    "Yes it was a solid class that I learned a lot from.",
    "Half linear algebra, half multivariate calculus. Good for Econ majors.",
    "It's mandatory for econ majors, but if you have a choice try to take it with Rolf. He makes it pretty fun for a 9am math course.",
    "Good introduction to linear algebra and multivariate calculus. Very engaging.",
    "Math 118 is a good balance of linear algebra and multivariable calculus. The material is sequenced so the topics build upon each other throughout the semester. Professor Rolf is a great professor, especially for a 9am class - he is very energetic, enthusiastic, and always willing to help his students.",
    "I would recommend math 118 to someone who is very interested in majoring in econ and who wants to understand more than what the textbooks in econ teach them.",
    "Math 118 is a great math class to take if you are an Econ major and are not looking to go to graduate school so you don't want to take Math 120 (multi) and Math 222 (lin alg). It is early but I highly suggest you go to every class and make an effort to pay attention. You will learn a lot and (I have heard from upperclassmen) that it helps in Econometrics.",
    "I would recommend Math 118 for a fellow student. It is a hard but good introduction to math skills important for students considering higher level econ.",
    "Good intro to linear algebra and multi variable",
    "I'd recommend 118 to anyone considering the econ major that isn't a huge fan of math. For the most part it gives you the tools you need for the intermediate econ courses, although there were quite a few times where I found lectures or pset problems to be completely unrelated to anything in economics.",
    "I would recommend Math 118 if you are planning on taking a class that requires this kind of knowledge, such as intermediate micro. If not, I would recommend taking a gut QR.",
    "Highly recommended. The material is interesting, the professor is great, the problem sets and exams are manageable."
