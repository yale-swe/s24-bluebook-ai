    "After taking FREN125, I feel I have a good domain over the basics of French. I can already understand some podcasts, articulate a simple essay, understand articles and communicate. French In Action is a truly immersive experience that exposes you to French culture and allows you to learn a lot in a short amount of time. I loved the course and Madame Sherak is incredible!",
    "I learned to write, read and speak French up to and including L2 in just one semester. I feel confident in my ability to hold simple conversations in French and to read everyday texts.",
    "You definitely get to make basic conversation by the end of this course",
    "Great class! Wonderful, caring and committed professor. Felt like I learned so much and had a remarkably fun time doing it!",
    "Learned more French than I could imagine in the beginning of the term.It's unbelievable!",
    "This class is amazing. Although I had a little bit of French experience prior to enrolling, that only made a difference for perhaps a few weeks. Leaving this course, I'm able to talk about films, food, culture, and education systems, all with relative ease. If you want to speak French--I mean, really *speak* it--take this class."

   "comments": [
    "Sometimes, I felt there could be more instructions on the use of the Course Package. A lot of the pages in my CP were left in blank (especially those for the first half of the term).",
    "The strength of the course is that you learn French by listening and speaking first, therefore learning and enforcing language skills that are often the most difficult to attain. The course is also extremely interactive and fun and so is the material.",
    "The material may seem a little dated but then what you learn is definitely still useful!",
    "I personally would have liked even more speaking practice, but overall it was a really strong and well-rounded course--practiced all language skills and gained confidence.",
    "This is probably the best class I ever took at Yale.",
    "At times I wish we'd spoken less \"off the script\", but to an extent I enjoyed that aspect in that you learn situational language skills while strengthening key vocab and grammar structures. Otherwise the course has been great."

    "If you do have a genuine interest in the language, FREN125 is a perfect option. It does require you to put a lot of effort and time, but you will learn a lot and Madame Sherak is an amazing instructor. She truly cares about all her students and will do everything in her reach to support you.",
    "Absolutely! To anybody wanting to learn French: this is the class for you. I had my doubts before starting about the time commitment but in hindsight it was extremely manageable. Professor Sherak is an amazing teacher and person and she makes class such a fun experience that I did not dread going to class a single day. The class is really satisfying because you can see and feel rapid progress in real-time, and after one semester I feel like I really have a solid grasp on elementary and part of intermediate french. Yes, the class is a time commitment but it is 100% worth it!",
    "Absolutely recommend if you want an intense introduction to French which is quite comprehensive.",
    "Definitely recommend. If you want to learn basic French and learn it quickly and with a great professor, TAKE THIS! Thoroughly enjoyed the experience. I found it to be a lot of work, but also definitely manageable. 11 hours of class a week, 2 hours of homework every other day-ish. But the kind of work that is easy to do--I enjoy the problem set feel. A lot of the reviews say to only take two other classes with this, but I actually disagree- I found 3 other classes (as long as they aren't incredibly hard or have lots of consistent weekly work as well) to make for a great semester. You get used to waking up and being \"on\" every morning, and class goes by way way faster than a regular seminar. Madame Sherak is also wonderful. A little goofy sometimes, but in the most lovely way!",
    "Absolutely take this course if you want to learn French fast. It is not as hard as it seems!",
    "If you're looking to take 125 then you've got a specific type of experience in mind already, and this course will absolutely meet and exceed those expectations. It's a lot of work for a lot of reward and it's extremely well done. Madame Sherak is fantastic.",
    "Yes, please take this course. It's so awesome. Be prepared to do a bit of work, but all the same, a vaut la peine, alors! :)"
