    "This course provided an overview of the discipline of palaeoecology through a series of case studies organized by topic. Thus, I have developed numerous insights that potentially enable me to independently explore further those topics that are relevant for my research. The course also included three sessions aimed at developing actual research skills (stats, database use), although these are introductory in nature."

    "I think more of a lecture component would be helpful.",
    "Strengths: overview of a diverse discipline, informal and relaxed setting. Weaknesses: case studies tend to focus on a limited range of topics, not enough conceptual background. Possible improvements: more variety in the choice of case studies, more conceptual introductions.",
    "I think 30 minutes of lecture per week to either prepare us for the next week's readings or reinforce that week's topic would have been valuable. As it was, the discussions were valuable and most of the student questions were good for summarizing the important parts of each paper."
