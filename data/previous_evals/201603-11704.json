    "I have a great handle on the subjunctive tenses, a better vocabulary, and a better grasp of common phrases. A solid course.",
    "Made greater improvements to my Spanish skills, both writing and speaking, than I originally expected.",
    "I greatly developed my Spanish language skills.",
    "I improved my Spanish by learning not only grammar and vocabulary, but also conversational skills.",
    "I have developed spanish speaking skills because of Professor Reymundi.",
    "I took the Spanish placement test having taken 6 years of fairly intense (honors) Spanish classes, including AP (which I got a 4 on). I felt that for me L3 Spanish was more of a review than actually learning new material, so I was slightly disappointed I couldn't have moved into a higher level to be challenged a bit more.",
    "My grammar really improved in this course. I feel pretty confident using different verb tenses in the appropriate context.",
    "Much of the course was a repeat of L2, so it was much easier. Focused on learning different verb tenses, especially in the subjunctive. Worked on speaking in partners most of the time.",
    "I learned a variety of Spanish grammar and had a lot of practice speaking the language with my peers."

   "comments": [
    "The online homework often didn't allow enough leeway for mistakes. For example, a lowercase letter, a missing comma, whatever, resulting in an unfairly low grade on individual assignments. Daily homework were super helpful, as was in-class discussion. Lissette is a wonderful woman who is lenient and speaks very clearly. I wish she would've correct students' pronunciation in class more, some were pretty rough and could've used some pressure in the right direction.",
    "Course is extremely organized and this was very helpful. I knew exactly what I had to do and when to do it. This made studying easy and the whole learning process a very steady improvement.",
    "This course was very good at continuously teaching Spanish, although the course materials are very expensive.",
    "The expectations of how to achieve a good grade should be more clearly stated.",
    "A few of the readings we did included offensive costumes to Native Americans, which were uncomfortable to read and speak about.",
    "As a course, Spanish L3 is a very well organized and straight forward, and a lot of content was filled into the semester. I don't see how it could be improved much, although I had a friend in a different section, and her teacher was significantly more lenient in grading. I also felt that there were varying degrees of background in the subject, so everyone seemed to be on a different \"playing field\".",
    "I think the organization of this course and the material difficulty and pace were its strengths. I also liked how we did readings to supplement what we learned in class.",
    "Strengths: The course didn't have too much work, even though you have some homework every day. Classes were fun and engaging- we began each day by watching a music video in spanish. We read interesting stories and watched cool videos. Weaknesses: not as many opportunities for speaking in front of the class as in L2.",
    "The course covers a wide range of Spanish grammar and requires students to speak the language frequently in class. I would have liked to learn more about Spanish culture and current events even though the course did include some of this."

   "comments": [
    "Yes!",
    "Although all L3 courses follow the same material, Professor Reymundi was knowledgeable, kind, and was skilled at explaining things in a way everyone could understand. Overall, I gained a much great knowledge of grammar, and became more conversational.",
    "Taking L3 allowed me to become much more comfortable with the language and I felt that I was able to organize and distinguish the different tenses and vocabulary much better, making speaking an easier and less mentally challenging process. Workload is a daily and constant flow of information, but I did not find it that overwhelming. If you kept up with the class then you would perform well. I recommend taking it.",
    "This course is a great way to learn spanish",
    "I would definitely recommend you take L3 if you took Spanish in high school, but didn't take an especially rigorous track. Having taken honors and AP, I felt this class was a little too easy, but it was still a great course in general.",
    "I would recommend this course if you are interested in Spanish! Profesora Reymundi is wonderful and so so nice. She speaks clearly and has a good sense of humor.",
    "If you are interested in improving your Spanish grammar, speaking and writing abilities, this is a good course to take."
