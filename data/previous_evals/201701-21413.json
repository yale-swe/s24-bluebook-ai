   "comments": [
    "This course wonderfully situates the Irish Literary Revival in its historic moment, allowing for a deep exploration of the texts with regard to the contemporaneous political environment.",
    "Critical engagement with the texts, and better understanding of the Irish history behind the Irish Revival period. There is a lot of work for the course, including weekly questions and reading responses, a large midterm paper, and a massive final paper. Be prepared to make this one of your primary courses or it will be overload.",
    "I learned a wide array of valuable historical and biographical information about the major figures of Irish literature between ~1890 and 1950, developing the context through which their works can be most accurately read.",
    "I came away with a greater appreciation for historicist readings of literature. I am not sure if I agree completely, but I feel I have a much better understanding of such arguments to engage with them on a critical level.",
    "I learned a lot more about the canon of Irish literature, the syllabus explores many of its nuances and is fascinating.",
    "I developed the skills of reading text thoroughly and considering it within the social context it was written.",
    "I developed a great knowledge of the trajectory of Irish literature, which I found fascinating. In addition, I learned to be precise in my analysis of the course texts.",
    "This is an excellent course on the Irish Literary revival. Cleary does an excellent job picking texts and ordering them in a meaningful way so that discussion can build meaningfully -- deepening as the semester continues. Cleary does not assume his students have a grasp on Irish history and politics, a good thing as it is quite complicated. Cleary always gives excellent introductions to class, allowing for everyone to focus in and start thinking about some ideas before class opens into general discussion. Fun and creative, Cleary leads the class with an enthusiasm that is contagious."

   "comments": [
    "Really a wonderful course that allows for both discussion and learning about the historic moment. Each class began with a small background lecture by Professor Cleary on the author or political moment which really enriched the discussion of the work and close reading that followed.",
    "Professor Clearys chief topic of interest in the course was the effect of colonial domination on the Irish literary scene and the various methods that Irish writers used to establish themselves in a world of letters that (unfairly) derided their aesthetic traditions as rustic and coarse. Each class would typically begin with a roughly 20-minute mini-lecture that would root a particular author in his\/her historical context. This was then followed by a more general roundtable discussion. The Professors interpretive approach, informed by post-colonial theorists like Edward Said, Pascale Casanova, and Declan Kiberd, was dramatically different from the more traditional (that is to say conservative) theories favored by the rest of the Yale English department. The flip side of this approach, however, was that the comprehensive discussions oriented around the greater post-colonial themes of the course were always more stimulating than our attempts at close reading -- which was never Professor Cleary's chief concern. But all this is rather inconsequential: If there's one thing that we get too much of in Yale English classes, it's purposeless close reading. Overall, the class was an exceptionally valuable experience that exposed me to new ideas that many of my other English courses have either skirted over or ignored entirely. I cant think of a more stimulating or important class to recommend.",
    "There is so much fascinating history during the Irish Revival. Professor Cleary is a great storyteller so it was actually enjoyable listening to him lecture about the Irish writers' backgrounds. The writers themselves are incredibly influential and skilled, so their works were engaging and informative reads. However, the class did get tiring by the end. It was a lot of work preparing the reading responses every week, not to mention reading the assignments (a book a week), and there was always this pressure to say something smart and accurate (as judged by the professor) to assert yourself in the class. If you're not up for the challenge, I wouldn't recommend.",
    "The syllabus is incredible. Perhaps more can be done with Yeats; maybe a two week bloc of his work in sequence would help us better understand that protean master. I felt as though he eluded me in a way that the other figures didn't. Perhaps that's just how he is.",
    "While the course itself has really engaging material, it was difficult as a seminar style class because the texts were often very difficult-- in some ways I feel it might have worked better as a lecture.",
    "There weren't really any weaknesses. It was a strong, wonderful class.",
    "This is a great course, although I am not sure I would recommend it to non-English majors. The workload is pretty heavy and Cleary expects a lot in terms of analysis, which I think is difficult to someone not used to those techniques. If considering the course as a nonmajor, I would recommend taking it Credit\/D\/Fail so as to enjoy the material without worrying too much about the requirements. I think a good balance was struck between discussion and lecture in the classes, although the biweekly questions were a little inconvenient at times and sometimes felt a little unwarranted."

    "I would recommend on the condition that it's not an all-English-major seminar again.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course! It affords the chance to read some of the great works with a professor whose knowledge, both literary and historical, and kindness are unmatched. A must take!",
    "Wholeheartedly.",
    "I would recommend this course but with a few caveats: it attracts the type of English majors who enjoy using terms like \"postcolonial literary modernism\" and who compete with their classmates to impress the professor with their (limited) knowledge of Irish literature. It involves a massive workload, with reading the texts, coming up with reading responses to suffice the demands of the professor, and coming to class prepared to stand your ground if challenged. If you're fascinated by the Irish revival and are willing to put in the workload this course requires, you will learn a lot, but you may be turned off by the massive amount of mental energy this course will require.",
    "Highly recommended for the amazing syllabus, hugely helpful historical and biographical context, and the teaching styles of the inimitable Prof. Joe Cleary, with whom this course must be taken at all costs.",
    "Absolutely, Irish Revival is one of the classes I am most glad I took at Yale. The readings are excellent, and Professor Cleary is a professor everyone should have at least once.",
    "If your interested in Irish lit, definitely, but be wary-- Prof. Cleary is super passionate about the material, but extremely demanding-- even if you work hard, prepare to have your papers ripped apart. Go in expecting a lot of work, but if you're interested in the subject, it's worth it.",
    "Absolutely!",
    "This is a great course, although I am not sure I would recommend it to non-English majors.
