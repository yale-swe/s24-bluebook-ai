    "I gained a better understanding of how economics works with individual actors. I also inproved my general mathematic skills in preparation for later classes in economics.",
    "I developed basic knowledge of microeconomics, including the skill of reading and drawing economic graphs. I also gained important insights into the economics of public policy.",
    "I had always naturally strayed away from Economics from fear of numbers and a disinterest in the subject. In this class, Tolga introduced me to the various implications of economic ideas outside of the economic market. I learned to think rationally and critically.I believe that these are skills that I can use in whatever I do in life."

   "comments": [
    "Weakness: did not spend as much time as we could have talking about econ, and rushed through content as a result",
    "The biggest strength of this course is the instructor because he genuinely shows interest in his students, seeks to teach more than just economics, and is patient with students' questions. A weakness of this course is that often it was difficult to connect in-class materials to problem sets. Perhaps doing more practice problems during class will facilitate better application of knowledge in homework.",
    "A strength of the class would be the actual classes because Tolga is an engaging teacher. A weakness, in my perspective, is the distribution of the grading. Having the entire weight of the grade be on the midterm and final made the class infinitely more stressful.",
    "The seminar setting was great and the biggest strength of the course is of course Tolga. Rather than slide-filled lectures, he goes through every lesson thoroughly and slows down as necessary. The only suggestion I have is spending more time on the math portions and specifically solving more examples in class (for more thorough notes for use on p-sets). Tolga makes himself available for assistance more than most any other professor I've had."

    "no, i would not reccomend 108, but i'd reccomend the lecture or seminar",
    "I would highly recommend this course for anybody, since economics is so widely applicable in all fields. Especially for students interested in public policy as I am, there is much to learn from this course.",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone who fears taking Economics. I also believe that this is an important class for anyone to take, even if your career does not directly connect to the subject because you learn skills that will guide you in everything you do.",
    "Yes, the gives you an understanding and introduction into microeconomics.",
    "Yes, absolutely. 108 or 110 is by far the best way to take introductory economics at Yale."
