    "It's a great course if this is the kind of material you are into. If you aren't strong in computer science (for instance, coming from a music background), you may find the workload to be a little taxing. It's a very normal CS workload, though (slightly easier than many cs classes, in fact).",
    "Yes. Take any class that is taught by professor Hudak :)Seriously though, Haskell is really really worth knowing. It will change the way you think.",
    "CS432 is about really interesting subject matter, but I didn't like the way it was taught. There was little-to-no documentation on the stuff we were doing (although that might change by the next time the course is taught), as we were using our professor's (unfinished) textbook as our main resource. Quickly we started using photocopied chapters from a book on an entirely different language than the one we used for sound processing. Overall, I was really lost and had no idea what I was doing for the most part.",
    "If you are deeply interested in computer music from the music end of things, then this course will appeal to you. You will learn how to assemble the building blocks of computer music to create new and interesting synthetic sounds. That is the fun part.This is a course that gives a very, very high-level overview of how to make sound with a computer. You will learn using Euterpea and you will write your code in Haskell. The course is very high-level -- there is almost no focus on implementation of Euterpea but just on how to use it to create sound.If you are looking to really understand how reverbs, equalizers, etc. work, thisis not the class for you. Even though you will implement these things, you will not learn why they work. In other words, there is little attention paid to underlying math.You will probably come out of the class learning HOW to make music with a computer, but not with a deep understanding of WHY the things you're doing work.",
    "I would take it if you like computer music. Not as much language concepts, really this is a class on generating computer music that happens to be in Haskell. It will probably improve the more years it is taught."
