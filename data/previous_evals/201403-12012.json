    "If you find the topics on the syllabus interesting, please do take this course; Professor Boorman is one of the pioneers in the field, however please be advised his lecturing style may not be for everybody.",
    "A fantastic course if you are interested in grand strategy or sociology in combination with computing. The first half of the course is very technical and can be more suitable to people with computer logistic experience.",
    "I think it is a pretty fun class. Your grade is determined by your final, so you need to stay on top of the material (or mega cram during reading week--not recommended!). Or you can take it Credit\/D because it's pretty interesting, and you don't have to worry so much about the final.",
    "Computers, Networks, and Society was one of my favorite classes of my semester. Professor Boorman is the best professor I have ever had. He is always willing to answer any question that a student may have whether it be during or after class. The class material was both accessible and interesting. Professor Boorman made sure to explain all technical material in a clear and concise way. The biggest strength of this class is that he applied all broad topics of the class to applicable areas of society. The class used the 4 principles of computing as outlined by Professor Boorman as a solid framework and foundation for the class, which was used as a launching point for all technical material and general concepts. Overall, this was a great class, and I would recommend it to everyone. Professor Boorman was an amazing professor. It was clear that he truly cared about his students and how they performed in his class. It was a lecture style class with the same number of students as a seminar (9 students). This format allowed us to listen to what Professor Boorman had the say while also being able to ask questions at any time. I definitely plan to take more classes with Professor Boorman.",
