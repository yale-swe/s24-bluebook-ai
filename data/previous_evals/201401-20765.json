   "comments": [
    "If you want to become fluent in Chinese you have to take this course. Just be prepared to work extremely hard.",
    "Definitely take this course! Chinese is a lot of work, but I don't regret continuing at all.",
    "You should absolutely take it, if you have any interest in learning the language, I believe this year really helped me make the jump from being able to converse to conversational",
    "I would recommend the class to anyone looking to vastly improve their chinese.",
    "Yes, I would recommend it. If you want to continue learning Chinese and have space for it in your schedule, it's a solid class.",
    "Chinese 151 is a continuation of 150 in most ways. There are a few more things you must do this semester (including a fun final presentation) but it is about the same workload: 3 quizzes a week, 2 Tests, 2 Oral Tests, 1 Individual presentation, 1 group presentation. It is a great course and should be taken by anyone who wants to continue their L5 learning.",
    "Chinese L5 2nd semester. It's a huge time commitment. It's very similar to the 1st semester, but the T\/F questions on the quizzes are harder and more ambiguous. Lots of C's and D's on my quizzes this semester, just because I missed one T\/F question and a few tones. Also there's a lot more Traditional character work. Each week you have to read a traditional paragraph and answer T\/F at the end. very tedious.",
    "If you're looking into taking CHNS 151, by this point you know exactly what you're in for. It follows the same format as 150, with three quizzes, one essay (either a draft or a final version), and one online homework assignment per week. The material covered, especially at the end of the course, is arguably more useful than that of 150, because it covers more frequently used words and structures, especially media-related vocabulary and grammar structures. Both teachers are fantastic and truly care about their students. Having five days of class per week can get to be a lot to handle at points, but it's ultimately helpful in the long run if you're invested in becoming fluent in Chinese.",
    "The best Chinese class that could be taken in the United States. We are very blessed at Yale with such an incredible Chinese department. I would like to sincerely thank the professors for their tremendous effort in teaching us so very well. Thank you so much."
