   "comments": [
    "You must take this class.",
    "Great class. Minimal work outside of class\/rehearsal, but really illuminating and awesome for music majors and non-music majors alike. Grant is a really great guy and clearly passionate about early music, a field I (a non-music major) knew very little about before the class. Take this!!! Awesome fifth credit (or fourth). HIGHLY recommend.",
    "Yes, this course provides a unique opportunity to learn and perform music from very specific time periods. Baroque music is tremendously challenging to sing, but also very beautiful. Because the class is performance-based, it may become stressful if you are assigned solos. Otherwise, classes are just like rehearsals and can be very relaxing.",
    "Highly recommend it! You'll get to learn about early music and have a lot of fun. Take it if you can!",
    "Basically rehearsal once a week with little work outside of class; take it if you are interested in early music. There was one short paper, an ornamentation exercise, and a short test at the end of the semester. Grant is a great guy and an excellent musician.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. It is a great introduction to performing early music, and at the end of the course you feel so accomplished, having made some great music for a great audience at the Beinecke.",
    "An easy class. Sometimes it is better than other times because of who takes it. It all depends on how good of musicians everyone else in the class are. Grant is a nice guy but sometimes disorganized, and things only fall into place at the end of the semester. Try it out and see--likely to get an A unless you just don't show up. Can retake for credit.",
    "MUSI 223 is a lot of fun, and not much work at all (it helps to be able to learn music in a reasonable timeframe). Definitely try to take the class in a semester like this one, where there is only one performance. If there are two performances, there is not enough to do any deeper learning of style\/historical context\/ornamentation etc, since so much time is devoted to learning music.",
    "COLLEGIUM IS A LIFE SAVER! This course is fun and educational! This year, for the first time, we had to write a paper and take a final, but it still was a no-sweat situation. As usual, concert and rehearsal is the primary focus and is totally fun, but again, there will always be singers who don't practice and bring us all down (stop doing that! if you have a solo, actually preparing it would be nice). Seriously, if you have any inclinations towards early music, check out Music 223!",
    "Great course! Grant is a boss. Very little work. That said, there is now a final exam and a paper which were not there before, but these are very manageable. It's a shame that there is an exam now but it's not a big deal and it does do well to coalesce what you've learned.",
    "Take it, even if your sight-reading skills are a little shabby. The work is, as rumored, minimal, but it's a lot of fun, and you do learn quite a bit about the historical and musical background of the pieces you're singing.",
    "Fun, low-key little course. Basically a choir with course credit attached. I do recommend it.",
    "This course is wonderful! Grant Herreid is incredibly knowledgeable, and ou get to learn about a period and its music both experientially and academically. I can't recommend it highly enough. Herreid's enthusiasm is contagious, the music is beautiful, and the history is fascinating.",
    "Studying renaissance music and performing it in an ensemble. I would recommend the course, especially to students who are not necessarily going to major in music but would like musical experience."
