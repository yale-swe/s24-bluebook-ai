    "Essential micro content.",
    "Consumer optimum, labor supply, consumption over time, monopoly, etc.",
    "How to answer a lot of economic questions by relying on economic theory and the steps that need to occur along the way when thinking about a question.",
    "microeconomics theory",
    "1) important basic concepts in consumer theory such as preferences and utility functions, utility maximization, duality of the consumer's problem i.e. expenditure minimization, Hicksian and Slutsky substitution effects and demands, Slutsky equation, consumer's problem with endowment (labor supply, intertemporal consumption) 2) important basic concepts in theory of the firm such as production function, cost function, monopolies, price discrimination 3) using these concepts to analyse diverse applied cases, which could serve as a basis for policy recommendations 4) new insight that I especially appreciated: hyperbolic discounting",
    "The course was highly interactive which helped us learn from other's doubts .",
    "Extensive coverage of income versus substitution effects in various contexts. Basic ideas for social program evaluation with respect to cost and welfare changes.",
    "I learned about how individuals and firms make decisions under different constraints and what are the strengths, weaknesses and cost effectiveness of different ways of compensation.",
    "subject knowledge",
    "Methods in microeconomics, especially in context of developing economics",
    "This course provides a deep-dive into Microeconomic Analysis from the consumer's and the firm's perspective.",
    "Microeconomics was really helpful in understanding Applied Economics in its true essence. It was an insightful experience where I got to learn the application of the models and relate to real-world situations.",
    "Microeconomic insights of various important microeconomics concepts",
    "Fundamental understanding of microeconomic concepts, right from axioms to applications."

   "question_id": "GS403",
   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Questions asked in the exams were way too tough, for the amount of practice\/material covered in lectures - need to adjust this to cater to everyone's learning ability\/starting point. Poor management of time - spent way too much time on earlier material and speeds up towards the end, felt like I wasn't able to learn the content well after midterms.",
    "This was an excellent course, I don't know how it could be improved.",
    "Strengths 1) great structure of syllabus; sequence of topics arranged so as to build on knowledge previously taught 2) teaching the axioms on preferences\/utility function in great depth 3) teaching the theoretical concepts always with a perspective on their relevance to policy 4) providing great examples from applied work 5) room for discussions and questions Weaknesses 1) timing: in my view, a little more time could have been spent on theory of the firm and a little less on consumer theory",
    "The course is fair and as easy\/hard you would expect a micro course to be at the graduate level. The material was not always the most interesting, and it felt very rushed at the end. The HW and midterms were fair, however the final exam was harder than anything we had dealt with in the class before. Professor Boozer is engaging and helpful, even when the material itself was not.",
    "The most significant weakness was the unnecessarily thorough coverage of Debreu's axioms at the beginning of the course. We spent multiple weeks discussing axioms that could have been covered in one or two class periods. Because of the extensive coverage we could only briefly discuss topics such as monopolies and had to completely skip rural labor markets and oligopolies.",
    "Mike explains this class with the best examples. I will always remember Uncle Peter, Cheerios and BMWs. Expenditure function is not something easy to understand at first glance but Mike made these abstract ideas crystal clear.",
    "This is a rigorous course that encourages original thinking, more problem sets would be helpful as well.",
    "This course is a good mixture of mathematical rigor and economic intuition. Problem sets are not just mathematical examples of what we have learned, but truly try to connect the material to real-world problems, which I really appreciated. I do wish that there was more rigor concerning the readings, and a clearer guidance for the TA what mathematical concepts to teach in sessions, so that the class could have moved a little faster.",
    "Strengths - Very engaging, especially the part about food subsidy programs Weakness - the part about Monopoly could be more insightful and detailed.",
    "Strengths-level of application questions related to real world issues",
    "Strengths: covered some topics in great detail, making me realise that the concepts I thought I understood, I didn't have full perspective. It was an eye opener in a good way Weaknesses: some topics were covered in haste, and understandably so, but i would have liked it more if they could be covered as well as other topics"

   "comments": [
    "No",
    "Be prepared to work hard, but so long as you do you'll get everything out of it that you should and will be well equipped.",
    "Yes. It is a good opportunity to study microeconomics theory.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to another student. The course is a great opportunity to deepen one's knowledge in microeconomic theory, since the theoretical concepts are taught in great detail, while at the same time providing examples for their applications, especially in the problem sets, which were challenging but also rewarding in terms of knowledge. The course is also great because it leaves room for fruitful discussions from which one can learn a lot of different perspectives and ways of thinking about specific topics.",
    "Yes",
    "I would recommend this course if you have taken previous courses in micro and it is required for your degree. The course is a graduate level micro economics course, and so there really aren't any surprises to its difficulty\/time consuming.",
    "Other than the coverage of social program evaluation, I don't see how this course would benefit students outside the IDE program. Since this course is required for IDE students, I would not recommend this course to anyone considering it as an elective.",
    "Definitely yes. I love the class style of take time to explain important concepts clear ans deep over rush through everything regardless of students' confusion. This is one of the classes that I can confidently say I learned a lot better here than anywhere else.",
    "yes sure",
    "Yes, this course is very helpful for my understanding of graduate level of economics",
    "Yes, for a student wanting to understand the true nature of Applied Economics, this course is perfect.",
    "yes",
    "For sure!"
