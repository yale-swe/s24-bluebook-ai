   "comments": [
    "Pretty straightforward math class, starts with linear algebra and moves to multivariable. Miki is a good teacher and couldn't be nicer, although class itself is pretty boring. Linear algebra textbook is hard to read but multivariable one is much easier. Weekly psets (10%, can drop one), 2 midterms (25% each), and a final (40%).",
    "Great course. I came in without knowledge of linear or multivariable, and barely remembering single-variable calculus. I feel pretty confident now, and the tie-ins with economics are cool. Take it if you are feeling math-rusty. Miki goes very quickly, and she's clearly a genius, but you will understand her if you just pay attention and follow along. ANd if you don't, the textbooks are pretty helpful when it comes time for the homework.",
    "Basically a great course for those who want some math background but don't want to major in math. You'll see a lot of econ majors and people like them. This is a real gem of a course, covering the highlights of multivariable and linear, while giving you a good basic foundation in each. My only advice would be to stay focused on the class. I did well on the first midterm, got complacent and then bombed the second one. No fault of the class, just mine for not studying enough.",
    "if you're not math inclined and are taking math to fulfill a requirement, this is a good class",
    "Yes. If you took Calc BC in high school and want a good math class that isn't terrible, I would recommend this.",
    "YES!",
    "Decent amount of work, tests are decent, grading is pretty standard",
    "If people tell you that you need this level of math for intermediate micro, they lie. I would recommend it as the perfect math class to satisfy the major's math requirement, but it's not necessary if you've already taken another math class.",
    "I would recommend MATH 118. You learn a lot of important concepts in linear algebra and multivariable calculus. Miki is a great instructor. She's engaging, extremely kind, approachable, and eager to help in any way she can. The workload is pretty consistent and exams are fair.",
    "This class is very difficult. Miki is a great teacher, but if you do not have exposure to multivariable calculus or linear algebra, a lot of the concepts will be very difficult to grasp. Do not take this class as an easy alternative to Math 120. The curve is harder because the class is filled with gunner freshmen econ majors. If you really like math and you're good at visualizing things like 3D graphs and vector spaces, then you should be fine. I'm not good at that, so I struggled a lot. In retrospect, I should've taken 120.",
    "Only take this class if you need to for your major or if you are really into math. It's not a fun class by any means, but it is a really great overview of linear algebra and calculus. It is isn't that difficult but I wouldn't take it unless I needed to.",
    "Not very hard, but a lot of math knowledge.",
    "I would definitely recommend 118, but beware that the material can be difficult at times. The problem sets are not too long, and the tests are not too bad (even though the final was significantly more difficult than the midterms). The class is really great for getting a strong basis in multivariable math and is not nearly as intensive as 120.",
    "It's the math for economics majors and with Miki, it isn't too bad. I think I might even miss it. Her tests are straightforward and fair and yes, I would recommend this class. Even if you want a QR class, you should take it.",
    "Absolutely take Math 118 if you need to take a math course or are a social science\/econ major. It's really not too hard at all, and Miki is wonderful. I came into this course with modest expectations, but ended up really enjoying it, especially the linear algebra.",
    "A good class to take if you need to get your math credit out of the way for the economics major, without retaking the calc ab\/bc equivalents.",
    "Fantastic course that is useful for econ majors. It moves at a fast pace, but gives a pretty comprehensive summary of linear algebra and an introduction to the multivariable calculus you need as an econ major. Miki is a great professor who is brilliant but still very personable. Take this course if you are serious about econ but don't want to be a math& econ major.",
    "This is a pretty decent math class. There is a lot of extra help if you need it and the TFs and the professor are very knowledgeable.",
    "If you're looking to just finish out the math requirement of the Econ major, I would recommend this class. It's much easier than 115 and better taught.",
    "I took this class as a non econ major and really enjoyed the content. I wish I went to class more often (it was at 9am) but I enjoyed learning it on my own nonetheless",
    "Math 118 (also known as the Econ Math) is a good one semester introduction to key topics in Linear Algebra and Multivariable Calculus. If you plan to go further in your Math studies at Yale (or to go to Grad School for Econ), definitely take Math 120 + Linear Algebra instead (the course barely covers the first third of Multi). You will find yourself doing A LOT of Linear Algebra, and a little bit of Multi (roughly 2\/3 of the semester are focused on LinAlg, and the reston Multi). Textbooks are good, though problem sets based off Strang's Linear Algebra can be confusing at times because of the textbook's verbiage. Definitely take this class with Miki - she is the best math instructor I have ever had, and she was extremely helpful both in- and outside the classroom. The examples given during class are very pertinent, and if you're having any difficulties understanding anything, GO TO HER OFFICE HOURS! Plus, Miki is hilarious, and probably one of the best Math professors at Yale. Overall, a very solid Math class at Yale!",
    "Yes if you're an Econ major.",
    "Miki was great! Overall the class was very good. Lectures were clear and helpful. She also offered tons of office hours, review sessions, and other ways to get help. The review sessions before each final were life savers. The 2 midterms and final exam were fair. It was a good class.",
    "I would recommend this class to another student because it's a really useful math course and the practicality of the course is apparent.",
    "It's a good balance between linear algebra and calculus. Math 118 is a great course for students who need a course in higher-level Math but don't want to put themselves through the suffering that is Math 120 (really difficult Math that doesn't have much applications, except for solving hard equations).",
    "Intro to linear algebra and multivariable which satisfies Econ requirement.",
    "If you want a basic footing in linear algebra and multivariable calculus, take it! If you're looking to major in something math intensive, you might the course to be a bit shallow. Though out of no fault of the professor, the course itself is designed that way."
