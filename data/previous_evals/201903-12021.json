   "comments": [
    "An overview of the major methods and theoretical discussions in the field during the last century, which often led to a more wider discussion about other fields in humanities as well.",
    "I became familiar with the broad sweep of art historical thought as it has developed in Europe and America. I was also able each week to think critically about how these ideas may or may not be relevant for my own future work.",
    "Baseline knowledge of important art historical texts. Although they dont directly relate to my field, it was a helpful course in understanding these texts, as well as how to critique them. Format of the class with short essays due every week was also very helpful.",
    "I learned to engage with difficult foundational theory texts on a much deeper level & to discuss these texts with my colleagues. As the course progressed the importance of reading \"dead white men\" became clearer and clearer - to dismantle and challenge these texts necessitates grasping their arguments! I am very glad to have had this course.",
    "I developed a sense of the historiography of the discipline of art history through the course. I also have a stronger sense of the foundational authors and texts of the discipline of art history.",
    "In taking Prof. Suthor's course, I gained an introduction to the ideas of a great many scholars (central to the history of art history, among other areas of study) and began to specify my own disciplinary views as an art historian.",
    "I developed helpful insight into the historiography of art history, as well as a diversity of approaches to the discipline. I also really appreciated the exercise of writing weekly responses, which pushed me to clarify my understanding of some quite difficult material."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The course was very good organized and the reading assignments for each session always reflected on different aspects of the discussed method, thus supplied us with a broad perspective. The weekly responses were an excellent tool that helped consolidating the knowledge and focus the readings.",
    "More authors of color, especially women of color.",
    "I thought that the texts chosen for this class were largely very interesting and I liked the variety of writing styles - from the orderly Germans to the difficult yet tantalizing French, and especially Krauss's Picasso semiotics text. I certainly would have liked to see more women on the syllabus - the Krauss and the Bal were two of my favorite texts, and I'm sure that there are more female theorists with much to offer! I also think it would be useful to gage at the beginning of each class which texts for the week felt most useful\/interesting and to discuss those mostly. I was disappointed that the psychoanalysis week discussion did not include Bal, as I enjoyed reading the text very much.",
    "A strength of the course was Professor Suthor's attention to the structuring of assignments. The 3 page response papers supported retention of the material, through synthesis and close engagement with the texts immediately after reading them, which was much appreciated. This format, rather than a final paper regarding Methods, kept students engaged with the material throughout the course. Initiating class by going around the room and each providing perspective was also a useful pedagogical tool, as it helped everyone feel comfortable speaking, and provided jumping off points for the seminars. Having classes in YUAG was appreciated, although the ways in which we engaged the artworks was not particularly imaginative or interesting. Sitting in a half-circle around an object we only discuss for 15 minutes did not feel like the optimal strategy for engaging the museum context. Perhaps starting class for an hour+ in the seminar room, which was much more comfortable and set up for discussion, then walking over to discuss an object for the last 20-30 minutes of class, could be an alternative method. A weakness was that the texts centered European \/ white \/ male perspectives throughout, without much attention or engagement with this as the frame, until students prompted this. I appreciated Professor Suthor's interest in engaging the individual interests of students with particular texts, which she mentioned often. That said, it felt as if only specific student's interests and research were being tailored to, which had others feeling left out of the individualized syllabus. More texts from feminist perspectives, Black Studies, and more would have supported the relevance of the course for future directions of the discipline of Art History. Though it was appreciated that Postcolonial Studies was given a week in the class, having the theme be for the final week of class felt like an addendum and postscript, especially after Thanksgiving Break, and did not allow students to engage the material as thoughtfully as hoped. Perhaps a final week \"wrap up\" to digest the material would be preferable, with Postcolonial Studies earlier in the semester.",
    "A particular strength of Prof. Suthor's version of Methods was the structure of our written assignments. Instead of composing a lengthy essay at the end of term, my peers and I were asked to submit three-page reflections each week that summarized and critiqued the readings we most recently discussed in class. In my experience, these responses provided a wonderful outlet to synthesize disparate meditations and check my understanding of truly complex material. This said, I think that our discussions in class could have been structured and directed more systematically, especially when we met in YUAG. I wish that, in these cases, the art we sat in front of could have been more prominently incorporated into the fabric of our conversation.",
    "I enjoyed getting to know other first-year students through this course. It was fascinating to hear people's perspectives from week to week. I appreciated the variety and diversity of theories, though I think it would have been useful to talk more specifically about how these theories would be\/have been used as methods, and how effective or ineffective they might be. Perhaps incorporating art history \"case studies\" to supplement some of the more abstract writings would be useful."

   "comments": [
    "Of course, this class is required for all first-year students, BUT I would \"recommend\" it in the sense that I would encourage students to approach the course with an open mind and a recognition that these texts are still vitally important today, whether reading postcolonial theory that draws on Lacan or simply wanting to intelligently and strongly challenge old modes of thought.",
    "The course is a requirement of the History of Art major. (I was surprised and compelled by one student from outside of the Department's interest in takign the course.) The conversations occurring within the Department about the Methods requirement will hopefully shift some of the stakes and texts included in the class.",
    "Yes. It's a very good opportunity to be exposed to a range of concepts and methods, even if they don't all resonate with you."
