   "comments": [
    "Yes, 100%. Take this course. The readings are so great!",
    "Definitely recommend it to any history student, even if one has no initial interest in medicine of public health.",
    "I would describe this semester's edition of the course as concerning the history of American public health. I would recommend this course to another student because it is interesting, engaging, and comprehensive.",
    "Yes! A great course!",
    "Absolutely take it ... if this subject is of interest, the books in the seminar and the discussions that take place around them are informative and enlightening.",
    "HIST 930 is a great introduction to the history of medicine and public health, particularly from the perspective of cultural and social history. While texts focused on the United States, many of the issues we discussed were\/are transnational or have applications in other contexts. The mix of history students and public health students also made for really interesting discussions.",
    "A series of discussions on the writing of the history of medicine and public health, as well as the history itself.",
    "Yes I would recommend the class to another student. Of course it depends on his\/her interest, but the readings are so interesting, that I would hesitate to not recommend the class to anyone with less than a passing interest in medical history!",
    "Yes I would advice it, it's a great overview of the recent literature in history of medicine and public health, very interesting seminar",
    "This course offers an excellent introduction to any graduate student seeking to write a history of medicine or public health. It is best intended to analyze the craft of such works in relation to the historiography. It may not be appropriate for all students in the public health program."

   "comments": [
    "I became more familiar with the historiography of HSHM and learned more about the craft of history more generally.",
    "This course introduced me to the history of science and medicine, and I was happy to delve deeper into this field.",
    "This course will be very helpful for me. The only thing that would have made it more helpful is if the instructor went a bit further in telling us what was most important about the books we were reading. But this is very minor - overall the course was fantastic!",
    "I am a public health student, but the history of medicine is always incredibly relevant to this field and it gave me a new prospective on how we approach diseases. Also wonderful insight on framing written works like dissertations.",
    "I found this to be a good introduction to a field of history that will likely be the central field for my dissertation project.",
    "The historical context was absolutely invaluable to a person who studies public health.",
    "Absolutely essential. The class contributed immensely to my research interests and I would not be where I am now without it! It has greatly deepened my interest in the field and I am so happy that I took this class.",
    "It was necessary for my studies as a general overview",
    "This course offered several works with leads into approaches and\/or topics that I might consider for my dissertation. In general, it allowed me to identify several model approaches in both writing style and creative methodology that I might hope to adopt in my own work."
