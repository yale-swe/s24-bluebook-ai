    "We explored the fascinating historical phenomenon of turn-of-the-twentieth-century Cabaret in Europe. From an artistic perspective, we focused on the modernisms of these various cabarets, particularly their attention to small-form performance\/visual art. We also surveyed modern performance art venues and practices that carry on this legacy a hundred years later. As a Theater Studies major, this class was incredibly valuable; so much of the focus in the major is on traditional modes of theater-making. This class pushed the boundaries of my creativity when it comes to what can be viable in performance.",
    "I learned about attitudes towards the creation of art from the turn of the century until the beginning of World War II. I learned about the philosophies behind different European cabarets, and I also learned about the history of political satire. I improved my ability to read texts from that time period, and I know have a new lens through which I can view and interpret art.",
    "We learned about the history and defining traits of the Cabaret, and all the artistic movements and evolutions of form that accompanied it.",
    "Overview of history of musical and theatrical traditions of European cabaret, with a particular focus on early 20th century German cabaret. Course materials included secondary historical texts, listening assignments, plays, films, and performance theory. Second half of the class primarily comprised of creating an original collaborative performance piece informed by readings from the first half of the course.",
    "Vast amount of historical information about the beginnings and development of cabaret as an art form and how cabaret has inspired and manifested itself into artistic venues today.",
    "This course was a great exercise in thinking about individual works as part of larger cultural trends and movements. I feel like I developed a strong working definition of modernism, often the vaguest of labels, that will be useful in thinking about 20th century art and literature going forward. I was also introduced to various approaches to cabaretesque theater-making which raised a lot of interesting questions about collaboration, commerce, and politics in making art that I will be mulling over for a long time to come.",
    "An overall knowledge of the history and impact of the cabaret tradition in art and how it affects art today.",
    "Knowledge concerning the history and influence of Cabaret and Modernism at the turn of the 19th century."

   "comments": [
    "strengths: Lynda Paul is a TERRIFIC professor, the seminar-style discussions were among the best I've had at Yale, and the performance at the end of the class was such a cool learning experience. weaknesses: really only one, and that it sometimes felt the class was a little \"over-stuffed.\" By this I mean that the syllabus was sometimes a bit ambitious and trying to do a lot of different things at once. On the \"depth\" to \"breadth\" continuum, perhaps future iterations of this course might benefit by tilting a little more towards \"depth.\"",
    "This class was nothing like I thought it would be, which is actually a great thing! I loved this class, and I learned so much about the impetus behind the creation of art and how to interpret new art. I think the reading assignments were all super interesting, and I loved creating our own cabaret at the end. However, at some points the class was a little stressful because so much was packed in. If it had a slightly narrower focus, some of the most interesting material would probably be eliminated but overall the class might be a little more enjoyable in the moment. However, I really loved the class in its current form!",
    "While I found some of the historical readings a bit dense, I understand them as a necessary evil for learning the material. I loved how we got to really engage with the artistic movements we were discussing. The guest speakers later in the semester were great. Some more structure to working out the final performance might have been helpful, but everything wound up working out and our performance wound up being a wonderful experience, so I'm not sure if it's really necessary.",
    "Strengths: extremely engaged and knowledgeable professor (Lynda is wonderful!), small class size, fascinating course material, varied assignments kept class interesting but still felt related enough to maintain class organization and contribute to overarching class goals communicated in the syllabus, GREAT guest speakers including the artistic directors of the YSD Yale Cabaret, fun and supportive classroom environment. Weaknesses: workload is quite heavy in the first half of the course and unevenly front-loaded, midterm is also quite memorization-heavy which is somewhat unexpected in a seminar of this size, but it's graded fairly and only around 25% of the grade. Other than that, no major weaknesses!",
    "Strengths: Interesting readings, lots of freedom in class discussion, creative opportunities Weaknesses: So much reading, not enough in class rehearsal time",
    "I didn't mind the heaving reading load at the beginning of the course and found the material useful but I found myself wishing that the distribution of reading had tended more towards cabaret theater and music and less towards description of the shows. Obviously, we can't see the performances, but I would have enjoyed analyzing more primary sources if they were available. I also would have liked to have spent a bit longer on the performance side of the class. I would have loved to put together more original material based on cabaret principles but ended up feeling too rushed \/ not put together enough to do a more ambitious project for the final performance. I think some of the reading, though really interesting, could have been cut or shortened to make room for this (Nadja, the modernist poets - but I'm biased as I'd worked with that material before, the Rachilde which was kind of redundant with the Maeterlinck, and watching The Threepenny Opera which was a bit redundant with having read the Brecht, even though I'm glad I finally watched it). Overall though, I really enjoyed the scope of this course, which turned a seemingly limited subject matter into something huge. I found this to be a fantastic way of approaching questions of theater-making I'd never considered before, and modernist art in general. I loved the hands-on activities we did, especially in the Dada unit (there honestly could have been more of this), and our class discussions consistently left me with a greater understanding of the material. Combining history\/scholarship with performance was different from other literature courses I've taken and a refreshing approach to the material.",
    "I loved the performance aspect of the class, and the discussions we had in class were very interesting. However, I think the amount of reading could be greatly reduced."

   "comments": [
    "Please take this course! Especially if you are a Theater Studies major. It will broaden your horizons and get you to think about theater more creatively and historically.",
    "If you are an artist who is interested in creating new and avant garde art, this class is made for you. Cabarets were homes to new and unusual theatre and music and dance, and there is a lot to be learned from their rise and decline. The material is super interesting, and will definitely change the way you look at art. Also, Lynda is a great professor, and you should definitely take a class with her!",
    "Yes -- Cabaret is not only interesting to analyze artistically, but is also situated in a fascinating point in history. The class really takes a look at how art and politics\/society meet and interact with one another. There's a lot to this movement, so I highly recommend this course to anyone interested in art and\/or history.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student, whether they are a THST\/MUSI major or just looking for a fascinating 4th or 5th class. Lynda is so passionate about the course material and has thoughtfully curated a great and varied syllabus. The performance aspect of the class was different than anything I've ever done at Yale and was so collaborative and creatively inspiring -- it made want to take more performance courses!",
    "Yes - if they had interest in cabaret, developing art in small forms.",
    "Be warned that the reading load at the beginning of the course is pretty heavy so make sure your workload can accommodate this, but the course material is super interesting, so if you have the time it's worth it. The scope of this course ends up being really broad - covering everything from the relationship between politics and art to a range of artistic movements. The approach is practical, always with the question of how does this relate to how we make art\/theater today. The combination of theory and practice is unusual and refreshing and both sides of the course illuminate one another. Prof. Paul is wonderful and makes discussions a delight.",
    "Yes, definitely, if you're interested in the subject at all and learning how to devise your own performance."
