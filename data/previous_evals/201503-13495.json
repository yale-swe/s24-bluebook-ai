   "comments": [
    "Strengths: - great professor - important material that is very relevant to healthcare - interesting class overall Weaknesses: - not many Overall, I thought the course was excellent.",
    "Gooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooood! But two many charts and lines in class, better to have more practical cases and examples as we are not suppose to specialize in economics.",
    "Great course. Like the application of theories into healthcare cases",
    "I loved this course. I learned so much, the professor was great, the TAs were great, the powerpoints were great. Having the course 2x a week would be more helpful. This was my favorite class this semester. What I learned was extremely tangible.",
    "Fascinating material, great instruction, good in class practice",
    "Very introduction to microecon. If more information provided to healthcare related would be better",
    "The instructor made the information useful and interesting. I've learned several practical things and find myself using econ terms in my everyday language now. The tests were hard.",
    "Overall, the class gives a good foundation for economics. It's structured well and Abby is very knowledgable. The tests, although they reflected the material, were much harder than the problem sets we were given, which felt a little unfair. The notes would be pretty simple, but then the tests would ask questions that were two levels beyond the notes. I know Abby tried to make it straightforward, but her teaching style doesn't really reflect the difficulty of the exams.",
    "strength: the slides weakness: it is definitely better if you have taken some kind of economics course before taking this class because you will be more confident",
    "The course topics were consistent, clear and interesting!",
    "I thought this was a strong introduction to the basics of microeconomics, and a great deeper dive into the application of microeconomic principles to the healthcare sector. The course did a good job of highlighting the market failures that exist in healthcare and what reasonable responses to them could be.",
    "The class was an excellent and thorough overview of econ in a health context. It was a lot to fit into one semester, but it was extremely comprehensive, enjoyable, and relevant.",
    "The course was great. I learned a lot, and the both the professor and the TA (Mike) were available to answer questions. Although the TA section was not mandatory, unlike the sections for other classes, I went to every one because it was so helpful. Our professor, Abby, is very knowledgeable, and fostered a great learning environment, even with a larger class. She is friendly and approachable, and I especially liked how she designed the class to connect with real world policy making decisions. Although I was at first apprehensive when I realized her class was required for my track, it turned out to be my favorite class of the semester. Surprisingly, I actually enjoyed the coursework, and did not feel like it was a chore to do. Strength: I liked that we had quizzes between each exam, which helped with the study load for each upcoming exam. Weakness: The class would be even better if the class size was smaller to ensure everyone followed along with the lecture with questions. Did not like that the 2nd quiz was the Monday after Halloween!",
    "This course is a good introduction to microecon. I think the slides are overall very good. It would be good when the point of reference changes (like when we are thinking about a social optimum vs. a private equilibrium) it would be good to label that better on the diagram.",
    "Overall, I really loved this course. The material was great, the professor was amazing, and I feel much more prepared to handle advanced business courses. Very, very happy.",
    "I learned a lot from this course, way more than expected.",
    "Extremely useful",
    "I absolutely loved Dr. Friedman's course. Although I had taken a survey to economics course before, I felt that she framed the topics in an applicable and useful way without being reductive. We tackled complex topics around the irregularities of the health care market, and I used the skills and terms I learned in her course throughout so many of my others this semester. Her class changed the way I look at decision making and gave me a whole new appreciation for the role of economics in health policy.",
    "I loved that the content had so much context in terms of current events as well as theoretical",
    "The course provides an excellent introduction to microeconomics, covering all the topics that are needed to understand how policymakers and managers approach problems from an economist's lens. Would like some required assignments to encourage engagement. Glad that there were no pop quizzes.",
    "Good as a course, taught really badly",
    "The course is a good intro to Econ. Sometimes the lectures are overwhelming however.",
    "Good, applied health concepts throughout semester, which I appreciated.",
    "Strengths: comprehensive course on microeconomic theory. Professor makes the material interesting and relevant. I truly enjoyed the course. Weaknesses: Having the class on a Monday and section on Tuesday\/Wednesday is too condensed for students to complete the assignments in time. Would be better with more spacing in between lecture and section.",
    "Great course to have, essential to understand microeconomics in public health.",
    "Good survey course for students with little\/no background in microecon. Professor Abby is very thoughtful, intentional and patient. I enjoyed the pace of the course, the examples that the professor used, the funny\/helpful videos, the problem sets and even the textbook.",
    "Awesome! Although some students may suggest revising the participation grading, I think any change would disrupt the fluidity of Abby's lectures.",
    "A lot of book reading because lectures can be confusing. Not sure why some of the classes were devoted to role playing UN or companies and negotiating...",
    "This course was great!!! I learned quite a bit of information related to economics and healthcare. This course does move very quick and focuses on a lot of information at one time but this was hands down my favourite course this semester.",
    "This course was excellent. Topics for each week were clearly laid out, the lectures were fantastic and very clear, and the homework assignments were comprehensive and provided deeper understanding of the material being covered. This is a very well designed and executed class that provided all the necessary tools to learn what we were supposed to learn.",
    "Good",
    "I think I would benefit from 2 lectures rather than 1 long lecture per week. Also I wished the section was less Q&A and more structured."

    "Instructor: Abigail Friedman \u00a0Awesome instructor",
    "Instructor: Abigail Friedman \u00a0Best professor I've encountered at Yale. She's engaging, culturally sensitive, and knowledgable. I looked forward to going to class. Her lectures are well thought out.",
    "Instructor: Abigail Friedman \u00a0Abby is fantastic! she is a very effective instructor and tries to present material in multiple ways",
    "Instructor: Abigail Friedman \u00a0Need some practical example to support much of conceptual idea",
    "Instructor: Abigail Friedman \u00a0She was interactive, interesting and used the information in a useful and fun way",

    "Instructor: Abigail Friedman \u00a0Excellent, engaging professor, I actually looked forward to this class every week.",
    "Instructor: Abigail Friedman \u00a0strength: her slides lay out everything really well (on the whole), she makes herself available to help weakness: talks really fast",
    "Instructor: Abigail Friedman \u00a0Professor Friedman is a great instructor who cares her students. If she can talk slower during the class, students would have a easier time understand the material.",
    "Instructor: Abigail Friedman \u00a0Strengths: -Great at prioritizing that we understand intuition of economic principles. This was a fantastic and practical way to learn econ for the first time. -Good at providing examples and practice problems to learn the concepts. -Appreciated videos and references to current events to help make concepts more tangible. -Sensitivity to equity issues across the board was strong and much appreciated.",
    "Instructor: Abigail Friedman \u00a0Abby was great--it's obvious how passionate she is about the material, and that makes the class even better. She made concepts easier to understand by using real life examples, and she created a comfortable environment that allowed for discussion about the concepts.",
    "Instructor: Abigail Friedman \u00a0Please see Question 6. The professor is great!!! Wish she taught more classes.",
    "Instructor: Abigail Friedman \u00a0Professor Friedman is a very good professor who incorporates games and video clips in a way that is actually useful. I would also encourage her to make announcements in class and then follow them up online. I know that I missed one class for dental surgery, and went to office hours as I was instructed to when I let her know the week before that I would miss class. When I got to her office, and was waiting outside a closed door, another professor walked out an informed me she was at a conference.",
    "Instructor: Abigail Friedman \u00a0The professor is fantastic. Very engaged with her students, and made the material very understandable. I would love to take another course with the same professor in the future.",
    "Instructor: Abigail Friedman \u00a0She is fabulous and I learned so much from her. She could talk a little more slowly, at times she was difficult to follow, a lot of students recorded her because they had the same issue. But she is a wonderful professor, all the same.",
    "Instructor: Abigail Friedman \u00a0Abby is very enthusiastic and applies the material wonderfully. Moreover, I appreciate in lecture the multitude of explanations she has for a concept ensuring that if I don't understand it one way, I'll understand it another. The homework and quizzes are challenging but the exams are fair.",
    "Instructor: Abigail Friedman \u00a0Professor Friedman is an excellent instructor. She explains concepts very clearly and engages the whole class in her lectures. She truly made the course very interesting and thought provoking by including real life examples and cases. One of the best professors I've taken a course with, I loved her course.",
    "Instructor: Abigail Friedman \u00a0Excellent",
    "Instructor: Abigail Friedman \u00a0Echoing what was said above, I think Abby was an absolutely phenomenal instructor. She gave us real problems to solve and answered complex questions with ease. I felt like she really wanted to prepare us for the working world and used Economics as a tool to do so. I really liked her use of practice problems outside of the classroom to make certain concepts clearer and I also appreciated that she took some time in class to work problems with us. The lectures were always interesting and challenging, and it was truly my favorite course this semester.",
    "Instructor: Abigail Friedman \u00a0The professor was great at engaging the students and made it fun for us",
    "Instructor: Abigail Friedman \u00a0Abby was my favorite professor this semester. She's passionate about her work and has a wealth of knowledge that she's eager to share with her students. She makes the material relatable and is attentive to her students' needs. She's fantastic!",
    "Instructor: Abigail Friedman \u00a0She has good intentions but execution is bad. Too many slides in a lecture to go over such that I learnt more going over them alone at home than in class. So whats the point of going to class? No graded homework is terrible because if you cannot make office hours you will never get time to actually get feedback.",
    "Instructor: Abigail Friedman \u00a0Very smart however the lectures are overwhelming because there is a lot of material crammed into one lecture .",
    "Instructor: Abigail Friedman \u00a0Good professor.",

    "Instructor: Abigail Friedman \u00a0Great professor! Very attuned to students' needs, encouraging, and an excellent lecturer!",
    "Instructor: Abigail Friedman \u00a0Great! One of the best lecturers I've ever seen. Speaks quickly, but if you're not tired\/hungover\/lazy\/absent, then you should be able to follow.",
    "Instructor: Abigail Friedman \u00a0Not sure why some of the classes were devoted to role playing UN or companies and negotiating... Went a little fast on some parts, like externalities. Talks very fast sometimes. It seems that on complicated parts, the words\/second increases.. Very knowledgeable. A little too enthusiastic on trying to elicit class participation.",
    "Instructor: Abigail Friedman \u00a0She is so great! She cares so much about us learning and the material and her energy was very evident with each class.",
    "Instructor: Abigail Friedman \u00a0Dr Friendman was fantastic. She was very knowledgeable, engaging, and provided clear explanations of complicated subject material. She was also great at answering questions in-class. She was very well organized and one of my favorite teachers at Yale.",

    "This course is essential to take in understanding the healthcare industry. I would highly recommend it to another student, no matter what department you are in.",
    "Recommend it",
    "I would recommend this course to everyone. Showing up to class and going to section are the most useful things.",
    "The textbook is great",

    "if you work hard, you will get it and you will feel great about it especially if it is your first econ course ever.",
    "Yes, recommend. Good learning experience.",
    "I waived this course and highly encourage anyone who can to waive as many of these core courses as you are able to. There are a lot of great electives at Yale that will give you unique insights on the topics you yourself choose to pursue.",
    "Great course, necessary to continue with your studies, overall very happy with the professor and the material.",
    "It is a very great course and I went from knowing nothing in econ, to knowing so much.",
    "Awesome! You'll learn a lot and find yourself deconstructing your surroundings\/other concepts using microeconomics by the end of the course.",
    "The course is very broad and touches on so many subjects in healthcare economics. It gives a very good background to anyone hoping to continue in the field. I think it's a necessary course for anyone at the graduate level. The course material was heavy but the professor makes it very interesting and beneficial. It's very rewarding to learn about economic theory that can be applied!",
    "Very nice overall",
    "I exempted this class.",
    "This course is something everyone studying health policy should take. In fact, I would say that it is useful for any sort of decision making. It isn't overtly difficult and if you keep up with the work, it will really help you understand healthcare more broadly.",
    "some exam questions were not fair. for example, one question was testing more of your quadratic equation capabilities instead of the concepts.",
    "Course is very good. Make sure to have time to dedicate to understanding material outside the classroom",
    "Required course.",
    "Highly recommend",
    "challenging but vert useful to learn.",
    "Very pragmatic relation of core economic theory and its relationship to health policy and practice...better than I could have expected, really. Definitely recommend for anyone who actually wants to shift the paradigm in human welfare and needs a crash-course in fundamental economic theory.",
    "If you took an econ course before, just reread the book and don't take this class. If you don't have any econ experience, take this class.",
    "Worth the credit",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to other students. It provided an excellent introduction to how economics influence the health care system in many different ways (e.g. financially, socially, behaviorally, etc...). I would recommend this course to anyone regardless of concentration. The course was very well organized, workload was very reasonable, and grading was fair.",
