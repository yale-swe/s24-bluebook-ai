   "comments": [
    "This isn't the survey of French culture you may be expecting, but it's certainly one you'll enjoy. Progressing, over the course of the semester, through topics ranging from immigration and racism to marriage and women's rights, 160 manages to give you insight into the issues at the heart of contemporary french culture without forcing you to do much work. Weekly forum postings under 100 words, a few vocab exercises and reading responses, and half-hour readings for each class are really all you have to worry about. The exams are only moderately difficult, and the hardest part is memorizing 40 vocab words to use in the essay questions. The movies (which are fantastic and come with each new topic) are usually subtitled. If you have a solid base in the language (which 150 will give you), then you'll be fine and able to enjoy the new words and understandings the course can give you.",
    "I would definitely recommend French 160 to students who want to strenghten their French skills, speaking especially but also reading and writing. The class focuses on contemporary topics of French culture and history; so it has more practical approach to the language than other advanced classes, like Fren170.",
    "French 160, as the name would suggest, is pretty much a class where you have conversations about various aspects of French culture, from the education system to the European Union. Grading is mostly homework, tests (two essays, usually, in which you have to use a certain amount of vocab words), orals (~25 or so minutes of speaking), and participation in class. If you aren't really comfortable with French, this will NOT be an easy class -- being good at 150 does not necessarily translate into success in 160, since 160 is more about comfort with the language than being really good with grammatical minutiae. I would recommend French 160 to another student if they are very comfortable speaking and writing French, want a ton of practice, and want to learn more about French society (because you really will get a better understanding of a lot of different parts of French life).",
    "I would recommend this course to students who want to engage in regular discussions in French about a variety of current political and societal issues AND who want to do so in a classroom context, that is to say with correction by a professor. However, this class is not really appropriate for students who just want to maintain their French level by practicing it every now and then. In this case, they should rather consider searching for a Franco-English language tandem partner.",
    "I would highly recommend the course. Great way to improve mastery of French language.",
    "I would recommend this class if you want to speak and be able to have complex conversations in French. It's probably no different than you think it will be--it's a pretty standard language class. The movies are great, the readings are interesting. I even enjoyed reading the textbook."
