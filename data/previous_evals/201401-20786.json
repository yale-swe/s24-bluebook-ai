    "Yes, it's the best Chinese elective I've taken so far.",
    "If you are looking to improve both your oral and written Chinese, this is for you. We read many newspaper and popular press articles, but we also do many conversation exercises in class. I would recommend this class.",
    "Yes, definitely. This is one of the best options for high level Chinese at Yale. Zhou Laoshi is the man. It's a decent amount of work, but it's one of those Chinese classes where if you put in the work, you'll get an A. You learn so much useful vocab, speak a lot during class, and learn how to talk eloquently about a lot of the major problems of modern China.",
    "If you're at this level, do it. Don't let your Chinese go to waste.",
    "TAKE this class if you're ready to work and learn!",
    "It's a LOT of work (memorization), but the articles are interesting and your Chinese will definitely improve. I recommend this course, but make sure you have enough time to spend on it."
