    "PSYC 200 is a good introduction class to statistics. You will learn to use SPSS, a statistics program, in a basic manner, and will learn the basis of a number of statistical tests. I have taken statistics before, but learned little, and I think this class does a good job of teaching lasting information. Lectures can be a bit slow sometimes, but going through everything before the midterm and final definitely helps to put it all together, and the class is graded fairly.",
    "Take it.",
    "This class is allergic to math. If you're anywhere near competent with numbers (especially so if you have statistics background), take this. Even if it's a 5th or 6th class, take this for all that's holy if you love your GPA and want to see it rise. Weekly psets (graded on completion), section where you can just screw around on the computer for 50 minutes (or do your psych stats pset for the week), and 2 exams (where the prof is careful not to include *any* calculations whatsoever). There's also a final project but the prof spells out explicitly what to do to get full points. Also, this class has a Piazza that can be used to convince the prof to bend to the students' will (this past semester, students convinced the prof to lower the \"A\" cutoff from 95% to 93%). Basically, this class' grading structure is designed to placate grade-obsessed psych majors who aren't good at math. If you have any mathematical ability, take advantage of this low-work, easy A.",
    "Most people just take it for the QR requirement or because of the Psych major, so if either of those criteria apply to you, yes take the class. Otherwise, your time is probably better spent elsewhere.",
    "I would recommend if want a fun QR credit",
    "Pretty basic stats class.",
    "A generally simple course. If you're interested in going into psychological research, this is a pretty good course because it teaches you how to use SPSS which is a standard in the field.",
    "Good, good.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class since it has a super low workload and was relatively easy.",
    "I would recommend this course to other students! I really liked this course and am happy that I took it.",
    "This is a great class for learning a useful skilld for real world applications. The class isn't necessarily easy, but the instructors and TF's do their best to help you succeed in the class. There were only two exams, and the instructor gave great exam reviews. The course project can be a lot of fun. You can work by yourself or in a team. The weekly homework was not graded harshly, which is nice because it was 1\/3 of your grade. All in all this a great course, with a lighter course load than most Yale classes. Great QR course.",
    "I highly recommend this class as a manageable QR credit for even the most math-averse (i.e. me!) It's not life-changing, but it's useful and interesting to know a bit about statistics. Tests are very straightforward (no computation, just interpreting SPSS output), problem sets are graded for completion, and you can work with a partner on the final project. Jaime Napier is an engaging teacher, so I would recommend attending lecture--but it's not strictly necessary.",
    "This is an excellent choice for a fifth class! The workload is very light and the material is presented in a very accessible manner. 10\/10",
    "This class is a great introduction to statistics and SPSS. It's a very low-key class, with an emphasis on concepts instead of math. I would recommend this class to anyone who wants to take an intro to stats class, but I would warn that it might not be as much of an easy A class as it might seem at first.",
    "If you're a psych major, this class is a requirement. But it's a chill class, and Jamie makes the material as fun to learn as it could be. The exams are very fair, and the final project can be fun if you do it on something you're interested in and\/or with a group. If you already know a fair amount about stats, it will probably be too easy. But if you haven't taken stats before or need a refresher, you'll learn a lot in this course and solidify what you already know. You also learn how to use SPSS, which is a good skill to have! If you go to section (it's required) and review the lecture slides before each exam, you'll do well!",
    "This is a requirement for Psych majors and a relatively easy QR. But be prepared for the weekly Psets, 2 exams and final project. If you didn't keep up with the material throughout the semester it can make these assessments challenging.",
    "If you want to know about stats, definitely take this course!! Very informative and a great intro class.",
    "Take it if you need it or if you want an easy QR. Nice class and not too much brainpower necessary.",
    "PSYC 200 is a great stats class to take if you are not looking for a career in stats, but rather need an intro to it for premed or other reasons. It is not math-based at all, so don't take it thinking it will prepare you for more advanced math-based stats course,",
    "EASY QR (the professor acknowledged this in class!!) and definitely worth taking if it fits your schedule\/requirements. Jaime understands why students are taking the class and makes sure you take away what you need. Exams are easy (EXACTLY like the reviews that she goes over in class), and the final project is easy (get good partners so that it isn't too difficult\/time-consuming). TAKE THIS CLASS!",
    "Super straightforward class. Study the PowerPoints and you are golden. No math required in the class, very conceptual. If you've never taken a stats class Before, this is a soft introduction.",
    "A super easy QR. You learn how to read a scientific paper and understand the result section, but don't expect to have much actual stats knowledge at the end. The concepts are very watered down and every equation had a \"beyond the score of this course\" asterisk next to it",
    "Take it! This is the stats class to take!",
    "Stats is pretty chill. Weekly psets and required section, a midterm, a final, and a final project.",
    "This is a very easy stats class. It's nice to take if you have a heavy semester otherwise as was the case for me.",
    "One of few classes where the final project felt not like a chore but really like a learning experience. It feels great to have left the class with (a very basic) understanding of statistical terms and tests, as well as SPSS. The class was super super easy, and generally low stress. Good choice all around for anyone in need of a QR!",
    "This course served nicely as an intro to introductory stats--key word on intro. Since I never took stats before, I felt like this was a good start to me getting a basic solid fundamental exposure to the field of stats! Though if you already took AP stats, by all means take a more challenging course...I guarantee it that it will move too slowly if you already have precious exposure to it.",
    "Not very engaging, but a very easy QR, even for people who aren't strong in math",
    "Do this if you need a QR, otherwise, it's not the most stimulating.",
    "boring lectures; very basic material; don't take if you don't need",
    "Fairly low workload class with a completion homework policy and fairly easy exams. The final project could require some time and effort, but it's all based on what you choose for your topic. If you are taking stats for a requirement or want to know how it is applied in the world today this is the class for you, but if you want to actually learn about statistics and get a more mathematically-based introduction, then other introductory stats classes may be better.",
    "My roommate and I went to two lectures between the midterm and the final; then we spent three hours studying, and we each got a 98. This is *not* a testament to our intelligence but rather of the extent to which this class was an ACTUAL JOKE.",
    "HIGHLY recommend if you need a statistics course. Very straight forward, good 5th course. Great for pre-meds who need stats and do not want to learn programming.",
    "Psyc 200 is a really fair course. Not the most interesting or engaging, but a great way to fulfill the requirement. For the most part it feels like if you put in the work, it goes a long way.",
    "A fine choice if you're looking for a QR. Professor Napier is accessible and friendly.",
    "Take this class because it is actually useful in the real world!",
    "A painless QR! And you actually learn relevant things like using SPSS and reading stats in papers. Definitely recommend especially if you need that QR credit.",
    "Really easy stats class that used to be easier but remains easy nonetheless. The exams aren't that hard, but they're also not a joke, so if you cram the night before, expect to get a high B, which probably doesn't place you in that great of a place with the rest of the class (since many of them have already taken Stats before in high school). You don't have to do anything at all in section, you just have to show up. If you don't go to lecture all year and don't do anything at all, you can get a B. If you put in a somewhat normal amount of work, should be an A. Overall would recommend though.",
    "If you stay on top of the lectures and do the homework assignments during the week it can be a really easy class. Easier said than done, but all in all, it is quite manageable.",
    "Best Stats class to take at Yale. Super fair, great Professor, easy assignments, exams, etc. And the lectures are actually quite good.",
    "It's an easy QR. There's absolutely no math skill taught or required: you learn how to use a fairly powerful\/useful statistics program, and that's about it. Lecture slides are online, but Prof. Napier is interesting to listen to and makes the lecture useful. Midterm and final pretty easy, weekly p-set short, boring and simple, lab requirement just involved showing up. Final project slightly more arduous, long and by far the most interesting part of the course, but again, it takes a long time, especially as you have to go to the lab or library to use a Yale computer to get access to the program. Fairly interesting, more useful than Geometry of Nature, not a lot of math and doesn't feel like a total waste of time. Best you can do for an easy QR as far as I'm concerned, perfect for a humanities major.",
    "I would summarize it as learning how to use a computer program to evaluate data from psychological studies and what they mean. I would recommend it to another student who was looking to fulfill a QR credit or interested in psychological studies, though others may find it a bit dull.",
    "Take it if you need a QR or have to as a psych major. Quite dull.",
    "This course is a basic stats course. It has two exams and a final project that are not too bad. Take it if you need a stats course.",
    "Take this class if you are a psychology major or if you're just not a math person and need an accessible QR credit. The workload is pretty light, and as long as you pay attention in lecture or just go over her Powerpoint slides you'll do well on the midterm and final exam. This is a good introduction to statistics if you have no previous knowledge and you won't feel overwhelmed learning how to navigate SPSS because Professor Napier and the TFs will walk you through every step.",
    "Great choice for psych majors or people in general that need or want to learn about statistics in the psych field. Not a hard class at all.",
    "I would recommend it as a simple QR.",
    "Psych stats is a pretty easy course but overall very helpful and interesting. Most students take it because they have to but it is also a great fifth class to take. I would recommend it if you want a basic understanding of statistics and don't have the time to devote to the stats into sequence.",
    "Great QR, required for psych major also. Not too challenging but you learn a lot",
    "A good QR, especially if you know nothing about stats, like me. I really liked this course. If you pay attention and put a solid amount of effort in, then you'll do well and learn a lot about stats. Overall, I highly recommend!",
    "This class is very easy if you are a science major. Requires minimal effort really.",
    "It's fine - everyone says it's easy and it is, at times to the point of being boring. The content is whitewashed a lot and learning concepts can be superficial, so if you're genuinely interested in statistics I wouldn't recommend the class.",
    "Good class, learned a surprising amount for something sometimes considered a \"gut\". NOT super easy, challenging enough that people who aren't math people can get a lot out of it (i.e. new way to think about statistics etc) but not be dying over work. If you study for the exams and put effort into the final project you'll do fine.",
    "A good yet not easy introduction to statistics. It necessitates a lot of regular work. Don't study a week before the exam. If you are looking for an interesting QR and are ready to put in the work, then take it.",
    "Not too hard, but very helpful! It is great knowledge to have, and the teach staff is great. For sure take this, whether you need it or not.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class if you need a QR. It's the kind of class that if you put in the effort, you're basically guaranteed a good grade. Plus the material is useful to know and not as difficult to comprehend as in other statistics classes.",
    "Tests and p sets are very reasonable in their expectations. Whether you take the class with Prof S-L or Prof Napier, you can't go wrong. Definitely take this and nothing else if you need an intro stats class (what up, pre-meds). Only tip from my own bad experience: do the final project with a partner who actually does the work.",
    "I would recommend Psych200: Statistics to anyone interested in learning the basic concepts necessary to understand statistics and working with data.",
    "Awesome class. It's obviously a gut, getting a good grade is super easy, but the stuff you learn in class is still pretty interesting. Great way to get a QR, and not at all painful if you're a psych major.",
    "Great QR for the non-QR minded person. Great (and required) class for psych majors. Great for anyone who wants to learn SPSS in a stress-free environment.",
    "I would summarize it as a *very* cursory introduction to applied statistics in the field of social science. I would recommend it if you need an easy QR. However, if you actually want to learn in-depth about the principles of statistics or research techniques, you will be sorely disappointed and bored by this course. I feel like we learned a little about a lot of things, but nothing was covered in-depth.",
    "Take it if you want an easy QR, if you're premed, or if you want to learn some basic stat as a general skill. You'll also learn to use SPSS which is useful.",
    "A good course if you're interested in research or applied statistics.",
    "Easy QR, important info even though its not all that interesting. Good class to take for sure.",
    "Good class for pre-meds, and for understanding basic stats applications.",
    "yes",
    "Only take this course if it is required or if you need a GPA boost.",
    "Well if you are a psychology major or someone looking for a relatively easy QR PSYC 200 is the way to go. Then again if you are a psychology major, then you have to take this course anyway. Take it your freshman year and get it out of the way.",
    "This isn't a gut class, but it is hard to take it seriously. Only take this if you need it for your major.",
    "Know p-values.",
    "Basic introduction to statistics (I think). I was surprised that very little overlapped with AP Stat. Gave a tool set that social science majors can use to analyze data in different ways! Professor said on first day: \"some people say this is an easy class, but it's still very important to know.\" You do have to put some work in, but it is a VERY reasonable, minimal amount. Class is optional; power points are pretty comprehensive. Glad I took it!",
    "Yes I would certainly recommend this class for those looking to better understand statistics.",
    "Yes, reasonably easy Stats course, especially if you want a QR.",
    "Take this class if professor Naiper is teaching. The project is fun at the end, and your own choice. Midterm and final are totally doable if you know the material. Problem sets are really fairly graded and don't take much time to complete. Helpful material for other classes and future careers.",
    "Pretty easy as long as you keep up with the work. Honestly, a really good 5th class that you probably don't have to go to."
