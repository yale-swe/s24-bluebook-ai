   "question_text": "Looking back on this course, what is your overall assessment of the course:  What are its strengths and weaknesses, and in what ways might it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Time of day is very challenging Slides are good",
    "Very useful and fundamental analytic techniques are taught; the instruction could be improved--especially the PowerPoint slides",
    "Important subject that should have the computer lab component as the focus rather than the theory as the focus",
    "This class was an excellent way to apply the biostats skills we acquired from the Intro class and to expand upon our current knowledge.",
    "The powerpoints are so confusing. I still have no idea what I learned. I am still very confused.",
    "I learned a lot.",
    "Strengths: -Very important content in terms of learning statistical tools that exist to better ascertain info on causality in research. -Lab helpful in practicing methods. -Important to offer either SAS or STATA as options for the statistical program! Weaknesses: -Dry lectures, hard to understand theory",
    "This is a relatively dry topic and understandably hard to teach. Overall it was a challenge to sit through. Not the most engaging or entertaining. It's easy to see its application in real life, but it was very difficult to stay engaged during class. The timing does not help with the situation. Cramming all that material into 2 hours is very heavy. The lab is extremely disorganized at first. The school DID NOT count the number of students, and it was very disappointing to see some students turned away because we didn't have enough computers. I personally found this an UNACCEPTABLE situation from YSPH. The professor dealt with it by creating new lab sessions, for which people had to sign up after they had signed up for classes. I think it all worked out, but seeing this kind of disorganization from administration is disheartening.",
    "Really good. I learned a lot, although felt like I only learned the material when studying for each of the two quizzes. I liked this course",
    "I would never take this course except it was required",
    "I think the course is great, but I honestly had no interest in the material. The professor was fantastic, and I honestly think that if I was entering this area of work I would appreciate the material much more. I just honestly do not see how this course is relevant to my future work, and I feel that having people like me in this course dilutes the experience for others. This was a core requirement.",
    "Strengths: - very good foundation in research methods Weaknesses: - The lab TAs were not helpful with the assignments and the SAS code was not explained very well in class so it depended a lot on personal effort to do the assignments.",
    "Good though it would be better if Dr. Chen could find a way to engage the class more during lecture.",
    "Great instructors, TFs, course material, homework, final project.",
    "this is very important course to learn skills for policy analysis. I think the course should be called methods for policy analysis because to me health services research implies a different range of skills. the lectures were not well organized. they were often difficult to follow and understand. labs were unstructured and wastage of time. the SAS coding wasn't that complicated but I didn't understand how to interpret the findings.",
    "Nice introductory lecture to various research methods.",
    "I thought that the course was a good introduction to SAS and how it is used in a policy context. I think that the kinds of tests and scenarios presented in lecture were relevant, but I wish that the lab component had been better integrated into the course. (Such that the code was presented simultaneously with the concepts, instead of in an ad hoc way). I also think having a first lab dedicated to the structure of SAS (variables, data sets, missing obs etc) would have been helpful. The TAs knowledge and familiarity with the program could have been leveraged better.",
    "The course was just not really engaging. Barely anyone came to class, lab hours were run like a mad house with no one being able to do any of the work on their own and basically asking for TA help to walk through every problem. I was really hoping to learn STATA through this course and I definitely didn't accomplish that goal.",
    "Good course, allows you to build on SAS skills. Material was useful for understand how to interpret resarch",
    "Labs were helpful",
    "Strengths: usefulness of skills Weaknesses: it was sometimes difficult to link what we did in the lab with what we did in the classroom. I think it would be helpful to have some sessions, even extra sessions, that went through an entire problem set and explained each answer. It was difficult to understand when all the bits of information were not strung together. An overall look at why we used certain procs would have been helpful. It seems like almost everyone had the same questions during lab, so it would have been more efficient sometimes if everything could be explained to the whole group.",
    "Very useful course if you put in the work",
    "Necessary skills for public health, but delivered in a rather dry manner",
    "Overall, a good course - I definitely came out of it with a greater command of SAS coding language and a better understanding of core research concepts.",
    "very good",
    "Very easy to understand and follow week to week. The labs are a little weird: they suffer from overcrowding and too few TAs to help. Most of the lab is sitting there with a question, waiting 30-45 minutes for the TAs to help a single clueless classmate across the room.",
    "it's a good class. These are things that you should know. But the project was a very rewarding project."

    "Instructor: Xi Chen \u00a0Professor is very passionate and knowledgeable about the topic Cares a lot about the students",
    "Instructor: Xi Chen \u00a0Very helpful but language is sometimes a barrier to understanding concepts taught in class",
    "Instructor: Xi Chen \u00a0No incentive to show up to class. Reads words straight from PPT slides. Great information learned, but poor use of my time",
    "Instructor: Xi Chen \u00a0Really great guy but needs to be more engaging in lecture-- should not be in Winslow!",
    "Instructor: Xi Chen \u00a0Professor Chen is extremely attentive of students' needs and teaches the class with a high level of professionalism and enthusiasm.",
    "Instructor: Xi Chen \u00a0He was nice, and very receptive to feedback and put a lot of time into helping the students. And yet, not very effective in teaching the concepts. I have no idea how to describe how to improve the teaching. But I just know that everyday I wondered what the hell the last 2 hours were about? I wondered why I came to class because I was lost 2 minutes in.",
    "Instructor: Xi Chen \u00a0He was wonderful, I learned a lot! He was available for me to assist me extra outside of class.",
    "Instructor: Xi Chen \u00a0Strengths: -Clearly very skilled and knowledgeable in the area. -Makes an effort to make lectures engaging (with jokes\/cartoons, and also examples) Weaknesses: -The way the theory behind the statistical methods was presented was challenging to follow.",
    "Instructor: Xi Chen \u00a0Professor Chen is a great guy, but his presentation style doesn't work very well for large scale lectures. He has a lot of things working against him, the material isn't the sexiest, it was super late in the day, and it was in a HUGE informal setting. This course needs to change and then I think the reviews of Chen will improve. I appreciated that he listened to feedback about the labs and made a change to better deal with student questions.",
    "Instructor: Xi Chen \u00a0Very helpful and knowledgable",
    "Instructor: Xi Chen \u00a0The best instructor I've met.",
    "Instructor: Xi Chen \u00a0Professor Chen cares about his students. He replies emails super fast and is always available during office hours and for making appointments. His lecture slides are clear and structured very well (concept -> examples -> wrap-ups). I think he is definitely one of the best professors here at YSPH!",
    "Instructor: Xi Chen \u00a0Strengths: Very nice, Very knowledgable Weaknesses: Not able to teach the material in a way that allows students to learn it",
    "Instructor: Xi Chen \u00a0Fantastic professor, really knowledgeable on the material, and an overall great person. He was immensely helpful in his critiques of both my SAS code and on answering questions about the material overall. Definitely one of the nicest professors at YSPH.",
    "Instructor: Xi Chen \u00a0Strengths: - Very friendly and extremely helpful - Covers many topics Weaknesses: - Can explain topics a little more clearly",
    "Instructor: Xi Chen \u00a0Sweet person. Very busy. Can be hard to get a hold of. His voice is kind of monotone. Can be hard to maintain focus during the lecture.",
    "Instructor: Xi Chen \u00a0Maybe less slides?",
    "Instructor: Xi Chen \u00a0Prof. Chen was incredibly responsive to student needs and questions. He made himself available at a moment's notice and was willing to assist with anything. One of the most responsive and helpful professors I've met at Yale.",
    "Instructor: Xi Chen \u00a0the lectures were not well organized. they were often difficult to follow and understand. he was approachable and responsive to questions",
    "Instructor: Xi Chen \u00a0He was approachable, and he usually responses quickly to emails.",
    "Instructor: Xi Chen \u00a0Dr. Chen was very good at giving feedback to students and working with them on their projects at the end of the year. However, I felt like the lectures were very long and presented in a less than accessible way. Though the examples were helpful and the slides thorough, I think Dr. Chen could have spent more time on working examples with us and less time going through the literature.",
    "Instructor: Xi Chen \u00a0Really nice guy and super helpful. Just wish lecture was more engaging. Maybe the auditorium isn't the place to hold this class.",
    "Instructor: Xi Chen \u00a0The professor is knowledgeable and great at being available and answering questions.",
    "Instructor: Xi Chen \u00a0Made significant efforts to teach, however a very unclear professor. Not very good at explaining concepts, sometimes had to go to TAs to understand concepts.",
    "Instructor: Xi Chen \u00a0Professor was always willing to help and was clearly knowledgeable about the material",
    "Instructor: Xi Chen \u00a0Poor lecturer!",
    "Instructor: Xi Chen \u00a0He is very patient and we can really feel his effort in trying to make students understand everything",

    "A required class that's important to take but I didn't get a lot out of it",
    "Fantastic class with important skills for future research\/careers. I would highly recommend it.",
    "Its a requirement. THe most you will learn will be through labs and projects. Don't bother going to class, the lecture is confusing and unhelpful. If this was taught somehow better it would be amazingly helpful in my career. Now I just feel helpless and overwhelmed.",
    "I recommend it to anyone going into the public health field.",
    "You have to take it. its hard to stay focused, but if you do you will be surprised what you learn. focus early and it will make exams easier.",
    "You learn how to apply SAS to answer health services research questions. You also work with a group to explore your own research question. Great exercises. Quizzes were fair and you realize by the end of the semester how much you have learned in the class!",
    "You have to take this course if you are HPM or HCM, so make the most of your group project and pray your get a good group. Otherwise, this already rough class becomes even more rough.",
    "If you are taking this course because you want to, then this course will be great. The professor knows his stuff, and you will get a lot out of it. If you're taking this course because you have to, then you'll still get a lot out of it, but not as much as others. This course will teach you important material that you may use in the future, and is put in a way that you can learn\/work through it.",
    "Yes I would recommend it to all public health students because it teaches invaluable tools and skills that are used when conducting research",
    "Good course if you don't have any background in econometrics. If you have taken another class in econometrics I would waive out. I was scared of this course initially but was glad to see it didn't use any linear algebra. All the math involved is very basic.",
    "Yes, I've learned a tremendous amount!",
    "unfortunately, a poorly taught course but required for health policy. policy analysis is an important skill so I hope the dept improves this course to teach us the skills we need for this field.",
    "You'll use methods from the class in the real paper.",
    "A mandatory intro course, Dr. Chen's course will let you take out what you put into it. The assessments and projects are manageable, but if you want to really learn how to use SAS in the context of this course, you will have to spend considerable time on your own working with code. More rigorous assignments would have made this course more of an asset.",
    "If it wasn't required, I'd definitely skip it.",
    "Expectations are clear and if you follow them you will get a lot out of the class",
    "Course, while not particularly interesting, is very useful.",
    "You will learn the most form the TAs. The PPTs Dr. Chen provides are also really, really useful.",
    "Necessary, just pull through it",
    "Good",
    "The basics of designing and implementing research in a quantitative way.",
    "Take it. The lessons are very good and makes you finally understand research studies with regression analysis. A great continuation of biostats from first semester. If you are good at coding or learning, you don't have to go to lab. Just do the labs on your own time to avoid crowding.",
    "Yes, recommend. Learned a lot, and professor was very prompt in posting the slides needed for the weeks' class, which was great.",
