    "I absolutely recommend Versification both to those who know quite a bit of poetry, and to those with as-yet-undeveloped curiosity. Having a solid grasp of meter and verse is not an insignificant thing. This course will give you the tools to articulate how words move and work. The weekly verse assignments might seem intimidating at first but are extremely manageable, and working in the meters discussed in class is an invaluable exercise. Professor Laurans encourages revisions, and makes herself very available to read and discuss them; she's genuinely committed to literature, and to her students. She's been teaching this course for quite some time, as her husband did before her, and as his teacher did before him, which is a nice thing to know.(Also, her knowledge of poetry and personal encounters with poets are not to be missed. A definite Yale character.) There are courses where the most valuable work you do is done outside of class while section drags, but every class session of Versification was incredibly satisfying.",
    "If you have any desire to improve and expand your appreciation of beauty and poertry this class is a must. You'll learn things you never knew you never knew. If you are terrified because you love poetry but can't write, don't worry about it--by the course's end you'll have something worth showing others, and you NEVER share work publicly.",
    "This is a wonderful class. Take it!",
    "Definitely take it if you're interested in English verse and poetry. It really does give you new tools and skills that you can apply to all future poetry classes (not to mention your future enjoyment of poetry generally), and it even gives you a sense of historical trends in non-English poetry. Perhaps its most amazing part is how it relates the history of English verse to the current practice of poetry.",
    "I'm glad I chose to take this class over the other English writing courses, because it's given me a much, much better grounding in the technicalities of poetry. Of course, the poetry seminars that help you to, in Professor Laurans' words, \"find your voice\" are important too, but if free verse is all that you really know, there's only so far that you can go with your poetry...I just think that this is an excellent basis for any aspiring poet.",
    "Take this class!!!",
    "This class is absolutely fabulous. It was the best class that I've taken at Yale. Unfortunately, it's not offered often, so if you get a chance to take it, DO! It changed the way I look at poetry. I wish prosody was required for English majors.",
    "Amazing, one-of-a-kind class. Take it if you have any interest in poetry whatsoever.",
    "Versification was a fantastic course, and my ability to analyze and appreciate poetry has radically improved over the course of the semester. I highly recommend the course to anyone interested in the subject. Professor Laurans can be a bit disorganized, but her personality, affability, and insight more than compensate. Her personal anecdotes about the poets covered in the course, many of whom she knew, also adds a special flair unknown in virtually every other English class, and a novel way of viewing the poets as people who wrote and not necessarily simply as authors.",
    "A great poetry class. In particular, a great first or second poetry class because you learn the tools and vocabulary that will help you write but really read poetry in the future.Master Laurans is a warm and wonderful person and professor. She knows a lot (things and people--Elizabeth Bishop, Ezra Pound), and she supplemented class with anecdotes and a field trip to meet (stand awkwardly beside and smile at) Seamus Heaney and hear him read at the 92nd Street Y in New York.Be careful writing your scansion paper!",
    "This class is not offered every year. If you can take it, do. It'll be 2.5 hours of happiness a week."
