    "Recommended for anyone interested in Central Asia, China, and Xinjiang in particular.",
    "Learn about the silk road and eliminate the misconceptions you had about it",
    "This is a terrific gem of a course that deserves to be taken by more students. The first (larger) half of the course is a site-based survey along the Silk Road where students will have to critically engage, analyze, and write papers on the primary sources excavated at each site. The material is extremely fascinating; by the end of the course, I was amazed by how much historians can figure out about the past simply by looking at pawn shop receipts and so forth. The second (much smaller) section of the course is a look at modern Xinjiang and its history as it was assimilated under PRC rule. I heavily recommend the course! The workload is very reasonable too.",
    "No",
    "A history of Xinjiang province in China, mostly focused on the early period."
