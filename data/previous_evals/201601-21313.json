    "This class is fine. Lecture is boring and sort of pointless, and the hws are long and tedious for no reason, but the exams are pretty fair.",
    "Do not take unless you have to. A lot of time consuming problems sets and very difficult material that I needed to use books and youtube videos to learn because lectures were confusing.",
    "I would not recommend this class, though most people have to take it for their major. The lectures and confusing and not at all engaging or useful, the psets are excessively lengthy, the exams are difficult, and all the instructors assume that you've taken linear algebra and\/or physics although neither are prerequisites for the class. That being said, it's possible to do okay if you put in a LOT of work (going to every review\/office hours, seeking other resources, poring over the textbook). The exams are somewhat curved, and if you're a freshman (like I am) you're essentially competing with people who have already taken the physics classes and math classes that are assumed to have been taken, although they're not prerequisites! The material itself is not difficult to understand, but the fact that I had to put in hours and hours beyond lecture, psets, and studying to teach myself the material is immensely frustrating. The textbook is also not great. I would recommend supplementing yourself with Pauls Online Math Notes and youtube tutorials of how to do each method. I would've preferred to take the Math equivalents of this class, but those sum to an entire year of class and this is just a semester.",
    "It's a very hard and time-consuming class- only take it if you need it for your major.",
    "ENAS 194 is a very difficult class about topics taught far more efficiently in most electrical engineering classes. It is a lot of work for what I feel to be very little reward. I would not recommend this to another student unless it is required, in which case, best of luck.",
    "Do not take this unless you have to. It's taught horribly and it's not worth trying to learn if you don't have to take it for your major.",
    "The class experience is highly dependent on the professor. Make sure you check course evals for the specific professor before signing your life away for a whole semester.",
    "Just learn it out of the book",
    "If you're taking this course as a requirement, then you'll just have to deal with it. The material will be presented in a less-than-interesting fashion and the problem sets will be merciless. If you're not taking this course as a requirement, I don't recommend it. Just find and read the course textbook to get all you need. That's what the instructor in the course tells you to do anyway; the lectures are just a means of teaching exactly what's in the textbook and nothing more.",
    "If you are an engineer, I'm sorry. Otherwise, for the love of the old gods and the new, take MATH 246. As a non-engineer, I thought this class would be a helpful, practical intro to differential equations, but the problem sets are actually just a nonstop barrage of horrible integration by parts problems. Unless that's your thing for some reason, you better brace yourself or embrace Wolfram Alpha. (To be clear, the material is entirely based in diffeq, so it's not some sadistic review of the worst part of calc--- except a lot of diffeq ends up being solved via integration by parts.) The class is also anti-proof, and some of the equations in the textbook literally pop up out of nowhere like the jumpscares that no one needed.",
    "If you're with Professor Hui Cao, prepare to learn the material by yourself. Prepare for the exam questions to be much more difficult and nuanced than any practice problems you have been provided with. Go to section - lectures tend to be unclear and focused on proofs rather than principles of application that will be relevant in the pset and exam.",
    "The most difficult math class I have taken at Yale so far but very enlightening nonetheless. The midterms are hard but doable if you study. The end of the class is very difficult and you are given very little time to familiarize yourself with that material before the final. But it is a good class and can be quite satisfying at times while a complete headache at others.",
    "You probably have to take this course for your major and there is no getting out of it. But don't take it with Hui Cao. Taking it in the fall or summer may be a better choice. Expect to do a lot of work.",
    "If you are familiar with differential equation and have seen some of this material before I would recommend this class to another student. However, if you are not, this class was not designed to make you comfortable with the material and still maintain a good standing in the class. There was a gap between the people who saw the material before in the class and those who have not. There was also a gap between the material covered in lecture and the material presented in the problem sets and exams. However, this was also the first semester this course was taught with this professor so hopefully with some improvements based on the feedback given this course will be equally geared toward people who are familiar with the material and those seeing it for the first time.",
    "This course is for someone majoring in engineering and who needs it for their major. It can honestly be taken before multivariable as you don't need much knowledge from multivariable to do differential equation except perhaps partial derivatives. If you want to take this differential equations but don't need to take the ENAS version DON'T as I have had very bad experiences within the ENAS department and hear much better things from the MATH courses.",
    "This class has a lot of work but it is really good. You actually learn a lot of stuff. TFs are very helpful. The exams and psets are quite hard and long, but the Tfs help",
    "Very useful course, but very tough. The class is in effect a survey of how to solve different equations but pay attention to how to differentiate them.",
    "Chances are you're only considering this class if you have to take it for a major. Go to offices hours and don't fall behind. Good luck!",
    "ENAS 194 is a course aimed to equip its student with the knowledge of differential equations and to test their ability to solve them. The course is is very challenging in terms of workload but the lessons learned from the course are easily applied to all other courses in the sciences (I have benefited from how to solve differential equations in my physics course and without ENAS 194 I realized how much harder it would have been to understand the physics material). I suggest the course to anyone involved in STEM because it will certainly be used within your career, just be prepared for the challenge and work.",
    "Don't take it unless you have to. It's really hard. If you do have to take it, stay on top of your work. Don't procrastinate on the psets.",
    "This course sucks because the beginning information is easy enough, but then they rush the most important pieces of information during the last two weeks.",
    "An introductory course in mostly ordinary and some partial differential equations. Don't take this class for fun, because it's not a fun one.",
    "Only to be taken if necessary. Hard p-sets and exams.",
    "Take the class to learn diff eqs but be prepared to learn mostly on your own.",
    "Lots of work. Only take it if it's a requirement.",
    "A difficult math class that is largely learned on your own. Expect certain students to master the material and aim for the average.",
    "If you need to take this course as a prerequisite, then it's something that you can't really avoid and so you should take this class. Since I don't know exactly what the more math intensive course is like (MATH 246), I wouldn't necessarily be the best person to directly compare the two, but if the math is more interesting to you, then MATH 246 might be better for you. As a lecture, it's fine; although it will require additional studying outside of class, more than might be expected typically.",
    "I hate this class so much. No class has ever caused me more stress and annoyance. The lectures were horrible. Professor Cao would constantly make mistakes (I think her catchphrase is \"I should be more careful\"), and her lectures were so dry and monotonous and confusing that eventually I just started bringing my textbook to class and teaching myself from the book while tuning out her lecture in the background. The psets ranged from fair to horrible-- some of the questions were so impossible. One of the psets took me 10 hours total to complete, and I couldn't do any of the problems without the help of the TAs or other students. The exams were so dumb-- the first exam seemed fair, even though it had a couple typos: for example, one question was impossible to solve because air resistance was set inversely proportional to velocity, which makes no sense. Professor Cao thought that an average score of 83 on the exams was too high for some reason, even though 83 is a very normal average, and made the next exam SO HARD. I thought the final exam was also impossible- I studied for 4 days straight and still couldn't get over a C raw score. I think that this class should not try to create so much of a spread in the class-- apparently the exams were so hard because everyone was getting good scores on the psets (that was because we would all go to office hours and then stay for 3 hours after the TA left and suffer\/work together). I don't see what the problem is with everyone getting good grades as long as we understand the material. I feel like if you take this class, you are probably an engineer, and probably naturally good at math, so I see why the exams should punish the students of this class for working together and understanding the concepts at a similar level. I used to like math a lot, but after this class and ENAS 151, I don't think I'll ever take math at Yale again. Also, physics was kind of essential for doing a lot of the p sets and exam questions, so if you need this class for your major, I would recommend taking physics before you take this class. I took physics in high school, but have not taken it in college yet, and I felt like I was at a big disadvantage to the students who were in physics.",
    "I stopped going to lectures within a few weeks, because they were not very clear yet still managed to move very slowly. Lecture notes weren't too clear, so I ended up learning everything from the textbook (which has horrible reviews on amazon). If you're just curious about dif eqs, than maybe take the math department version I hear its better. If you have to take the course, be savy with the 3 hw departments. Try very hard to not use them the first half of the course so you can drop them on some annoyingly hard psets (but still do a few problems from psets you drop to not fall behind).",
    "dont",
    "I would recommend this course to a fellow student. Differential Equations can be an extremely difficult course and the Professor and TAs worked hard to make this class as painless as possible.",
    "This is a very challenging course both because of the material it covers and how poorly the class was taught for spring 2016. Class time largely felt like a waste, with a vast majority of learning coming from the book and from office hours.",
    "Not a great math class. Lectures were disorganized and often times incomplete. The problem sets were long and tedious and often unhelpful in actually understanding the material or preparing for a midterm. Professor Cao did not have the skillet to teach a lecture style class, and everyone suffered because of it. The TAs were helpful, so definitely go to the review sessions and study halls.",
