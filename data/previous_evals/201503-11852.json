   "comments": [
    "Overall, this was a good course! The essays took me forever to write and much longer to revise, and Matt can be a harsh grader, but he is extremely helpful with revisions and lightens up on grading as the course goes on. The readings were also very interesting and quick reads. The topic is very interesting, though by the end I was definitely done with it.",
    "This class provides experience in essay writing for its students. Discussions are at times philosophical and specifically on the subject of authenticity. Compared to other ENGL 114 sections, this section might be tougher in terms of reading and grading compared to them but the challenge is worth it. I learned something new every class and I feel my essay writing skills have improved because of this class. I would recommend this course to anyone who is interested in writing, literature, politics, history, or philosophy. It is a great class if you actually want to learn something.",
    "It depends on how much effort you're willing to put into the class. I spent a lot of time on each essay.",
    "I would recommend the class.",
    "I would summarize it as a course in which you learn to write, but not by doing worksheets or tirelessly reviewing writing skills. You instead learn about an interesting topic and the writing skills are mixed in.",
    "This is a rigorous class, but the topic and material is very interesting. We dip a lot into linguistics, cultural anthropology, and hip hop music. If that sounds interesting and you need to take an ENGL 114 class, then take this one! The Professor is friendly and helpful, though in a way that teaches you to think and write for yourself.",
    "This course is one for questioning previously unconsidered assumptions surrounding authenticity. The eventual outcome of this intellectual musing, like the student's success in improving their writing, is greatly dependent on the individual's effort in growth. The professor provides all the materials for the criticism of the subject of authenticity and of the student's writing, but only by the student's own volition can the value of authenticity and the individual's writing ability be slowly rebuilt."
