    "Take it, but be prepared to spend about 10-15 hours a week on the psets. Go to discussion and review sections!",
    "Chances are you need to take this for your major if you are taking it. Word of advice: even when it seems easy, be on guard. Also take advantage of the resources that Howe gives you.",
    "If you're really interested in math (i.e. want to major in it), you're going to have to take this class, and it's going to suck: it'll feel slow, boring, and somewhat like a massive review. Seriously consider just sucking it up and taking 230\/231, especially now that they're easier. If you think you can learn the implicit function theorem, manifolds, and differential forms on your own, maybe even try to skip straight to MATH 300. If you're taking this because you have to for a non-math major, then, well, you have to. Nothing to say there. If you're looking to take a math course as someone who is not going to be actively using this material in other classes, I would strongly recommend that this not be it. It won't be as fun as some of the more concrete courses, and it might feel like less than an entire course's worth of materialyou can get more bang for your credit-buck from, e.g. probability\/stats, discrete, or reflection groups.",
    "Professor Howe is a great teacher. The way he explains is mostly clear, though there are some concepts that you have to think about for a while to grasp them. I guess it is not because of his teaching but because those concepts are basically complicated. Materials are good too.",
    "I honestly did not like this course very much. It ties linear algebra and multivariable calculus nicely together, but as explained above, it is too much difficult material and work in too little time. I would absolutely not recommend this course to another student.",
    "AAA Roger Howe is god. The god of math. Best math course of my life, best math professor in the universe. I learnt not to be afraid of math, to enjoy it, to appreciate how versatile a subject it is. This course made me want to go to graduate school in economics again.. It really isn't as much work as people say it is. Take it with some friends though. Also, the midterms are really easy but the final is much harder. But don't worry - it isn't curved, and the exams are really fairly graded.",
    "This is an awesome class! It's well structured, the exams are fair, Prof. Howe is the most committed teacher I've ever had, the homework is super helpful, and you just learn a lot!! Take it, it's not as much work as the reviews suggest, and you'll get a lot out of it!",
    "MATH 250 is a great introduction to rigorous math. It is far harder that MATH 120 and MATH 222 which I have taken before but the results are more beautiful and the class is more rewarding. Be prepared to spend a lot of time figuring out concepts and doing problem sets. Don't be afraid to go to office hours or the problem sessions. Professor Howe is a great teacher and he really cares about students and is willing to help. The peer tutors during the problems sessions were also incredibly helpful. The tests can be challenging but are very fair as you have a lot of choice of which questions you can answer. The generalization of stoke's theorem which encompasses all of the theorems of traditional vector analysis (Green's theorem, Divergence theorem, and the original stokes theorem) is a very beautiful result and illustrates the usefulness of a rigorous approach to math. I can say that I put a lot of effort into this class but that I got a lot out of it and have definitely improved as a mathematician.",
    "THE DERIVATIVE. Inverse and Implicit Function Theorems. Manifolds. Differential forms. General Stokes' Theorem. It's really hard, BUT Howe is the best. Even when you don't understand him. You gotta love the guy. He works so hard to make this class doable for everyone and he cracks some adorable jokes sometimes. I hope I never forget when he talked about the \"Fundamental Dogma of Real Numbers\" (which I have yet to find anywhere on the web, which suggests to me he named himself) Now the tests are actually not very hard. Very Ace-able. Basically you choose which questions you want to answer usually the selection involves an easy one or two (and others that make you laugh, cuz despite all their potential difficulty, you don't need to worry about em). As Howe said, tests in the class are to show that you've learned \"something.\" Problem Sets. Soooo I praise Howe a lot but I gotta admit the lectures very often do not relate to the problem sets. Problem Set 1: Basic Set Theory, and yet he talks about sets the next week (don't worry if this problem set takes forever, the first week's the worst and some weeks the problem sets are actually really short). Problem Set 5 or something: Manifolds, only he never introduced manifolds in class? You learn these things from the book, which is quite good, or a really smart peer tutor, or the TA, or Howe who runs all these Problem Sessions and holds all these office hours to help you out. You should get pretty good at reading mathematical things, writing proofs and the like. So! If you want to learn some higher math take it... If you want to keep all the material make this class your priority. If you don't want to make this class your priority, you'll be more than fine too.",
    "An amazing class. Professor Howe is amazing - my favorite professor at Yale. It's well organized and I always had a feeling there was a purpose to the lectures and psets.",
    "Fantastic class. Take it with Roger Howe. Exams are very fair. Homeworks take forever.",
    "I would recommend the class, especially if Howe teaches it. I'm not sure how good or interesting it would be otherwise. Professor Howe did a great job in the problem sets making the material interesting to a wide variety of people interested in different topics. However sometimes a lot of effort was required for simple brute force algebra that was not always very fun or enlightening.",
    "I would recommend this if you enjoy mathematics and its applications. However, if you need to take this class for a major, don't worry too much because although it is a lot of work, it does not grade too harshly. Also, you will learn a lot.",
    "If you are taking, you probably have to. Just take it during your sophomore year, junior at the latest, when your classmates take it.",
    "Take it if you are interested in proof-based math. If not, and you are not doing math or econ\/math major, don't take it.",
    "For anyone interested in all the cool abstract stuff you can do with the tools of linear algebra, calculus, and the other things learnt in math 250, I would highly recommend this course.",
    "Take it take it. this class kept my love for mathematics alive.",
    "Great class with a high workload.",
    "250 is a hard class - don't kid yourself. The problem sets are consistently 8-12 hours each week, the concepts will make you think very hard, and there's no easy way to learn how to write proofs. Having said that, this class has all the support needed to help you get through a hard math class. There are frequent problem set review sessions, the exams are not hard (there's ample choice of which questions to do), and so on. Professor Howe is a legend - if you need to take this, take it with him - no question. Make friends in the class and work on psets together. You will work harder than ever before, but you'll definitely feel like it was worth it.",
    "Definitely take this class! It's so much more interesting than any previous maths class you would have taken. Some vague knowledge of vector calculus\/linear algebra is probably necessary, but don't feel like you have to have done all of 120 and 225; I think this class would work really well as an alternative to 230 for people who aren't masochists (although the material in this class is still fairly hard). Homework\/class is about really interesting, fairly difficult theory. Exams are much easier computational, sometimes almost Math120-style questions.",
    "VERY HARD AND TIME CONSUMING! But very interesting (if you enjoy the topic). Find a good study group. The exam is very fair, it's not as hard as the problem sets. Overall worth it.",
    "This course rigorously proves the concepts presented in math 120 using more formalized theory of calculus and basic concepts of linear algebra. It also fleshes out concepts from 120 by giving more general results and examining them in more general settings.",
    "It's tough, but worth it. Expect a lot of work. The course gets deceptively easy in the middle of the semester - the midterms are doable, and while the assignments take some time, they are doable. I thought that because the midterms were easy, the final would be easy - I was wrong, the final kicked my butt. So don't ever let your guard down, this class is hard right through to the end. That being said, however, I have a whole new appreciation for mathematics now. In fact, I feel like I can call myself a mathematician - you begin to look at things such as derivatives and quadratics from their very fundamentals, and you gain a much more intimate understanding of these concepts than you ever would have had in a previous math course. This is a class that made me realize that Math is, well and truly, beautiful.",
    "You probably don't have a choice but it's a pretty good class. Familiarity with writing proofs would be very helpful but you can figure it out. Problem sets are usually difficult and time consuming but make exams much easier. Final is harder than midterms",
    "This class did a good job introducing the process and mechanics of proof based calculus with many in-class examples and homework exercises. The homework exercises especially forced me to think about proofs on a more rigorous level. The problem sets took me >=10 hours consistently throughout the semester, although some of the middle problem sets and short ones took me less than 10. I'd recommend leaving enough time weekly to complete the problem sets.",
    "I would probably not recommend this course to a fellow student. While I think it was well-taught, it simply took up too much of my time and dominated my semester.",
    "Amazing class!!!!",
    "A. Professor Howe was an impeccable instructor--he guided students through material during lecture very carefully, was highly open to all sorts of questions at office hours, during lecture and by appointment, and kept things in great humour. I thoroughly enjoyed the course and left inspired and humbled. Highly recommended with prof Howe.",
    "MATH 250 extends all the concepts from multivariable calculus to their natural (and sometimes less natural and wholly surprising) n-dimensional counterparts. It offers some incredible insights that do require some time to get your head around them, making the class and the time you put into it very much worth it. And of course, to top it all off, Professor Howe is an incredible teacher with vast experience teaching mathematics and the textbook is a true gem. I would definitely recommend the class.",
    "Loved this course. It will probably be a struggle: the material is very challenging conceptually, and the workload is intense (~10 hours weekly), but at the end of the course, when you can take a step back and look at what you learnt, it's worth it. Plus, the tests are not hard: they asses whether you know something, not whether you know everything, and as a result have tons of choice, which is both necessary and welcome. Professor Howe is phenomenal. Great lecturer: he manages to hold his class' attention even through the most twisted proof. Always available to help you, and may be the most pro-student professor I've had at Yale. In a nutshell, this course is a lot more fun once you're done with it, but I would wholeheartedly recommend you take it.",
    "One of the most interesting and intense courses I've taken. Make are to keep up with the concepts, as it can quickly snowball, but problem sets, help hours, and midterms give plenty of balanced opportunities for learning.",
    "I sometimes found myself confused as to what was going on during lectures, but when it came to be time for midterms and exams, I found myself prepared and with a solid enough knowledge of the materials to do well. The homework is fair, but I recommend going to tutoring hours to go over tough questions with the professor or TF or peer tutor. This was a challenging but interesting math class that definitely helped advance my mathematical comprehension.",
    "Math 250 was a great class. Some of the concepts were pretty challenging, but it was cool to see how linear algebra and multivariable calculus mix together in a study of higher dimensions. We learned several new elegant ways to approach these types of problems. Professor Howe was awesome -- he was clearly dedicated to the class and our understanding of the material. He personally held one discussion section each week and a few sections before each exam. I thought the grading \/ homework policy was great, especially given the challenging nature of the course -- there was lots of choice for each question on the exams and only the best homework grades counted. I would highly recommend the course to anyone interested in a further study of mathematics, especially higher-dimensional calculus."
