   "comments": [
    "Our workload for this class came in our projects with our created theatres. So I found the workload to be relatively light. The project was demanding of time and skill, but that was its fun, in its needing you to challenge yourself and make time.",
    "I think the workload was completely manageable",
    "This class required quite a heavy workload but I felt it was relative to our goals of the class so it was never overwhelming. Due to the nature of the group project, I was inspired to take on more work as to not let my team down, so the work was a positive experience.",
    "I appreciated the amount of time we had between our first presentation and the final. I can see the danger of allowing students to choose their own pace for preparing, but my team met every week, so we spread the workload evenly and did not have a mad rush at the end to finish everything. I thought the workload was just the right amount to show how difficult it can be to plan a season.",
    "I really appreciated that the workload of this course was on the team itself. We had to manage ourselves and our projects and goals. The \"situation\" assignment (diva, etc), was a fun issue to think about individually and with my team, and it may have been fun to have a few more of those throughout the semester. Just discussion questions and scenarios where decisions have to be made.",
    "The workload was appropriate as it allowed plenty of time for the groups to work on our final projects.",
    "The structure of the class is wonderful and efficient and challenging. The semester-long assignment creates an overarching structure that asked me to think about the class as a whole, rather than just a collection of parts. And each class itself added the information I needed to complete the large assignment."

   "comments": [
    "Overall the class was very organized and clear in its structure, goals, and progression. I found it to be readily and easily accessible and engaging. Generally the class became more of a lecture, but that's really (I feel) up to the students themselves to change and not in the hands of the instructor or course.",
    "I enjoyed the set of the classes",
    "The guest speakers were amazing. It was great to apply what we learned from each guest to our project.",
    "MPP is a fabulous course. It is a superb mix of the creative and the pragmatic. Exactly what I needed to end my first year in the Theater Management program.",
    "I loved having guest speakers come in and talk to us about their operational experience with their theater companies and to see how that process differs from venue to venue and the means with which they all still manage to produce strong theatrical seasons. It was very inspirational and eye opening especially for someone who plans to open their own theater company one day.",
    "The course was organized very well. It was clear, comprehensive and coherent.",
    "This is the best structured class I think I have ever had. Clear, concise, but also allowing for quite a bit of freedom and flexibility."

    "Vicki is fantastic. Very clearly knowledgeable, open and easy to talk to, you felt a peer and apprentice at the same time; you knew she was the instructor and mentor, but you felt utterly respected and well looked after as a peer as well.",
    "I really enjoyed having class with Vicki and hearing how much she knew about producing and seeing how much goes into producing a season.",
    "Great! I really appreciate the private group meeting outside of the classroom. It is great to have such a responsive instructor.",
    "I could not see anyone else teaching this course. Vicki does a great job of balancing practical considerations involved in managing a theater with the creative impulse to experiment and be a little bizarre in our choices. It was clear from the beginning that if you could convince her a choice was appropriate and fit with the vision of your theater, she would support it and help you work it into your planning. There are a lot of practicalities involved in this type of planning, but Vicki never lets us lose that necessary sense of play.",
    "Vicki's availability outside of class to answer any questions we may have had or to simply discuss topics we touched on in class was fantastic. It was that willingness that made the class all the more enjoyable. Not only were her lectures clear and specific, but class time was always structured in a way that allowed us to have back and forth discussions instead of being held to the form of a lecture.",
    "Vicki was a great instructor. She was clear, interesting, always available, encouraged dialogue and engagement, and explained the content in a super interesting way.",
    "We were provided great access to information on season planning from both Vicki and her visitors. The structure of the timeline for the class made great sense and each class built upon the previous in a very logical way."

    "Long Wharf was a fantastic guest. It was extremely interesting to get a glimpse into their operation and, doubly so, because they themselves made comparison to themselves and the Yale Rep, which was a very interesting insight.",
    "I highly enjoyed all the guests she had in class. It really helped the understanding of the process.",
    "As mentioned above, the guest speakers were great and informative!",
    "All visitors were excellent to have in class.",
    "The visitors again were great to have in class, especially since they were our theatrical neighbors and gave us deeper insight to those individuals who help run theaters in the New Haven area.",
    "Both visits of James Bundy and Long Wharf were highly interesting and helpful for understanding the area of studies. I wish we would have more visits like that.",
    "Visitors in the class were very informative and interesting. I LOVE when James Bundy came, and I actually think it would be a very interesting experiment to bring James back at the end of class and have another discussion. I also would be very interested in a more diverse group of visitors. Right now they mostly come from the same size & style of organization, but what if we brought in artists and managers from the world of devised theater? Dance? Puppetry? I know there is limited class time, but it would be great to see a more diverse group of people represented."

   "comments": [
    "It was really during our projects that I felt I learned the most. This is more than likely due to how I learn, hands on versus thru observation. At the same time, and this may be how my group read it, we clearly took on roles right in the beginning of the project that I feel limited us into how much and what we could learn. Our director was the AD and didn't involve himself much in budgeting so he didn't learn much about it. Our theatre manager in fact did most of the budgeting work, splitting the production budget to someone else. It was great because, most likely, this is how a theatre actually works with people doing specific tasks and thus needing specific skills, but as part of a classroom, it became \"I'm learning this and you're learning that.\"",
    "This class has made me very interested in producing after school.",
    "Over all the project was incredibly informative to my learning of the theater process. It helped me to have a better understanding of all the details and how to prepare for a season from both the artistic and management sides.",
    "I have such a stronger respect and deeper understanding of exactly what goes into season planning. Having done it first hand in this class I have a better understanding of the specifics and finances that can make a strong theater company. This class will stick with me for my career because one day I will open my own theater company, and this class has taught me how to do it successfully even on a limited budget.",
    "It was one of the best courses this year! The course gave a deep and thorough look on the managing side, mostly with regard not to the artistic side. For me, it was very important to understand how this market works in the States. I wish there was more emphasize on the artistic side as well - examples of theaters' seasons, tips for building an interesting season, resources to search for materials, artistic progress and growth of a few theaters, managing the dialogue with the theater manager, relationship with the season's directors and playwrights, etc."

    "Please see my answers to questions 4 & 5",
    "I would love if the class were open to more than just Stage Managers, Theater Managers, and Directors. I really enjoyed getting to know these classmates, but I wonder if there would be interest from more dramaturgs? Or designers? Or even actors?"
