    "It's a trap. Shapiro is a poor seminar leader, the material is boring, and the class lacks direction. The worst 2 hours of my week. Just don't, it isn't work it, take a PLSC seminar with a younger professor who has more enthusiasm and doesn't push his views on students.",

    "Not that interesting of a seminar so unless you're really into the topic not that great of a class"
