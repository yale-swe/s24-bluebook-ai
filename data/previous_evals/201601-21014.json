    "Keep going at it! The language only gets better.",
    "Continuation of 130. Irina is a fantastic teacher and really cares about improving every aspect of your Russian. Would absolutely recommend.",
    "The Russian program at Yale has been amazing. Definitely would recommend learning Russian.",
    "This class is a lot of work just because it meets daily and the homework is daily as well, but it is also very rewarding. You learn a lot during class and then practice it on the homeworks. If you are invested in Russian, take this class. If not, don't take it.",
    "If you're interested in Russian, absolutely take this course with Irina. Second-year Russian is hard but worthwhile. I am amazed by the progress she has helped me make in 2 years! I am now able to hold basic conversations in Russian and understand most everyday conversation. Irina explains concepts very clearly and runs a highly interactive classroom where we practice speaking with our classmates, read stories and poems, and give short presentations.",
    "Focuses on building comfort with grammatical\/syntactical constructions in conversational Russian. I definitely recommend it."
