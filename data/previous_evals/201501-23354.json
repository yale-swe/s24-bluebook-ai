    "We had actual practice on doing literature review and grant proposal writing, which was very useful but it can take a lot of time as well.",
    "The course could use more structure.",
    "Great introduction to grant proposal writing, literature review, and paper critiques using environmental hormones and health effects as a platform.",
    "Overall, this is a great course. We learned a lot from this course including skills in literature review, writing grant proposal and original papers.",
    "This course was okay...but I was expecting a lot more from it. I did not feel like I got a very good overview of the subject, although it was good practice on how to go about conducting an epidemiological study and how to effectively review and critique literature on a specific topic.",
    "This course provided a decent overview of environmental hormones and the routes through which they act as endocrine disruptors. There were no exams on the course material. Grading was based on applications to real-life situations we would find ourselves in if we were to enter academia (i.e. article critique, literature review, grant proposal, original research). I would have appreciated the opportunity to apply the lecture material in an exam.",

    "Instructor: Yawei Zhang \u00a0Dr. Zhang was being harsh sometimes during our presentations.",
    "Instructor: Yawei Zhang \u00a0It would help to have guidelines, expectations, or even an explanation of assignments posted somewhere. Assignments were explained in class, but were not always clear or consistent.",
    "Instructor: Yawei Zhang \u00a0Sensitive to student needs, enthusiastic about teaching, and always willing and available to meet with her students.",
    "Instructor: Yawei Zhang \u00a0Dr. Yawei Zhang is wonderful. Thanks for her great teaches. She is very responsible and gave us many useful feedbacks.",
    "Instructor: Yawei Zhang \u00a0Strengths: Dr. Zhang gives very helpful feedback on all presentations and coursework, and is very receptive to students needs. Weaknesses: Her lectures did not give a good overview of the topic and were very specific to her area of research. She also needs to be much more clear about her expectations for the course, what we are going to be graded on, and what she wants us to do for her assignments.",
    "Instructor: Yawei Zhang \u00a0Dr. Zhang uses a lot of examples from her own research, which is useful but could use some variety. Her slides and lectures are fairly clear. She can be too vague about expectations and instructions for class assignments. A syllabus with grade breakdown would have been helpful.",

    "If you would like to learn about doing literature review and grant proposal writing in the field of environmental exposures and human health, you could take this course and it really helped you practice.",

    "Yes I would like to recommend this course to other students. All the knowledge and skills learnt from this course will be very useful in the future study and researches.",
    "I would only recommend this course to a student who is very interested in this topic",
    "This class is a good introduction to endocrine disruptors, their modes of action, and current issues in environmental hormones and health. Dr. Zhang is a very strong researcher and a clear lecturer. However, I still felt somewhat unsatisfied with what I learned in this course.",
