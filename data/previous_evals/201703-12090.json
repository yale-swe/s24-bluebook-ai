    "I learned how to think critically about various therapies and how to utilise them to help potential clients.",
    "Through this course, I learned the theory behind motivational interviewing, cognitive behavioral therapy, and acceptance and commitment therapy. I also had the opportunity to practice skills involved with each of these therapies through role-playing a variety of techniques, and to learn how to write detailed treatment plans incorporating a variety of therapies.",
    "I learned so much about theoretical and practical applications of therapy techniques as well as how to develop a comprehensive conceptualization and treatment plan.",
    "This class was an incredible learning experience! I began to build a strong foundation of CBT and ACT psychotherapies in both their underlying theory and how to implement in clinical practice. Mary also encouraged thoughtful discussion in how to take different perspectives to treatment and conceptualization and how to integrate them in a way that empowers a client. She further provided the support and in-class practice to help us think deeply about these psychotherapies and begin to build insightful expertise in treatment planning."

   "comments": [
    "I enjoyed the chance to practice therapies on one another and wish we had done that a little more in order to really strengthen the skill and feel more confident in the skill.",
    "Strengths: This was a very dynamic course that involved reading, discussion, and practice of different therapeutic techniques. I thought that each of these three aspects was very engaging and conducive to learning skills associated with each therapy. I think the readings, videos, and exercises in class were very relevant and helpful. I think this was probably my favorite course I took all semester! Not a weakness, but just something I noticed: it was sometimes difficult and I felt awkward doing the role playing exercises in class, which probably means that this is a skill that still needs some work! Time permitting, I think it would be great to do even more role playing of therapeutic techniques in order to force us out of our comfort zones\/ get the feelings of awkwardness out of the way before we perform these techniques with real clients!",
    "I thought the course was extremely well-designed and clear. It was designed to facilitate engagement with the readings and with class discussions. I appreciated being able to practice skills in class."
