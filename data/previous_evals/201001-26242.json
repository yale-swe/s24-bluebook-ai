   "question_text": "Looking back on this course, what is your overall assessment of the course:  What are its strengths and weaknesses, and in what ways might it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Its strengths were definitely that it was a comprehensive introduction to the issue of HIV\/AIDS from a public health perspective, all angles of it, and that was interesting to learn. The weakness was that sometimes it was hard to follow if you didn't have a strong background in public health. Overall I think it balanced things well and the material was incredibly interesting and relevant.",
    "Strengths: interesting articles, lectures, and discussions; a lot of feedback from the teaching fellowWeaknesses: not enough discussion",
    "This course gave a comprehensive and systemic introduce of HIV\/AIDS, gave us a better understanding of this disease, and also, it taught us some methods to analysis public issuse. It need more examples from some sectors, such as CDC, UNAIDS.",
    "a very nice course, which covers most knowledge related to HIV\/AIDS in public health.",
    "Kaveh is awesome - major strength of the class. You can tell he's passionate about the material and he is really straightforward and honest about what needs to be understood with regards to HIV\/AIDS.Some of the issues are hard to talk about, but he makes them easy.The guest speakers he brought in were great and gave insight into very different perspectives about HIV\/AIDS.There was so much about HIV\/AIDS that I always wanted to know and was able to learn through this class.One weakness of the course is the number of undergraduates who take it. It makes the class size larger and the experience a little diluted for graduate students with more background knowledge with the subject material.",
    "The class gives an overview of topics related to HIV, however so many different topics are covered that it's sometimes difficult to go in depth into all of them. I enjoyed the guest speakers as they are very effective in conveying important information and concepts related to the topics taught in class.",
    "I liked the structure of the course and having guest speakers. The course was informative and expansive in the topics covered. The reflection paper was not necessary.",
    "Strengths:1) Kaveh, the professor was engaging and interesting-filled with information and very supportive of the students2) Louis, our TF was incredible. The time he spent correcting and commenting on our papers was admirable-I honestly felt that he was committed to helping us improve-which can be rare with a TF3)Great combination of statistical data, history and discussion. I really feel that I gained an important insight into the key public health issues surrounding HIV\/AIDS4) I enjoyed the online discussion format-I was able to learn about interesting and relevant issues related to HIV globally and in the media-and learn more about my classmates' perspectives.Weaknesses:1) I had a major issue with the predominance of uninvolved, distracted undergrads in the class. The class was listed as a grad course, and yet enrollment was 90% undergrads. A few of them were involved and participated in classroom discussions-most checked their facebook pages throughout class and didn't respond to questions from the professor.With more engaged classmates the classroom experience could have been much more rewarding.2) more clarification at the beginning of the year regarding the expectations for the short papers would be appreciated. I was not aware that the expectation was for a lot of lit review, as opposed to personal reflection.",
    "This was an extremely good introductory study of HIV\/AIDS. I loved the interdisciplinary approach, and the chance to explore HIV as a social, political, biomedical, interpersonal, etc., public health issue. The readings were often excellent, and added much depth to what we were learning in class. However, because our discussion in class was often rather general, there was not too much of an incentive to do the readings, as we didn't always bring in specific details or examples from the reading. I think this worked for the best though -- some weeks, there was far too much to read and I found myself unable to finish it all, and the structure of the class discussions allowed me to read for the primary information and because I enjoyed learning about HIV, without stressing over memorizing details.I do wish there had been more in-class discussions\/debates, though. I think many people in the class were shy or unwilling to engage in debates\/discussions, and these would have been stimulating and pushed us to think further about many of the issues. It would have been nice if Kaveh had facilitated some more discussions among the students by directly engaging individual people, or by asking us to seek out the flaws in someone else's statement\/argument.Additionally, the work was not always organized in the best way logistically. For example, making the reflection paper and the group project paper due on the same day was very stressful. Requiring the 10 posts& responses to be due 3 days prior only added to this stress. It would have made much more sense to stagger those due dates.",
    "Overall, I thought this course was a great overview of the major issues in HIV\/AIDS. I thought both class and the readings were excellent and informative. The course covered a broad array of topics without going into depth on any of them, and I feel like that approach worked for the material. I am glad that I became familiar with a bunch of issues, rather than an expert on just one or two.I was a little frustrated by the disconnect between class and the assigned reading. We very rarely discussed the assigned reading in class. Consequently, I do not think that many people did the reading. I would have gotten more out of the readings had we discussed them more, and many of them would have been fascinating to talk about.",
    "This course is fascinating, and does a good job of covering various facets of HIV\/AIDS as a global health problem. It seems like a broad overview, with a few opportunities to go more in depth on something through assignments. The readings did not always seem essential to what happened in lecture. The course also could have benefited from more in-class discussion. One of the many great things about this course was the guest speakers.",
    "The material covered in the course was fascinating and Kaveh presented it well. The course placed a lot of responsibility on the student, which was great because the student had a lot of freedom in terms of their work, but needs to stay on top of things by themselves.",
    "This course provides an excellent historical and current perspective on HIV\/AIDS. Lectures presented both a broad public health perspective as well as the individual experience."

   "comments": [
    "Instructor: Kaveh Khoshnood \u00a0Kaveh is certainly the most helpful and resourceful professor I have had at Yale. It is to no one's surprise that he is so well-liked by all.",
    "Instructor: Kaveh Khoshnood \u00a0Kaveh was a great professor in that he provided interesting lectures and material, but he was not as helpful when it came to elaborating and talking after class. Maybe it was because he expected more out of the undergrads who were in the class, but sometimes it didn't feel like he tried to help us.",
    "Instructor: Kaveh Khoshnood \u00a0strengths: very knowledgeable and encouraging of independent thought and discussionweaknesses: not enough time for students, did not provide clear enough instructions for assignments",
    "Instructor: Kaveh Khoshnood \u00a0He is a very good guy, and the systemic thinking and methods he showed to us are very useful.",
    "Instructor: Kaveh Khoshnood \u00a0nice instructor",
    "Instructor: Kaveh Khoshnood \u00a0Awesome! He is so approachable, easy to talk to, straightforward with difficult material... Reasonable with regards to his expectations of the class. He also seems like he enjoys teaching, which is really nice as a student.",
    "Instructor: Kaveh Khoshnood \u00a0Kaveh is excellent and really makes you think deeper to explore the subjects covered. His expertise in the subjects is well demonstrated in the lectures.",
    "Instructor: Kaveh Khoshnood \u00a0Kaveh was a good professor. I admired most his commitment to the material, his desire to keep us involved and engaged, and his positive attitude.",
    "Instructor: Kaveh Khoshnood \u00a0Kaveh was an extremely good instructor, and I would look forward to taking another course with him (which I hope to do). His passion for the subject was evident, and he challenged us to think much further about the many public health issues associated with HIV. However, I do wish he would have engaged the class in discussions\/debates more frequently. At times, he would ask a question, and when nobody answered, he would let one or two students dominate the discussion. If Kaveh had encouraged us to engage in more inter-class debates, whether by calling on individual students, asking students to speak a little about what they'd learned from the readings, or simply encouraging us to find the flaws in another student's argument\/statement, I think it would have challenged me to think even further about these issues.Furthermore, I had the impression -- although I'm not sure whether I'm correct -- that only our TA read the papers, and that Kaveh did not know much about our work outside of our in-class discussions. I would have liked to feel as if Kaveh were more engaged with the individual students, by reading our papers, or even simply by reading our first paper to get a feel for our writing style and style of argument.",
    "Instructor: Kaveh Khoshnood \u00a0Kaveh is a very engaging lecturer and great at involving the class in discussion. He has lots of interesting experiences and stories to share from his work in the field. He also seems to be very passionate about teaching and sharing this information with students.I realize that Kaveh has taught this course before and recycles the powerpoints and lecture materials from previous years, which is understandable. However, I think it would have been helpful if he had spent a bit more time updating the powerpoints with the most recent studies and tailoring them to the pace at which this particular class was going. He would often skip through excess powerpoint slides that were in the presentation, but not intended for this class, or refer to a study that was out of date, acknowledging that more recent and accurate data was probably available, but that he had not put it in the powerpoint.",
    "Instructor: Kaveh Khoshnood \u00a0Kaveh is great! He is so friendly and approachable. Also, his knowledge on the subject is incredible and his real life anecdotes added so much to the class.",
    "Instructor: Kaveh Khoshnood \u00a0Kaveh is a great lecturer and brought in many interesting speakers as well. He pushes his students to achieve higher levels of critical thinking and research. He is respectful to all of the students in the class, despite their varied levels of knowledge and really provided interesting discussion topics. He is passionate about HIV\/AIDS research and dedicated to the advancement of his students."

    "Louis Fazen is a wonderful TA who has been instrumental to us in the writing portion of our course.",
    "Louis was a great TA. He read all of our papers critically and was willing to meet to go over the group project. His comments were constructive. The only thing was that he took a while to get back to you on questions via email and that was frustrating at times, especially when things are time-sensitive. Overall he was very helpful and understanding.",

    "nice TA, who read my paper very carefully and gave aimed comments",
    "Louis Fazen was the TA this year. I found him to be very reasonable with regards to his expectations. He was very helpful clarifying information for the class when necessary. He also gave good feedback on the papers. He was definitely very engaged with the material which was great.",
    "Louis is a great TA. I have never seen a TA treat each and every assignment that seriously. He gave excellent points and insight in every written assignment and was able to guide students in the project paper as well. Overall, he's the kind of dedicated, knowledgeable, friendly TA that every YSPH class should have.",
    "The TA is very helpful and provides constructive feedback for the assignments. He was very involved in the course.",
    "Louis was excellent. As mentioned above, he spent a great deal of time correcting and commenting on all of our classwork, which allowed me to improve over time and become more self-reflective about my writing and perspective.",
    "Louis Fazen was an excellent TA. He provided very good insight, was often available to provide comments\/answer questions when were confused, and always challenged us to think more deeply about the subjects of our papers, in-class discussions, or group projects. However, there were times where it felt like he might have simply skimmed the e-mails we sent him and answered without really looking at the question, resulting in answers that may not have been as helpful as they could have been. Overall, though, Louis was a wonderful TA and I'd feel very lucky to have him as my TA again.",
    "Louis was great! His feedback was incredibly through and it was clear that he was really committed to the course and put the time into doing a good job with comments on papers, drafts, etc. He seemed very knowledgeable and passionate about the material. His comments on papers were extremely helpful and really pushed me to improve.",
    "Louis Fazen - He was an awesome asset to the class. He reviewed the papers in depth and gave insightful comments, which I believe was important learning process in this class.",
    "Louis was a great help and made himself very available to students. His contributions were always invaluable.",
    "Louis is wonderful. He was very helpful and willing to meet outside of class to help. Also, his comments on paper and projects were thorough and very helpful.",
    "Louis was outstanding. He provided prompt and insightful feedback on our assignments- the kind of feedback you would expect to get in graduate school, but rarely receive from a TA. He was always available to answer our questions also."

    "I would definitely take this course if you know what you're getting yourself into. It's a lot of reading, and sitting there for 2 hrs on a Wednesday afternoon can be tiring. Kaveh will still teach it, which will be great, and if Louis TA's it again, that combination will make the class instruction good. It might be frustrating if you don't come into it with a strong public health background, so be aware that it will be more work for you if that's the case.",
    "yes, very good to analyze the complexity of HIV\/AIDS abroad and here in the US. however, it is a lot of work.",
    "It very useful and necessary for student want to do some work on AIDS prevention.",
    "It's a very good course. Anyone who want to work in this field should take this course. It will help you a lot in the future.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student. The only downside is the number of undergraduates.Kaveh is wonderful and the material is very interesting. He teaches is very well.",
    "I would recommend this course to those that have had limited exposure to HIV\/AIDS issues. This course is challenging but manageable and emphasizes many public health concepts.",
    "THis course gives a great and thorough overview of the key pubic health issues related to HIV, both domestically and internationally. It provides a good balance of statistical\/background info and contemporary debates.I would not recommend this class because of the large percentage of undergrads. If the course was open exclusively to grads(or at least if grads were the majority) I would recommend it whole heartedly.",
    "This course is an excellent introduction to the study of HIV from a public health perspective, as a political, socioeconomic, interpersonal, and biomedical issue, among many others. If you have any interest in HIV, I definitely recommend taking this course. However, the papers, while only 3 - 4 pages, take much more time than anticipated (they require a fair amount of research), as does the group project, so plan ahead. The amount of reading can also seem pretty intimidating, but it is possible to get through the class without doing all of it, so on weeks when you have papers due, don't worry about finishing all the reading, too. That being said, it's usually pretty interesting, and you might really enjoy it : )Kaveh's also a great professor, and his experience in HIV research and his passion for the subject (particularly when it comes to injection drug users, his area of research) is evident.Overall, this is a great class that I highly recommend to anyone interested in public health& HIV!",
    "Great course! It is definitely an overview of the subject and does not go into a lot of depth on any one subject. I now feel familiar with all of the major public health issues related to HIV. The three short papers are challenging, but engaging and interesting-- they take a lot longer than one would think a four page paper might. The big group final project can be frustrating because it is truly a group effort and a group grade, but it is probably worthwhile.",
    "I absolutely recommend this course to other students. It is a fascinating, somewhat broad overview of HIV\/AIDS as a global public health issue. I enjoyed every lecture, and bothKaveh and Louis are wonderful and very helpful.",
    "I would recommend this class to another student. You will learn a ton about HIV\/AIDS and the class is taught extremely well."
