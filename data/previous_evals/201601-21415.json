    "A rigorous introduction to partial differential equations. I have recommended the course to friends.",
    "Well. Partial differential equations are pretty fun. But Math 247 (with Ronald Coifman) is kind of all over the place, with a lot of careful treatment of Fourier approaches to each problem and a pretty quick and dirty treatment of all other options. However, apparently 247 is usually taught by a different professor. I don't know. We had two take-home exams and just scattered exercises throughout the class, so I couldn't have really asked for less work while still learning some material (although probably less than I may have hoped for). Weigh your options.",
    "This is literally the worst class I have ever taken at Yale. PDEs as a topic are fascinating and very useful. Because of Coifman, I learned nothing. There was no class structure and no real textbook. Professor Coifman would walk in, start lecturing very rapidly facing the board, without explaining where he was going or why, make leaps without explaining, and use strange notation. As a result, he was impossible to follow. He seemed to have no idea of the mathematical background of the class, expecting much more sometimes and explaining basics like complex numbers other times. Homeworks were also mostly useless: he would write mini-exercises on the board as he went that would take half an hour and were interesting but usually would have little to do with the rest of the course. The only thing I learned from this class was how to google mathematics more effectively, otherwise this class has been a complete waste. The one bonus of the class is that both the midterm and the final were take-home and collaborative. If they hadn't been, I would have failed this class.",
    "I honestly would not recommend taking 247 with Coifman, or if one has to, to supplement or skip his lectures in favor of reading a textbook or using opencourseware. The problem sets, though, were very helpful in building up fundamentals."
