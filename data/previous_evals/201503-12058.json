    "Enjoyable class with lively discussions. Take it with Madame Schneider, she's a wonderful and caring professor, and my speaking and writing skills definitely improved!",
    "This class focuses on improving communication in French. The workload is not as full of busy work as the lower level language classes. Throughout the semester there are short writing assignments, two orals and a presentation. Madame Schneider is a great professor. I would definitely recommend taking her class.",
    "This is a college French course. There's going to be reading, writing, watching, and mostly speaking in French, and you're expected to fill in whatever knowledge gaps you may have up to this point on your own time with individual study. If you put in the work, you will leave the class with a better understanding not only of the language itself, but also of where you stand within it and what you need to do in order to improve.",
    "If you want to practice conversational French and writing, this is perfect."
