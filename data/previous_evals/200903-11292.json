   "comments": [
    "I thought French 150 provided a good bridge between a more grammatically-based study of the French language and a true literature course. The readings were often funny and\/or interesting, which was nice. However, I felt like the sheer number of graded assignments was much greater than my other, non-language courses, and I always seemed to be studying for a test or writing an essay. The class wasn't very easy to get extremely high grades in, though it was also not hugely difficult either.",
    "It's a fair amount of work but very workable. Do the work and the readings and you'll be fine. I would recommend this course quite highly.",
    "I would recommend it if you want to learn more French than you learned in L4. It's just a French class. A constant, steady stream of work, but never unmanageable.",
    "Yes take it, it is a lot of work but worth it since it really pushes you to practice French on a daily basis.",
    "Yes! I was thinking about quitting french, but I decided to stick with it.",
    "It was a good course overall. I liked the movies and books a lot, and that made for interesting discussions in class. You get to discuss deeper topics in this class that in previous French classes. The grammar reinforcement was helpful to an extent, but at times it felt like we went overboard reviewing the same thing repeatedly. I learned a lot from writing the papers, and some topics were more challenging than others. I found the tests to be very easy. My biggest problem with the class was the group work and skits, which I have alwaysdisliked.",
    "I would recommend this class if you want to keep taking french...unless you have a way of practicing on your own, it's really hard to keep up a language otherwise. But be prepared for the homework."
