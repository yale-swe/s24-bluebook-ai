    "In this course, I learned a lot about myself as a writer and how to best revise poetry.",
    "I became a better critic of my own work, and better at articulating my reactions to a poem. I became more emotionally in touch with my writing, more creative in my choices of subject matter. I started to learn how to revise.",

  {
   "question_id": "YC403",
   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Could be improved by having an electronic system for submitting poetry - I think having a class TA who could coordinate the logistics would be VERY helpful.",
    "As the class is set up, it is 100% workshopping, in which the main writer is not allowed to speak. At a very basic level, many of the conversations we had would have been immediately clarified had we been able to ask a factual clarifying question to the writer, and I found myself more and more frustrated. HOWEVER, the class ended up generating many interesting conversations about style and method, and gives prompts for a poem a week.",
    "I loved the poem-a-week writing schedule, and how class was structured (workshop 3 poems per class). One more revision assignment would have been helpful, as I still don't feel like I really know how to revise. Also, some reading assignments would have been beneficial. At the beginning of the semester, we received packets with poems to read, but that tapered off toward the middle and end.",
    "It is easy to be intimidated in this class, both because Louise is Louise and because people who know about poetry like to talk and show how much they know about poetry. Once you get over that, or if you never have that block, there is so much to get out of this class. Prof. Gluck is great one on one, and you get into the habit of writing consistently which is always good. I think that because it is a workshop class, a lot depends on who your classmates are."

   "comments": [
    "Definitely yes! Louise Glck is a phenomenal professor, and the workshop structure of the class is really beneficial to helping students understand how their poetry is perceived by other people. You basically write 1 poem a week, and then 3 people who she picks (everyone ends up being picked 3-4 times) that week will have their poems workshopped in class. Really wonderful.",
    "Professor Glck is brilliant, incisive, and surprisingly down to earth. By the end of the course, you will probably be left wondering how to distinguish good poetry from poetry that Professor Glck likes, but at any rate, you will be able to write poetry that Professor Glck likes, which must count for something.",
    "I would recommend this course. I would caution students against waiting till the last day to write the weekly poem; this course really is what you make of it.",
    "take this class simply to be in the presence of louise",
    "I recommend it, but I think that it is a hard class, and people fawn over it because Louise Gluck (who is great) teaches it. There is a lot of individual effort that has to go into getting something out of this class."
