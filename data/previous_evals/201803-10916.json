    "I learned about several models and estimation methods commonly used in labor economics research.",
    "The course provides the students with a complete overview of the labor economics field and also with several important techniques.",
    "What are the main areas of research within Labor Economics; what makes questions important and interesting; how to read a paper and think about its contributions.",
    "I gained an understanding of various topics and modelling in labour economics.",
    "I learned a lot about the structural modeling, and especially enjoyed the matching and searching model, inter generational mobility and marriage market topics. I learned a lot about why structural work is important to answer policy relevant questions and techniques to empirically estimate and conduct the counterfactual analysis in the structural model.",
    "I gained insights into how the labour models work, and especially with regards to how structural models are built and calibrated."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I liked that the course covered a variety of topics, even if it came at the cost of deeply understanding any one of them. I do not expect labor economics to be my primary field of study, but I think that this exposure to a variety of models and methods used within the field will help me identify opportunities to improve my future research by applying a 'labor model'.",
    "One strength of the course is combine both the classical literature with recent papers in the frontier of the field.",
    "Strengths include motivating the material. Weaknesses include covering the econometrics used in papers too quickly. It could be improved by selecting a few papers whose techniques (e.g. method of moments) are explained step-by-step.",
    "Strengths: Interesting content and helpful advice on conducting research. Opportunities for student presentations. Weaknesses: I would have liked more focus on the estimation of the models we discussed. Although I understand that our time was limited.",
    "The strength of the course is that we learned so many various topics in the labor economics. Therefore, we can find specific topics that are interesting to us for our own research. Also, the reading group helps us a lot to have an access to the cutting edge research, because without the reading group, it may have been difficult for me to figure out which paper I should read first.",
    "This is an interesting class. Toward the end, there was a focus on the motivation behind the models, and it would have been helpful to have that earlier in the semester. The only problem with this class was that it always ended late, since almost all of us had another class almost directly after.",
    "Strengths- Clarity in the materials presented Weakness- More empirical motivations needed"

   "comments": [
    "I would strongly recommend this course to a student who is interested in using structural models to answer questions in labor economics. To a labor student not interested in employing structural estimation, this course may not be so useful, since the models and methods emphasized are definitely on the structural side. However, I would also not recommend this course to a student for the structural estimation alone (i.e. if the student was not interested in labor topics), since the course doesn't delve as deep into the practical side of estimation as, for example, the courses in IO and Cormac O'Dea's Public Finance.",
    "Yes",
    "Yes. I enjoyed being able to learn about up-and-coming topics in the reading group, and it was useful to practice presenting.",
    "I would recommend the course to students interested in concentrating in an applied microeconomics field.",
    "I recommend this course to other students interested in labor. The class deals with a lot of topics in the field of labor economics, and each topic is dealt deeply. I think this class can be especially helpful to students who are still searching for topics that are interesting to them.",
    "Yes"
