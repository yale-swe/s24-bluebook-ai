    "I developed a greater overall understanding of the Arab Spring as well as better grasp of the key actors.",
    "I gained a wide breadth of knowledge about the Arab Spring and its aftermath, and an ability to contextualize the current events in the MENA region within their historical\/cultural backdrops. I personally learned a great deal about how the US has come to shape its foreign policy in the Middle East. I also got to explore a few topics of my own through papers!"

   "comments": [
    "He could not do better. It is already excellent",
    "The reading material is well chosen. The student presentations were diverse and interesting. The writing assignments were reasonable and very well graded. In my opinion, Ambassador Ford needs to leverage his immense experience more during discussion. His insights into US policy and, especially, personalities within the government, would have been fantastic.",
    "The course was a great overview of the middle east policy landscape post Arab-Spring. I would have liked to have seen Ambassador Ford bring a little more personal experience into the course; I know he worries about \"storytime\" courses but he is so far away from that there is much to be gained from him sharing his experience. The class works well as a seminar but was a bit too large this semester, making the seminar format a bit difficult.",
    "The most significant strength of this course is its structure. Ambassador Ford poses key questions about the reading, and guides us through a set of different ideas put forth by the classmates. He clearly spends a lot of time preparing for each of his classes, and it really shows. I always felt like I left the class having learned something new and having asked questions I did not necessarily ask myself when I was doing the readings. The readings are rigorous, informative, and diverse. The mix of Global Affairs\/Law students worked really well too. I do, however, think that the class could be a tad bit smaller. That way, discussions could be a bit more focused."

   "comments": [
    "Yes. You do not need to know anything about the topic. Ambassador Ford will immerse you into the political and economic landscape of the Middle East and you will come back with the necessary elements to understand US policy in the region and power dynamics",
    "Definitely. The course is very interesting. The effects of the Arab Spring continue to reverberate through the Middle East and North Africa and will do so for decades to come.",
    "Yes. Ambassador Ford is an incredible teacher and provides extremely valuable feedback on writing which is rare in the Graduate School.",
    "Absolutely, one of the best courses I've taken at Yale by FAR. If you have even a remote experience\/interest in the MENA region, I highly recommend you to take this course. You will never regret it.",
    "Yes, one of the best courses I've taken at Yale. The professor does an excellent job."
