    "I LOVED this class! Jonathan is the best stats professor I have ever had. I have tried various stats classes over the years, at various universities, and Jonathan is by far the ONLY statistics professor who makes the subject intuitive.This class was invaluable to me, and will be useful to anyone who wants to do quantitative research. I highly recommend it to everybody. The professor is very approachable, and very knowledgeable about the subject material.",
    "Professor is very engaging and clear, and is quick to take a different explanatory approach if students get stuck",
    "Jonathan delivers great and energetic lectures that make the subject more interesting than it would otherwise be.",
    "I would recommend Jonathan Reuning-scherer's class for anyone who needs a foundational understanding of statistics especially if you've had negative experiences with math and stats in the past. I also recommend his class as a brush up if you've been away from the tools for a while. His methods stray from conventional and it's exactly what the doctor ordered!",
    "Prof R-S is very hardworking and genuinely wants to help people learn. He comes to class prepared, energetic, and creates an interactive dynamic to process material. He is accommodating for students and always tried to connect concepts to practical examples.I think the notes pages that he created are incredibly helpful.Coco basically for the first half of the course gave us the answers to the homeworks in the TA sessions. Then she redesigned her approach to respond to student questions - I ended up learning a lot more.",
    "The instructor is truly great, but the rhythm of the class is extremely fast, and key concepts are lost.",
    "N\/A",
    "I thought JDRS was fantastic: more than most other profs I've had at Yale, he really went out if the way to make himself accessible to students. I don't know how he managed to make time to work with all the students on our projects, but he did! I thought his teaching style was generally great: I appreciated how he paid attention to the mood of the class and slowed down, etc. if we needed it.That said, I do wish we had actually had a required textbook, and have had our problem sets from a book. I know that's a bit boring, but I often felt myself unsure where to look if I got stuck on a homework problem. It would have been nice to have our Psets match a book that we could use for reference, and it would have also helped to be able to do similar problems that weren't assigned and check our answers (the odd or even numbered questions in a book that usually have the answers). Overall fantastic class though!",
    "This course was very valuable for gaining an understanding of the statistical tools to analyze data. JDRS is a very engaging lecturer and kept class interesting.",
    "excellent class, excellent professor.",
    "Professor Reuning-Scherer made Statistics fun and more interesting than I would imagine a standard Stats class to be. My one complaint would be with his office hours. People would sign up online but no one abided by the rules, including him. I would have liked more one-on-one time with him wihtout the fear of another student needing his help. In the future, it would be beneficial to his students if he had an equal number of \"drop-in\" hours where anyone could come by and meetings with his students that people had to sign up for.",
    "Very useful to all of us irrespective of our academic background.",
    "I got really lost during lectures sometimes. I'm not sure that it's in his best interest to just keep trudging along after we're not able to answer any of his questions anymore. I wish we could simplify things a little more and not rely as much on reading through the notes. Minitab examples helped a lot.",
    "Question 4: Although Professor JDRS was excellent, he tended to cover concepts a bit too fast. Students were generally able to keep up, but when it came to more complex concepts, it was more difficult to follow.",
    "Question 4: I liked the sense of momentum in this class. The professor did not get bogged down in excessive detail, and challenging concepts seemed less so due to the pace with which we moved through them. However, in some cases it would have been helpful to slow down and deal with the painstaking concepts more fully.",
    "The class was very well structured, the homework was linked to the lectures, and the professor was always available for questions. Excellent class! The teaching assistants were not very committed to the class and during office hours were more willing to give us the answers rather than to explain the problems to us. I think that next time around the TAs should be chosen more carefully.",
    "JDRS is incredibly accessible, approachable, dedicated to the course, and understands the needs of the students! I really wanted to take this class--wanted the tools to approach my dataset!!--and even so, it exceeded my expectations",
    "Prof. Reuning-Scherer is a talented and dedicated professor. The course covered too much material for most students and could be pared down some. It's unclear if the material will be useful to me in the future. Overall it is a very good intro to stats class.",
    "The main issue for me was the pace of the course. When I was able to understand the material, it was really useful, but towards the last few weeks of the semester, either the pace increased, and\/or the difficulty of the material did, and I really struggled to keep up (despite re-reading the notes, trying to decipher my textbook, etc.) So, the instruction was really useful, but very fast. This increased my frustration with office hours, where the TAs were doing their best to quickly get around to everyone, and more detailed explanations of the material (versus quicker questions about the homework) didn't seem as possible.",
    "The professor is extremely approachable and keeps students entertained with a great sense of humor. However, I felt that sometimes the lectures moved too fast- especially the section on probability. I would either devote another week to probability or remove it from the class altogether. Or, alternatively, assign students problems that are a bit easier \/ rudimentary. Having finished the course, I do not feel I have a strong grasp of the material. Having said that, I'm not sure that this is the point of an intro-level stats class. I have come to the conclusion that most learning in stats comes from doing lots of applications\/homeworks. The class would be better if it were limited to say 25 students or so, so as to give more individualized student attention during lectures.",
    "Prof. Reuning-Scherer is one of the best professors I have had in my Yale career. He knew the material so well and knew the best methods to teach the material to new statisticians. I was always energized in class because he was and he kept his audience engaged in every way he could. His review games were very helpful and appreciated and I think he is an incredible educator.",
    "Maybe place the textbooks on reserve at CSSSI? I ended up checking one out (and using it!), but I felt badly for depriving other students access to the book.",
    "We covered a lot of material in the class and it could be difficult to keep up. The main challenge for me was understanding the reasoning behind why we were using a type of analysis. JDRS is great at making stats engaging, but it could get overly campy, and I found it frustrating when we heard \"but you don't really need to know why we do this\" over and over again. I respected the fact that you'd need to skim over things to cover the amount of material we did, but at the same time, it was frustrating to cover so much and yet not feel like we had enough time to really delve into why you would use the different tools.",
    "The professor, Jonathan Ruening-Scherer, is an excellent professor. he made himself available through almost all means possible: email, cell-phone (text or call) and I believe even skype. He held numerous office hours and often extended them past their durations when students like myself had additional questions. Very reasonable, understanding professor and good at making complex subjects more digestible and easy to understand. I really give this guy my highest ratings, he helped me a lot through this class and with good lecture and I wish I had gone to his office hours more frequently. My only complaint is that the course moved too fast; it covered too much in one semester and I'm not sure that I've been able to absorb enough of the information this way. This class might be more practical if it was spread over two semesters.",
    "I think I would have internalized more information and taken away more from the class had there been more working time in class, instead of just lectures where students were simply recipients of information."

    "The professor was probably the best I've had at FES (I'm a second year so I've had a few). He took potentially dull material and made it entertaining and understandable, had tons of office hours, and was very responsive via email. I learned a lot and I really credit Reuning-Scherer with helping me understand what I'm doing and why. I took stats as an undergraduate and learned how to do things by hand and more of the mathematical theory, but I really didn't appreciate the wide world of methodologies or the what-to-use-when questions. This course was great.",

    "Jonathan is incredible accessible, willing to help, and energetic. He makes learning statistics a great experience.",
    "I learned more in the outside help sessions than in class. There are so many people for me it was tough to connect with the information, especially when I could just read the notes solo. That said, my comprehension of the material from solo reading of the notes pages was not sufficient. The office hours, TA sessions, and Q&A were awesome though to fill in gaps. This is more a comment on my learning style than the quality of the teaching. Prof R-S is impressive and dedicated and very smart.",

    "Clear and organized structure. Knew what to expect walking in the doors each day.",
    "This course helped familiarize me with the basic terms and concepts of statistical analysis, which will be helpful in my research.The best parts of the course were OF COURSE when Jonathan tells crazy stories to help us remember concepts.",
    "The best aspects from this course were the in class quiz and home work. They were very effective for me to apprehend the materials from the class. By having the quiz, I was able to review the course material in class. By having the home work, I was able to learn and think more on the material out side the class. They were also very effective to help me doing my exams.",
    "Professor Reuning-Scherer is an engaging instructor who manages to make statistics entertaining.",

    "Jonathan is an engaging teacher and makes every effort to make class fun and use interesting examples. It was a rare class when I didn't laugh at one of his jokes. Regarding the material, I thought having weekly problem sets really kept me up to speed on the material so by the end of the course, I at least knew where to find everything if I needed to use an analysis for my final project.",

I would also love more basic comprehension check questions on the homework like those that are used in the review sessions. A lot of the homework is completing tasks while the review questions test to see if you understand them. Peppering these questions into lecture more or assigning just a couple simple questions on the homework would have helped me make sure I got the Main Points and helped me connect the dots.",

    "The professor and the TAs are NOT very accessible during the semester, excluding the final period for the final project, to the majority of the class. The proceedure for signing up for professor office hours was very confusing, and usually filled up so fast due to the quantity of students that there was no way to ask for help in the course until the very end. The open hours where anyone could come ask for help from the professor were limited compared to the 1 on 1, and as a result I did not find a space to discuss issues with the professor or TAs 1 on 1.Course should really use R or statistical package that is used more widely in the field, as much convenience in later statistics analysis will come from software knowledge not just the concepts. Feel that because we used Minitab the knowledge gained in this course will not be as helpful for future research.",
    "The pace of the course is very fast during the last 4 weeks, while it was fairly slow initially for simpler concepts. I think we could have used more time to learn more complex concepts, and gone over simpler statistics concepts (averages, standard deviation, etc.) faster.",
    "The TAs should have more office hours.",
    "The TFs were inconsistent in how they evaluated students.",
    "I think the TAs should be more involved--for example when we are doing exercises in class, it would have been great to have them go around the room to answer questions. Also during days when we were working on final project (all crowded in CSSSI) it would have been great to have more than JRS there so everyone could get help sooner.",
    "I think I would like a textbook for this course with some practice problems similar to the problem sets.",
    "Slow down! It's impossible to form questions in class when you're moving so fast! Also, I think lots of people say this, but sometimes the humor can drown out the important stuff. It often felt like I was in elementary school. Also, we were often let out of class up to 20 minutes early. Why not slow down the lecture to allow for more questions and let us out on time?",
    "The course moved too fast, it either should cover less topics with more detail or be spread out over two semesters. I could definitely say I need more training in statistics to be able call myself confident in the subject.",
    "Some of the lectures were too fast-paced, however there are plenty of opportunities to receive clarification outside of class."

Even in the last weekof the semester, he allocated many hours in Statlab to help us doing our homework. I took Stat in my undergraduate, and it was boring.

    "I did not seek one on one support from any of the TFs, so my only commentary pertains to grading. One strength is that they were all timely in grading and returning our assignments. A weakness is the lack of consistency across how many points were deducted for incorrect answers.",
    "I think the TAs may have been overwhelmed by the sheer number of students in the class; it could be hard to find time to have them explain a concept in detail, but they did a good job trying to get around to everyone, and were very patient with all of our questions. I think it helped to have had taken the course before becoming a TA; Coco is really nice and very, very smart, but sometimes she wasn't able to address how a question fit into our coursework or understand where our questions were coming from, since she wasn't as familiar with the course material or with what we had or hadn't learned. This also made it harder for me to fit her explanations back into the course content.",
    "Teaching fellows were unable to explain probability problems clearly.",

She is so helpful and nice and was great at helping students who were all worked up calm down and work through problems carefully.",

Class lectures also move very quickly, so come caffeinated and well-fed and ready to learn.JDRS is a dedicated professor who really knows his stuff. He definitely goes into the nitty gritty of why and how various statistical tools work the way they do, however, so be prepared for that. You will start to be able to tease out which parts of the lecture are critical and which parts are background information.By the end, you will have a comprehensive, albeit surface level, understanding of basic statistical tools.
