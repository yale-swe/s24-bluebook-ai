    "Great! It's going to be scene study regardless, and Joan is smart and has a lot to share.",
    "A scene study class. Three scenes are done throughout the semester at advanced focus and level. I would recommend this class- you learn a lot.",
    "I would definitely recommend it to someone looking for a bread-and-butter scene study course. However, what you get out of it depends largely on who the professor is, so do your research before you pick one! Also, the class is mostly made up of Theater Studies majors, so that's something to be aware of.",
    "This was one of my favorite classes I've taken at Yale. The class was entirely scene study, and it was small enough that we quickly bonded and were all given enormous amounts of personal attention. I love close scene study, and Joan had a fantastic balance between specifically directing bits of our scenes and also asking us the right questions to discover motivations for ourselves, as well as always welcoming input from the rest of the class (allowing us to learn how to improve not just our own acting, but each other's). Joan is the warmest and most considerate professor I've ever had, and being in class with her was a constant joy.",
    "Intermediate Acting with Prof. MacIntosh will help you to know when your acting is sincere and when it is not. Prof. MacIntosh's greatest strength as a teacher is her ability to identify the moments when you are \"acting\" as opposed to those when you are living the life of your character. As an actor, that is an invaluable tool to have at your disposal. However, if you choose to take this course,you should supplement your learning by reading plays outside the Western tradition (Stanislavsky, Meisner, etc.) and by taking part in campus theatre life. This course teaches you important acting skills but it doesn't teach you everything you need to know and it won't give you the practice that you will need to internalize what you learn in the classroom. Take this course with the intent of improving your acting, not with the intent of becoming an actor",
    "I would recommend it if you are a theater studies student interested in taking a performance class. I enjoyed my semester.",
    "Building on 210, this course features mainly scenework from different great playwrights. We focused on Chekov, Tennessee Williams, and Tony Kushner and Caryl Churchill. A really relaxed classroom atmosphere with some very exciting moments. Joan is a great teacher, and it's amazing to have the opportunity to work with a Yale School of Drama instructor as an undergrad. You get to know your classmates really well and to grow as a performer. I think I got to know my classmates really well and grew as a performer and have many new tools with which to approach my acting work. I only wish we'd had more time to spend on all of the scenes!"
