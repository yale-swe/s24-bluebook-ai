    "I gained an appreciation for the richness of PDEs. As a physics major, this class was really unifying in my college experience and I don't understand why it isn't required for the major. In E&M and Quantum you learn how to solve Maxwell's equations and Schrodinger's equation, but you don't get much of a sense of the theory behind doing it. They are just special cases. This class helps to unify the concept of PDEs and their study."

    "I feel like we could spend more time at the beginning of the term on first-order PDEs. As it stood, we didn't really spend any time on them. This would give better intuition for the rest of the term - particularly when trying to understand characteristics or semilinear\/quasilinear equations.",
    "Put in more numerical solutions at the end- given that only special PDE's seem to have analytic solutions, it would be good to see methods to solve more complex equations we see in research"

    "This course used to be terrible, but if Manas is still teaching it then it should be better. The lecture is good, but you will still probably find yourself learning from the textbook which is fairly well written (the textbook is Partial Differential Equations: An Introduction by Walter Strauss). There are fairly lengthy psets every other weak and optional psets in between. No one really did the optional psets (they weren't collected) but a lot of the test material comes from them, so it would be a good idea to at least look at them. You can take this course without really having taken a course on ODEs as long as you have a physicist's understanding of ODEs.",
