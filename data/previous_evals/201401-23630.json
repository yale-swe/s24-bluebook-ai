   "comments": [
    "You will learn a lot about Precolumbian cultures and work with ancient objects every week. High recommended for anyone interested in the art, time period, or a break from the Western lens.",
    "The course follows and interesting trajectory that sometimes focuses on time period or region and sometimes addresses cultural property disputes and the art market. Assignments are fairly self-directed and allow you to explore areas of interest in depth. Readings are not central to discussion and of course vary in quality.",
    "A good class, but rather disorganized. I wish we had spent a few weeks in the beginning of the semester actually talking about Ancient American art, rather than diving straight into museum politics. I came out of the class feeling like I knew more about trade agreements and archaeological looting than the art itself. Not that this is a bad thing- I actually loved those discussions! I feel like I look at museum exhibitions with a much more critical eye now. However, this was a class directed towards students with no prior experience with AA art, and I'm not sure it should have been.",
    "This was by far one of my favorite classes at Yale. Every seminar felt like a field trip (not to mention you take a trip to the Met and Natural History Museum in NYC). The class is taught in the YUAG, both in the gallery and in an object classroom, so you really get to interact with the art that you study. Dean Miller is such a fantastic seminar leader and is so knowledgeable. There is not too much reading, but Dean Miller will make sure that you work on your writing to develop the skills to craft a museum exhibit (object labels and wall texts). Even if the timing of the class (Thursday night, when the gallery is open late) might not be the most appealing, you cannot pass up the opportunity to take this class."
