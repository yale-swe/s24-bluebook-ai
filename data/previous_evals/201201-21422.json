    "ANTH 242 was a great non-science major science credit. We covered a wide variety of topics in biological anthropology, ranging from adolescence, menopause, stress, energetics, male senescence, pregnancy, etc. The information was relatively accessible to people with a wide variety of academic backgrounds and to both genders. Professor Bribiescas was also great, so I would most definitely recommend this course to other students.",
    "This is an excellent course. The professor is very engaging and entertaining. the lectures are very informative and interesting and the exams are a good reflection on the material that was covered. i would definitely recommend this course.",
    "I took it for a basic science\/bio class and got what I hoped for. That said, it is more work than similar classes (read Issues Approach), and you might be better served taking that class if you really really don't care for the material.",
    "An interesting course with good lectures in which I learned a lot about human reproduction, but the course expectations were unrealistic and discouraging. Prof. Bribiescas assumes a much more detailed biology background than many students in this class had, especially since this is a course without a science prerequisite. The exams are harshly graded and require a ton of memorization in order to do well, which to me seems like a less meaningful way of learning. He also refuses to curve grades up.Also, we had an issue with the second midterm in the class which has made me pretty wary of his grading. He told us it would only cover the material in lectures after the first midterm. By accident, he made 2 of the 15 questions about material from before the first midterm. When students pointed this out, he said that we wouldn't be penalized for missing those questions. I thought that meant the questions would be extra credit or something. However, he graded the exams as if nothing had happened. He says that he'll take the lost points into account in final grades for the course, but this doesn't seem like it will help much.I would only recommend this course to students with a college biology background.",
    "Surprisingly difficult and awkwardly taught.",
    "Great course on life history theory and evolutionary biology! This course provides a great complement to traditional evolutionary theory courses.",
    "If you're looking for a science credit it's interesting but hard. Don't take it.",
    "DO NOT TAKE FOR A SCIENCE CREDIT. take it for a social science credit as a science major.",
    "Yes - Prof. Bribiescas is one of the most engaging biological anthropologists at Yale, and his lectures really are interesting. This is a great class that covers basic everyday phenomenon (exercise, reproduction, why women put on weight more quickly than men, diet, fertility, etc.) and provides understandable explanations based on evolution. Great course if you're the type to be interested in why humans are the way we are... lectures are enjoyable, only 2 midterms (multiple choice\/short answer) and 1 final, readings are VERY manageable and very few throughout the semester. You need to study for the exams, but this is a perfect 5th course to do credit\/D. Also a recommend course for non-science students to get their science credit.",
    "Yes. This is a great Sc credit for anyone. You'll find yourself talking about the subject material in random conversations.",
    "This was a great science credit. There is no section, and no problem sets. The only piece of homework is the reading, which is very light. The lectures are very engaging and fun. Lastly, there is not an outrageous amount of memorization; the entire class goes more like a long chain of cause and effect.",
    "Just make sure you stay on top of the readings for the midterms. Two midterms and one cumulative final that drew from pretty much everything.",
    "I would not recommend this course to another student.",
    "I would recommend this class but I would encourage looking for either a smaller lecture size or a freshman\/sophomore seminar if you're interested in the subject or in need of a science credit. Overall an interesting class but not one to write home about.",
    "Not that bad if you're looking for a relatively easy science credit. It is important to go to lecture (the slides aren't very useful, as I unfortunately learned) so if you want a class where going to lecture is optional, look elsewhere. Otherwise, the material is interesting, the reading load is light, and the tests are pretty straightforward as long as you study a bit.",
    "Take this if you want to learn about evolutionary biology without taking evolutionary biology. This isn't a gut. You have to pay attention and do the reading and study a lot. There's not a ton to study and learn, but you really need to be conscientious to do well. I learned that the hard way after the first midterm. Also, go to Bribiescas's office hours!!!",
    "I thoroughly enjoyed this class (as a non-science-major junior, who was looking to fulfill a final science credit!). The content is relevant for anyone who is interested in human lives and who wants to be able to bust out some reproduction-related facts when the conversation hits a low point. The lectures are enjoyable, and you can get away with not doing the reading regularly before class, BUT grades are totally determined by 2 midterms and the final, which are very fact-and-figure-oriented, also drawing from the readings, so if you are lazy about reviewing throughout the term, like I was, cramming is hell! That said, I would recommend this class for anyone who, like me, is interested in science but definitely not a sciencey person, and who isn't too squeamish about hearing some gnarly parasite horror stories!",
    "Yes, especially for those looking for a science credit with relevance to non-majors. Athletes will find this interesting.",
    "Fairly easy science credit. All you really need to do is go to class and take notes. Actually study for the midterms though. they're trickier than you think. I kind of bombed the first one.",
    "This is a really cool class where you will learn some really interesting stuff about human evolution and the way it shapes our lives today. I would recommend taking it credit\/d though because the midterms and final are rather tricky since they involve memorizing a lot of graph. Also, some of the information seems intuitive, but you really do have to study a lot to know everything. Finally, readings are really NOT optional.",
    "I enjoyed this class. I really loved learning about the course material (but I've always been very much interested in human evolution). The course material is detailed so be prepared to spend some time studying. That being said, if you're interested in the topics of the class studying it isn't an incredible hassle -- some of it is intuitive. The bottom line is that this class isn't a gut science course, but it is a worthwhile class to take if you're willing to put in the effort and are fascinated by the course material.",
    "This is a great introduction to human life history. It will give you a much better sense of the factors influencing human evolution. Professor Bribiescas is an engaging lecturer and very knowledgeable.",
    "There are certainly easier science for non science major credits out there.",
    "Good lectures. Interesting material. A small amount of the science seemed a little suspect (e.g., N too small).",
    "Great science credit. Not a guy but worth it.",
    "Awesome class. Take it!",
    "Anthro 242 is a great overview of human evolutionary biology and it's pretty easy. Just two midterms and a final, all of which just require that you study notes from the lectures. Be warned though: while the powerpoints do get posted online they are not at all helpful when it comes to studying, you really have to attend lecture in order to know the information that you will be tested on.",
    "Take the class because it touches upon a lot of different aspects of human evolution and biodiversity. It is truly interesting and good to have in your background when thinking about life and all its wonders.",
    "I was sorely disappointed by this class. It lacked rigor and the teaching was uninspiring.",
    "If you're interested in the material, yes. It's all tests, so you might get tempted to skip lecture\/get behind in the readings, but the tests are HARD. If you keep up with everything you'll be ok (but not necessarily getting an A). The good news is that besides being an engaging teacher, Professor Bribiescas is a genuinely nice guy, and is very receptive to questions. My biggest complaint is that he wasn't there for the tests (there was a proctor), so there was no way to clear up unclear questions.",
    "Good survey of biological anthropology. Three tests, no other assignments. Professor Bribiescas is a great person and a great lecturer. Good SC.",
    "Yup",
    "Yes, but I would encourage them to consider that the readings must be read carefully, and the student must be willing to memorize a lot of specifics, particularly for the final.",
    "This course was a great survey in many important topics of evolutionary biology and anthropology. From the syllabus one might conclude this is an easy course in terms of workload (2 midterms and 1 exam), but be wary; the curve is not on your side since most students do really well on exams. I would recommend that you go to lectures, because Professor Bribiescas is extremely engaging and passionate, and you end up on much better grounds when preparing for exams. Professor Bribiescas proclaims to be partial to graphs on exams, but also prepare for problems that are based on very specific parts of readings. There are few \"big picture\" questions, so the emphasis is on rigorously and comprehensively preparing for all materials taught in the course. Do not take shortcuts (as I did by just skimming the readings) or your grades will suffer (as mine did). I would recommend this course on the grounds that: 1) it is well-taught, 2) it is interesting, and 3) the material is very important for a better understanding of how we came to be, and what we will become in the future. I would caution against: 1) skipping lectures, 2) putting off the readings",
    "Take it! It's not just really interesting material--it's about your own body and culture and how they work. Genes and environment. YES.",
    "It is hardly what most people would expect from an Anthropology class. It is much more focused on Biology and a lot of its themes overlap with medicine and other natural sciences. One plus is that there is no textbook and the readings are all recent publications on the subject, which can be more engaging for most people. I'd recommend it to anyone looking for a science credit or interested in how medicine and human life and health can be understood from an evolutionary perspective. The workload is not heavy, and the tests are not the most challenging."
