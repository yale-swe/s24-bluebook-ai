    "Psych 110 is an intro course that covers all aspects of psychology (clinical, developmental, neuro). It is a lot of work but a very fun class. Tests are hard but if you work hard your work will pay off.",
    "Intro psych--pretty basic. The material was interesting, and the class was well organized. The degree of detail that the professor tested on the exams was kind of ridiculous, and seemed to be a symptom of her being a 1st time professor. But overall the class was pretty good. I would try to take it with one of the bigger professors though--Professor Olson definitely fell prey to some of the typical pitfalls of being a 1st year professor trying to prove herself. Her tests were ridiculously detailed as if shewas trying to prove that in her class you have to do the reading. But intro psych is a really interesting class and it's necessary if you want to be a psych major. Plus it's a pretty good way of deciding if psychology is something that interests you.",
    "I would recommend psych 110 to anyone who wants to go into the field, but i wouldn't recommend it to someone who wasn't really interested in the material. It's by no means an easy class so you have to be really committed to learning about the different fields.",
    "HIGHLY, TRULY, WHOLEHEARTEDLY NOT RECOMMENDING THIS CLASS!",
    "Take it. If I had taken it earlier I would have probably doubled in psych.",
    "Psychology 110 is a great introductory course that touches on many different aspects of the field of psychology. I would recommend this course to any student, as it covers very interesting and thought-provoking material, regardless of whether or not you are interested in pursuing the field of psychology.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student. If you want to take Intro to Psych without there being 500 kids in the class, it is better to take it with Dr. Olson. You must be prepared to attend all the lectures and do all the reading or else you are in BIG trouble on the test. The papers don't require any research and the tests are okay as long as you study.",
    "Highly recommended.",
    "You must take this while at Yale!",
    "I would definitely recommend it even if you're not thinking of majoring in psychology. It's truly a great course.",
    "Psychology 110 is a class that is a broad survey of specific Psychology fields. I'd recommend it.",
    "Basically there are 2 lectures a week, including topics such as Memory, Learning, Personality, Love, Religion, Cognitive Neuroscience, Clinical Psychology and more.There are 4 essays you can write, of which only the best 2 counted - these are always opinion based essays, so there is no right or wrong answers, and the topics are usually very fun to write about.Apart from that there are occasional class questions (you can't get these wrong - it is basically testing whether you attended the lecture) and three non-cumulative tests which each count 25% of your grade. The tests are fair - focusing on mostly on the big ideas and covering each topic discussed equally.All lectures are fun and you feel like you have learned a lot at the end of the semester. TAKE THIS CLASS with Professor Olson if you can!",
    "If you are interested in psychology, you will probably like this class. The studies are really interesting, and after intro, you can take classes more focused on one area of psychology now that you have learned about them all and know what you like.",
    "Would definitely recommend this course to any student looking to get a relatively easy introduction to the field of psychology. As long as you do the readings and keep track of videos\/demonstrations shown in lecture, you're pretty much set.",
    "It's an overview of psychology. I would readily recommend it.",
    "Your average Psychology 110, just how you would expect the class to be like. I would recommend this class to anyone who was going to take Psychology 110 anyway.",
    "A decent intro to psych class. Lectures are interesting. Pretty heavy on reading and the tests come down to rogue memorization though.",
    "Great Intro. Course--Definitely take it even if you aren't a psych major!",
    "Though I won't be a Psych major, I'm glad I took this class. It was really interesting overall - I never skipped a lecture, partially because that would completely screw me over for the tests and partially because they were never boring. If you are planning on majoring in Psych, the class is a good introduction, and Prof. Olson gave the class ample suggestions for people within Yale to contact about working in labs.",
    "Pysch 110 is a broad intro to the whole field of psychology and encompasses a lot of topics, so even if you're not interested in the topic of one lecture, the next one is likely to be quite different. I'd definitely recommend this class to someone else, I thought it was fun and not too much work.",
    "An amazing \"must-take\" class while you're at Yale. It's one of those rare classes in which the professor, the material, and the real-life experience you're required to have to pass the class are all equally relevant, engaging, useful, and interesting. Professor Olson is by far one of the fairest and most dedicated instructors you could possibly dream up. C'mon, just do it. Do it to change your perspective on the world and life in general.",
    "It's a great, interesting class! Take it!",
    "Yes. It is a productive and broad introduction to psychology. It gives you a good sense of what's out there in the field and allows you to assess your interests in psychology, and to begin focusing them on more specific subsets of the field.",
    "I would recommend it! Kind of a must-take at Yale.",
    "I would recommend this class to another student. It's not to straining and you'll actually enjoy the material.",
    "I would recommend Intro Psych to anyone because it's a great survey course that covers all aspects of psych and gives you a chance to see if the major is for you. Kristina Olson was great because her tests were fair and she was a great lecturer. The workload is manageable, with three tests and two short papers, but it is more work than most intro classes.",
    "Take it. It's interesting and fun. A little tough but if you read and study for the midterms you can do well",
    "In Psychology 110 01 you will get a broad overview of psychology. As someone who never took a psychology course in high school, I took the course to see if the field is something that I am interested in. I would definitely recommend it, because the guest lectures expose you to many different fields and it really highlights all that Yale has to offer in the way of studies and research opportunities.",
    "This is an interesting class and not too hard.",
    "Absolutely take this class. It is engaging, interesting, and makes for great conversation with your friends. The reading is moderate but fairly easy, and the subjects are fascinating. Professor Olson is great. She's so enthusiastic and I looked forward to her lectures.",
    "Yes if you are interested in psychology",
    "Engaging course, interesting subject. I'd recommend that everyone take it, if just to gain some insight into the workings of the mind.",
    "As one would expect of an intro course, this course embodies the phrase \"jack of all trades, master of none.\" This course is much more about memorization that any deep conceptual understanding, but definitely full of interesting material. Worth taking, but will leave you begging for more.",
    "covers the foundation of psych. straight forward. more than average amount of work but not absurd if you stay on top of it",
    "Good class but take good lecture notes if you have Olson. Most of the studies on the test come from lecture not the book. If you're not good at taking notes, take Credit\/D",
    "Psychology 110 with Kristina Olson is a decent introductory psychology course, but the paper topics are plentiful and not necessarily related to the course material or psychology at all for that matter.",
    "I would recommend it.",
    "I would recommend this class to another student because the material is interesting and useful. But he or she should know that this class is sort of a lot of work, reading, papers, exams, etc. If you aren't great at memorizing or simply don't have the time, beware.",
    "YES! Why not!? The stuff you'll learn in intro psych is great to know for anything, not just for a major or a preprofession.",
    "Psychology 110 01 gives you a great basic understanding of Psychology. There's a fair amount of work, but because the material is so enjoyable, its really not bad! Clearly, I would definitely recommend this class.",
    "Psych 101 is a must-take before graduating from Yale. The material you learn is incredibly relevant to daily life and any career path you might be considering. Furthermore, the course is well-organized in terms of reading versus lecture - the two tie into one another, but you still learn new material from doing each one. I would definitely recommend it to another student.",
    "Yes! It is a really fun interesting class although it has a little more work than other classes I took at the time.",
    "Hard tests with a lot of info. Class questions - you need to put thought into these to get a check plus. I thought the papers were easily graded. Very interesting lectures, but a lot of extra reading.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. Psych 110 is a prereq for all other psych classes so if you have to take it definitely take it with Professor Olson!",
    "Very very enjoyable course. Take it with this woman.",
    "yes I would recommend it because it is interesting and that makes the work load not so bad",
    "A good, interesting, general subject to take as a freshmen.",
    "This class is very interesting. You will learn about a wide variety of subjects in a short matter of time. This class has a lot of reading. If you do the reading and study hard you will do fine. The tests are hard.",
    "The course covers the basic history, principles, and theory of Psychology. The material moves fairly quickly, but because nearly all of it is interesting the speed is manageable. I strongly recommend this course to all students because you won't regret it.",
    "I thought it was overall a good class. The material was interesting but the tests had a lot of picky stuff from the textbook. I thought the workload was manageable.",
    "It's a great class that you should definitely take if you get the chance. Profs. Marvin Chun and Paul Bloom get all the hype for this course, but take it with Prof. Olson!",
    "PSYCH 110 is a fantastic introductory course to the field of psychology. It spans a wide range of topics - the history of psychology, social psych, clincal psych, emotion, love and many more - and Professor Olson is fantastic.",
    "I would recommend this class. Very interesting material. Be prepared to read a lot though.",
    "Yes. Interesting and lively lectures and well-organized.",
    "The material is pretty interesting, but lectures by Kristina Olsen tend to get monotonous. Exams are extremely doable if you know all the material. There is, however, a lot of material to learn for the exam.",
    "Yes, I would recommend Psych 110 to my fellow students. It's a great course. You should take it regardless if it's applicable to your major or not. A lot of the things you learn in the course are great icebreakers at parties. If you go to those kinds of parties.",
    "Definitely would recommend this to another student. Anyone interested in learning about the way we humans think should take this course.",
    "Unless you are interested in majoring in Psychology, do not take this course unless you take it Credit\/D\/Fail. The tests are hard, and the material they cover is too expansive to get through unless you are truly interested in it.",
    "I would recommend it as a great introduction to the different aspects of the subject.",
    "Psych 110 is a great introductory class to psychology. A wide variety of topics are covered, and these samples help you decide what specific psychology classes you want to take in the future. This class is for those who are willing to keep up with a lot of reading. The exams are challenging,and the papers are very manageable. It is a demanding yet fascinating class.",
    "I really liked Intro Psych. The workload was very, very manageable--a few short papers, 3 exams that were not too bad, and no final (though I'm sure this depends on the instructor).Obviously Marvin Chun and Paul Bloom are the hotshot professors for Intro Psych, and if you can take it with them, then you probably should. But Professor Olson was friendly, substantive, and on her way to becoming a really, really great professor, as well.Overall, Psych is a great class to take simply for the amazing number of random tidbits of information you'll learn, and you always walk out of class debating some study from the lecture. I'd recommend intro psych to anybody.",
    "I would reccomend the course ifyou enjoy psychology and how the mind works. I would not reccomend the course if you are someone who prefers individualized attention. It's a big lecture course, so you wont get that.",
    "Psychology 110 is a broad introduction to various studies within the field. I would definitely recommend Psych 110 to another student, as this class is directly relevant to everyday life.",
    "Great intro course, and not a huge time commitment with respect to work. Make sure to do readings though, as these are not always covered in lecture, but are part of the exam.",
    "Great class if you are interested in the field. It is a difficult class, and there is a lot of memorization.",
    "YES YES YES, favorite class of the semester! The material covered is very interesting to anyone. You learn all these awesome things about life and why we do things the way we do, and how doing things a certain way effects us. Kristina Olson was a good lecturer and very understanding on a paper extension when I was ill.Do not underestimate the amount of reading and if you can do not save it until right before the midterms because you are actually expected to recall stuff from the reading. The 3 tests varied a lot in difficulty. 1) you were expected to know loads of tiny facts and names of people 2) much more broad 3) more scientific with some personal psychological ideas.Papers. These are not too bad, they vary a lot in topic so if you are sciency there was as chance to write lab report for example. Put some time into these because if you do well enough on your first ones you won't have to do the last one.Also...no final, which I guess makes up for all the midterms\/papers\/reading.",
    "this class is a lot of work. as is intro psych with any prof im sure. i heard the midterms with paul bloom were reaallly hard. kristina's tests are pretty fair but the grade for the class is 4 essays (top 2), 7 in-class questions (top 5), 3 midterms, and 5 hours of psych studies. no final.quite manageable, but a lot of reading too. the textbook is fun to read although again its a looottt of material. but you should prolly read it, since lectures are not completely parallel. (although close)kristina olson is a very strong lecturer, she's pretty funny, a nice person. it was her first year teaching this class and she did a great job! i never once fell asleep in this class.take it :) i enjoyed it a lot.",
    "Psychology 110 is a great introductory course for the field and is quite interesting. I would definitely recommend it to another student whether or not he is planning on majoring in psychology or not.",
    "Psychology 110 is basic Psych that introduces you to all the different branches of psychology and what it is used for. It also teaches the people who founded and developed psychology. I would recommend the course because it teaches what you need to know in an upbeat interesting way.",
    "Yes. Great for people who like psychology."
