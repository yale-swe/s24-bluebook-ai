    "Only necessary if premed or if you need it for your major.",
    "This course is somewhat engaging, and it's not too much work. DiMeglio is also great! This is much better than gen chem lab.",
    "TAKE IT. Orgo lab is a great experience! The atmosphere is really chill (get to know the people around your bench!), there's music playing, the techniques are not difficult, and percent yield isn't all that important. You'll learn a lot, andit will probably even help clear up some things from orgo lecture.",
    "YES- a great fun lab course",
    "CHEM 222L is a good laboratory class, but the grading method is not effective. I thought that the weekly reports and experiments were interesting and the material is fairly aligned with the concepts taught in CHEM 220.However, the way that this class is graded is absolutely absurd. Students must fixate on minor details like page numbers in order to do well. Instead of learning material, students are worrying about minor details that have nothing to do with lab techniques.Lastly, the information which is tested for the final exam is NOTHING like what I expected. I thought the final exam would be centralized around mythologies. Instead, I felt like I was taking a multiple-choice version of CHEM 220. The details tested were simply not appropriate.",
    "Obviously one of those 'don't take it unless you need it' classes, unless you're REALLY that curious about organic lab techniques. That being said, however, even if you DO need it, it's not that bad; for all I know, it could be MUCH MUCH worse. Just get to lab early (~20 min beforehand) to get everything set up and running before pre-lab lecture, and you can get out pretty early by around 3ish to do other more important things. Read the lab packet like a Bible and take note of every little formatting thing that it mentions, because those are the points you'll be docked off the most for (yeah, stupid, I know). But in the end they curve the grades for each TA, so it's not too bad. We'll see. Experiments are pretty interesting, though, if you like organic chemistry. I enjoyed doing the lab but hated all the busy work that came with handing stuff in.",
    "Do it only if you want to be pre-med or a science major. Also, taking it in your first term may not be a good idea, but it is doable. Brace yourself for bad grades.",
    "It's what you expect organic chemistry lab to be: mixing clear liquids to yield a clear product, washing beakers, analyzing results, writing lab reports, etc. The atmosphere in lab is very relaxed, as there's always music playing and the TAs are always willing to help. At first, lab might be confusing and difficult but it definitely grows on you--by the end of the semester your wet lab skills will have improved greatly and you might find yourself really enjoying doing labs.",
    "If you're a pre-med, you kind of have to take this course, but it is not at all that stressful once you get into the rhythm of things. Much friendlier than gen chem lab.",
    "I would take it only if you have to for a requirement (like premed). Otherwise, its way more stress than the 1\/2 credit is worth.",
    "The TA makes the lab. Not just in how he\/she grades the lab reports, but also in how the labs are run. My TA's enthusiasm was contagious, and made the lab experience so much more rewarding. On the other hand, a fellow suitemate who was also taking lab had a strict TA. In the end, what you learn will still be the same, and the TA you get is a luck of the draw. So this is just something to keep in mind.",
    "If the student is interested in research, I would highly recommend the class, as you learn the basic techniques that are constantly being used in lab. Even if the student is not interested in academic research, the course still provides the practical side of what is learned in lecture.",
    "This is actually a great course, which may be surprising since it a lab course. It is very well organized, and it is really nice because everyone works at their own pace. Unlike gen chem labs, people come in during staggered times so that everyone is working at different stages. It is genrally calmer and less competitive than gen chem labs. Also, they have the capabilities to be much quicker -- often I left before 2:30, but I was usually one of the first out.Professor DiMeglio is absolutely fantastic, and I feel like I really learned the techniques that we used in this course.",
    "It was overall a great course. You learn quite a bit, and have a bit of fun as well. I would definitely recommend it to another student.",
    "I would recommend this class if you like working in the lab. The actual lab work is fun and interesting, while the assignments can become repetitive and nit-picky. The assignments are graded strictly but I wouldn't let that keep you from taking the class.",
    "I recommend it. It's very relaxed (radio's on the whole time) and you learn a lot of chemistry techniques.",
    "Orgo lab's pretty good! It's kind of fun, not too hard, not too much work, and we always got out early. It really is half a credit.",
    "If you have to take a lab, this one is the way to go. It's really relaxed and you learn important techniques.",
    "Take it as a lab it is easy, and enjoyable and doing the Experimental Plans (EP's) though they may seem tedious actually help you understand what you're doing in the lab, and you're normally out by 3:30pm.",
    "Way better than CHEM 119L",
    "Yes - the lab is so much better than general chemistry lab and far more interesting.",
    "a necessary evil",
    "It's a decent lab, but it's one you should only take if you need to along with the semester 1 orgo class.",
    "The material in Chem 222L and Chem 224 (Freshman Orgo class) is not particularly related. Lab starts off with the assumption that you already know chem (because it has students from both freshman and sophomore orgo) so I was very disoriented for the first few labs. Keep in mind that the amount of time you spend on lab (any chem lab, not just organic) is definitely worth more than 0.5 credits. The greatest thing about first semester organic chem lab is that, unlike general chem, we aren't graded on accuracy. This means that, even if you have 18% yield (which, trust me, has happened before), you will not be penalized as long as you explain what went wrong. Also, for first semester at least, we only write one full lab report. Everything else you write are \"post-labs\" which are designed to build up to a full report. You get points off for the most pointless things (not numbering the page properly, etc.) but this more or less depends on the TA you get. I always find the actual lab stressful because I felt like the only freshman amid a bunch of sophomores. Try to actually read the lab beforehand or else risk making a stupid mistake and having to start the lab over. The lab course manual can be difficult to read at times; it's not organized very well. The final lab exam is easy enough as long as you study the exam prep questions at the end of each lab.",
    "The work can get repetitive and boring. A lot of pre and post lab work and lots of writing notes during lab. Overall not bad.",
    "Although I felt lost at the beginning of the semester, it wasn't too hard to get into the routine. PLs and reports take more time than you would expect and are graded harshly. Fortunately the success of the reaction doesn't matter, only the analysis.",
    "Lab courses are inevitably painful, but Chem 222 minimizes the pain. This course is definitely well-taught and I really liked both my instructor and my TA. We had no pre-lab quizzes and only one full lab report during the whole semester (we normally had post-lab assignments that were either discussion questions or partial lab reports). We also had to write EPs every week, which were mildly annoying but only took 60-90 minutes. Overall, I learned a lot and it seems to be much less painful than other lab courses at Yale, even if it still wasn't a pleasant experience.",
    "good lab class to take to introduce yourself to synthesis and analysis lab techniques",
    "Challenging and time consuming but not difficult. Yes I would recommend it because it is a great course.",
    "A solid lab course. The workload is not too heavy (no more than 2 or 3 hours per week), and the lab effectively teaches basic orgo technique. I would certainly recommend the course. It is worth noting, however, that the overlap with the Organic Chemistry lecture is minimal.",
    "I felt like I learned some very important techniques that I will be using in the future. It becomes much more enjoyable once you get used to finding your way around the lab.",
    "Not incredibly time consuming. The labs aren't incredibly interesting either, but odds are if you're taking this course it's because you have to. Not difficult to do well, just make an effort to answer all of the review questions at the end of the labs as you go along and you'll do fine on the final",
    "Great, very well structured class",
    "This is a great lab. There isn't that much work, and Professor DiMeglio is extremely nice and helpful. The lab is informative and fun, and the environment is relaxed. The radio is always on, and it really isn't a stressful lab or anything. I definitely recommend this lab to anyone taking organic chemistry.",
    "First term orgo lab meets once a week for 4 1\/2 hours - and depending on how quickly you work in the lab, you will be there between 2 and 4 hours each week. I love being in the lab because of the laid-back-but-feeling-important lab atmosphere and because hands-on chemistry is cool. Some people simply do not enjoy being in the lab. I strongly recommend this course to anyone inclined to enjoy lab work.Please note: the work load is definitely greater than half that of an average 1-credit course but less than that of a full 1-credit course.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class, because it enriches the classroom experience of organic chem.",
    "Not a bad lab at all. There is only one lab report and post-labs take hardly any time (under an hour). Pre-labs take about an hour a week.The final was not difficult, just make sure to study all the questions and have a general sense of each of the labs. Prof. DiMeglio was always nice and helpful and the TAs were also nice (that isn't always the case!). Lab is a relaxing place, you can take your time and still get out around 3:30-4:00 most weeks.Grading was very particular - pay attention to detail on all the assignments or you will be marked down.",
    "Orgo lab is very relaxed and the TA's are great! I started off not really liking the class, but towards the end, I enjoyed all the lab techniques I had learned.",
    "If you are looking to take it, you probably need to so you may not have that much of a choice. It's a pretty average amount of work but the grading is tough and they teach you absolutely no chemistry principles. You learn how to mechanically complete the labs but any theory you need to get from the lecture or outside research which is frustrating.",
    "Orgo lab was a very good class for setting a foundation for laboratory techniques. It's a great opportunity to learn how to assemble and write lab reports well, and the TAs and professor are very supportive of their students.",
    "I would recommend taking orgo lab only if you need it for pre-med or your major. It was a well-structured intro to organic chemistry lab, and was not too difficult or time-consuming, as far as labs go. You will definitely get more out of the class if you do the reading, even though it is possible to perform the labs without totally understanding the chemistry.",
    "Pretty chill class. The experiments are pretty interesting, and most of them will allow you to be out well before 5pm. Grading can get pretty nitpicky though. If you're planning on taking this, it's probably a requirement. This is one of the easier ones.",
    "One of the better labs. Can be fun if you make the most out of it.",
    "If you take 220 you should take the lab and it won't be a problem.",
    "You probably won't be taking this class for fun, but don't worry - like everyone says, this class is leaps and bounds better than general chemistry lab. The first few assignments take awhile because you have to get used to the formatting and picky details, but then they just become second nature. The labs are shorter, more interesting, and there were no titrations involved. This class is actually quite helpful for understanding some of the concepts that are brought up in lecture, so pay attention to the lab introductions in the manual.",
    "Yes, it's a good class. Interesting and rewarding. MUCH better than Gen Chem lab.",
    "A good introductory organic chemistry lab course. I would recommend taking it if it is required, but there are probably other labs where you can learn a lot more. Some of the experiments seemed pretty redundant, but I do feel better off from having taken it.",
    "Great lab! Chem labs are always daunting, but this one was a lot of fun. Really. The lab was really well organized, you get out early if you prepare beforehand and work efficiently, the workload is minimal compared to gen chem lab. It felt as though we were learning\/ doing useful things (we made aspirin once- pretty cool.) I was not a fan of orgo by any means, but this lab was infinitely better than the class.",
    "Great intro organic chemistry lab. I learned a lot and the amount of busy work was minimal, which is rare for lab courses at Yale. The course is efficient and you get out early most weeks. Overall SO much better than gen chem lab. You only have to write one full lab report. I really liked having post-lab assignments instead of full lab reports most weeks, because they asked questions that made students understand the main ideas behind what they were doing, but didn't require students to focus so much on the more tedious aspects and formal language of a lab report. There is a written final exam so you have to understand the concepts behind what you are doing all term.Finally, your experience will largely depend on your TA (I got a great one so it was really fun, as far as labs go).",
    "The workload doesn't seem to be worth only 0.5 credits. But if you're a science major or pre-med, you should take this course. Otherwise, you might consider taking other more enjoyable courses.",
    "This course is good at preparing you for lab techniques used in organic chemistry labs. This lab is much more enjoyable and better than the gen chem lab. Professor DiMeglio is absolutely wonderful and really does try and make this an enjoyable lab. Although the grading is tough, what you learn is useful.",
    "really great and although the pre-lab and post-lab assignments are tedious and take a long time, the lab itself is pretty enjoyable and you really learn a lot.",
    "Definitely take Organic Chemistry Lab with Professor DiMeglio! the workload for the course was very fair, with only one lab report over the entire semester. Most of the time the labs themselves could easily be completed in much less than the allotted 3 1\/2 hours. Dr. DiMeglio is also very accessible if you have questions about lab procedures or concepts.",
    "It is a typical lab course, but the workload is much less than that of General Chemistry and it is so much fun. I honestly enjoyed every experiment and all the lessons build upon themselves in a fun way. I didn't feel like I was doing work when I was in this lab course. I would recommend this course to anyone who is eligible to take it because it is so fun.",
    "You're not going to take this unless you have to (clearly), but even so, it's very reasonable for a chem lab. The workload isn't bad, and the final exam is easy.",
    "You're clearly going to take this class regardless of the course evaluations, you don't really have other options for orgo lab. but just so you know, this lab is much better than gen chem lab, you are done most days by 3pm and only have to do one full lab report!",
    "This lab is amazing! Especially when compared to gen chem. You really learn how to do the techniques, the write ups and EPs aren't so bad when you get used to them, and even the atmosphere of the lab is enjoyable! TAKE THIS CLASS",
    "Best lab course at Yale. Hands down.Not only is the material really interesting and relevant, but the lab reports aren't tedious or busywork. Each post-lab assignment is different and contributes to you learning how to write about organic chemistry without requiring a detailed, lengthy report each week like most other lab courses.",
    "Odds are, you're taking this lab because you have to. However, it was incredibly refreshing to look at this 3 hour block in my day without dreading the time, and the outside work was much more reasonable than Chem 116. As far as labs go, this was a good one.",
    "The lab very thoroughly covers organic laboratory techniques. I would strongly recommend this course to gather real life applications of what happens in organic lecture.",
    "Good class. You would usually only take this for some kind of requirement.",
    "It helps with Organic Chemistry and is not too bad a lab.",
    "fun, but the TA's are very focused on details",
    "Tough but very interesting.",
    "It's not necessary",
    "Take it. It's not that bad.",
    "The lab itself is very easy; all of the experiments were fun to perform and relatively safe, although there was one experiment with a very corrosive chemical that was a little unsettling. However, if you pay attention, the course is very rewarding. Grading can be very harsh, so it really depends on what TA you have. Christine DiMeglio, the professor, is delightful and extremely helpful.",
    "This course is useful for learning how to operate in an organic lab, but it is difficult to jump into as one's first college lab experience. I may have wanted to take an inorganic lab course first just to be better assimilated into the lab environment. I would recommend this course for anyone who plans to pursue a health profession or chemistry seriously, I would not take this course for fun.",
    "Yes I would recommend it, especially if you're taking Orgo anyways. Overall one of the better labs in my opinion, not too much work and not too stressful.",
    "Take it if you're taking orgo. In general, people complain about lab, but this one is really not too bad.",
    "Chem 222L mostly teaches organic lab techniques. From what I've heard, it's much more chill than most other labs - there were post lab assignments most weeks, but only one full lab report, so the workload wasn't too bad. For me, it was a little intimidating to jump straight into organic lab as a freshman, but Professor DiMeglio and the TAs were really helpful, so overall I would recommend this class.",
    "Chemistry 222L is a complement to 124 that really solidifies one's understanding of Chemistry. If you are clumsy or impatient, don't take this course; labs will not be your forte. However, it is a great class, and even if you have no previous lab experience, it is entirely manageable.",
    "I would strongly recommend Chem 222L to another student. I would advise them to try it to see if they would like to pursue a Chem. Degree. This lab puts the Organic Chemistry Theory into practice.",
    "This is a fine lab-it's not too much work and the experiments are interesting. The first couple EP's take a long time but after that you get used to it. Just don't slack off on the 1 full report you have to do-it's worth a lot and the grading is pretty harsh.",
    "It was a lot worse than I expected. Make sure you TALK WITH YOUR TA before you take the class about what they are expecting from you in terms of formatting. Turn in your lab reports early so that your TA can look it over and inform you of what you have to work on (in terms of formatting). Very seldomly will you be graded on your actual chemistry. It's all MS word skills here, folks.",
    "Yes. So much better than gen chem lab. Shorter labs, too. Lab reports, post labs, and EPs are not to be taken lightly though. Grading can be very tough depending on your TA. It's not crucial to take it at the same time as orgo lecture; it didn't supplement my learning of the course material all that much.",
    "IF you don't need to take it, save yourself the four hours. If you do, it won't be bad at all. I actually loved it; the labs are straightforward, the work isn't too bad, you're not graded on yield (thank God!), there's music playing, and it's an overall relaxed lab.",
    "Its a great intro course to Orgo Lab. You go over some very basic concepts early on, but the labs get more and more intense every week. Also, while there is less work than in other labs, it is very hard to get a good grade in this class. What you turn in has to be the best it can.",
    "As a freshman, this was my first experience with labs at Yale, and I can honestly say I came away with a very positive experience. The labs were engaging, and by the end of the semester I could take pride in being able to perform a variety of lab tasks with ease. The low-key nature of the lab was also very enjoyable, and labs rarely ran over the established time of the class, if at all. This last point was particularly impressive, being that I typically was one of the last students to finish each session.",
    "It's an introduction to organic chemistry lab methods. The course does a good job of building on knowledge, so once you learn one method you practice it multiple times until you master it. I was really nervous coming into Orgo Lab but the atmosphere was super relaxed, and I actually ended up enjoying this lab. Grading can be a bit annoying at first, because you'll often get docked points for something that you weren't aware you had to include\/not include, but you get used to it. Before each lab you have to prepare an Experimental Plan, which you turn in on lab day, and sometimes there were Post-Lab assignments for certain labs. I usually ended up doing the EPs the night before, but they never took more than two hours. There's only one full lab report, which takes a long time, but you're given a few weeks to do it.",
    "Who takes this for fun? You will have to take this either way. That said, it's not bad at all. A very chill lab, the grading and the assignments are fair. So much so much better than gen chem lab, no stupid pre-lab quizzes, and sometimes, the labs are quite fun.",
    "The concepts are not always thoroughly explained in the course packet or in the Mohrig (textbook). Other than that, this was a fairly straightforward lab. Not too intense of a workload. The final will be easy *if* you make sure to understand the chemistry behind what is happening during each lab. DiMeglio is great. Try to get Shuming as your TA if possible!",
    "It's a good lab course - you'll really learn a lot. It is organized really, really well. DiMeglio is great too...always willing to help you out and answer questions.",
    "I really enjoyed orgo lab. It's pretty relaxing--MUCH better than the general chemistry lab. DiMeglio is really cool and friendly, and there's always music playing in lab. Not too much work outside of class--no weekly lab reports.",
    "Not too bad but it depends on your TA and the people in your section. I was in a section with friends so that made it enjoyable... and they play music in this lab so at times I was just JAMMING, mixing chemicals and such. Also I love DiMeglio. Get to know her - she\u0092s nice, approachable, and helpful.",
    "I would recommend this class. Even though you're probably taking it because you have to, it's an instructive and sometimes fun lab and Dr. DeMeglio is awesome.",
    "Probably the best part of taking Organic Chem here at Yale.",
    "Yes. If you are interested in organic chemistry or have to take it for pre-med, the lab with Prof. Dimeglio is great and helpful to lecture.",
    "Take it alongside chem 220. It's managable-- only one full lab report.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this class to other students. By the end of the course, you feel accomplished in all the techniques you learn and the skills you develop.",
    "Those taking Organic Chemistry should definitely take lab simultaneously. The pairing will aid tremendously in the student's understanding of organic chemistry.",
    "Well, put in the effort and ask questions. This is a great lab and will help drive home some concepts.",
    "Chemistry 222L is a standard organic chemistry lab that can be taken along with the organic chemistry class. It is a class that gives overview of many basic techniques, such as extraction, chromatography, infrared spectra, etc. It is an excellent way for freshman in Chem 124 to start their lab experience at Yale, because it is very structured and can complement the lecture at times. I would recommend for students to take this course. Even though it can be challenging and demanding in terms of workload at times, it is a great way to enhance one's knowledge of organic chemistry and prepare for future laboratory work.",
    "It's a survey lab course - I think most people take it because it is required for higher-level courses or medical school, and it isn't overly fascinating, but some of the experiments are fun! It's cool when you synthesize aspirin. =)",
    "The lab was a great opportunity to learn about methods and chemistry in a lab setting. The TAs and Christine were, in my experience, very friendly and helpful. Lab days were interesting, the pre labs helped prepare you for the lab without having to do too much work. This was a great lab experience for me. Study for the final.",
    "We only had post labs and only one complete lab report. While EP's were annoying, it was better than taking a lab quiz and made it so you actually knew what was going on in lab, which NEVER happened in gen. chem. Quite possibly failed my lab final, which was not a final lab but a multiple choice final. Whoops! But this was definitely not a bad course. Annnnd, you probs have no choice but to take it.",
    "You have to take this to be a doctor, so you will take it regardless. The grading in this class is completely stupid. You lose points for not following formats (ex. not listing you name on every page), which has nothing to do with your actual knowledge of organic chemistry or lab techniques. I don't often times disagree with the grading scheme in classes, but this lab has the dumbest, most asinine grading rubric imaginable. Very rarely are you docked points for gaps in knowledge, but a majority of the points that were lost were due to formatting issues or not anticipating that you should have included two answers instead of one (even when the question did not explicitly state that two answers were required).",
    "Organic Chemistry lab was fun and the TAs were very helpful! I highly recommend this lab and you will learn many useful lab skills.",
    "This was a fantastic course, by far the best lab I have taken at Yale. Professor DiMeglio is wonderful, and the lab is not very stressful. This was my first experience in a chemistry lab ever. After three or four weeks of getting used to the techniques (and being the last person to leave), I had caught up to the level of the other students. I definitely recommend this course, even if you're not a premed.Some recommendations: read the coursepack and the course textbook thoroughly, and arrive fifteen minutes early to gather reagents and set up the experiment.",
    "Basically, this meets once a week for four hours, but be prepared to spend a lot of time doing homework for this class. Every week, you have an EP (experimental plan) due and a PL (post lab) due, which at least for me would usually take a large chunk of my Sundays since I had lab at the beginning of the week. This was my first lab class, which made me very nervous but it's actually a good one to start with since they don't assume that you know how to do all the techniques. I'm a freshman so there were sophomores in the class too, but this semester basically covers techniques that you'll need for the next semester, so you learn how to do TLC, IR spectra, column chromatography and other techniques. It wasn't the most fun class - I had to do it for pre-med - but if you have to do it, it's not bad. PS - I didn't realize until the end of the semester, but this class does have a final. It's a 40 question multiple choice, takes 1.5 hours, so not bad. But just thought you should know.",
    "Orgo Lab is much more interesting than General Chem Lab. There is a much better relationship between this lab and the lecture course in that you use concepts from each to help your understanding of the other.",
    "This is a great, well-organized, exciting lab. Obviously you'll have to take it if you're premed, but don't hesitate at all because it's so well done and not that big of a work load compared to other labs.",
    "It's a good lab course and you might as well take it if you're taking Chem 220.",
    "This is an awesome lab. Most people get out every week by about 3:30-4, only one full labreport due during the semester, and you learn A LOT. One final exam at the end of the semester - all multiple choice, totally manageable. Also, Dr. DiMeglio and the TAs are great.",
    "Needed for premed reqs, but it's much better than gen chem lab so don't fret.",
    "Take it! It's fairly easy and lab is actually really fun. I suggest taking lab later in the week because then you have the weekend and the rest of the next week to finish EPs, PLs, or lab reports.",
    "It's probably a course you have to take, but it's a good, chill lab.",
    "Good to take along with orgo. If you take them separately, it may be tough to keep up with the concepts covered here. Not too bad, in terms of workload. Most of the work you'll be doing is in the actual lab itself.",
    "You don't go out of your way to take this class, so take it if you've got to. Hard but fair grading. Try to put in the necessary time.",
    "Yes, good class and takes the stress off of Orgo lecture",
    "I would recommend this lab to anyone who took organic chemistry. Even if you are not required to do the lab, I would still take it. It is a fun way to learn lab techniques in a stress-free relaxed environment.",
    "Yes, lab is always fun.",
    "If you do not need to take Chemistry 222L then don't. However, most people take chemistry lab because it is a requirement for their respective majors. Therefore, go into the lab knowing that no matter how many hours you spend on a lab report, you will not get higher than a B because points will be taken off for some minute clerical error rather than actual chemical mistakes.",
    "I would recommend CHEM 222L to another student, it's a great lab course with the typical amount of work associated.",
    "Orgo lab isn't bad at all! It's actually a very chill lab and isn't stressful or too much work. It's nice not to be graded at all on your technique or performance during lab (20% yield is totally fine!) which allows you to actually pay attention to what you're doing, not just to be focused on perfecting everything for a good grade. Before each lab you have to prepare a page or two EP (materials you're using, procedure, etc - all info is in the lab manual) which is really easy and doesn't take long at all. Don't worry about understanding every detail before lab - it's not like gen chem lab in that regard, just have a general understanding! The full lab report took a while, but there was only one and generally this lab isn't too much work. Dr. DiMeglio is awesome - don't stress about this lab at all!",
    "Chem 222L is a great lab and much more fulfilling and enjoyable than Gen Chem lab!",
    "Chemistry 222L is very independent lab course in which the student is essentially on his\/her own to learn the lab procedure before lab day. Although the TA would clarify mechanisms and technical information specific to the lab, little instruction was otherwise given, except retrospectively on corrected lab reports and pre-lab assignments.",
    "Great for those who wants to learn some lab techniques.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course.",
    "Most people that are in this lab have to take it for pre-med or some other requirement for a science major...that would be the only reason you should take it.",
    "If you need a lab, take this one. If you don't need a lab, but are interested in orgo, take it.",
    "Definitely take it. It's not a ridiculously hard course as far as labs go, but you will learn a lot about how organic chemistry is actually applied, and enjoy doing it.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course -- the skills we learned were vital, and it helped that the different experiments we performed allowed us to practice these techniques several times. The lab experience itself (i.e. : with the music) was great and definitely a big step up from 114\/115 lab.",
    "Overall, a good course. Was much less work than general chemistry lab. Experiments are straightforward and sometimes fun. The final exam (40 multiple choice questions) was generally easy but did have a few tricky questions with multiple plausible answers.",
    "Live and learn.",
    "Orgo lab was great! You are probably taking it because you have to, but it's pretty low stress and it's also interesting! Way better than Gen Chem lab",
    "Orgo lab was a lot of fun, and it definitely felt like they were trying to keep it to half a credit of work. The experiments were innovative, and I definitely felt like I learned from them. There also wasn't weekly quizzes or lab reports which was nice.",
    "A solid intro to organic lab techniques. The class is much more independent than GenChem Lab and the workload is reasonable and the assignments are meaningful.",
    "Organic Chemistry lab is a great course. One of the better labs I've taken here at Yale. Definitely better tan the lecture. Take it. And Christine DiMeglio is wonderful.I definitely recommend it :)",
    "Much better lab than gen chem lab.",
    "Orgo lab is a very nice lab class - very enjoyable. Prof DiMeglio is very friendly, approachable, and eager to teach - I would definitely recommend this lab course",
    "It is a good introduction to the techniques used in Organic Chemistry. You also learn the basics of synthesis labs.",
    "After taking this class, you will feel so much more comfortable in the lab situation. This was the first lab course I took at Yale (I'm a freshman), and it was a great experience, overall. It helps if you have a good TF. You learn the basics (vacuum filtration, TLC, etc.) and by the end, you even do some neat synthesis labs. The one problem I have is that it doesn't match up exactly with the regular orgo class, which means that sometimes, you don't really understand the underlying chemical principles and you're just blindly following the procedure.",
    "If you are taking orgo you obviously need to take the lab...",
    "This course is a great way to learn important orgo lab techniques. I would definitely recommend it to anyone thinking of going into the life sciences.",
    "For most students this is a necessary class to supplement orgo class and fulfill requirements but this does not mean that it is anywhere near as bad as the class and the assignments are much more reasonable. Also the labs are much shorter and to the point than gen chem.",
    "Yes, take this lab. There's no reason why you shouldn't. It's a lot less work than some of the other labs, but you come out learning the same thing. You'll be intimidated at first, (I know I was,) especially if you're a freshman, but you'll learn to get used to the lab room really quickly.",
    "I would definitely recommend it. Its way easier than gen chem lab.",
    "It's a very good lab course. The best I have taken so far definitely. TAKE IT FOR SURE. Excellent instructor, manageable workload.. I would totally recommend it.",
    "It's required.",
    "Organic chemistry lab is not hard if you do the work and the reading. Beyond its difficulty, if you really put in the honest effort and put your preconceived notions of 'lab' aside, this class can be rewarding, informative and an overall pleasant experience. There are quite a few 'ifs' though.",
    "Don't fret too much about your grades for the first few experiment protocols and post labs. You will learn what is expected of you quickly, and then your grades will rise. For me, organic lab was much different from high school chemistry lab. It is a lot more independent work that took me by surprise on the first day, but you quickly adapt to what is expected of you. Then it becomes second nature. The work is not bad, but definitely don't save the post labs and experiment protocols until the night before the lab is due. Spread out your work, and you will be perfectlyfine.I didn't have much dialogue with my TA; however, he\/she is a good resource. If I had any questions, my TA would help. Talk to him\/her about anything from how carry out a procedure, to how complete written assignments to the best of your ability.",
    "Yes, it is better at teaching you organic chemistry than the class. Also its easier than genchem lab in that you dont have weekly lab reports. If youre in orgo, definitely take this class.",
    "Take it if you have to.",
    "It was difficult in the beginning. There was a steep learning curve for the written portion of the course that took a while to adjust to. The lab itself was pretty enjoyable. We didn't perform too many interesting labs as they were mostly technique labs but learning the techniques wasn't bad at all. The later labs were much more engaging since they made use of the techniques we learned throughout the semester.",
    "I would recommend this lab class to a pre-med student. The labs are interesting and the post lab assignments are manageable.",
    "Orgo lab 1 gives you a quick introduction to some basic techniques used in chemistry labs. It is much less work than general chem lab, and is more laid-back. The labs rarely last more than 2-2.5 hours.",
    "This course is much better than other science labs I've taken (physics, gen chem, microbio), and while the workload is heavy, its not more than for any science class. The benefit of weekly assignments is that you don't stress for the final. It's a multiple choice exam, and by the time you have to take it, you've learned everything you need to know even if you don't know it. Professor DiMeglio is easily accessible, and the TA's want you to do well.",
    "This lab was fantastic, one of the best ones I have taken at Yale. Mostly because it is very well put together and clearly organized. Professor DiMeglio made it very enjoyable.",
    "The labs were generally pretty good, but I don't have much other lab experience to compare them with. Throughout most of the course, they did not relate to Chem220 though, which could be frustrating.",
    "If you're reading this, you have to take orgo lab... But don't be too scared - it honestly isn't that bad. It's similar to gen chem lab, except we synthesize things and learn orgo techniques. Also you have to write up a prelab report for every lab, which is kind of annoying. But, there aren't that many post lab reports, which is nice! You must be careful of the small formatting things when handing in assignments or you'll find yourself somehow with a low grade even though you understand the material. Study for the final exam, but it isn't *too* bad.",
    "Chem 22L does teach one some useful lab techniques and in that it is good. In terms of learning actual chemistry material outside of lab methods it is unhelpful. I assume that most people looking at taking this lab don't really have much of a choice anyways. All in all it was good for a lab course. (more work than 0.5 credits, but much closer to the 0.5 credit mark than gen chem)",
    "I would definitely take this course, whether it's required or not. The corresponding organic chemistry course isn't great, but the lab definitely shows the better side of organic chemistry.",
    "It is a much better lab than gen chem lab.",
    "Much less stressful than general chemistry lab. I felt like it was a practical application of the skills we had been learning in gen chem and the first part of the class.",
    "Definitely; it's probably a pre-req for your major if you are even thinking about this course. A good exposure to harder labs that we will have to take.",
    "This is such a great lab course! The experiments are interesting, the lab is so well run, Professor DiMeglio is super helpful and organized, and the TAs are patient and very helpful. The workload is totally fair, especially compared to the other labs that require a tedious full lab report each week. I would definitely recommend it!",
    "You have to take it anyway probably. Fun in the lab, not fun outside of it (lab reports and stuff where you're expected to be perfect.)",
    "Regardless of whether you are required to take this or not, I suggest taking this lab over others at Yale. The lab is constructed in such a stress free way and the workload is very fair. \\I thought that the grading was strict on assignments, but most of that is due to formatting and general nit picky things that you can do if you devote some time to them. And a lot of this depends on the TA...so some get luckier than others. The assignments were not very computational or thought intensive otherwise.The lab itself is kind of fun. The experiments are not difficult and you never get graded on yield. So there is no stress at all. You get to really enjoy doing interesting experiments and take pride in your final product, no matter how little you get.Take this lab, it is the best lab I have taken yet at Yale (vs Chem 119 and Phys 165).",
    "I would recommend this class. It is a very reasonable workload. Just make sure you study for the final.",
    "Orgo 1 lab is actually great. I mean, you probably have to take it anyway, so that should be very good news. DiMeglio clearly cares a lot about the class, and she has worked to make it very clearcut what is expected. That means, there is a tyco coursepacket just for this class (although, it is also under resources online, so don't buy it at tyco if you can print it cheaper yourself!!) There are clear readings for each lab (that take about 5-10 minutes, don't worry) and you actually understand why you're doing and even why too. (a much appreciated changefrom genchem lab). Also, the outside work for this lab is totally manageable. Every week, you have to write an \"experimental plan\" which takes about an hour and a half and involves you rewriting the procedure and creating a table with all the compounds you will be using that day (and their properties\/safety concerns etc). Other than that, most weeks there is some sort of post-lab write up, but in NO WAY does it compare to the multi-paged novels you probably wrote for genchem lab. Instead, they are clearly assigned questions or other clear assignments that you can do in 1 or 2 pages. There is only one full fledged report (with an intro, conclusion, error analysis and all that jazz) and that doesn't come until the end of the semester. Also, this lab is really chill. She plays the kiss radio station, and it's an overall enjoyable time.",
    "It's actually a pretty great lab. I am doing this for premed stuff and still enjoyed it. Relaxed, well organized, and the distribution of the workload is much better than most labs -- experimental plans ahead of lab, rather than a weekly lab report (plus some scattered postlab assignments and the occasional lab report). The final is a multiple choice test rather than a practical. All in all pretty good, especially considering I didn't have a lot of prior interest in the subject."
