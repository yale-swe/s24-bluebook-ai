    "I would recommend English 810 to another student as Prof. Brisman allows students to work on topics of interest even if Victorian Poetry is not their field. Classes were rewarding, and I truly do feel as if I got to read some of the best poetry from the period.",
    "This course is a taste of Victorian poetry, beginning with the Romantic tradition and moving through to Browning. The course focuses primarily on Tennyson and Browning. I would absolutely recommend this course to others, and have already recommended that my peers get to know Professor Brisman."

   "comments": [
    "While this course was taken to fulfill a distribution requirement, I feel as if I was able to understand how authors and texts from my earlier period influenced later periods, which is extremely interesting and helpful. While the research may not make it into my dissertation, I'm still extremely happy I took the course and would do so if I had the choice again.",
    "I took to for personal reasons, not professional. And I came out having learned what I wanted to.",
    "This course aided me in numerous ways. I feel more comfortable now with an area of poetry about which I knew very little, and which I hope to continue to read and enjoy. Though this course may not directly factor in to my dissertation, the reading skills I acquired certainly will."
