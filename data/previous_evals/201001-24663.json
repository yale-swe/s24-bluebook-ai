    "A really informative and eye-opening course. It's a nice mix of dramatic lit, drama, and history that can't be found in other courses.",
    "Take this course. It's very fun interesting and not too much work. I enjoyed it immensely and I looked forward to learning from Professor Kevles. We had good discussion in our group and enjoyed class periods. Do not be frightened away if you are a science major and not a THST major. You will be fine. I repeat take this course.",
    "The class allows the examination of an amazing group of plays and gives very interesting background into the science which surrounds them. It is not aimed at students of theater, but rather at history and history of science majors. I was still able to get a good amount out of it as a theater student, but not being the target audience was often difficult as it meant the areas of interest discussed were often either emphasizing as new things which I had already studied or taking for granted areas which I had never encountered before."
