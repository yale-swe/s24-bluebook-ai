   "comments": [
    "A course on the several approaches to morality. Warning: may get a bit philosophical at times--talking in circles. Seminar style, so you should probably be cool with talking about psychological literature",
    "Sometimes devolves into discussions hashing out the merits of the methods section of research papers rather than talking about major themes and how the paper addresses some larger question about morality. Mark is the best, he's super approachable and friendly.",
    "This is a great class, which provides a critically rigorous and diverse introduction to evolutionary psychology research in morality -- covering all kinds of approaches from the computational\/economic, neurobiological, comparative, developmental, etc. There is potential for interesting discussions about how these accounts combine, but as with all seminars, a lot depends on your own and your classmates' willingness to engage with the material.",
    "A flexible survey of the literature and theories relevant to the evolution of morality. It is a great class the lends itself well to senior essays.",
    "10\/10 would recommend. Not too much work, but very interesting . You will learn a ton of from Mark who knows everything about this subject basically. He is also very reasonable and understanding when it comes to grading and other assignments",
    "This is a great course covering a fascinating topic. Take the course.",
    "Evolution of Morality was a neat seminar that really made me think each week about the evolutionary mechanisms that, over time, have yielded commonplace behaviors and traits like punishment, generosity, egalitarianism, etc. Yes, I recommend it!",
    "Reading and discussing scientific, morality papers. That's pretty much the whole class! Read 3 papers a week and discuss them, and a final paper at the end. Definitely go for it if you enjoy reading scientific psych papers; if your more in it for the philosophical discussion of \"what is morality\" etc., maybe try something else, as this is strictly about experiments."
