    "Golling has been the highlight of my academic YEAR (I had him for 200 as well). He is young and passionate about teaching. He is easily approachable (I've gotten to know him quite well though numerous after-class questions and office hour encounters) and also willing to go to great lengths to help you with the material. Most admirable, though, is his interest in receiving feedback (he asks for it at least twice during each semester) and his genuine attempts to cater his classes to the feedback he receives. Golling is by far the best professor I've encountered at Yale, and I hope to take more of his classes in the future.As someone who greatly enjoys physics, I'm not in a position to recommend the course on the basis of material. I will say, though, that I found the material stimulating and very manageable. There wasn't too much math (by that I mean that it didn't bog down the class or detract from the real-world connections and practicality).",
    "If Golling is teaching this course, DON'T take it.",
    "An okay class. I'd probably not recommend it with Tobias Golling, but it's a good review\/extension of AP Physics C. You're probably going to take this after you've taken Phys 200 anyway, so the review is basically pointless, except to say that if you liked Phys 200 (or even disliked it), Phys 201 is incredibly more interesting and more fun. I feel like this class helped me to solidify some topics in electricity and magnetism and learn the basics of a few new ones like quantum mechanics.",
    "Take it if you want a challenging but extremely educational course in Physics. Great material, moderately challenging workload, and exams that teach you to grow immune to exam taking because they're so unpredictable that you don't really care if you don't do well on them anymore. Most challenging course I've taken at Yale so far.",
    "A very hard course. If you struggled with Phys 200 then get a tutor for this semester. Tobias Golling isn't the best lecturer, his style is best suited for those who already have a grasp over the material. If you have the chance, spend the winter break before this class starts watching Shankar Phys 201 lectures on OpenCourseware. Workload is manageable (1 Pset a week), but just barely.",
    "You'll know if you took 200.I personally loved the topics. The course gets to some interesting material in the end with Quantum, General Relativity, Cosmology, and Particle Physics. It's not super intensive with these topics but just gives you enough to get you interested.Golling is a really nice and approachable professor. Give him feedback and he'll listen.",
    "yes, the class is so much better than 180-181 sequence! (I'm telling it from my own experience as a student of phys 180 in the fall term who switched to phys 201 in spring)",
    "If you are taking this class, it is probably required. Golling has been making a conscious effort to improve, and it has certainly been showing. 201 this semester was taught better than 200 last semester, and I would expect him to continue improving. He doesn't really dwell on the basics, but overall I would certainly recommend this class.",
    "More E&M. Then quantum stuff. Super abstract lectures, super mathy exams.",
    "I would strongly recommend this class. The work load is not to bad, although the material is difficult.",
    "Stay far, far away from this class. I took AP Physics C in high school and got a 5 on the Mechanics section and this class was still a lot, primarily because of how poorly it is taught. Golling is a great guy, but it was his first year teaching, and I think he forgets what a huge knowledge gap there is between us and him. I realized this when he was talking about Quantum Mechanics (which I already knew quite well from taking Physical Chemistry concurrently), and really, he presented it so haphazardly that if I hadn't already learned it, I would be incredibly confused.Shop 260. Or drop down to 180. This class isn't worth it. Physics doesn't need to be this stressful.",
    "I would recommend Phys 201 to a student who took Phys 200 and did decently well in the class. The material in Phys 201 is a bit harder.",
    "It's a pretty good class. The material taught is great. It goes into a little more depth than 181 but not as crazy as 261. It is the best physics class for EE majors. Professor Golling is ok, although some say he has improved. Psets were not terribly difficult or long, but exams are pretty hard, so the class overall is a good amount of work.",
    "Don't take it if Golling's teaching it. Take 260 if you're smart enough.200\/201 is good because the pre-meds are weeded out and more about physics knowledge that getting an A (lol about thinking you can get an A...) but the quality of the course is bad. There's too much to cover to learn anything well.",
    "This class is horrible. Do not take it unless you must. Golling is horrible and does not know how to teach. The TFs cannot help.The best part of this class are the peer tutors. That is right - your peers, not the professor, is the best part. See a problem? I do.",
    "I would certainly recommend this for those looking into a math science field as you can learn about the Higgs Boson from the man who discovered it! The course went well beyond my expectations for a base level course.",
    "I would recommend it, but only if you're a physics or engineering major. As a non-physics major, I found it difficult to keep up with the students that had decided for years that they were physics majors, and as it was a curved class, it stressed me out a lot. After a while, it was hard to distinguish between my resentment for the stress that this class caused me and my resentment for the subject (which I actually do like), which was a pity. If you're not a physics major, take the 180\/181 sequence - they covered the same material without the same curve stress being present.",
    "Boring lectures. Not a good class.",
    "Physics 201 is a great course in introductory physics covering electricity, magnetism, optics, quantum mechanics and a little bit of cosmology\/particle physics in the last week. The level of teaching was better this semester than last semester in Physics 201. Also, while many in the past seem to have commented on the greater difficulty of second semester, I must say that the exams in the second semester were easier than those encountered in the first semester, even if the concepts are a bit more abstract in the sescond semester. Overall I highly recommend this course, especially if you have to take physics for a requirement, and I now have a much better understanding of electricity and magnetism.",
    "If you're interested in physics, but not prepared enough to take the 260 sequence, then physics 200\/201 is an unfortunate inevitability. Much of the time the material is simply unintuitive, and we often solve problems in ways which use workarounds due to not knowing the math to solve them the normal way. The biggest flaw in this course is that the curriculum tries to teach us new material, but at some points, the average physics 201 student simply doesn't have to mathematical knowledge to easily grasp the material.",
    "I would definitely recommend PHYS 201. If you're a non-major choosing between PHYS 200\/1 and 170\/1 or 180\/1, you really stand to gain a lot from this class. All the classes will teach you the basic laws, but this class was also about learning how to take ownership of your math tools and use them to do what you need. I find myself applying the techniques we used in physics to problems in other classes\/areas all the time.Also, the class is really enjoyable as long as you're not too stressed. Dr. Golling is a great lecturer and makes the class fun. The study hall means that if you're stumped on a pset question, you can always get help. There are some very intense periods, like the special relativity pset, but if you put the work in, those are the best parts.",
    "If you want to learn Physics well, take this class! I really enjoyed it and the workload is manageable. Just make sure you are on par with all the other students, because they will all be pretty good at Physics.",
    "I would not take this as a fun class unless you are already interested in physics, and even if you are, it is not \"fun\" in the way of some other classes... it is a lot of less than fun work. If you do have to take intro physics, I would certainly recommend PHYS 200-201. If you did 200, stay with 201, for sure. Don't be scared of E&M just because everyone else is... I found it personally to be more fun and easier! It is possible.",
    "NO",
    "Though you may have to struggle with disorganized and less than perfect teaching, take this course if you really want to address the math behind much of electromagnetically, along with putting your feet in the water of quantum math.",
    "Fun intro physics course. Not very stressful and a great chance to hear from Professor Golling, who is an incredible person!",
    "Physics 201 is a pretty intense intro physics class. It's fast paced and challenging but Professor Golling is very good and helps to make the class enjoyable. The brief look into quantum mechanics, general relativity, and particle physics certainly makes the class worth taking.",
    "Good class. Too difficult if you're not interested in going into some type of physics, but definitely a great experience. You'll learn a lot and have a solid physics background.",
    "If you gotta take it, you gotta take it.",
    "Physics 201 is an excellent way for you to learn a lot of physics in a short period of time without it being only a cursory look at everything. I would recommend it to anyone interested (and I mean, really interested) in physics.",
    "Physics 201 is a great intro physics course - the material is difficult but the problem sets and overall organisation of the course make it straightforward to follow. The peer tutors were extremely helpful and sometimes stayed overtime at study hall to help out with the psets.Prof. Golling really cares about his teaching style and the course and is extremely responsive to feedback. He always asks students what they think and makes sure to communicate what he thinks to the class before making decisions",
    "Difficult class with a good curve and a reasonable pace. Take if really interested in physics and can't take 260",
    "This is a great course to take if you plan to major in any science discipline. Golling is a great lecturer and the topics are all accessible.",
    "It's fine. I enjoyed the physics more than I expected, but the class itself was still a struggle. This was partially because so many people dropped from Physics 200 that everyone left in 201 was honestly doing really well. It made grades really stressful though. Professor Golling isn't the greatest lecturer, so supplementing with Shankar's online material was helpful. Problem sets are pretty easy. Tests definitely not so easy. This could be frustrating too, but I think Prof Golling was aware of this feedback and trying to work on it.",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone who has a strong math background (at least 120) and who enjoys physics or wants to major in engineering. Otherwise, this class might be to in depth for them to enjoy.",
    "This is a good course to take if you are OK with going in depth into the mathematical analysis of systems such as AC circuits and quantum mechanical properties. There is a lot of new math that I learned from the class and new applications of math I already knew, such as a looking at oscillations as represented by polar coordinates in the complex plane."
