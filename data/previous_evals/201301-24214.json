    "Loved the seminar, great speakers. I do however, wish there were alternatives to pizza every week.",
    "The speakers were pretty good this semester.",
    "A better location. Bring speakers from industry and organizations such as the CDC, NIH, and FDA. Should have professors choose speakers or colleagues from other institutions.",
    "I really enjoyed the talks but would prefer to hear a little more from a wider range of public health professionals. Also, it would be nice to not sit through the same talks we had in our Principles of Infectious Disease course- we heard from the same person three times on the same topic. Otherwise, I really enjoyed these lectures and look forward to attend some next semester.",
    "Some lectures were really interesting and seemed relevant. Some were painfully boring to sit through and didn't make sense at all for EMD students.",
    "Enjoyed very much Dr. Mike Begon and Dr. Les Real. Would like to seem more modeling and zoonotic disease (as a personal preference). Liked that the class met every week and covered variety of subjects.Side note: Although pizza is delicious and I am happy the seminar has food, having sandwiches every-so-often might be nice.",
    "Great set of seminars from public health professionals from multiple fields and schools.",
    "Not well structured for MPH students. Lack of resources in classes v2 makes it very inconvenient. Starting with having syllabus and resources in classes v2 would help a lot",
    "Strengths: There were many wonderful speakers this semester who presented on a wide variety of topics, which is very useful to first-year students who are exploring various research areas. Weaknesses: I would have liked to have seen more individuals engaged in public health practice, as opposed to research.",
    "The seminars and speakers were all great",
    "Great way to be introduced to research in EMD and associated departments\/faculty outside of EMD. Would be great to have something other than pizza sometimes.",
    "Mandatory"

    "I would recommend it because it is required but it is also useful for a student who is looking for a particular public health interest and needs a push in a certain direction or another.",

    "I would recommend this course to another student. This is a great opportunity to hear from and to ask questions of individuals from all over the field of public health!",
    "Yes I would recommend this seminar to other students"
