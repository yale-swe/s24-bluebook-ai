    "If you want to learn to read French and have the motivation to push yourself outside of class, this is an excellent course. It moves at a reasonable pace -- you won't be overwhelmed with grammar or vocabulary -- but you won't get a huge amount out of it if you don't put in the work yourself, either.The course really is French for Reading. Four months in, I can't pronounce anything, but have gotten to being able to comfortably read a newspaper from not knowing any French at the start of the semester.",
    "you can learn a basic grammer of French and start to read french."
