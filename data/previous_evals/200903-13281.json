   "comments": [
    "A standard language course with a lot of grammar review (and some new grammar), some great movies, short stories, and a little bit of poetry. It's a good class overall - the grammar can be frustrating since so much of it IS review, but it's a good chance to go over everything from the last two semesters and make sure it's straight in your head. There's no final exam, which means a lot of emphasis is placed on the final skit - intimidating for those who don't like speaking.Elisabeth Wagner is a great professor to have, and if you have the chance to take it with her, some of the discussions will probably end up being alot more fun.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. It is a great mix of different media and texts in order to learn German better.",
    "harder than romance languages but still fun. be prepared to commit lots of time to it if you want to do well."
