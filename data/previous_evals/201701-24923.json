    "Professor was incredible and brilliant and added greatly to the material from her own knowledge rather than just having us assess the readings. Extremely important subject presented in a way that did its significance justice. Professor did some lecturing which does not usually happen in seminars but was fine with me because again this information gave a new depth to the readings. If anything maybe needed some better facilitation of discussion - class was somewhat shyer at first so could have used some more directed questions."

    "Definitely yes! I loved it and Professor Eller is amazing!",
    "Yes! Absolutely, this is my favorite course I've taken at Yale. It's fabulous. You learn so much and can gain an entire new perspective on the world. Also Professor Eller is incredible and brilliant so you would pretty much get a lot out of any course with her."
