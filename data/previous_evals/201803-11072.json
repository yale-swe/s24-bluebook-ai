    "Research skills, time-management, proper citations, how to relate to advisors, general nuts and bolts for writing an academic paper Through ER&M specific readings, you learn what it takes to write an ethnic studies paper.",
    "This course was helpful in giving me a sense of the different methods, topics and perspectives an ER&M thesis could take. It was helpful to have some grounding in a field that can be so interdisciplinary. For the year-long, I think it is a smart format to have a class in the Fall to get us going and then a credit\/independent study in the Spring. It did make me realize how much work I have to do this spring to write a thesis, which taught me the value of daily progress on a research project this big."

   "comments": [
    "strength: having a small cohort of peers whose reading your work and whose work you're reading is really powerful.",
    "It was really helpful to learn from my peers, and I think the most productive seminars were when we broke into small groups and discussed our work, partially because everyone's papers are so interesting and because that held me most accountable to my own work. I also liked the guest lectures (particularly Professor Laguna's lecture). I think there were too many deadlines in September\/October, and it would have been helpful to have more thinking time then and then had the annotated bibliography etc. due in early November. I ended up not using most of my preliminary work because of how my thesis transformed throughout the course of the semester. I liked the writers manual, and some of the readings like Linda Smith, but otherwise I felt like it was time spent that I could be using to do research for my thesis.",
    "This course provided a fairly comfortable, intimate space in which to discuss our senior theses and be inspired by the work of our peers. I thought the readings were helpful, and I liked that we were asked to read the works of faculty members in the ER&M program, because it made me feel connected to them and to the major. One thing that I think could be developed about the course is I think the class discussions could make more space to acknowledge\/talk about the things that seniors are experiencing throughout the semester besides thinking about our theses. Senior year is such an incredibly intense time (and Yale is just intense and insanely demanding anyways) and I found it difficult at times to stay present during colloquium and give it my all, because I often felt much more focused on the events happening immediately around me (in my personal life, on campus, or in the country) rather than on a project that isn't due until the spring. I just sometimes felt like my thesis and senior colloquium were holding me back from being more present to the people around me and engaging with the current events transpiring, when in reality, I think our ideas about our theses should be allowed to evolve and grow along with the things we observe and experience throughout the year. If we fostered more honest conversations in class about how we're doing, what we're working on\/not working on, thinking about\/not thinking about, then there wouldn't have to be so much tension between writing our theses and engaging with the world immediately around us."
