    "Great course. Cathy is amazing and very responsive to students. She really makes the course. It helps to have a strong background in physiology coming in, especially because Cathy goes so fast during the lectures, which are comprehensive and informative (but fast!). I liked to freedom in the assignments, as they let me explore physio in relation to something I was really interested in.",
    "Strengths) Well taught. Amazing lecturing and well thought out topics, order, and flow of course material. Great workload, very interesting to write critical review pieces and blog posts. Overall amazing class. Weaknesses) Group work was sometimes unstructured, and no points were given for some assignments which lead to unmotivated work.",
    "Strengths: Provided a systems perspective on physiology and where the vulnerabilities occur that lead to public health issues. Lacks some details about physiological systems (though this is ok because it isnt the intention of the course to be hyper-detailed)",
    "This course is great. You learn in-depth content on human physiology but in a very simplified way. A lot of merit to Professor Yeckel's passion for physiology, her work and will for student engagement. She gets very hyped for any physiology principle, even worse when her students engage and ask questions. She is also very adaptive, as she often gives feedback for work assigned with readings that refer specifically to ones major or discipline.",
    "I LOVED the implementation of the blog post in the course. It was an excellent opportunity to learn how to translate critical public health messages from complex medical terminology to accessible laymen term messaging that is accessible to the general pubic. I also loved the opportunity to grasp not just the biological concepts of public health but also their applicability to day to day life.",
    "A lot of content, but done well with the combination of the weekly write ups.",
    "The blog articles were a great part of the class. Students were challenged to put complex physiologic and public health topics in an easy-to-read blog format. It also allowed for collaboration with peers across different departments at YSPH.",
    "Material is great, and Cathy is absolutely wonderful. The material goes by very fast though, and it can be difficult keeping up.",
    "Please take out the blog and talk about it less.",
    "The instructor was definitely knowledgeable and excited about the material, which was great. The slides\/information were sometimes too in depth but other than that the assignments, exams, and supplemental material were all organized well and tied the course together.",
    "STRENGTHS -- The PowerPoints were well-organized. -- The curriculum was well-designed, and covered the highlights of physiology as it relates to public health. -- The assignments were interesting and were spread out over the course of the semester, so that grades were not dependent only on a midterm and final. WEAKNESSES -- The blog post assignments were not graded, so it seemed as if people were talking out of two sides of their mouths (this assignment is very important vs. this assignment is not graded). This led to a major imbalance in the workload for different students some people did no work at all on the blog posts, while others did all the work that was meant for 4 people. The participation grade was meant to partly account for blog posts, but there was no actual measurement of work done."

    "Instructor: Catherine Yeckel \u00a0Cathy is amazing. Brilliant, helpful, encouraging... She knows her stuff and encourages students to challenge and think critically of the content in class. Only complaint is that she goes through the material really quickly during lecture! Otherwise, she's amazing.",
    "Instructor: Catherine Yeckel \u00a0Amazing lecturer. 10\/10",
    "Instructor: Catherine Yeckel \u00a0Prof Yeckel knows her stuff and clearly delights in teaching. She has a huge level of energy and a desire to meet every student at his or her level. I wonder why the readings were from so many different sources. The class might feel a bit more organized if we used one central physiology textbook.",
    "Instructor: Catherine Yeckel \u00a0Very enthusiastic and caring professor. She really encourages students to run with their interests and is supportive of individual inquiries. Really emphasizes the tie-in to public health issues.",
    "Instructor: Catherine Yeckel \u00a0Beyond amazing. She is one of the best professors I've had at Yale. She is very passionate about her work, and gives so much useful feedback. She is great at explaining complicated principles, and is always available if one needs her for help with course content.",
    "Instructor: Catherine Yeckel \u00a0Phenomenal! Fantastic! Deserves a raise ASAP!",
    "Instructor: Catherine Yeckel \u00a0Great professor. Passionate about the course and very helpful with everything.",
    "Instructor: Catherine Yeckel \u00a0Dr. Yeckel was a treasure! Her passion for physiology is palpable, and she truly invests in the development of her students!",
    "Instructor: Catherine Yeckel \u00a0Cathy is so wonderful. She is so enthusiastic and loves to watch her students learn.",
    "Instructor: Catherine Yeckel \u00a0A great teacher!",
    "Instructor: Catherine Yeckel \u00a0STRENGTHS -- The professor was very enthusiastic and knowledgeable about the material. -- The professor carefully planned out the curriculum, and incorporated the latest scientific knowledge into the course materials. This kept the course fresh and exciting. -- The professor emphasized student engagement. She provided opportunities for students to work with each other during class time to solve problems and plan group blog posts, and encouraged discussion among students, TAs, and herself. She also made good use of the TAs to give mini-lessons about topics of interest to them. Overall, the professor was one of the better educators I have had at YSPH, in that she knows how to approach the material from a variety of angles and styles. WEAKNESSES -- The professor spoke very quickly especially at critical junctures in lectures, when it would have been helpful to slow down, define key terms, and check in with students to ensure that the information was being transmitted as intended. -- While the professor usually responded helpfully to student questions, she was sometimes impatient if a question did not fit the pre-conceived notion of where the class was headed. Patience, along with a willingness to surrender some of the academic material in favor of sparking student engagement (which this professor already has more of than most YSPH professors), would help with this."

   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this course very much to another student. It is very well taught, and I really appreciated it as someone who doesn't have a huge background in STEM or Physiology. Can be approached from any background in PH and well done.",
    "Great course and very accessible for students even with no physiology\/biology background. Great overview of body systems and common pathologies and how they apply to overall public health. Dr. Yeckel is passionate about the subject and it made going to class enjoyable.",
    "This is a survey of physiological elements underlying major public health problems. The student will be able to dive into a number of specific topics of their choosing related to different physiological systems. Would recommend.",
    "Overall, an amazing course. You should definitely take it!",
    "Highly recommended! One of the best courses at YSPH and easily my favorite class this spring semester.",
    "Greatly recommended as it applies to public health.",
    "Yes, highly recommend! It allows for one to critically examine the physiological basis of many public health issues. It is also a great class for any student interested in pursuing a medical degree following their MPH.",
    "If you like science, take it. It's tough if you're not a science person.",
    "Yes! Very informative and interesting",
    "I would recommend this course as a very useful look at how human bodies work, and the public health implications of that. The curriculum was well-designed and showed how different systems in the body are connected and how these systems can be disrupted. I would recommend the class for students with some background in biology; for those with no background at all in biology, the work needed to catch up will be cumbersome."
