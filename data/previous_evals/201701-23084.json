    "My biggest struggle with Hindi was the fast pace combined with the lack of prior info about what was happening of\/expected in class. All language classes at Yale are fast-paced, but they have more of a schedule or routine with assignments and quizzes. For example, they often have syllabi detailing what concepts are going to be covered that week, what the student is expected to learn for tests\/quizzes, and what the homework assignments will be, and this is given a decent time in advance of the due dates so students can come up with a system to adequately prepare to balance their learning with the workloads of other classes. Hindi is fast-paced as well, but this is combined with getting homework the evening before it is due, as well as learning what will be on the quiz the night before. This makes it hard for students who work slowly or struggle with language learning to balance the classwork and really learn the concepts without trying to speed through the work. If no matter what you are stuck doing your homework in the night plus you have other obligations, the quality of time devoted to learning concepts is much lower. Personally I have had a really hard time with this both semesters because I am a slow learner, and I also work and take other hard classes, so I wish I knew what was expected of me a little in advance, because I know it would really improve my ability to work effectively. I know both instructors are very busy but I hope this can be implemented somewhat in the future. That criticism aside, Hindi is a wonderful class! I absolutely love Seemaji and Swapnaji and they are amazing, kind teachers. We covered a great amount of grammar, I wish I knew more vocab but I'm sure we will get to it in L3! Seemaji and Swapnaji (and Reeta too) are really good at explaining nuances in language and cultural gaps. As an Indian American I am really happy I took it and learned about India from three awesome Indian women! Shabash.",
    "The course's flexibility is definitely a huge strength, as it is very understanding of its students. It makes the language class much more approachable and so students will be more likely to take it next semester. The one weakness is that students don't have a sense of where they stand in the class until the very end so I would recommend using online supplies (like canvas) to keep track of grades."
