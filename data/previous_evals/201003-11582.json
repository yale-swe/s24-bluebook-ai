I never felt like I could speak to or with my classmates - it was ALWAYS through the instructor who moderated virtually everything that was said. He is clearly an expert on the material and skillful in moderating a workshop, but sometimes he needs to take a backseat to the rest of the class so they can communicate amongst themselves.",
