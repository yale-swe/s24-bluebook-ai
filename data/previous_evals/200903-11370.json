    "Take it, but be prepared to treat all your other courses like extra-curriculars.",
    "This class is really hard. No matter how hard you work your spoken ability will get worse (if you are coming back from light). There are a lot of characters to learn, especially when you have other classes to think about. The class is really well taught, with amazing teachers and a very interesting book, nevertheless it can be frustrating to ptu in so much work and still feel that you are getting worse at chinese. It has a very set schedule, with a lot of quizes and homeworks so you dont fall behind, so once you get into the swing of things it gets easier. I think you should take it if you dont want to forget all of your chinese, but it will also be really really hard with not much payoff other than maintaining some level of chinese ability, so keep that in mind.",
    "Great, fun, and easy course if you want to learn Chinese. However, if you came from an intense language program in China, you will find it unfulfilling and very easy.",
    "I would recommend this course to a fellow student with the stipulation that he\/she should be prepared to work, as there are quizzes three out of five days of the week.",
    "I thought nothing would require more work of me than Chinese 110... I was wrong. Just the right amount of grammar; an insane amount of vocabulary. It's great in the sense that unlike your average Romance language, you still need a lot of foundation work in third year - basic sentence patterns and a ton of vocabulary (we've done almost 1,000 words this semester). Retention is the real problem, so try to build a solid chunk of review time into your week before it's too late.",
    "Good class- still 5 days a week though. Taken after a summer with Light Fellowship, the workload doesn't seem that heavy- a few characters sunday night, tingxie monday, characters to learn monday and tuesday night for small quizzes tuesday and wednesday. The work follows the same schedule every week.",
    "I came back from a summer at PiB with the Light Fellowship. I felt like my Chinese gradually got worse over the semester, but that's inevitable just because you won't be in a Chinese speaking environment anymore. Both teachers are great and you do learn a lot, just expect to be frustrated with your Chinese level getting worse. Also, the workload will seem like cake after a summer in China\/Taiwan.",
    "Yes, if a student is serious about Chinese. If not, you will fall behind and hate it.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to a student whohas studied Chinese in China before; it is a good way to make sure your Chinese does not get too rusty. I think, however, that it might be a little too difficult for someone who has not spend time in the country.",
    "I would definitely recommend Chinese 150 to any student who is interested in improving their written and oral Chinese. The class is relaxing, and the work load is not too heavy (although it does require time every day). The content is interesting, and the atmosphere of the class is really enjoyable.",
    "This is a great Chinese course. It is demanding but engaging.",
    "No complaints. For those of you coming back from a Light Fellowship, it's a great class to take. You learn a huge amount of new and useful vocabulary. The class is fun, well-organized, and the course material is actually kind of interesting. Both Wang and Li Laoshi are incredibly fun teachers. If you are planning on continuing Chinese, you don't really have much of an option, but look forward to taking this class.",
    "Chinese 150 is a difficult course that builds on everything you've learned in Chinese up until this point. There is a lot of work, but when you do it, it really pays off. There is emphasis on everything: reading, composition, listening comprehension, speaking, learning traditional characters, etc. There is slightly less emphasis on writing characters, but you still have to be able to recognize all of them and know how to write them for tests, tingxies, etc. The topics are interesting and help to build vocabulary in areas you might actually want to use them: food, music, social phenomena, etc. Overall, a really good course. Just make sure you have the time available to put into it.",
    "I would recommend this course, because although it didn't improve my fluency as much as I hoped, it increased my vocabulary substantially. Furthermore, I felt that the weekly essays improved my writing ability. The textbook material is relevant and very interesting.",
    "TAKE IT! Wonderful course! I love the teachers. Li Laoshi and Wang Laoshi were very encouraging, and we had many opportunities to practice our speaking in class. If you've taken AP Chinese before, try to place into this class.",
    "It is very vocabulary heavy with stories which make the book more interesting. Class structure is set up the same every week with vocabulary the first few days followed by grammar and oral presentations on Friday. If you want to keep learning Chinese then you kind of have to take it. It will be fun! Yay!",
    "Chinese 150 is a good class for those returning from the Light Fellowship summer programs. I enjoyed it, although the work does not lessen from first year Chinese. Learning 80 or so characters a week and doing the weekly assignments (readings, listening homework every weekend, written homework, essay or presentation) may seem like nothing coming from a summer in China, but it is significantly harder and more demanding at Yale, while balancing other courses, extracurricular activities, and realizing that your Chinese level won't be as strong as it was when you were always speaking it. The course demands a lot of your time, but the teachers were tremendously helpful and encouraging along the way.",
    "I would recommend this class if you are planning on continuing your study of Chinese, and I have found the class to be very useful to my Chinese. I studied my second year of Chinese in Beijing, so I do not know how the second year Chinese program is atYale, but I found the difficulty increase to be not too steep. Each week consists of two days focusing on reading sections with about forty new vocabulary words each, as well as one day focusing on 3 listening sections, with about thirty new words altogether. There is minimal emphasis on traditional characters, and only about four days are dedicated to it.",
    "If you're used to PiB or HBA, the workload will be quite a bit easier, but the course picks up pretty quickly and you will find that you're learning a lot of new stuff by the end of the year. The textbook is great--you not only get very formal grammar patterns but also learn very useful and fun colloquial expressions. Although sometimes you can get bogged down with the work, you won't regret it by the end.",
    "I would recommend this to another student who wishes to maintain Chinese on a superficial level. For true gains, go abroad.",
    "Yes, I would greatly recommend it.",
    "strongly recommend",
    "Chinese 150 is standard third year Chinese for non-heritage speakers. It represents a considerable step down in intensity from study in China, although the class still represents a large amount of work and must be addressed with the utmost diligence. Towards the end of semester, properly learning 80 new vocabulary words and properly completing various grammar, listening, speaking, and other assignments began to represent a greater challenge. If you are interested in taking more Chinese, this class will be helpful, but it should be taken seriously and with the expectation that learning will not be quite the same as it was in China.",
    "It's a great class if you want to keep up with CHinese and make a little progress. If you're coming back from a summer program like HBA, you will notice that your level of Chinese will go down so expect that to happen. But overall, Li laoshi and Wang laoshi are great. You will have fun taking the class",
    "Chinese 150 is a very intense Chinese course. You will learn a lot but expect it to be very time consuming (it probably comprised half my workload). That being said, it isn't that hard to get a good grade, and you do get used to all the work",
    "Chinese 150 is a very work intensive course, and I would reccomend to anyone serious about learning Chinese.",
    "It is a great continuation class for those interested in increasing their Chinese proficiency.",
    "It's Chinese. If you're at this level, you know what your getting into. It's taught as well as any Chinese course can be, and the textbook is pretty great.",
    "Chinese 150 is a very intensive Chinese language course. I felt that the level jumped considerable from Chinese 130. I would definitely recommend it as you learn a lot, not only in terms of the language but also the culture which I find particularly interesting.",
    "Excellent Chinese class, highly recommended. Be prepared, though, to work consistently throughout the semester."
