    "The class is very helpful, especially if you are looking to improve your spanish skills. Expect homework every night and a sufficient amount of work weekly.",

    "I would only recommend this course to those who are proficient at reading and speaking spanish. The course becomes more difficult if you lack one of these attributes",
    "I would recommend Spanish 120 with Rosamaria Leon. It is a challenging course with a lot of grammar (especially if you feel you may have tested a little above your actual ability), but you will definitely be satisfied with the amount you've learned when it's over. Sra. Leon is fun and really willing to help, but also wants you to do your absolute best to learn the language. It is every day and there is a steady stream of worksheet-type homework, but you get used to it."
