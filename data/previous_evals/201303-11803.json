    "If you've ever wondered how one is supposed to deal with a lot of philosophers disagreeing with each other - this might be a good class for you. Otherwise - maybe not.",
    "Great material and professor. Really interesting topics. The discussions were usually good, but they sometimes became overly cryptic.",
    "Interesting class. Easily the most esoteric I've taken at Yale thus far (and I was in Ancient Notions of Time last year). I still feel that it was useful though, because it dealt with an issue which confronts people regularly in various contexts, but is rarely addressed explicitly. Yes, there were some days when I got a little dozy in class, but there were others where I found myself thinking about the topics we had discussed for weeks -- ever months -- afterwards. Sometimes it could get a bit narrow, but overall I really enjoyed the topic, the course, and how it was taught.",
    "Yes, but it's focused on a very specific topic. It was more focused than I anticipated, but that didn't make me enjoy it any less."
