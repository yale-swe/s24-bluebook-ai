    "Well, if you are a first year econ phd, you have to take this. If you are in another program, honestly, I just think that this course is too technical and too difficult to be sensible.",
    "Most people are required to who take this class.",
    "It's a very good basic course on Game Theory and Contract Theory.",
    "Yes,it introduces a lot of useful topics.",
    "this is what game theory is all about. if you are interested in strategic interaction you should take this course.",
    "It's a challenging course, but with very useful material for future research. I would certainly recommend it.",
    "It's a wonderful graduate game theory course. I would definitely recommend this course to other students.",
    "Definitely you'll learn a lot, but very very challenging and time consuming.",
    "Highly recommend. Even though the workload was ridiculous at times, we survived and learned a lot.",
    "Yes, the concepts are important to know.",
    "It is a required course, but I would recommend it anyway.",
    "Coming from outside the department, I would highly recommend Econ 501 to any student who would like to potentially one day be a producer of game theoretic results, not merely a consumer.",
    "Yes I will.",
    "yes",
    "The course goes through the basic theory of games, information, and mechanism design. I would recommend the course because the concepts from this class are very important to understanding many types of economics research.",
    "Yes, totally. Great Introduction to Game Theory, most of the relevant topics in Game Theory were covered.",
    "very rewarding course",
    "Yes",
    "excellent"

    "I imagine it helped a lot with my understanding! I certainly didn't understand game theory the first time I took it (not at Yale).",
    "It helped me form the basis for further study of Micro Theory and was as such extremely helpful.",
    "Laid theoretical foundation of the research.",
    "We'll see. I haven't started writing yet, or even chosen a topic for that matter.",
    "My knowledge of game theory is much better now.",
    "As I hope to use game theory in the future, the tools sharpened in this course will likely be of direct relevance.",
    "a lot",
    "This course will be very important to understanding certain models in the literature. It is also likely that I will incorporate some of the concepts into my own research.",
    "I am very interested in the part of mechanism of design, I will definitely used it later on for my research.",
    "Very helpful!",

    "Very useful"
