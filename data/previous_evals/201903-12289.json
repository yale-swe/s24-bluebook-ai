    "I started knowing only a few words in Russian, and now I can carry out casual conversations with native Russian speakers about a limited (but incredible considering the little amount of time) number of topics. I have learned a significant amount of vocabulary and grammar, and I have had lots of speaking practice to assist in gaining confidence with conversing.",
    "I gained a comprehensive knowledge of Russian grammar and a solid introductory vocabulary. My reading, writing, and listening skills in Russian improved rapidly, as did my understanding of the more nuanced aspects of grammar. My speaking skills didn't improve as quickly, but it takes more time.",

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "This class goes strictly by the textbook, but I think this course could be improved if it didn't go page by page through the textbook. Some of the exercises in it were not that effective, and I wish we'd spent more time talking during class. The textbook follows a video narrative, and much of this was not very relatable since it was outdated. I enjoyed explanations from Professor Muravnik about the history of certain words and grammatical structures. This made such words and structures easier to remember.",
    "The only complaint I have about the course is the manner in which the alphabet was taught. I already knew the alphabet coming into the class, but I can't imagine that the way we learned the alphabet would have been effective for students who didn't already know it. I think we could have spent a few more days practicing reading (as opposed to pronunciation and the spelling rules right away) to assist students who otherwise fell behind very quickly.",
    "This course was excellent. Constantine explained grammar concepts clearly and created ample space to ask questions and practice skills. One thing to consider in the future is a discussion section or moment where the goal is to simply practice speaking informally but with a little structure or guidance.",
    "This is the best language class (maybe class in general) I've ever taken, so no real complaints. More time with Constantine would be great! He understands so much about the history of the language and knows how the language actually works, which allows him to give really valuable explanations for everything we learn. There are really tricky grammatical concepts in Russian that non-native speakers won't be able to grasp through brute force, so it's great that he knows when to explain things in English and when to challenge us to actually use the target language."

   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this class if you have some background in Russian or at least knowledge of the Russian alphabet.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course! You will learn Russian so quickly! The professor is absolutely incredible and you will certainly have fun learning the most complicated grammar points in the Russian language. If you are looking to learn Russian and you're not afraid of a quick pace, this is the class to take. And the pace isn't even so fast! The workload is manageable, and the knowledge payoff is amazing.",
    "Absolutely! As long as you're comfortable with a challenging classroom environment, it was an excellent language course.",
    "Certainly - the course might be a lot of work if one wants to get the most out of it, but I highly recommend it.",
    "If you like\/are good at picking up languages, then 100% yes!!!"
