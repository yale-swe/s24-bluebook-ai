   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend this class. The field trips are fun, and a great way to see the course content in a concrete way. It is also a very manageable class.",
    "A definite YES if you're taking G&G110. The lab helped solidify my understanding of a bunch of GEO concepts, especially rock identification& formation. Labs are fun, not too time-consuming and very much worth it.",
    "Take the lab if you're really serious about geology. Otherwise, don't. It really is a fun lab, but if you're not looking to really go in depth with geology, you don't get much more out of taking the lab. Psets are short and easy, final paper can be difficult if you don't know how to write or read scientific literature.",
    "We do psets and sometimes go hiking. Basic activities include closely examining and scratching rocks to determine mineral content. Psets often arduous and more about practice than content. Only take it as recommended (with G&G 110 or 115).",
    "I recommend this class. It is chill and you get tea and cookies at 3.30pm. The final paper is relatively easy and the work load is small. Plus great professors and TAs.",
    "Ya take it if you are considering majoring in geology or if you want a *half credit* lab that is actually a half credit of work, which most of them aren't. This lab is interesting and fun, you get to go on field trips rather than be in the lab every time.",
    "A great compliment to the lecture, but also a course that can be taken on its own. Full of field trips and exciting, hands-on activities, this lab was by far the most enjoyable lab I've ever taken. The 1\/2 credit workload is actually a 1\/2 credit for once; but the class itself should be valued for its impact at much more than 1\/2 a credit. The trip in October is a great chance to discover geology in the field, as well as the beautiful vistas of New England, while seeing your peers and professors in a more relaxed context. Definitely worth taking if you have the time and want to learn a bit about geology!!"
