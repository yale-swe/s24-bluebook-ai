    "Our first writing assignment was fairly early in the semester, so perhaps allow for another week before assigning it to allow students to digest the rhythm of the course a bit. The material was very interesting, and at times obscure (to me). Some of the readings would probably be strengthened by having some sort of brief, historical context, unless that's one of the purposes that the work serves, like Hoffman's Revolution for the Hell of it. Actually, much of the historical context is in the reading itself, though some readings like Boal's theater of the oppressed were hard to place for me contextually.",
    "Our class was really small which was great! I think it would have been nice if we could have discussed some of the stuff on the latter half of the syllabus together.",
    "One of the biggest strengths of the course was the syllabus. At first, it was unclear why were reading so much theater theory in a class that was billed as being \"since the 1960s,\" but once we really dug into the more modern stuff, the theory was so relevant and provided a really solid foundation for the rest of the semester."
