    "Irina Andreevna continues the great mineralogical tradition of the Yale Russian department: she is a gem of a teacher. Russian took up 93% of my studying this semester, but it was worth it.",
    "Great continuation of Russian education at Yale. Irina is a great professor who gives you feedback on all assignments. Not too much work but it'll definitely challenge your Russian skills because Irina is able to assess all of her students' strengths and weaknesses and tailors the class accordingly.",
    "It is a fourth-year course that focuses not only on grammar but verbal proficiency and the ability to improvise in another language. We had several reading assignments of the novel \"We\" and watched many news broadcasts. Overall, the work was very manageable but not too easy. I would recommend this course to anyone interested.",
    "Yes! Professor Dolgova is great and your Russian will definitely improve if you take it."
