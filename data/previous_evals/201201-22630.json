    "Italian L4 is essentially a survey of modern Italian film, theater, poetry, and literature. While it does cover a lot of grammar, most of it is a review from L2-L3 and is not very substantial or difficult. The movies are fantastic and the professor is wonderful. I definitely recommend this class, even if you don't need to fulfill a language requirement!",
    "I would highly recommend this course to another student. I personally believe that the Italian department is one of the best language departments at Yale.",
    "Great course, and there is no exam. There's a final project which allows you to learn a lot about something that you are interested in. Some of the culture components, like certain plays and what not, were not my favorite. However, the course overall was great.",
    "L4 Italian is a great class, and totally different from L3. Only a few chapters of grammar are covered, and most of the class is spent watching\/reading movies and poems and discussing them. There are only 4 essays and 5 tests, so the workload is substantially less than L3. It's a great class!",
    "A great class, as always. I wish the grammar portions were taught better, but I enjoyed the emphasis on learning culture through film and literature. Griffin is the best! He's enthusiastic about the subject, genuinely interested in our observations and stories, and enjoys making the class fun. My only concern was that he spent too little time teaching some of the important grammar that the class covered, which made the much bigger writing assignments difficult to master. I also wish he made available the topics for the writing assignments earlier, which pushed 500 words and definitely needed more time. But either way, great teaching and great course.",
    "The way it was organized this term was extremely chaotic, but the movies and cultural things were interesting. You also really notice how your Italian improves throughout the term. Overall, I would definitely recommend taking the course, especially with Griffin.",
    "Do it! Relaxing and fun."
