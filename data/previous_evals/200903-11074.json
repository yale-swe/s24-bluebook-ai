   "comments": [
    "This course was by far the most challenging and most rewarding I have taken at Yale so far. I learned more about methodology than in any other history course, and writing the research project has been a very engaging and immersive experience. That said, these rewards do require significant time and effort on the part of the student, beyond what most other courses - even other research seminars - seem to do.I would heartily recommend it to a fellow student, and I believe it should be a required experience for anyone pursuing research in the Early Modern period at Yale. Having had almost no prior exposure to Early Modern Britain or historical research in an academic setting, I was pleasantly surprised by how open the classes were to non-experts.",
    "Absolutely -- though I would caveat that its workload is intense. The time one invests in it is very much worth it, but the course dominates the semester, to a much great extent than anything else I've heard of or experienced in the history dept.",
    "This class has an incredibly huge workload. You get a lot out of it, but make sure you like early modern British history (esp. high political and economic history) before taking it.",
    "After this seminar, I would recommend any Pincus course to a fellow student."

   "comments": [
    "As mentioned in previous questions, this course has been the most beneficial for deepening my knowledge of methodology and this period of history. It also completely changed my desired area of focus and provided me with useful inspiration for my thesis topic.",
    "See above.",
    "The course contributed to my research by exposing me to the wide range of source material available to me. Moreover, Prof. Pincus was very specific about what materials have been overlooked by historians, and what they might have to offer to my particular historical interests."
