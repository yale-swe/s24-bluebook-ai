    "This class is good if you just want to be pushed to paint and already have some working knowledge of acrylics. If you want a sort of intensive basic painting workshop, this is NOT the class for you. Also, if (like me) you like paintings that are pretty or sort of traditional (literal representation, etc) you might be less satisfied with this class than another: example - we speed-rendered a still life composed of shoes and a plastic hamburger one day.",
    "I would not recommend Art 130. Take a real painting class instead. This wasn't rigorous or inspiring enough to leave me feeling like I had improved or learned much more than I could have just painting on my own.",
    "Super chill class, just show up and do the assignments, and you'll get a good grade and be happy with all the art you've created",
    "this is a great course to take for pretty much anyone. you will see all skill levels in this class, but pretty much everyone improves by the end of it. the work load with anna is very reasonable - about one painting a week - and the type of work is a nice change from cramming \/ paper writing. paints can run out quickly though and get expensive - buy larger tubes than marked on the syllabus sheet as this will save you money in the long run.",
    "This is a fun class and not a lot of work.",
    "Yes! It's great! I had never taken an art class before, and I improved so much. It's enough work to make you improve but not too much.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class for another student. It was awesome.",
    "Painting Basics is fun enjoyable. Anna doesn't teach much; instead, she just sets you up, you paint, and she gives comments. This is a perfect class to take Credit\/D. But I don't know that I'd take it for a grade.",
    "A good amount of painitng",
    "I would recommend this course, but probably under the instruction of Ms. Betzebe because she has more experience as an instructor.",
    "Art 130 01 with Anna Betbeze is a really great introduction to painting. Prof. Anna Betbeze is an incredibly relaxed and relaxing instructor. She creates an atmosphere where students feel free to play around and experiment with the materials as they learn and get used to painting. While she does not give too much technical advice, which, in any event, might have proved to be overwhelming in an introductory class, she allows students to learn by doing. The work can be rigorous, but it is rarely overwhelming. And Prof. Betbeze does her best to be understanding and make sure that her students are comfortable. I think that I really benefited from the opportunity to practice and hone my skills as a painter."
