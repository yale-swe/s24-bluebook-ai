    "I really want to like this class--Rick is a genuinely nice guy who tries his best to make class interesting. But this is an 8:45 AM lecture twice a week at SOM--and it gets worse. Homework in this class is graded on completion, except for three problem sets (one per unit). So already, there's an emphasis placed on quantity (of work), rather than quality. On top of that, Rick sometimes doesn't make available the problem sets until a few days before they're due (even though we spend more than a month on each unit). Plus, he makes us turn in homework for financial statements *before* he lectures on it, meaning we have to learn how to do T-accounts, balance sheets, income statements, and cash flow statements on our own just so we can do our homework. In addition, the solutions he posts (very late, by the way) often contain a number of typos. All in all, this was one of the worst-organized courses I've been a part of the past 6 semesters here at Yale. Lastly, this is the second time Rick's taught this class through Yale College. I've heard from some friends who took it in Fall 2014 (the first time he taught it) that he didn't give any A- or B+ grades. A lot of people were furious with this grading scheme but couldn't include it in their reviews since they had to submit them before getting their grades. So, if you're still considering taking this class, try and find out if Rick gave out A- and B+ grades this time around, because if he didn't, seriously consider taking it Cr\/D unless you want to risk getting shafted. (Because, by the way, all the work you do during the semester--including a take-home final--gets you to a B, and a 90-minute timed final determines whether you get up to an A.)",
    "If you're looking for a course at Yale that will teach you something practical, you found it here. Expect to put in a lot of work or else you'll have no clue what you're doing by the end of the semester.",
    "I would say that this class is worth it if you desire to cover the basics of accounting. You will not learn much more than this, but it is useful knowledge if you plan to go into finance. Be prepared to go to the SOM early in the morning a couple of days a week. The online homework was generally boring but useful. The problem sets were not \"easy\" but they were not too hard either. I took this credit\/D, which made it less stressful. Also, in this class, there is both a take home final and an in class final. If you are happy with a B or are credit D'ing the class, then you only have to take the take home final. I you want a grade higher than a B, then you have to take both the take home and in class final.",
    "I wouldn't take it if I were you. You'd probably learn an equivalent amount of accounting reading a good textbook one your own...",
    "It was a lot of work for a credit d class but good knowledge to have in life.",
    "ACCT 270 spans many topics in accounting as well as excel skills and is a great introduction into the subject, especially before a finance job or internship.",
    "Don't suffer through this course. It isn't worth it. If you do decide to pretend like you like accounting, take it Credit\/D",
    "I'd recommend taking it to get the basics of the course material. There are assignments due each class, some are easy and some take hours, so there is a time consistent time commitment.",
    "Not particularly difficult, though the weekly assignments can be annoying. If it's at 8:45 am again be warned that you will probably just end up skipping.",
    "Highly recommend it for all those interested in how businesses operate financially.",
    "Bad instructor. Does not teach what is needed in problem sets and homework. Repeats information all the time.",
    "If you are planning or thinking about going into finance, take this class!",
    "The walk over to SOM is worth it",
    "This course will teach you accounting and a little bit of valuation. It is NOT an easy course, and it is dreadfully boring at times. That said, you will learn a lot.",
    "If you want to know basic accounting definitely take",
    "A good overview of Accounting. While it's not too hard and there isn't too much workload, it is structured in a way that it's very hard to get an A.",
    "Great course to get exposure to accounting. Rick Antle's humor was great for such a early class. Really appreciated all the effort he put in to help us out.",
    "ACCT 270 was a very helpful course, especially for those with business, finance, or consulting internships in the summer. It was nice to be inroduced to basic business concepts and to get some more familiarity with Excel. Studying for the final was actually a very positive experience because I felt like I learned a lot about how business works. My only complaints about the class are that Professor Antle moved too slowly through the material and that homework was assigned for material that hadn't been taught yet. In the amount of time we had, I think we could have fit in more topics and some more in-depth learning. Homework was due the morning of the lecture in which the material was taught. This was frustrating because students would struggle to teach themselves, turn in the homework, learn about it the next day, and then not have a chance to properly practice\/apply what was taught unless they took the extra time to re-do the submitted homework.",
    "ACCT 270 is a great all-around primer to accounting and valuation. I took it as a grad student looking to replicate some of the SOM core curriculum material, and got all that I was after in this class. There are regular homeworks, but the workload is manageable and no assignment feels extraneous or arbitrary (although the deadlines are always changing and rather hard to track). I learned a lot from Rick, whose style is engaging on an otherwise dry topic, and he's really available to help students. It's a solid class, definitely worth taking if you want to be able to tell an employer you're MBA-capable even if you don't have that degree yet."
