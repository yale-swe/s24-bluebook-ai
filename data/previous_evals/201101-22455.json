   "comments": [
    "I recommend it.",
    "definitely a good class, though our section was a bit lacking in structure. that will probably change in the future.",
    "A good class both for those who wish to get their feet wet and for those more experienced who wish to further develop their skills.",
    "This was kind of a cheap class. We did two projects and had to learn about woodworking in class. More of a woodworking class than intermediate sculpture class...we spent a lot of time talking about technical skills that I will probably never use for the kinds of sculptures I'm interested in building. Not too much work though!!!",
    "Fun class. Lacked the structure of an introductory class like basic drawing. Much more casual atmosphere. Interesting projects.",
    "I really really enjoyed the class - I learned a lot and I really enjoyed the classroom experience. In general I felt it was a supportive learning environment.",
    "I would strongly recommend this class to anyone who feels like they want to learn a valuable skill(s) while at Yale.",
    "Liberal woodworking.",
    "I would recommend this class for students who have taken sculpture before and are looking to expand skill level\/learn new techniques and looking to really talk about your work. It is somewhat debilitating to have students who have never taken an art course in the class. It goes kind of slow but you have to take responsibility in your own hands if you want the class to really move for you."
