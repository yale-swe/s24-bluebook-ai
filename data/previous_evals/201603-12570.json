   "comments": [
    "I came into this class a bit nervous about teaching, and I think that I came away with some of my anxieties dispelled and a better sense of what my choices are when presenting myself to a class and leading a discussion. I felt as if I walked away with a basic literacy in teaching theory, just enough to draw out some of the decision-making problems inherent in classroom work. Doing a bit of teaching, a bit of grading, a bit of reading about teaching approaches, was helpful and did quite a lot to demystify the work that I will be doing next year.",
    "I think the course was a nice introduction to teaching and I think it gave some good practice time to practice teaching in front of colleagues. I think the real heart of the course was in the mandatory visitations we had to make to other instructors' courses.",
    "Good information on how to handle a variety of in-class problems, situations, and goals. Easy movement from the theoretical to the concrete.",
    "The most helpful aspects of the teaching practicum were those in which we put our more abstract discussions to direct practice (i.e. our two teaching observations and the teaching demonstrations that we gave in class). While I enjoyed the opportunity to talk with my cohort about our teaching methods and issues, I felt that I learned the most from observing and teaching in undergraduate classes, where I was not simply dealing in hypothetical scenarios but was actually engaging with students as a teacher. In those settings, I was able to observe different teaching styles and get a better sense of the diverse range of dynamics at play in the classroom firsthand. Whereas I'm sure the seminar discussions aimed to acquaint us with planning techniques and and some teaching philosophies, I do not think I would have felt prepared to apply those ideas in my future teaching without the valuable experience of actually seeing a classroom in action."

   "comments": [
    "The emphasis upon practice as opposed to theory-- the textbook pretty much dropped away after the first couple of weeks-- was, I thought, a smart choice. To teach and watch other people teach, as opposed to talking about teaching in the abstract, was for me the most valuable part of the class, once the preliminary readings had helped to create a framework for discussion and draw out some of the nuances of teaching practice and the classroom atmosphere. There were things that did not come up in class discussions that might have been helpful, practical problems concerning how to put together a syllabus, grade papers, and so on. The readings were also sometimes, admittedly, a bit dated, and could use some revision. However, on the whole, I felt that it was a good introduction. The slow pace of the syllabus meant that there were gaps in coverage, but the culture of the class was friendly, supportive, and low-key, which I found very helpful.",
    "I think Alfie is a very kind, understanding teacher, and I think the actual teaching was hugely helpful for many members of the class. I think the course could be supplemented with more readings on the practical aspects of course preparation, e.g. syllabus drafting, grading, etc.",
    "It's unacceptable how little attention was given to the role that identity (of a teacher as well as a student) plays in teaching, both because it's 2016 and because of how consistently graduate students have asked for greater training and support on this issue even just in the two years that I've been here. We had exactly two conversations that I can remember that touched even obliquely on race, gender, sexuality, class, or any other kind of difference: the first was prompted by a student's question in the middle of a discussion of a different topic, and the second resulted from some readings that students had submitted at Alfie's solicitation. Neither was planned for or structured within the larger shape of the class, and neither would have happened had students not proactively initiated them. All of our sample teaching and role playing was instructive, but graduate students don't teach in a vacuum, they don't all teach the same material, and their students will not be other graduate students.",
    "The course is well-designed to allow for student involvement. This always prevented it from seeming disconnected from real teaching.",
    "Alfie did a great job of encouraging excitement about teaching, and gave us interesting technical suggestions for planning courses. That said, this course would benefit from shifting emphasis away from vague teaching philosophies and toward more practical techniques for interacting with students--particularly methods of dealing with the difficulties of teaching politically and emotionally sensitive materials in the classroom. While I would not expect any clear-cut method for teaching about difficult topics, or topics that might affect different students in different ways, I do think that the course would have been more helpful if we had devoted more time and attention to this aspect of teaching. Alfie did a wonderful job of facilitating a classroom space in which I felt comfortable to ask questions about these issues, but I think a more direct and deep attention to the possible challenges of teaching sensitive materials should be built into the course structure. Also, while I found it very helpful to practice writing lesson plans, I wish we had spent some time learning techniques for grading assignments and crafting syllabi."

    "Yes-- I think it's good background for anyone who, like me, is new to teaching.",
    "I would recommend this course, as I think preparation for teaching is a hugely important part of our training that is unfortunately neglected at Yale. I would even advise adding another required course that focused only on the history of rhetoric and composition to better prepare us to teach.",
    "I strongly recommend the course."
