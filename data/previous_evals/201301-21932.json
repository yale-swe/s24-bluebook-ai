    "This is basically the kind of cozy seminar experience you read about in Yale College marketing brochures. Dean G hosted a cookies-and-architecture-documentary night, as well as an end-of-term celebratory dinner. Grading: 1 collaborative presentation on Santa Maria Donna Regina, 2 prompt-based essays (1 in class but you could bring an outline, 1 typed at home, neither of them serious scary research papers).",
    "I would recommend this class to people who are more art-historically inclined. As a history art major, I had a blast with this class, I felt intellectually challenged, and I felt that I learned an enormous bit about a very interesting portion of Italian history. However, I know some undecided majors in the class who had more trouble with the artistic stuff.",
    "If you can, you should absolutely take a class with Prof. Genoni. She really knows her stuff and the class is so incredibly interesting, even though it seems like a niche interest. It's not a lot of work (very little reading, midterm is an essay which you come into with an outline, and take-home essay final), but you feel like you learn so much, which is great!",
    "Take this class if you are are interested in talking about power and identity as it relates to medieval\/early Renaissance Naples. It is a pretty focused class, so take a look at the syllabus closely and you'll get a sense whether you are interested or not. There's an average amount of work. It's a good class, but in the end I think there are more worthwhile options.",
    "One of the best classes I've taken at Yale. It was extremely informative and manageable workload. The class and topics relate to anything you are learning in school, you only have to find the connections! 100% take this class!",
    "This is a great class for people interested in a Humanities take on art history, because it is all about taking art and architecture and understanding it in the context of the Neapolitan politics and rulership of the day. Each week focuses on different important monuments and tombs, and they all relate to each other in one way or another. Because of that, the class can sometimes feel unstructured because it doesn't follow a strict timeline, which for me made it occasionally difficult to keep the monuments straight. But the midterm and the final are both formulated as a paper with several different options for prompts that are provided a few days before, so they're actually a great opportunity to really sift through what you've learned and make sense of it in your head. They are also not stressful assignments. About halfway through the semester each person also does a presentation on a reading with a partner, which is actually fun because you get to really dive into one topic. There is also plenty of reading each week (although not an overwhelming amount), but everyone is assigned to be in charge of one reading per semester which takes the pressure off the rest of the class to answer questions about the reading. Overall, this is an interesting class but I don't necessarily feel like I learned a semester's worth of material because of the structure.",
    "This course explores the strategic use of Gothic architecture and the borrowing of predecessors' design as political propaganda in medieval Naples. It is interesting to observe the history of such a small region and the evolution of Naples. I would recommend it to art history majors and non majors alike.",
    "I would do whatever you can to take this class, with the assumption that Dean G. is teaching it. Even if you are a Physics major and have never taken a humanities class, she makes this relatively obscure topic relevant to each student and exciting.",
    "Yes! Great seminar! Readings are not too long or difficult and there are not too many assignments. The midterm and final are basically take-home so you really have to think about what you learned in class in order to do well. It's not hard to succeed, but you do have to focus and pay attention in class.",
    "Great course suitable for science majors and art history buffs. Excellent overview of both history, art, and architecture. Prof. Genoni does a fantastic job explaining the material and making the class very enjoyable."
