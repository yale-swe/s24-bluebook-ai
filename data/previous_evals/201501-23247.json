    "It's like a review of Spanish grammar etc. learned in SPAN 110 and SPAN 120, but in more depth. It helped me to strengthen my current knowledge, expand my vocabulary, and more comfortably use a range of verb tenses. It help with Spanish speaking, writing, listening, and reading skills--and it's enjoyable to have every day. I would definitely recommend this course.",
    "Spanish 130 is a great class. Take it if you'd like to learn Spanish.",
    "Spanish 130 is a class that allows you to practice your Spanish on a daily basis. It provides plenty of opportunity to read, write, listen and speak, and it also provides a good refresher on a lot of grammar. As someone who took a lot of Spanish in high school, but then took some time off, it was a great reintroduction to Spanish.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course and more specifically, recommend professor Reymundi.",
    "You'll review everything you've learned up to this point and also the finer details of Spanish. Never used the word \"sino\" because you didn't know when it was appropriate? You'll learn it here. The class can be fun and rewarding as long as you invest the appropriate time and energy into it."
