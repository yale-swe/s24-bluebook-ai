    "Excellent senior seminar. Perfect balance of work. Greg is AWESOME.",
    "Absolutely. If you have any interest at all in neuroscience and how humans make decisions, I strongly recommend this. But keep in mind that you'll need at least a passing interest, or the talk of brain area X and brain area Y will fade into mush. Also, it would be a very good idea to brush up on your general brain science beforehand -- which areas are where, and what sorts of things they do. Otherwise, you might get lost in class discussion.",
    "Great class. It's exactly what you think: read a bunch of neuroscience papers, write a reading response, talk about the papers, 10-page essay at the end. A lot of work, but if this is your area of study and you think you want to take it, then you probably want to take it. Students were well-versed in the subject area which made discussions lively and even fun. Greg is a fantastic resource and super approachable, a guy worth knowing. He also gives you all the hot gossip on the authors of the papers, which is always fun.",
    "I'd definitely recommend this class. It's an exploration into the different components of decision-making, with a good amount of neuroscience but also a reflection on greater applicability of topics.",
    "An amazing class. You learn to read papers very very well, write brief synopses really really well, notice and articulate nuances well, and think about bigger questions. Take it.",
    "I would definitely recommend it. The content is super interesting. Even though for my own personal purposes I prefer to study neuro in the context of mental disorders and decision-making in the context of behavior, it's definitely worth it to get to know the underlying mechanisms that are at play during the decision-making process. Greg is awesome, the requirements are totally doable (10 page paper--with built in interim deadlines, weekly 600-word reading response, 2 very small presentations). The readings are very dense, especially at the beginning, but you will learn how to get the most important information from them and synthesize across materials very efficiently by the end of the course through the reading responses. The reading responses were an especially good resource when writing the final (and for the future too) since each summarizes 5 or 6 articles in 600 words or less.",
    "I wholeheartedly recommend this absolutely amazing course, which is also an excellent option to fulfill your senior psych writing requirement if you need it. Greg is the best professor at Yale. He's funny, engaging, totally brilliant, and genuinely cares more about his students than any other prof or TA I've had at Yale. Each week you read 4-6 recent journal articles and write a 600-word response. Some of the papers are long and difficult, but one of the best things about the course is how quickly you become a pro at reading this kind of literature. The reaction papers are difficult at first, but Greg gives great feedback and is good about communicating expectations. The readings are a really good mix and provide the meat of the discussion topics for each class. This is definitely a discussion-based seminar, and you are expected to contribute each week. Student questions drive most of the discussion, and every class kicks off with a mini-presentation from student groups about that week's readings. The final paper is totally open-ended and, as I said, is a great choice for your senior psych writing requirement. Greg seemed to always be willing to meet and talk about the paper or anything else, and the proposal and half-finished draft he requires at points throughout the semester help keep you structured and focused. Take this class if you want to learn a lot, be significantly but not unreasonably challenged, and have a fantastic classroom experience.",
    "An absolutely phenomenal course, one of the best in the Psych department. The seminar is a survey course on neuroeconomics: the neuroscience behind key components of decision-making, e.g. subjective valuation, intertemporal discounting, risky and ambiguous decision-making, and neuromarketing. It's a lot of neuroscience (all your readings are journal articles) and so it's quite challenging, but by the end of the semester you'll have gained a really good picture of how exactly you make decisions. Greg is the coolest dude ever! He's extremely knowledgeable and presents the course material in a thorough yet understandable manner, and creates such a fun class environment that I wish this seminar met more than once a week. The course is tough and maybe harder than the syllabus makes it out to be (the reading responses take much longer than you'd think they would and grading is rigorous), so be prepared to work for your grade, but it's so worth it. If you're a psych major with an interest in behavioral economics, this course will definitely cause a surge in your VTA\/midbrain dopamine neuron activity!",
    "I recommend the course if you are interested in the material. It is certainly not easy! There is a considerable amount of reading and since it is seminar-style you can't really slack off. Each week you write a short summary of the articles that you read. There is also a final paper with a semester deadline for the first draft. \"Jump-starts\" are fun demos that people in the class take turns doing and they usually involve something consumable. Prof. SL is laid back, easy to talk to, and knows his field. Overall, a great senior seminar. Only aspect I would like to see improved is to have a better balance between teaching and discussion - and having a little more explanation from Prof. SL",
    "Take this class if you're interested in the way that neural regions control different aspects of decision making, like physical and cognitive effort, time discounting, reinforcement learning and more.",
    "VERY neuro heavy. Papers are long, hard, and exceedingly dull. Tons of homework, and the reading responses take a long time to write. But class discussions were great.",
    "Highly recommend. Great survey of work that's been done in decision neuroscience. Class is organized by weekly themes. Professor SL also wants you to be a good student and participant in group discussionweekly reaction papers make sure that everyone has read the material and he has you turn in half your paper ahead of time so that you won't end up writing all of it last minute.",
    "take it if you can get in, I learned so much and Greg is amazing.",
    "Don't be fooled by the \"PSYC\/ ECON\" course listing... This is a SERIOUS neuroscience course. You'll read 5-6 imaging papers each week (writing a short review paper on them), discuss real brain regions\/neural processes, and do true methods critiques of the journal articles. But if you're up for it, the payoff is huge. You'll learn neuroeconomicsa cool and relevant and (relatively) unexplored area of neurosciencea mile deep; you'll be taught by a wonderfully caring and instructive and organized professor; and, if you put in the time, you'll feel like you've learned a ton from this course. Workload is pretty sizable, but so is Greg's skill as an instructor and the learning payoff of the class. Great elective- fun, interesting, rigorous."
