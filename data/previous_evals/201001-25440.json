   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend it, even if you have no experience drawing.",
    "Art 114 is a great course if you are debating being an art major or just trying to think in a new way. As a liberal arts major, it was great to work in a different way and improve my drawing. After practicing every day I can certainly say that I made great strides in my abilities.",
    "If you want to get better at drawing, this is a great way to do it, obviously. Of course to be honest, if you had the willpower to just practice sincerely and with dedication, and you have someone to give you advice... this isn't the most necessary, unique course in the world. But Anna Betbeze is a perfect drawing instructor and you'll definitely improve over the course of the semester.",
    "Its a fun course that will teach you how to draw, regardless if you think you can or can't do it.",
    "Yes!",
    "If you have any interest in drawing, take this class. Not only is it a lot of fun and a nice break from textbooks, but your drawing ability will increase tenfold. This course covers all the basic forms of drawing (hence its name) as well as some painting towards the end of the semester.",
    "Absolutely take it. Especially as a 5th class.",
    "I would absolutely recommend basic drawing with Anna Betbeze. Anna gave me something worth looking forward to every Tuesday\/Thursday. I came into the class with absolutely no talent in drawing and came out feeling as though I had legitimately improved myself. Take it!",
    "Take it for sure! I mean, if you're an art major you have to - so you might as well enjoy yourself and take it with Anna! A great professor and a great person. Manageable workload, fun projects - you'll love going to class!",
    "Anyone who currently enjoys drawing or wants to learn how to draw would absolutely love this class. It'll push you past where you thought you could go but at the same time is incredibly relaxing and a wonderful change of pace for anyone who isn't an art major.",
    "Great basic drawing class, but don't expect to be doing a lot with a pencil! You have to be pretty self-motivated to make great workoutside of class because it is so time-consuming, but the in class projects are difficult but truly helpful. Be patient and work hard, and no matter what, this class will make you better and will (for me at least) change even how you see things when your walking around (like seeing the sky cut into a building in decreasing rectangles instead of a building in front of the sky.)"
