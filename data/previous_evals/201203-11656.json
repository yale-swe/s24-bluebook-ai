    "This was Su Wei's first year teaching this course. I felt that it was very unstructured, and we didn't really learn any grammar in class, we mostly just answered questions from the book and listened to Su Wei's life experience. Su Laoshi is a really interesting person, and he is very knowledgeable, but as this was the first year of him teaching this course, it wasn't fantastic, and I feel like my writing and speaking abilities have probably not gotten any better. Nonetheless, I do feel an improvement in my listening and reading comprehension. Shop this course and see what you think, it may get better next time around, or maybe if you really like self-study, it's just the course you're looking for.",
    "I would say this class is mostly learning Chinese through engaging with modern Chinese culture. Each lesson in the text book is about a part of Chinese culture, looking at history of it, detailing its change across time, and talking about its present condition. Our professor brings in many examples of modern Chinese culture from his life to enrich the discussion. My favorite example is when he saw a sign in a Chinese hotel saying that it offers the best service among hotels because the staffs never hit or shout at its customers. I'd recommend this class because learning Chinese through Chinese culture is so interesting and a lot of fun.",
    "I would recommend it if you are interested in pursuing Chinese a high level. It's interesting and rewarding, though very rigorous. If you are simply looking for an L5 credit, go for the lower L5 course.",

    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student. It is a demanding class, but not one without rewards.",
    "It's a good class. Just a bit of a letdown after a summer abroad. I just lacked some of the energy until the end of the class."
