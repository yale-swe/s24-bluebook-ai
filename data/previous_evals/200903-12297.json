    "Very interesting class. Great if you're looking for something off the beaten path.",
    "absolutely. i think once professor wetters has taught this course 1-2 more times and has a better feel for how to make it cohesive, it will be a truly fantastic class.",
    "I totally recommend this class. Maybe you'll get a few characters in your class like I did. I think this class definitely attracts a certain kind of person, so it should be fun!",
    "I would recommend this course to a student who is interested in studying trust games. Otherwise, the two-hour seminar could quickly become overwhelming for an uninterested student.",
    "Definitely! Professor Wetters is a quiet but really nice guy, and the seminar was a great forum for checking out some interesting works of literature, as well as ample opportunity for relevant tangents to provide some interesting discussion.",
    "If you enjoy reading and thinking about difficult concepts, this class would be very enjoyable.",
    "We basically read a lot of stories about con artists. The stories are very interesting, and the discussions are as well. However, it is totally not practical in any way. But it does make you think about what truly is a lie and when it is acceptable. A good class overall.",
    "I thought this class was very interesting. The topic of con men is one that I knew a little bit about from pop culture but learned to appreciate at a much deeper level. Con men come up in nearly every area of our society and their morality is something interesting to talk about.If Prof. Wetters teaches this class again, I can anticipate him using some different materials. At times the conversation based class slowed as we repeated the same concepts about can men. Given another chance to teach the class, I think Wetters would incorporate many other things.Overall I liked it.",
    "If you think this class might sound too good to be true, you might be right. The topic itself is so elusive and ambiguous that unfortunately the discussions were always slightly disappointing. However, you will read some interesting material on con men and fakery in general, and every once in a while the conversations will be really fascinating."
