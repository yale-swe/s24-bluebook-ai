    "Work intensive class. A lot of homework. Not too hard to do decently well though.",
    "Great course! A lot of work (daily quizzes, 7-8 characters a night, daily hw, etc.), but absolutely worth it--especially if you are like me and had close to no working knowledge of chinese.Strengths: Learn a lot; weekly tutorial (graduate student listens to you read weekly passages); class meets every dayWeaknesses: 1-4 hours of hw per night, depending on your skill level; weekly tutorial (held on friday, saturday, or sunday); class meets every day (had to wake up early for 9:20 am class every day)Perk: Light Fellowship! Free money! Only East Asian languages have this fantastic program for you to study abroad (summer, summer + fall, or summer + academic year) for free! This alone should convince you to take Chinese!Highly recommended.",
    "Good class, I learned a lot this semester. You do have work every single day and a quiz every day so you need to be able to make the time commitment. Otherwise, very worthwhile.",
    "This class is a lot of work, but is manageable if you plan for 1-2 hours of homework\/study every day. You get used to the daily quiz and you really learn a lot. Liang lao shi is very good, with a great sense of humor and very engaging. I hope she is my teacher again next semester!",
    "Chinese 112 is by no means an easy course. In fact, it was arguably the hardest that I took the fall of my freshman year. That said, it was also a very good course that I have no regrets about taking. Assuming 112 is the right level of Chinese for you, it would be almost impossible for your Chinese not to improve after this course. However, a degree of speaking proficiency is definitely necessary. Although your vocabulary will probably improve, the course does not spend a ton of time correcting pronunciation and tones. If you are committed to learning Chinese and are at the appropriate level for this course, I would definitely recommend it.",
    "I would recommend the class to another student. I feel like my Chinese has improved a lot through the semester.",
    "Chinese 112 is INTENSE, but very helpful. you learn 300+ characters a semester in addition to 5-20 vocabulary words a day. (depending on the day). It moves at a fast paced, but its manageable as long as you study for the daily quizzes and study a little extra everyday.",
    "I would recommend Chinese 112 to other students. There is daily homework and quizzes in class which makes the course load tough, but depending on how well your heritage background is, it may be easier\/more difficult. But the class is worth 1.5 credits for a reason. Daily repetition of what we've learned would probably be useful so you don't turn into me trying to relearn everything before each exam.",
    "Yes! Chinese 112 01 is totally manageable and I saw a huge improvement in my ability to ready, write, and speak Chinese over the course of one semester. You are always prepared for exams and quizzes and sure, the class (like every other L1\/L2 language class) is everyday, but that's the only way that you can really retain what you learn.",
    "Chinese 112 01 is very heavily loaded in course work. There is homework every night and also a quiz every day. In other words, it takes AT LEAST two hours of your day, everyday. However, don't let the amount of work discourage you. You actually get used to the amount of work and find a way to manage it. I have learned so much form this course in just a semester. I would definitely recommend it to everyone who is ready for the work load.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. It provides a good foundation for future studies in Chinese.",
    "Definitely recommend. If you have had even a little background in Chinese, take 112 over 110.",
    "Chinese 112 is a lot of fun. I came into Yale absolutely hating languages, and I have really enjoyed learning Chinese. I came into this class with VERY little background in Chinese. (Even though this is a heritage class, speaking is still very difficult for me), but I still found this course to be amazing. Liang Laoshi is incredible! And the structure of the course\/course packet is extremely effective in making you learn the language. Even though it is quite a bit of work, it is basically all busy work, so it really is not that taxing.",
    "The course was pretty much what you\u0092d expect from an intro language course \u0096 lots of brute force memorization, not terribly enjoyable but rewarding nonetheless because of the practical benefits. It\u0092s a time sink so you\u0092ll spend lots of hours doing homework for the course, but none of the material is conceptually difficult."
