   "comments": [
    "A thorough survey of art during the long 17th century, aka c. 1550-1750. Wonderful explorations of Velazquez, Vermeer, Caravaggio. While typical in its format (teaching from slides, sections in the art galleries), the exams are definitely not typical--the midterm didn't have any slide identifications. Rather, that information was given to you and you were instead asked to apply the broader themes of the course and your skills in visual analysis to form an answer. Easier in theory, but tricky in the moment.",
    "yes its a fun class if you are into art history and if you're not it helps you appreciate art",
    "yes",
    "The number of assignments is standard and there is virtually no required reading for the course (usually an article a week, if that). That being said, Chris Wood's lectures are intricately designed and demand active engagement in looking at and making connections between works of art, and this can be difficult to follow if you don't have experience with art history. Make sure you're willing to go along for the ride and you're sure to enjoy it!",
    "This class is easily the best class in the entire university. Even if you have no prior experience with art history, this course is simply fabulous. Professor Wood is one of the most fascinating lecturers and makes the class come alive like no other. This class is absolutely essentially to take at any level or with any interest because it gives you a fundamental understanding of art history as a discipline. I would retake this course 100 times if I could.",
    "YES. Do not graduate from Yale without having taken this course or at least something from Christopher Wood",
    "I would definitely recommend anyone with even a slight interest in 17th century art to take this class.",
    "DO IT. worth the work.",
    "Take this class only if you're really interested in the period and are already somewhat knowledgeable about the historical context that surrounds the art. Otherwise, you might find it a bit hard to follow. It's not a typical art history survey.",
    "Yes, if you are interested in the subject matter, this class will offer both a broad look and specific focus on painting in the 17th century.",
    "This class was a very interesting course that covered a wide range of information. We looked at a huge number of images that were both well known and little known but yet very interesting and important. Lectures and section are both really interesting and engaging. I thought, with the exception of the final which was extremely difficult, the course was amazing.",
    "If you liked Nemerov's intro lecture, you'll love Wood's style too. It was A LOT of work (weekly section, 2 short papers, 1 long paper, midterm and final), but I got so much out of it. The artists you'll learn about are both the heavy-hitters (Caravaggio, Rembrandt, Vermeer, Velazquez) as well as the slightly less well known (Tiepolo, van Ruisdael, Hals).For the midterm and final, you really have to be able to come up with your own interpretations for the comparisons you're given, which is pretty tough.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course. The material, readings, and sections are great, and not too burdensome, and Professor Wood is incredibly engaging and inspired. I cannot say I walked into the class knowing much or being too interested in 17th century art, but I certainly walked away feeling as if I knew the material and that I really appreciated the art and history.",
    "Great course, take it. You can actually learn something from your time at Yale.",
    "TAKE THIS COURSE. I didn't expect to be very excited about the 17th century, but found myself absolutely adoring the material. The lectures are unusual and exciting, and provide a great entry into the 17th century.",
    "TAKE IT. BEST LECTURE I'VE TAKEN AT YALE SO FAR.",
    "History of Art is a terrific introduction to the works, both famous and less well known, of the major seventeenth and eighteenth century artists of western Europe. Take this if you've ever wanted to look at works by Caravaggio, Velazquez, Rembrandt, Vermeer, Rubens, and many other notable artists. This is the best art."
