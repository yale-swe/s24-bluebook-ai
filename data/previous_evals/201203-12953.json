   "comments": [
    "Only take this if talking a lot about the impact of slavery on American society today (as the class name implies) is something that really interests you. The conversations were many times very philosophical and hypothetical which made me lose interest at times. I did learn a good amount about slavery through the readings, but some readings were boring and over my head. It was a good class, and Professor Ball did a good job with it, but just make sure you're actually interested in the material.",
    "The course deals more with the social and cultural implications of slavery than the hard history of it (though a knowledge of the history is still good to have, and you do learn a lot of history). Some of the readings and documents dealt with in the class are incredibly moving and some of the issues discussed are very difficult to deal with. Discussing these things in such a small and open environment, with a professor like Edward Ball, is a really amazing experience. The class bonded more than any other I've had and really changed my personal outlook on certain things. I would definitely recommend to anyone",
    "This class follows the way in which slavery is remembered. There is much reading for the class. However, the reading really provides you with all you need to have a meaningful discussion in class. There is one class trip that we took in which we discussed all we had learned over the course of the semester. That trip really made all we had learned more real. I would recommend that a fellow student take this course because it will certainly make you think, if nothing else.",
    "I think that if the subject matter interests you a lot, then you will like this class. However, papers are infrequent and Professor Ball has high standards, so if getting an A is your top priority, this is not the class for you.",
    "The best part about this class was the people and the interesting nature of the material, so i actually wouldn't really recommend it. Also, Professor Ball is a little eccentric and hard to get help from in terms of your writing for the class. I definitely wouldn't want to be in one of his 120 sections.",
    "However, the grading seems to be very illogical at times and almost incomprehensible. There seems to be a strong degree of self-centeredness. Reading the professor's own book and watching clips of him on film can be particularly awkward. It is very interesting as a whole but I only recommend this as a class if you are very keen on learning about slavery and are willing to struggle with a system with no apparent order.",
    "The Memory of Slavery is a broad overview of American Slavery and its repercussions in American society. There are a lot of readings which are not always necessary, but you get more out of the class if you do them. I would definitely recommend this class to another student, especially if he or she were interested in having a more educated view of American culture.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS IT IS SO FUN AND INTERESTING",
    "Don't expect this course to be a history course. Expect some (one) creative assignment(s). It elucidated many of my thoughts about the issue, as well as giving me new perspectives from which to understand and encounter everyday issues. Worth it? Yes. What I expected? No."
