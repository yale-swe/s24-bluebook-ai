    "Polishing up presentation skills, both presenting one's self and one's work.",
    "This course is a great opportunity to learn how to do research and how to manage yourself over the course of a long project.",
    "This course was great for developing in-lab research experience, as well as effective communication skills to relate this work.",
    "In this course I learned a formalized way of conducting scientific research, and how to navigate current literature and writing content to describe my research.",
    "I learned about various aspects of doing research (ex. reading papers, analyzing data, presenting results, writing reports).",
    "What you learn will be dependent on your project, your advisor, and how hard you work. There was also a lecture component to the class, but to be honest I didn't think it was super useful."

  {
   "question_id": "YC403",
   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Weaknesses is that it doesn't really teach much, and having the lectures seemed like a little bit of a time sink with little reward except showing the expectations for the presentations etc.",
    "On the whole, the class was well balanced. Some of the lectures were less helpful than others (the lesson on fashion wasnt necessary). That time might have been better spent working on the final report.",
    "The research component of this course, although highly advisor-dependent, is engaging, generally rewarding, and educational. The classroom component, although understandably necessary, occasionally felt superfluous. More engaging classroom time, maybe including more on presentation skills, research frontiers, etc. could be interesting.",
    "This course is pretty hands off, in terms of involvement from the teaching staff. This is great if you want the freedom to work under the direction of your lab, but it can be difficult if your project is more self directed.",
    "I found the lectures to be super informative and useful. I often went back to the slide decks \/ my notes from class later on as reference.",
    "The biggest strength is that you have the freedom to choose a project of your interest."

   "comments": [
    "Yeah! It's easy and if you're doing research you might as well get credit for it.",
    "Yes if you have a meaningful project and a good adviser",
    "This course is exactly what it sounds like: an opportunity to do research, with a big paper at the end.",
    "This course is great for developing research experience and getting one-on-one experience with a professor. I would definitely recommend it if you are interested in pursuing research in the future, otherwise it is a lot of time, even for a fairly guaranteed good grade.",
    "This is a great course if you have a plan for it, and a clearly defined idea of what you want to accomplish over the course of the semester. Otherwise, it's hard to make the most out of the course.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student if there's a project you want to work on \/ a lab you want to work in. It gave me a better understanding of how to do research, and doing the work for a class made me more disciplined about getting things done.",
    "I think that with this course, you get out as much as you put in. If you're working hard, approaching the problem from multiple angles, you'll learn a lot."
