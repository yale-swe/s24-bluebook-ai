    "It is a really good course to learn the basics of ecology, and how to apply ecological ideas to paleontology, to make the field of paleoecology. I recommend it to any student who does not have a strong background in ecology, because if they do, it might be too basic.",
    "You read the most important papers of ecology and then read a paper that tries to adapt this concept to the fossil record. I would recommend the class if someone was interested in ecology."

    "IT deepened my knowledge of paleoecology a lot, because I had basically never learned anything about it before. It will probably not apply much to my dissertation research, though, since I don't plan to have much of an ecological component.",
    "It gave me some ideas of what hasn't been done with the fossil record yet."
