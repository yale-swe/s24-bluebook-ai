    "If you took ENGL 500 or happen to know Old English, absolutely take this class. It is the most important, beautiful, and rewarding work you could read in the language. Professor Frank is brilliant and always generous with her time. The workload is heavy at first, but gets easier as vocabulary and grammatical structures recur. The class is also likely to be fairly small, which is great. Take it!",
    "ENGL 501 is a translation of Beowulf in the original Anglo-Saxon, with some accompanying poems paired to enhance an understanding of the text. Familiarity with the Anglo-Saxon language is a must. I would absolutely recommend this course to my fellow students. I do hope that this course and its companion Anglo-Saxon introduction [ENGL 500] will always be available to students who want to learn more about our Modern English language roots."

    "As a medievalist, I loved being able to explore a bit farther back into the history of our English language and literature. I have thought very frequently about becoming a combo Anglo-Saxonist and Medievalist as a result of this course. I know full well that I will be able to use what I learned in this course not only in my dissertation, but also in my future teaching. I feel I have an invaluable, irreplaceable skill set after taking this course with Roberta."
