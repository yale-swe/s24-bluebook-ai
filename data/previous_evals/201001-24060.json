   "comments": [
    "Nigeria, plain and simple.",
    "Take it if you're interested in Nigeria, if not I wouldn't recommend it since it is a specific country that is not necessarily extremely important to have in depth knowledge about",
    "I learned so much about Nigeria this semester and I'm very glad I took this course. I would definitely recommend taking this class.",
    "Definitely take it if you need a WR and are looking for a good time",
    "This is a great course. Professor Adesola is wonderful. He is truly devoted to his students, very understanding, and very accommodating. In terms of a writing credit, this is probably one of the easiest you can take. There are only two 6 page papers and weekly 1-2 page reading responses. While the responses can become tedious, the papers are fun and very easy to write. This class offers a broad overview of Nigeria and is not intended for those who are very familiar with the country. You review very basic information about culture, customs, language, geography, religion, etc. The class is very lighthearted and not stressful at all. I would certainly recommend taking it.",
    "A class worth taking",
    "I definitely recommend for any student interested in learning basic facts about Nigeria and having a broad picture of this giant of Africa",
    "Absolutely, if you want to learn about Nigeria, which i think is pretty interesting. And through the class and students, you get some perspective even if little on other African countries.",
    "Nigeria + Nigerians (home and abroad) + fun interactive class sessionsTake it",
    "This is a great classroom dynamic: it was probably around 40% African, with some African Americans, a American of Jamaican heritage, and non-blacks from with various heritages. This provided for a very interesting coversation.",
    "Yes, because it's informative, interesting and fun!",
    "yes i would. this class is amazing!",
    "Very laid back class. Much of the work is done independently and the teachers lets you choose your own topics to write about. Definitely a must take for anyone interested in anything Nigerian or African for that matter.",
    "Take it. The course was great. It gave me a chance to learn about the aspects of Nigerian history and culture which interested me. Moreover, Prof. Adesola is great. He is funny and interesting and he really cares about his students. I know so much more about Nigeria and West Africa now.",
    "I think that this is a class where you learn a lot about Nigeria.",
    "Yes!! Definitely. You will learn a lot about Nigeria. Even if you don't really think you would be interested in knowing stuff about Nigeria you will still have fun in the class.",
    "A MUST TAKE!",
    "The students in the class get to know each other well and you do read interesting material, but don't go in expecting to learn a lot about current Nigerian affairs. The class needs to be much more rigorous."
