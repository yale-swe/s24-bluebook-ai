   "comments": [
    "For sure. As far as real-world applications and worldview expansion, I think this is the class I've learnt the most from. It was thoroughly enjoyable and altogether a stress-free course. Even though it's a 350, I entered as a freshman with no prior knowledge of the subject matter and I did very well and had a wonderful time.",
    "YES! If you are interested in medicine or public health, take it!!!!! It is inter-disciplinary, has amazing guest lecturers, and you have a lot of freedom on the papers.",
    "I would recommend it because it opened my eyes to a whole new way of viewing violence and changed my perspective on it. I learned a great deal and Professor Lee really cared about her students. The only caveat is that there are a lot of guest lecturers and not much discussion.",
    "This is a great introductory course to violence. The interdisciplinary nature of this course serves the topic very well. There needs to be more interdisciplinary courses at Yale and more courses on violence as well - this class does both very well. Professor Lee is a caring, responsive professor who knows so much about this topic. The guest speakers have always been relevant and informative.",
    "This course is amazing and allows you to think about violence from completely different perspectives: biological, psychological, legal, public health, anthropological, etc. This interdisciplinary approach was very significant, and I can honestly say that it is the best seminar that I have taken here at Yale."
