    "I would recommend the course as a low-key way to have a more formal introduction to photography, as well as a space that pushes them to be better photographers. That said, it is not particularly formal or rigorous, for someone who's looking for more rigor from the course.",
    "If you want to learn about photography, you must take this class.",
    "Art 138 is a fantastic course that will really help you develop your photography to a new level, especially if you're a beginner. You will learn to perfect photo-taking techniques needed to take great exposures, and you will also learn to be quite proficient in post-processing with photoshop. Perhaps most importantly, you will learn to become very good at printing your work, a talent which you probably won't ever have another chance to develop after college.The course is time-intensive, and even as a senior taking it credit\/D I found myself investing a lot of time simply because I found the work exciting and compelling. If you want to do well, you will need to put quite a bit of thought and time into everything - but the good news is you'll want to do that anyways.Take the course with Professor Maida if possible, he is really a wonderful instructor and will help you immensely. Take this course if you can, it will be hard to get into... but it is really one of the most enjoyable courses I took at Yale, and simultaneously produced some wonderful images that I will be able to treasure after graduation.",
    "Take it. It's fun.",
    "If you have interest in photography, TAKE IT. You will not regret it. It is a fair amount of work though, and you will need to dedicate yourself to it if you want the full package of what the course has to offer. And don't hesitate because you're not an art major or anything remotely related. There was actually quite a diversity in the class in terms of our majors, though art majors and art-related majors do have priority in getting into the class. Really, the only problem is getting into the class because there's always so much competition. But really, this class is a must take.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student, if they could get in. It's just a great change of pace from everything else Yale offers--but don't let the art aspect of the class fool you, this class is still challenging in that you have to take really, really great pictures in order to truly succeed. This is no place for the easy A. However, if you're after knowledge about the history of photography, and (mainly) technical know-how of how to take pictures, this is the class for you. If you can get in, do it!",
    "YES. But you need to put time into it or you won't be satisfied with your work next to others."
