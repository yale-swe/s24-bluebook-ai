    "IF YOU HAVE ANY INTEREST IN PSYC, TAKE THIS COURSE! Marvin Chun presents the material in the most interesting way possible and you can succeed in the course if you put your mind to it. Also, fabulous lectures, guest lectures, and engaging reading and coursework.",
    "Intro psych is a great course. The textbook is funny; the lectures are interesting and fun. Whether you get Prof. Chun or Prof. Bloom, the lectures are amazing. It is really worth it to learn a little bit about psychology, for the purposes of daily life. Psychology is a topic that I think everyone would find really interesting, so if you haven't taken psychology before you should definitely take this course!If you take intro psych with Prof. Chun, the course is basically lectures, plus three non-cumulative exams and three really short papers, plus participation in three sections in the entire semester, participation in some psych experiments. It's great - you should take it!",
    "It's a fair amount of work for a large amount of enjoyment. The class, though large, is fun, and the lectures are dynamic. Overall, a great experience I would recommend to any student.",
    "Definitely not a gut course, but a manageable workload if you stay on top of the reading and assignments. The three exams have a fair amount of detail but are doable if you study efficiently. No final exam! I left feeling that I had a good understanding of a broad survey of topics.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS. (a must take while at Yale.. Dont let this opportunity pass you by)",
    "Good lectures, but the outside work makes the course difficult. Cr\/D\/Fail it",
    "You'll get out of this course what you put into it. If you want to take a \"gut class\" credit\/d\/fail, go for it. You won't have to put in a ton of work and if you show up to class you'll learn some valuable information and Marvin will usually keep you alert and engaged. If you take this for a grade, you'll have to keep up with the readings (i suggest taking cumulative notes) and take notes during the lectures. Again, the more you put in, the more you get out, but if you are able to take this class in any capacity, go for it.",
    "YES YES YES!",
    "Wonderful course! One of the best I have taken at Yale. Despite its large size, it was engaging and interesting.Take this class!!!",
    "Not a lot of work- three exams and three 500 word papers- and interesting lectures. Guest lectures especially are not to be missed. Marvin Chun is a nice guy and solid lecturer.While I'm a psych major, a lot of people take this class for fun and personal enrichment- and it's a good class for that.",
    "This class is very overrated. Marvin Chun is cool, yes, but overrated. No, this will not be THE BEST CLASS YOU'VE EVER TAKEN OMG. It is often said you MUST take this class before you graduate. No, you don't. Also, you don't have to hold out to take it with Marvin Chun. He is good, but not exceptional.",
    "After having heard all the hype for this class, my expectation of it far exceeded anything a college class could actually achieve. After a bit of disappointment, I realized it was, after all, still just a class. The material by itself is not actually that interesting, as anyone interested in psychology has probably seen a large portion of the material either on the internet or in a book they read. Thatsaid, Professor Chun makes this the best taught course I have taken to date. He has an incredibly rare level of emotionally investment in his own lecture performance, and as you will learn, or maybe already know, this intrinsic motivation is what allows the quality of his class to surpass most Yale courses.",
    "Yes, Great course",
    "It's intro psyc. Chun is a really nice guy, but adds nothing to your understanding of the subject, so don't bother going to class. The sum of the learning for the semester is reading the textbook. There are only 3 non-cumulative exams, so it's not much work. Just be careful of a difficult curve--there are lots of freshmen in the class who do an inordinate amount of studying.",
    "Yes, I would most definitely recommend this course to every student at Yale!",
    "Yes, Intro Psych will teach you so many foundational concepts and will definitely help you later.",
    "I'm going to preface this by saying that you shouldn't have too high of expectations for any class, because that can lead to disappointment. Also, if you like to read about psychology for fun like I do, some of the cooler studies will be ones you've already heard about before.That being said:Take this course!!!! It's sooo fascinating! And Marvin Chun is really nice!I hope he'll put this on a slide next year.But seriously, this course is great.",
    "Psychology 110 is exactly what it sounds like--an introduction to the science of mind and behavior. Some of the material was extremely interesting, but much of the material (and TRUST ME there was A LOT OF MATERIAL) was dull and obvious (who would have thought that frustration makes people more likely to act aggressively or that men want to have more sex than women?!). Really, a lot of the class just teaches you the psychological jargon for concepts you already know.Also, one should not underestimate the sheer volume of work: 3 papers, 3 tests, ~700 pages of TEXTBOOK reading, 5 psychology experiments, 3 sections, and frequent class participation. Sure, the work is easy, but, TRUST ME, sometimes you want to set your textbook on fire.I am definitely glad I took this course (and you should take it too if you have no psychology background), but I do not think I would take it again.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS!! The workload is completely manageable and the reading and lectures are SO MUCH FUN! Professor Chun is a fantastic professor. He is really engaging and tries his best to keep lectures interesting by having videos and interacting with the audience through Q&As and the clickers are a great asset as well because you get to answer polls in class and see the results which Prof. Chun breaks down for you and explains. The lab requirements are really easy and can be fun if you pick the right labs. The three short papers are also fairly easy; hunting for an article can be tough but once you find one it's not hard to crank out 500 words (you actually find yourself over the word limit all the time, or at least I did). The exams are also very fair. A mix of short answer and multiple choice that are all straight from lectures and the book. Just make sure to stay on top of the reading because the chapters are quite lengthy (they're about 50 pages each) but they aren't dense! They're full of information, so read when you're supposed to read and make sure to study in advance and you'll be fine. I absolutely loved this class. The workload was fine, the professor was so sweet and a great lecturer, and what I learned was fascinating. TAKE IT, TAKE IT, TAKE IT!! I don't think you'll regret it if you put some work into it. Just stay on top of everything and you'll have a great time.",
    "Great intro and very informative.",
    "This is a great course. If you have a lot of time, it's pretty easy to do well. If you can't invest a lot of effort, it's perfect to Cr\/D\/F as long as you go to class. Chun is great and I hear Bloom is good too, but anyone else and you're taking a risk. It is full of freshman, which can be good or bad.",
    "A little overrated. A good introductory course, but definitely skip if you've taken AP Psych.",
    "It's a neat lecture, but it's not the amazing, change-your-life kind of experience that everyone seems to chalk it up to be.",
    "A really interesting look at some of the most basic parts of every day life\/interaction. Fun and interesting lectures, textbook reading is mandatory to do well but is also interesting though long and time consuming. If you want to just take the lectures, take this course Credit D and you'll still get a lot out of hearing Marvin Chun but also won't have to kill yourself doing all the reading.",
    "Great class, take it.",
    "Good summary course. Everyone should take it whether or not they are majoring in psych or related fields.",
    "Yes, but it's not a blow off class",
    "I would highly recommend it, whether you plan to do psychology or not.",
    "Yes- it's so interesting and applicable to everything!",
    "I would definitely recommend this to another student but do not think it is an easy course it is a lot of hard work and very hard to get a good grade in be prepared to study a lot and do a lot of reading. and do not skip class.",
    "TAKE IT WITH PROFESSOR CHUN!This is not a gut by any means... you have to do the reading and there is a lot of it. Also, the papers aren't hard at all and are graded very fairly. The lab requirement also isn't hard. The tests require a lot of prep. Start it credit\/d\/fail until you take the first test.",
    "Very interesting material, awesome professor",
    "Of course. ALL students in this school have something to learn from Psychology 110.",
    "Yes, fun& informative overview of psychology. The lectures tend to reinforce the reading so you should definitely keep up with the readings. Overall, the workload was not bad and the material was very interesting.",
    "Interesting for the novice, and an occasional boor for the student who has already taken AP Psychology. Previous psychology studies students: enter at your own risk. All else: Enjoy!",
    "I would recommend taking Psych 110 to everyone, its just one of those classes you have to take. Even if you've taken AP Psych, like I did, this class does a lot of case studies and mostly of it won't be repetitive. The work load is much at all, very manageable.",
    "Psych is a good, entertaining course that isn't too difficult, especially if you do the reading. There is quite a bit of overlap with cognitive science, especially in the lectures, but the reading is very informative.",
    "Every student should take this course. You learn fascinating informaiton about human interactions and thought processes. Take this class especially with Professor Bloom or Professor Chung. The exams are completely fair and, while the reading is dense, it is usually genuinely enjoyable.",
    "Great class. Lectures were interesting, especially guest lecturers. You should take it pretty much because Marvin Chun is a baller. The book has its own sense of humor too, I guess.",
    "Like I said above (which I will copy down here because I don't think that students evaluating courses read anything other than this box)AWESOME. This is a class learning about humans. About how we think. About how we develop. About what shapes our personality, preferences, behavior, and beliefs. Taking this class is taking a class that can be applied to your life in ways that you wont imagine till its over!I dont care if you are premed, prelaw, grad student, economics major, mathematics major, history major, biomedical engineeering major, anthropology, major, someone who has no idea what they want to do with their life\/yale experience, any major. TAKE THIS CLASS!I should mention that its hard: you HAVE to do the reading, prepare for each test, come to each lecture. BUT its like reading a fun magazine (ie. it has cool, interesting, quirky facts that you can learn and apply to your life) and going to lecture is like going to lecture on how to be a better human!Just take the course, you won't regret it.",
    "Probably a class you should take before you graduate from college....",
    "This is a good course to take if you're interested in psychology at all, or even if you're not. It gives you some cool terms that can make you sound smart, and definitely helps to figure out how to deal with other people from day to day. It is NOT a gut class- a lot of reading is involved, and you do have to study and work hard if you want to get an A. Don't be scared that it's such a huge class either- it doesn't feel that big when Professor Chun is talking.",
    "Psych 110 was a great class. Marvin Chun is a great lecturer and the guest lecturers are awesome too. Make sure you go to lecture and do all the reading because the exams focus on both. Also the lectures are interesting because they apply the info in the book to real life situations. I would not recommend this class if you have already taken AP Psych. It was pretty much the same material. However this was a fun class to take with friends because you often get to discuss things.",
    "A good course only because Professor Chun is very entertaining and his lectures are great. The course material and the tests are forgetable.",
    "I would recommend Psyc 110 to other students, especially if they aren't much interested in social sciences and are looking for a So credit. The class was enjoyable, entertaining, and useful.",
    "If you have never taken a psychology course and you are interested in the subject, then by all means take this course - it is less stressful than a seminar, the readings are fun, and you get to participate in actual psychology experiments! However, if you - like me - have taken AP Psychology in high school (and retained a decent amount of information from it), there really is no reason to repeat the course all over again - except, of course, if you are interested in seeing how psychological beliefs have changed (quite a lot in my case, actually - but that may be due to the outdated Psychology textbook my school used...).",
    "Perspective of a senior, EVST major taking it credit\/D for fun: It's like watching simple ted talks.",
    "It is a good introduction to psychology. Do the readings because the tests will be pretty much impossible without that knowledge. The classes are entertaining.",
    "Take it. Psychology is important, and what you learn is applicable to everyday situations.",
    "Best class at Yale, or anywhere probably.",
    "While it is not a gut (you really do have to at least skim the reading if you are taking it credit\/d\/fail), this is a must take class at Yale. Since everyone has taken it, it is the perfect conversation starter for basically everyone by saying, \"guess what I learned in pysch today.\"Also, Marvin Chun is actually the coolest person around. I could not ask for a more engaging and entertain teacher.",
    "I would not recommend this course.",
    "This course is challenging, but worth it. The information is interesting and will reshape some of your former ways of thinking. Pf. Chun is an excellent lecturer and a great professor.",
    "I highly recommend PSYC 110 with Dr. Chun. You'll learn a lot and have fun. It's the best class at Yale, hands down, and everyone who I have spoken to has loved it.",
    "Its great but tough. Soo much information but its worth it. Everyone has to take a class with Marvin, he will change your life. Credit\/d\/F would be a good idea. Although that's what I did and I'm still hoping I actually got credit.",
    "great course, interesting material. not too much work- no final! the involvement in psych studies requirement got a bit boring but it was interesting to see what kind of research is being done.",
    "I would absolutely recommend Psych 110!",
    "Good intro to psych, but in my opinion not very fun or interesting.",
    "Absolutely. A must-take class at Yale. It will make you a better student and likely a better person.",
    "I would highly recommend the course. It truly makes the subject fun to learn.",
    "Everyone should take this course!",
    "Take this course! Professor Chun is great, and the class isn't that challenging but it's very interesting and fun.",
    "This is a survey course of psychology. Lectures are great, the reading is long but the textbook is entertaining so it's not drudgery. Do the reading because it will show up on the exams. Prof. Chun doesn't want you to fail (he told us that he would curve only to our advantage). Definitely take this class, even if you aren't going to be a psych major, the way that Prof. Chun teaches it makes it very applicable.",
    "Intro to psychology... the name kind of sums it up.",
    "I would recommend any course taught by Marvin Chun.",
    "yes- interesting, comprehensive, and fun.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS !",
    "Yes. Key to understanding a lot of basic concepts prevalent in everyday life, a good foundation",
    "Take it credit\/D. There is a lot of reading you probably won't do. Attend all of the lectures and take good notes. Study a lot for the tests, as they are hard and graded on a harsh curve. Really use your TA and ask them questions and advise when it comes to writing the papers and studying for the tests. Professor Chun is really the reason to take this course. I thoroughly enjoyed listening to all of his lectures.",
    "great overview of psychology. interesting lectures. you should take it just because it's a cool class. i took it credit\/d\/fail so i wouldnt have to worry about it much, and if you don't need the class for your major or for a distribution requirement, i'd recommend the credit\/d route.",
    "Tough class, but really fun.",
    "course material is interesting, Marvin Chun is a great lecturer, and there's isn't too much work involved",
    "YES.",
    "A broad overview of psychological concepts. Interesting, but a huge lecture class-- if that's what you are looking for, go for it.",
    "Yes, it's a class all students could take. While I didn't ace the class (the range of material you need to know is EXPANSE), it's definitely a class that's interesting enough to enroll in.",
    "Definitely take it. It's so much fun and interesting as well.",
    "This is a class on introductory concepts in psychology. I would definitely recommend it, but it won't teach you mind control powers.",
    "Intro Psych is an incredible interesting and relevant introductory course to the field of psychology. Whether a student wishes to study psychology or not, there is still something relevant worth learning. Highly recommended.",
    "This class is massively overrated, and while it seems to be fun at first, it is actually a significant waste of time. I don't feel like I've learned much of anything of use, and the stress related to obscure exam questions and the memorization of a vast bulk of facts without any serious thought on my part was irksome.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS, and take it with friends! :) It's a lot of fun, you will never want to miss lecture, and you'll learn a lot. It's a bit harder than anticipated though, so just stay on your feet with the midterms and essays. Don't slack on reading \u0097 read beforehand, then reread to study for the tests.",
    "Yes, this is a great class. Watch out for the tests though, and make sure you do the readings because there are a lot of sneaky, specific questions on the tests based on the textbook.",
    "Overall this was a very good course touching on many of the different areas one can study in psychology. On that note, while there is a lot of information, there isn't a ton of depth. Each lecture pretty much stands on its own information-wise. While there are some overall themes, there isn't a direct connection between lectures. If you are interested in learning the basics of what psychology is about and want to learn a ton of interesting random facts, this is a great class for you. You do read the entire textbook and are responsible for all textbook and lecture material. Luckily, there is no cumulative final, but, if you want to do well, the reading load is a little heavy.This class was described to me as one of the most amazing courses Yale has to offer with one of the best professors ever and it will make you want to become a psychology major. Personally, while Professor Chun is amazing, it was not the most amazing class I took at Yale, and I do not want to be a psychology major. I did like the class (a lot) and I realize that we are indeed all psychologists; understanding the mind is essential in all areas of study.",
    "It was a very comprehensive and interesting course, i feel like i learned. theres a lot of reading though. and the tests are killer.",
    "Take it with Professor Chun!",
    "100% recommendation to any and all (if you are worried about a grade, just take it C\/D\/Fail. Seriously that great of a class)",
    "Sure. Great credit\/d class for seniors!",
    "An interesting and engaging course, I would highly recommend this course to any student.",
    "YES, I RECOMMEND. But you should seriously consider taking it Credit\/D. We covered a lot of information and you are expected to know details to get full credit on your exams. It's tough, but it's worth it. Credit\/D makes it so much more manageable and therefore enjoyable. TAKE IT.",
    "I recommend it--credit\/D. The reading is a LOT if you actually plan on doing it, and it's hard to get a good grade. You can skate by on credit\/D though by just attending the majority of the lectures and save time and money that would have been spent on the fancy textbook.",
    "Professor Chun is so cute. Very sincere and sensitive. Material very relevant to everyday life. Lectures moved pretty slowly. Credit D is money.",
    "Psych 110 is, above everything else, interesting. A lot of the material you already vaguely know, but Psych brings it all together. There is a lot of reading - the book is hefty - and the crossover between lecture and textbook is not that huge, so studying for exams can be tough since it's so much information, but overall it's pretty doable. Overall, it's a fun and worthwhile class. Take it if you're OK with a big lecture, studying hard for exams, and learning a lot.",
    "Great intro course. Definitely recommend.",
    "Good class to take, although the grade distribution is crazy. Although there was a lot of material per exam, I enjoyed going to this class the most.",
    "A must-take course while you are at Yale. What course to better change the way you think than a course about the mind? Take it for the Professor, the ambiance and for the beauty of the subject.",
    "Amazing. Definitely take it regardless of whether or not you're planning a future in Psychology. Not only is it fun, but it really introduces you to many insights that you wouldn't normally think of but that totally make sense (i.e. risk aversion).",
    "Psych 110 is a fantastic introduction to the study of psychology from both a biological and a social standpoint. It is a well-taught class with a good textbook.",
    "Excellent excellent excellent. Some say it's an overrated class, but I thoroughly enjoyed it. I have no doubt psychology will be incorporated some way into my major.",
    "Psych provided a quick and dirty intro to the deep and wide subject. I really enjoyed parts of the class -- Chun's infectious enthusiasm, the well fitting and enlightenening clicker demos, and the guest lecturers. I do feel that the course was not as cohesive as it could have been, but that is largely a function of the wide subject matter that the class attempts to discuss with the limited time. Awesome workload -- I learned a ton while not doing any busy work, which I very much appreciate.Chun is a phenomenal guy. He handled the class with grace and enthusiasm, and managed to get the large majority of the class excited about the subject of psychology. He did a wonderful job communicating with the class -- even though it wasso massive. I was especially impressed with the grace with which he conducted himself after the tragic death of Cameron. Overall, he's an awesome guy, and I enjoyed his lectures.",
    "A great class worth taking. Some concepts are common sense and rehash, but fascinating concepts come up in class quite often as well. If you don't need the credit, though, save yourself the extra effort and take it Cr\/D\/F.",
    "Psych 110 was one of those most interesting and relevant classes I have taken at Yale. Even if you're not planning on being a psych major, you will find this class useful. Professor Chun is a very nice man, and will guide you as you prepare for three midterms over the semester. You get to use clickers, which makes it more of an interactive class. You will never have trouble finding someone to study with, as 500+ people take this class (Chun is that good). I would highly recommend taking this class.",
    "Great intro course to take, relatively easy material, just a matter of attending section and reading the text. I attended basically every lecture, but some lecture weren't jammed with pertinent information, instead it was just Chun being interactive and cute. Highly recommend the course.",
    "It's a great class to sit in on because the lectures are interesting and Professor Chun shows interesting and pertinent videos. Reading the textbook is really time consuming and dense. Studying for tests takes forever.",
    "Overall, good course. If I could do it again I would take it credit\/D. And yes, I would recommend this to someone.",
    "Take it, no matter what. It's the kind of class that teaches you things you'll remember forever and be able to use in your everyday life.",
    "Take it sometime in your 4 years. You learn a lot about people and how they operate. I went to every lecture (for the first time) because they were that good. Some are obviously better than others but all are important. Textbook is pretty funny too. Chun is awesome. Study for exams and actually learn the info so the class is really rewarding\/interesting. I came out of the class better equipped, not just academically, but socially and psychologically.",
    "I would say that it's an OK class, that has a lot of reading attached to it. The psych book is pretty dry, as is the material, but it can be a rewarding class if you put the time in.",
    "Full of freshman with no real classes to take. If that's not you, then don't take it. Not necessarily an easy credit\/d (you still have to do the reading, papers, lab requirement, and decently on the tests).Otherwise it's just a lot of memorization, so not necessarily hard. Just a lot of reading. And 25% of test questions come exclusively from lecture so you have to go.",
    "Yes, but the tests are really hard.",
    "Take this class. Take this class with Marvin Chun, and you will never regret it.",
    "It's a pretty easy and relaxing class, but really basic. I wouldn't recommend it if you are looking to be wowed, or really to learn for learning's sake, because its not that type of class. it is the barest of surveys that doesn't really dive into anything with any depth.",
    "Take it. It's part of the experience of going to Yale. You might get tired of if by the second half of the class but you'll be surprised with how applicable it is to life. You'll wind up bringing in your psych knowledge to almost every class.",
    "great intro course~ take it before you leave",
    "I would recommend the course. The classes are fun and interesting--it's sometimes like going to a show. There is a lot of reading, but the text is really great and sometimes funny. A nice course for freshmen.",
    "This course is very interesting and the material really does make you think about the world differently. Even a non-psychology major like myself benefited from being able to better understand many common human behaviors. The workload is fine but does take a little bit of time management, as the readings can be somewhat long (~40 pages). It is important to do the readings because material from the textbook but not covered in class can still be tested.",
    "Absolutely! This course talks about things that are so relevant to everyday life (like happiness) and basic theorists that an educated person should know about (Freud).",
    "Very interesting and entertaining, but be prepared to work very hard if you want to get a good grade.",
    "I think it is a great course, a lot of fun and really interesting. I would definitely take it if you are looking for an engaging big lecture.",
    "Great course! Definitely a must take at Yale. Marvin Chun has a very engaging teaching style, so even the large lecture course is easy to pay attention to and go to.",
    "Read the textbook and go to all the lectures and you will learn so much!",
    "I would highly recommend this course to all students, no matter what they are interested in studying. It is not too much work, but it is important to keep up with readings and prepare sufficiently for exams.",
    "Good course, lectures are fun. Need to do the reading though, definitely not a \"gut\". Workload is fairly regular, but low level.",
    "A LOT of reading! Not too much work!",
    "I mainly took this course because Professor Chun was teaching it and I heard great things about him. Most of the hype was deserved because Professor Chun is amazing! However, sometimes I felt that Chun was more trying to entertain us than educate us.The tests didn't reflect the material in the book. They were much easier and contained mostly lecture information. I felt like a lot of material didn't get tested. The problem with easy tests, though, is that every one scores high and it makes it difficult to get an A.Still, taking a huge class like this was a lot of fun and I think it's important and useful to know some basic psychology.",
    "DEFINITELY!!! it will change the way you view life",
    "Great course I wish I could take every year. Strengths extend beyond words and the weakness was just fitting in all the lab credits, which wasn't that bad.",
    "Absolutely take this class, even if you aren't a psych major.",
    "A great, broad introduction to psychology. The class essentially consists of lectures and textbook readings, with three noncumulative midterms and three 500-word papers. The class isn't very much work aside from the readings--which you don't necessarily need to keep up with for class, but need to do before each midterm if you want to do well. Professor Chun is a great lecturer, and really cares about the material and his students--he also brings in some cool guest lecturers throughout the semester. Is this class overrated? Maybe--but it's still great.",
    "Take the class. You will not regret it.",
    "Not an easy class but one that is worth taking. Readings are quite a lot, and one has to be regular with them. also paying attention in class is important, though with the class being so interesting that is not a problem",
    "Yes, I think anyone can benefit from this class.",
    "I would recommend taking it Cred\/D. It really is an interesting class, and the material is good to know for real-life situations, but the grading is just very strange. And you have to really read the textbook carefully. You have to put a lot more time into this class than you would think to get a good grade.",
    "Yeah, it's okay. MARVIN CHUN IS NOT AS AMAZING AS EVERYONE SAYS. Don't get me wrong; he's a good guy. Very smart, very nice, very helpful. It's just that the course is kind of disorganized and it will be terribly frustrating if you know anything about psychology (e.g., have taken intro cog sci, personality psych, human emotion, social psychology, etc.). Lectures can be fun, can be boring, really depends. Exams are okay; you HAVE TO STUDY and know your stuff. For real though; it's possible to get an A, so don't rush to take it C\/D\/F. Plus, psychology is such a baller topic that you can't really go wrong. Having said that, if you have taken other psych courses and don't need to take the course for other requirements, then just buy the book and read through it - no need to take the course because it's going to be boring and repetitive. I have a lot of friends who liked it, but many people acknowledge that it is really a cursory look (perhaps by nature of an intro course?) at psychology and does involve a lot of reading. The book is good though; very good.",
    "This is a great class. It's a fair amount of work, especially when it comes to those tests, but it's a lot of fun, and you should definitely take it (even if only Credit\/D)",
    "I would take it, but mostly because it's not too challenging and because everyone else takes it. Otherwise, I disliked the class because it was too fluffy. The information is not real or very difficult.",
    "Highly recommended. The course will show you just how incredible the human psyche is, and probably make you a happier person also.",
    "You can't graduate college without taking Intro Psych at some point, and if you have the chance to take it with Marvin Chun, all the better. Whether credit\/d or for a grade, this is a class with minimal stress and that you will actually enjoy going to.",
    "Take this class !! Especially with Marvin Chun!!Though it's a bit of work, the material is so relevant and well taught that you will walk out of lecture thoroughly entertained but also with a firm grasp of basic psychological concepts everytime",
    "It is an overview of basic psychology with a different specific focus each lecture that is presented in a way that makes psych applicable to life, such as discussing the relationship between psychology and law.",
    "It's reaaly interesting stuff for everyone to learn--lots of reading though and other work(3 short papers and sections and lab particioation) --tests are tricky and pretty detailed --Perfect class for credit\/D, but not impossible if you don't --tests start out hardest and get better",
    "Take it Credit\/D unless you are prepared to go to every class, read everything and study a lot - the papers aren't hard but the test are unless you're really prepared. It's a really interesting class and Marvin is AMAZING so I would definitely recommend taking it for 'learning's sake' - that's why you should Credit\/D it. If you end up not taking it, at least stop by for Salovey's lecture, it's fantastic.",
    "TAKE THE CLASS. CHUN IS GREAT.",
    "This is a must-take course. Even if this is not related to your major you should be sure to take it (especially with Professor Chun). All of the material is relevant and interesting. Lectures and sections are engaging. The material tested is more than reasonable. Expectations are clear. The book is comprehensive and enjoyableto read.",
    "Excellent course. Definitely recommended. Everyone should take it with Chun!",
    "Great course. Lectures are fun and interesting, and Chun is a fabulous professor. However, there is a LOT of textbook reading, much of which doesn't really correspond to the lectures and it is tested in the exams. I took it Credit\/D which helped a lot but this class is definitely not a gut even if it is relatively easy to do well if you read the book and come to class - people do get Ds and worse. Definitely recommend it though, even if you're only slightly interested in psych.",
    "I truly enjoyed this class. Professor Chun was an undeniably wonderful lecturer and I recommend this class to any student- psychology major or not.",
    "Yes, definitely. You may find that you are much more interested in psychology then you had realized.",
    "Intro Psych was a great survey class on psychology. Marvin Chun is a fantastic professor and picks very interesting topics to lecture on. His lectures are always well organized and extremely interesting. I always looked forward to going to class. The tests were always very fair. I truly enjoyed this class.",
    "This is a phenomenal course. You must do the reading or you'll be murdered by tests. Anyone who says \"wait for Paul Bloom\" or \"wait for Marvin Chun\" is being silly--they're both incredible lecturers and people. Just avoid the woman.",
    "Take this class! The material is interesting, the huge lecture class dynamic is actually kind of fun, and Marvin Chun is great. It's a fair amount of reading and you should plan on going to all the lectures, but the textbook and the lectures are interesting so its definitely a worthwhile use of your time. It's just a really fun and laid-back class to take sometime in your college career.",
    "I recommend this course to someone interested in Psychology. I found it slightly less engaging than Introduction to Cognitive Science (with Brian Scholl), but that could just be me. The lectures and the reading (do the reading!) cover a wide range of mostly interesting topics, though, so if you're interested in this area of study, take this course. Professor Chun is an interesting lecture, so I'd also recommend him.",
    "A fun, engaging introduction to psychology. It requires a decent amount of time and work, but mostly pretty basic material. This course covers a lot of material that everyone should know - but most of it you probably already do.",
    "Psychology 110 is a comprehensive and interesting introduction to the field of psychology. I would highly recommend this course to another student if they are at all interested in this field.",
    "Definitely take it. It's so interesting and many of the concepts apply valuably to day to day life even if you're not going to be a major. The lectures also hold your attention, the demands are reasonable and the essays current.",
    "Awesome class, I would highly recommend it. You might consider Credit\/D though, cause then you can just take it for fun and not worry about your GPA.",
    "Would absolutely recommend. A survey of widely applicable ideas in basic psychology. I don't feel like I learned anything groundbreaking or even that I have a great grasp of introductory psych, but everything we learned was interesting and felt relevant. One of my favorite classes- I looked forward to lecture every single time and never fell asleep.",
    "It's pretty easy and Prof. Chun is entertaining, so I guess a good 5th class.",
    "Terrific class - very entertaining, interesting, and fun. Not too much work. I recommend doing the reading if you want a comprehensive understanding of the subject, but the textbook is really readable and interesting so it's ok.",
    "Great Course. Well taught. Interesting readings. I highly recommend it.",
    "One of the most enjoyable courses I've ever taken at Yale. TAKE IT WITH CHUN. no regrets hands down.",
    "Yes, take it! It's a huge class (more than 500) but Marvin Chun makes it feel small. It's huge basically BECAUSE Marvin Chun is so awesome. He even has a facebook group dedicated to him. A great introduction to psychology, incredibly interesting stuff, and presented in a wonderful way (using clickers, demos, videos in lecture). Great guest lectures too.",
    "I would recommend this to most students looking for a So credit who are remotely interested in psychology. However, don't take it if you already took Intro to CogSci.",
    "You should absolutely take this class before you leave Yale. Marvin Chun is incredibly entertaining and incredibly knowledgeable. This course changed the way I think about things on a day today basis. It's a ton of work, but it's worth it.",
    "An enormous survey course that breezes through a lot of topics.That is a strength and a weakness, in obvious ways.If I had to choose an intro course of this type, I'd probably go with CogSci because Brian Scholl is awesome and you grow to have an enormous amount of respect for him. Psych is, however, a requirement for the upper level courses, which are more focused and can thus be more fulfilling.Chun was a great guy: very niceand cheery.Try to take advantage of office hours, so you can spend time talking with him. It can only be rewarding.",
    "You should take it. A very good class, and Chun is wonderful. You'll learn things about people, how they think, how the world works, etc. This class does feel a bit overhyped at times--this class is not necessarily God's Gift--but it is definitely a class every student should take. Also, not a hard class to get an A in if you do the work; the tests are fair. Just be prepared that doing well will require quite a bit of studying, and the few days before the exam will be hell if you haven't done any of the reading until those few days (but that strategy worked fine for me!)",
    "Yes, take PSYC 110. Lectures with Marvin Chun are funny and fascinating. The class is popular for good reason - not only is the material itself very interesting, but knowing the fundamentals of psychology is helpful for a wide range of social sciences (and probably other subjects too). Workload was manageable, but the class was slightly harder than I expected. Be prepared to do all the reading if you want to do well in the course.",
    "Psychology 110 is completely and utterly overrated. Chun is, at best, half the lecturer most students make him out to be. The material is interesting, but only to students completely unfamiliar with Psychology. The textbook is the only resource and its chapters are pretty long. Sections meet irregularly, so students do not form personal relationships with their teaching assistants. Chun's usually inaccessible. He's a father, a residential college Master, a professor, and a psychologist all at the same time, so it hardly comes as a surprise that he doesn't have much time for his students. If you're looking to teach yourself, Psychology 110 is the class for you. If you're looking for a memorable, stimulating, and enriching experience, look elsewhere.",
    "Don't take this if you want to seriously learn about psychology, it is a waste of time and by the end of it you wont respect the field at all.",
    "This course is legendary. Marvin Chun is legendary. Your friends will be referencing this class for years to come. Plus, the material in the class is fascinating and very much applies to all aspects of life, regardless of your major. You owe it to yourself to take Intro Psych.",
    "yeah, it's really interesting to see how much of the way we understand the world derives from this practice.",
    "Great course, strongly recommend.",
    "Yesssss! Take this course. The material is super interestingand every single lecture is absolutely awesome. I have never enjoyed lectures as much as I enjoyed these. Marvin Chun is the man--you will never want to miss class! I can't remember one lecture that was ever boring! That being said, I would recommend taking this class Cr\/D\/F because it takes a lot\/is difficult to get A's on the test. There are three tests throughout the semester that are not cumulative, three short essays (500 words), and lab requirements. The reading is not too much and is very interesting, but this is definitely not a gut class. If you want to get an A in the class you really need to work for it and put in the time when the exams come around. Take this course! You won't regret it. The material absolutely rocks!",
    "I think PSYC 110 is a cornerstone course of a Yale education and everyone should have a chance to take it. Not only is the information intriguing and relevant to everyday life, but you get the chance to take the course with a wonderful professor. Professor Chun is always entertaining and humorous and makes the course a delight to take. Be warned, though; the course requires a lot of outside reading and learning and you have to be on your toes during lecture in order to make high grades on the test. Other than that, the course is a great opportunity to take with friends and see all your other freshmen and sophomore buddies.",
    "Highly highly recommend it!",
    "Your Yale degree is not complete until you take Intro to Psych. Please do not miss out on this wonderful opportunity of taking this awesome subject with Marvin Chun. Whether you are an engineering, biology, econonics or physics major, psych is life and is applicable in every field. You are better off doing it. It is that one subject at Yale that one should not miss out on.",
    "Psychology 110 is a great course. You learn a lot and lectures are actually really interesting and fun. Professor Chun is great and engaging. Theres some dull book reading, but overall the class is great.",
    "I would summarize it as a superficial trip through the field of Psychology. It's great, but it only scratches the surface.",
    "A must take class at Yale",
    "Highly recommend. Do the reading and you'll really get a lot out of the course.",
    "Intro Psych is the course everyone says you must take before graduation, so yea take it. Its been my favorite class at yale thus far and I'm not a psych major. Maybe I should be, except that the rest of the psych department is not taught by Marvin Chun.",
    "I'm not sure I can come up with a good summary of this class off the top of my head, but I assure you that there's a very good reason why this class is so wildly popular. By all means, if you have any interest at all in understanding your brain or understanding other people, take it.",
    "yes, take it! great course, very relevant",
    "take it. great credit d course - learn a lot and dont have to do any reading. definitely not a gut, and if you take it for credit, seems like there is some really basic stuff thats not as interesting, but a class worth taking just bc its got such great lectures.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class because you would be surprised at how interesting you will find this field whether you have been exposed to psychology before or not.",
    "Psych 110 is an incredibly fascinating class with so much relevance to real life. Master Chun is extremely engaging. Every class was a lot of fun. All of the lecturers were really well structured and organized around an interesting theme. Master Chun's use of clicker surveys and video clips help to mix things up and keep it interesting. The exams are definitely a challenge, but they're really fair. This is a class that every student at Yale should take before they graduate.",
    "Intro to Psych with a great lecturer. However, it probably would not be interesting if you took AP Psych in high school",
    "interesting and almost necessary to take at some point in your 4 years",
    "A very good overview of psychology. Marvin Chun is a professor with a great sense of humor and he makes lectures funny and entertaining. The lectures were usually unrelated to each other, but interesting nonetheless. For the tests, you HAVE TO READ THE BOOK, because he will put VERY specific things on the test that you can only get in the textbook, not the lectures.",
    "Take it. Interesting material you can apply in other aspects of your life.",
    "GREAT COURSE!! Marvin Chun is amazing! Take it with him. He doesn't require that you remember all the names and dates in the book. Tests mostly on lecture and concepts.",
    "This is a great course that is both fun and relevant. I would recommend it to anyone who is hoping to understand human nature a bit more from a rational perspective.",
    "Psychology 110 is a fantastic course that will give you a new perspective about how your own mind works. You will learn about interesting concepts from mental disorders to how we process information. You will also learn and even participate in experiments, so that you will have a pretty good understanding about how the field works at the end.The class is a good amount of work for a fifth credit, especially if not taken for credit-d (3 papers, lab participation). Also, it felt like too much rote memorization at times. But overall good course.Take it if Professor Chun is teaching!! He was awesome, engaging, warm, funny and interesting ... he made the class.",
    "This is a very good course with extremely engaging lectures. I especially recommend taking it with Chun.",
    "Take it even if you're not a Psych major because it's a relevant, interesting, fun course. One of the best classes at Yale to take, and don't just get scared away because of the hard grading... Just do the readings and you'll be fine.",
    "This has been one of the more interesting courses of my Yale career. As a graduating senior, I highly recommend this course.",
    "This is a really interesting and applicable class. The one thing to watch out for is that the grading process can be stressful- the class can be a grade-neurotic pre-med freshmen haven, so expect to work really hard if you want an A-range grade. It might be worth starting this one Credit\/D.",
    "Do not enter this class thinking it will be the best class you will ever take. This class is entertaining, fun, and useful, and is taught by a very good professor, but regardless of how it's advertised, this class is not lifechanging. It is a good class, but if you want a \"great\" class, this isn't the one to bank on.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. It's an intro course that truly tries to draw you into the subject. Professor Chun is great and even the most basic psychological principles are very interesting. Only drawback is that it is a huge lecture.",
    "I recommend the class. It is very interesting information. Psychology just helps us better understand how our brains work...if you are curious about that, take it.",
    "if you have the slightest interest in psychology, take it! even if you don't, take it and you will. i looked forward to going to lecture every day. professor chun really is an amazing teacher. keeping up with the readings is annoying, but essential for doing well on the tests. the fact that sections only meet 3 times is a definite plus.",
    "This class is overrated.",
    "HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. Take this class! You learn A LOT. Exams are multiple choice + short responses. As long as you read and take good notes in class you'll be fine grade-wise.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course for a fellow student. It's not too much work and the information is extremely interesting. In addition to getting to listen to Professor Chun lecture, you also have several guest lecturers, who discuss different topics. I found these three lectures particularly interesting because they exposed me to other top psychologists and made me think in ways that i had not before.",
    "Psych 110 is a cool and interesting lecture introductory course. It is quite watered-down and does not offer a formal theory-based approach to psychology, however, so if you took a rigorous AP Psych course in high school I most definitely would skip the course with your AP credit.",
    "Take this class!...even if you don't think you are interested at all in psych, it is a very enjoyable class and you will learn a lot about basic psychology. The lectures are fun and the reading is actually enjoyable. The professor is also one of the most talented lecturers at Yale and also brings in many talented guest speakers.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course, if for no other reason than the fact that it's taught by Marvin Chun. But that aside, the material the course covers can be applied to almost any field of future study and having an understanding of our approach to psychology and important experiments that have been done in the past century is important. Probably the most daunting aspect of the course would be its size, but the work load is more than manageable.",
    "yep",
    "I would summarize it as an introductory psychology course that is good for any major. I would definitely recommend it.",
    "Prof. Chun was great, but the curve can be tough, especially if you're not an eager freshman. Maybe a good class to credit\/D",
    "Without a doubt. People need to understand how psychology affects them and society more, and this course is a perfect first exposure.",
    "Psych 110 is a great class! Professor Chun is an amazing lecturer. Although there is a lot of material to cover before the tests, the reading is interesting so it is not too bad. Definitely take this class!",
    "This is a fun class to take Cr.D.Fail. Sit in the lecture, don't take notes, and don't study and you can pull a low B or C and enjoy Chun's lectures.",
    "Yes I definitely would. Great intro course. Inspired me to do further classes in psychology. Very interesting material. Fun professor. I feel like it's just one of those classes you should just take your freshman or sophmore year at Yale",
    "This class was SO awesome! I would definitely recommend that every Yale undergrad take this course.",
    "This is a great class! Definitely take it but only with Professor Chun because I cannot stress enough was an amazing lecturer he is! Be prepared though, the class is tough. There is a lot to remember and a lot of nuances that have to be paid attention to that make a big difference in the grade you receive. You might think you understand the concept but just concepts isn't enough because the questions on the exams are really specific and detailed. The reading is a lot too but it is interesting!",
    "Excellent introduction to psychology! Definitely worth taking if you having any interest in understanding people.",
    "Psychology 110 is one of those must-take courses at Yale, especially with Marvin Chun.",
    "Great class, intro to psych. Definitely take it!",
    "It's a good course to take with friends. The lectures are entertaining and it's not too much work.",
    "This is a great class. Not easy though, you have to do the reading and memorize a lot for the exams.",
    "Take it no matter who you are.",
    "Intro Psych is a very entertaining class. It's a great one to take Credit\/D. If not though, the book is actually really good; you'll enjoy the reading. Marvin Chun is great, although he doesn't actually teach you as much as he could. But based on first impressions from shopping period, it's worth waiting to take Intro Psych with Chun (or the equally revered Paul Bloom) if you can. You'll like the class.",
    "Take it credit d if you don't want to ruin your high gpa. it's a great class, but definitely not easy if you are bad at multiple choice.",
    "Meets the hype.",
    "yes, cuz psych with prof. chun teaching is sure to interest you. even tho I would never be a psychiatrist.",
    "Absolutely take this course, regardless of your major. It's interesting, fairly light work-wise, and is actually a lot more relevant than you'd think. It explains a lot more of behavior that you encounter every day than you'd expect from an introductory course.",
    "Definitely! Master Chun is amazing, you won't regret it!",
    "Lovely class! A true Yale treasure~",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course for it is in my opinion essential knowledge for the world we live in today.",
    "Intro Psych is an incredible class if Professor Chun is teaching it. It truly lives up to its reputation as a must-take class for any Yale student. Professor Chun is brilliant, hilarious, entertaining, modest, and overall a wonderful professor and person. The workload also isn't too bad as long as you stay on top of the reading.",
    "Of course! It's a great class that helps you understand the way you think.",
    "A quintessential Yale course. Make sure to take it with either Bloom or Chun, the most celebrated Intro Psych professors.A course Yale students should probably be required to take because it provides a unique perspective on life, society, and human thought.",
    "Psychology 110 01 is a course that will introduce you to cognitive science and human behaviors that are noticeable at seconds and sometimes first glances.",
    "Absolutely do not take this with Marvin Chun. He rambles nonstop, spending 10-15 minutes on one slide, and you get nothing substantial out of lecture. The reading is interesting, but then the tests are completely random, and it's almost impossible to do well unless you happen to think the way Marvin Chun thinks. Do not think this is an easy A because it's not. I thought that and do not have good results to report. I studied hard for the class, and almost always do well in classes that involve a heavy amount of regurgitation of information, but Chun's tests are honestly so random that there's no good way to study for them well short of memorizing the book, and even then you will probably get screwed over. Lecture is painful: Chun talks down to us as though we're pre-teens still learning about the world, and presents the entire class as a series of \"interesting life lessons\". I found it completely boring, and I am really interested in the field of psychology, so I think the class just did not do justice to psychology at all. Just don't do it; it's a waste of time.",
    "I would most definitely recommend this class, especially with Marvin Chun!",
    "Intro Psych is a basic overview of the most essential concepts in psychology, and I highly recommend it. It has changed the way I think.",
    "Take this course if you want a basic introduction to Psychology. If you already took AP Psychology, you might want to consider passing this course however, the course material is almost identical (Professor Chun says the contrary, but trust me it's the same material).",
    "YES. Take this amazing class. The professor is one of a kind and I always felt that going to lecture was more fun entertainment than anything else. That said, you learn a lot on top of the laughs.",
    "Intro Psych is one of my favorite classes I have taken at Yale. I would 100% recommend it. I don't have any interest in pursuing psychology but I still learned a lot from the class and have been able to apply many things from the class to every day life. It really makes you think about why people are the way they are. Definitely take it with Marvin Chun, his lectures are great and he's really funny!",
    "Yes, take Intro Psych. It is a Yale \"experience\" that everyone should have. You will learn a lot and enjoy it. Professor Chun is also great.",
    "Yes, take it.(It's more work than you'd think, though.)",
    "I definitely recommend it.",
    "This class is AMAZING as anyone will tell you. Lectures are really superb and I always looked forward to them. The material is stuff that you'll find yourself wanting to tell other people about it's so cool. If you don't want to do work and just want to enjoy Professor Chun's fantastic lectures take it Credit D. On the other hand the stuff in the book (which you do NEED to read if you are taking it for a grade) is really fascinating and so I actually enjoyed studying that stuff for the tests and was happy I didn't take it credit d.",
    "Definitely recommend, there's a reason why it's one of the biggest classes here. It's a fun class with great material, yet still academically challenging and definitely not a gut.",
    "Yes I would recommend it but it is a difficult course.",
    "Intro Psychology is a (not too) easy introductory class for the psychology department. Marvin Chun, of course, is an excellent lecturer. As someone who took AP Psychology and this course, I find this course geared more towards practical everyday use rather than a more academic presentation.",
    "Don't take this if you've taken CGSC110; there's too much overlap. Professor Chun said there wasn't, but there was, so I feel it was a waste of a credit. Don't take it credit\/d either; that's what I did. It's supremely easy to get a credit, so the temptation to not do anything for this class (not going to lecture, not really trying on the papers) is very, very strong; so you end up with a credit with little knowledge gained.",
    "Sure, although I took Intro to Cognitive Science and a lot of the material repeated, though not as much as it did in the past from what I understand. Marvin Chun is a really great guy, and lectures were enjoyable. The guest lectures were really fantastic as well. The exams weren't too hard, and were short enough to finish in the time allotted. Beware of three short, but annoying and toughly-graded papers. The lab requirement is also a bugger (5 hours of being a psych experiment subject).",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to a student interested in general psychology, or simply interested in understanding how the mind works. Professor Chun does a great job of applying the topics in class to the everyday world, particularly to the lives of Yale students.",
    "This class is tough, but fun. Professor Chun is a great lecturer.",
    "I great introduction to psych, especially if you are not a major and are just curious about the way people think and and why we act the way we do. Light-medium coursework, but reading the great textbook is entertaining and not very much like work. I would recommend this class to any Yale student, no matter their grade or major. I learned a lot, and I am confident that what i learned will stay with me for years to come.",
    "Great class. Absolutely take it if you still need to be introduced to psychology. If you already know the basics, then don't. Lectures are educational, interesting but most of the time also really fun to go to. I didnt miss a single one and also the guest lectures he brings in are great. Expect to work for it as the curve is really steep and one mistake on one of the tests can make a gradepoint difference. But dont worry about grades too much, you really take something out of this class.",
    "Good! Lectures felt a little light at times, but always fun.",
    "Psych 110 is a very broad intro to the field of psychology, and I ABSOLUTELY recommend this to any Yale student, even those who do not think they have any interest in psych or any desire to study it after the intro level. The things you'll learn can be applied to just about any other field of study, and the lectures are thought-provoking and relevant to everyday life. Lectures are engaging, exams are fair, and even though it's dense, the reading is incredibly interesting.",
    "not the gut class\/take it just cause everyone else is sort of class you expected at first. not terribly hard as you'll find out from the exams but even though the questions are really easily, the grading can be a bit harsh. everyone walked out of the first test thinking they got 100s and most people ended up in the 80s, if not lower. take it if you just want to learn about some interesting material, applies for any major really. lots of reading, there's also lab requirements, papers, clicker stuff, section, so really a lot more involved than anyone really initially thought. watch out and actually study hard for the exams...",
    "Yes if you want some sort of introduction to the subject of psychology.",
    "TAKE THIS COURSE. WITH MARVIN CHUN.",
    "I would definitely take this course at some point during your Yale career. Prof. Chun is a great lecturer and the class is very interesting. Taking it Credit D takes away the stress of the course and means you can enjoy it for what it is.",
    "Yes! It's a great Intro to Psych course! You learn about the scientific basis and also how this applies to the real world (with tons of examples from history, current news& even class data sets). It's lots of fun and you a learn a lot! And it's the sort of info that can inform everything you do in life - how to study better, knowledge about the society you live in, or even an interesting conversation topic for the dinner table!If you haven't taken Psych before, I would highly recommend this course!But, I would definitely recommend that you keep up with the readings and take some sort of notes while doing the reading (whether in the book or on separate paper) b\/c otherwise studying for the test is going to be painful!",
    "While a bit fluffy (lots of \"did you know\" sorts of facts and interesting youtube videos), this course is highly enjoyable and I actually learned quite a bit from it. Read the textbook as you go along because the test is 1\/3 just from the textbook and reading it the night before is not advised.",
    "Definitely take it despite the size",
    "This class is a lot of fun and very interesting. I recommend it.",
    "A great psych intro course. Pay attention in lecture and go over material regularly (or else it will be a lot of material to absorb at the end! and sometimes Chun provided lecture PowerPoints with missing slides!). Study highlighted\/italicized terms in books but give equal weight to lecture content.*Write papers with various studies and connect them using some insightful conclusions that weave them together",
    "Psych 110 is a course which should not be missed if a student has any interest whatsoever in the subject. It is an immensely enjoyable course and one which teaches a lot about the many areas of the field.",
    "Yes, very interesting class",
    "Great class, take it credit\/d\/fail if you want to take it as a gut but be aware that to make an A you have to actually invest some time.",
    "I would recommend this class because it helps explain a lot of human behavior, which is important to know in any field. If you have taken AP psych a lot of this class will be review, but I still think the way in which the information is presented is interesting and informative.",
    "Good class, but if you don't need the social science credit, I recommend auditing this course or taking it credit\/D. You can learn a lot just from the lectures, enough to pass the course. Getting an A in the class is difficult because a lot of the questions are based on small details from the readings, in order to help set a curve.",
    "Take it, but only with Marvin Chun. The only down fall is the reading. You can get by without doing it, but the reading will probably help you when it comes to exams. Otherwise it is fun, fun, fun.",
    "Absolutely. A lot of reading, but that does overshadow the fact that the material is interesting and applicable. Plus, you should never pass up the opportunity to take Marvin Chun's course.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to my fellow student. I feel that I've learned more about psychology than in any other psych class I've taken at Yale. Especially if you've never taken a psych course before, this is a great course to take!",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS. It is extremely interesting and fun. I enjoyed going to lecture, more than any other class I took this semester. I often felt that I wanted Professor Chun to be my life coach, because the information in this class can really be applied to one's own life.When you do take this class (everyone should) make sure you actually do the reading and study for the exams. The workload is more than manageable, but if you fall behind it will show on the exams. This is not a gut class, you definitely have to work, but the work load is definitely manageable.",
    "It is a really interesting course and has a lot of relevance to any program of study.",
    "Psychology 110 01 was a good survey course of basic psychology. It is not a gut class; there is a fair amount of work, but the material is interesting and engaging. It gives a good background for those who have had little\/no exposure to psychology beforehand.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student.",
    "Psych 110 was awesome. The book chapters are reallllly long and not super interesting (even though I find psychology interesting) but the lectures make up for it. Marvin Chun is awesome and so are his guest lecturers. He also puts all his lectures online, but the meat of the information he says (and isn't on the slides) in class. This is not an easy class, even for those who have taken AP Psych in high school, but definitely fun and interesting.",
    "If you can take this Credit\/D\/Fail; do it. You'll avoid competing with those feisty freshmen. The course is legit. All the things you hear about Chun; they're true. The dude has talent."
