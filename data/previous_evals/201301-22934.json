    "Absolutely. Yale's Arabic program has improved tremendously. If you can, take it with Sarab. She's a great teacher. She's intimidating at first, because she expects you to speak in Arabic and pay attention in class, but she's truly very sweet and very fun. I enjoyed being in class, and I learned a lot.",
    "It's fun, challenging and rewarding. Take it if you're willing and able to put in the time.",
    "The arabic program needs improvement. Very disorganized and daily schedules can be confusing. Hard to communicate with professors.",
    "Very fast-paced and difficult. A lot of homework. But definitely worth the effort and a very fulfilling, useful class.",
    "Arabic 120 focuses on a few more complicated grammar structures with more accelerated introduction of new vocabulary and an emphasis on speaking and reading practice. The class is a great continuation of Arabic language learning and helps to boost proficiency.",
    "I have learned 6 other languages so far, never did I learn so much and had so much fun doing it than with Arabic at Yale. I cannot recommend it enough.",
    "This is a great way of building on the basics of Arabic 110 and developing your knowledge of the language. It is a fast paced class so be prepared to work but it is very rewarding.",
    "Yes, if you are dedicated to learning the language and willing to put in the time necessary."
