    "Great class if you like personal writing, there is NO analytical writing",
    "Yes I would definitely recommend this class to other students. The writing assignments are interesting prompts and all the readings are enjoyable.",
    "Great class. Really interesting way to look at writing and you read a lot of great pieces. I have heard it varies dramatically professor to professor though depending on the personality match.",
    "YES",
    "The framework for this classic English class is great: read New Yorker style essays and then write similar non-academic essays on a variety of topics. It's a good way to improve your writing (but be aware you will write one essay per week) and a fun way to gain a deeper understanding of the literary\/publishing world. Professor Hopper is open, caring and committed. She provides good feedback, but the classroom experience can be slightly dry, boring and repetitive from time to time. The class is worth taking and Professor Hopper is a good instructor, but not legendary.",
    "Though 120 has the potential to be a fantastic class, I didn't get this experience. Professor Hopper takes an extremely long time to respond to essays and doesn't give detailed feedback.",
    "YES. After taking this course, you will feel like you can submit your work to a major publication. The seminar discussions can be fun and lively. To be sure, thw workload is heavy: six major papers and a lot of reading. However, you will be glad that you did so much work; you'll feel like a better writer."
