    "It's a great class. I would definitely recommend it. The collaboration at the end with the lyric class and the performance class is really enjoyable if you're partnered up with good people. You end up with a really cool final product.",
    "Music 214 is an excellent introduction to the medium of the music theatre song. It's an awesome class and a great deal of fun. Despite its relatively low course number, don't take it if you don't feel reasonably confident of your compositional ability: You will write, with very few exceptions, an entire song every week of the term, and Josh doesn't accept many excuses for failing to turn something in. (It doesn't have to be genius, but it does have to exist.)",
    "Take this class. If you want to improve your songwriting ability, just take this class. It's fantastic.",
    "If you are interested in writing music of any kind take this course, it expands your lyrical understanding as well as harmonic palette."
