   "comments": [
    "If you've ever listened to music, you should take this class to understand what you're listening to.",
    "I would definitely suggest this course for the non-music person. It gives you a great overall summary about different forms in music, and about music itself. The exams are a little difficult if you do not have a good \"music ear,\" but it is manageable.",
    "Yeah it's great.",
    "I would definitely recommend the class, I think clapping for credit is a stupid name for the class because there's little clapping and its not a throwaway or super easy class. Prof Wright is the best in the business, he wrote the textbook and helped the design the interactive website which you do your homework on, which is really useful. Teaches an appreciation of classical music and also makes fun connections to pop music i.e. Michael Jackson, Gaga, Sting. Loved the class.",
    "I would recommend the Listening to Music class for a fellow student because it is an exciting class that anyone can find joy in, and the work you do is not too intense yet helps you develop a greater understanding for music.",
    "take it! it's pretty enjoyable, fun, not too hard, and performers come from time to time. plus it's so nice to go to a class where you can actually listen to music over loud speakers, i always looked forward to tuesdays at 10:30.",
    "Yes yes yes! Definitely if you haven't taken one before.",
    "It made me learn to enjoy classical music. what more do you want?",
    "Easy and fun. Learn enough to be able to better appreciate music, but the class can be kind of slow.",
    "It's a nice course - but be warned, it's much tougher than you'd expect.",
    "I would recommend it as a easy and fun 5th course. Classical music is interesting, especially for people who really enjoy music.",
    "This class is more difficult than may seem. Attending lectures is required because some information on the exams only appear in the lectures.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to someone who wants to get some exposure to music and better understand classical music on the whole. It made me excited about listening to music.",
    "Music 112 was a good class that I would recommend. It is not a ton of work if you simply go to class and do the reading, and the tests are very manageable. The material covered is knowledge that everyone should really have. I am very glad to have taken it and to have a much better understanding of music history and the different types of music.",
    "Yes, this is a really good class if you like classical music AT ALL. The beginning 2\/3s are mostly learning about the different parts of a piece, like meter, tempo, etc. and you listen to music in class and for homework. The final 1\/3 is kind of a history of classical music so you should read these chapters in the book, but it isnt hard. The homework, listening exercises, are really easy.",
    "Great class. Easy, fun, enjoyable. Take it.",
    "Yes, take it if you haven't had much training or exposure to classical music. You will definitely learn many new things.",
    "PHENOMENAL CLASS. Prof. Wright loves his students and it is clear that he is very passionate about his teaching. I came out of the class knowing about different types of music and really having a greater appreciation for Classical music. After taking this class I regret not taking more music classes in my past three years at Yale. One of Yale's gems - I ABSOLUTELY recommend this class with no reservation.",
    "Yes- definitely recommended. Not hard, very interesting, great teacher.",
    "This is an AWESOME class, but not as much of a gut as you'd think if you have no musical background - this is not \"Clapping for Credit.\" Prof. Wright is really entertaining and knowledgeable, and his genuine passion for music is infectious. You'll get a pretty good grasp of how classical music works and its history in the western world. Exams and papers are all quite manageable if you come to lectures and pay attention.",
    "Absolutely take this course before you graduate if you have any interest in music!",
    "Great class! However, more work than expected. Unfortunately, the majority of the class also has a background in music, so it can make getting a good grade somewhat difficult for someone with little experience. Prof. Wright is the man...just awesome. Definitely get to know him if you can.",
    "Yes, definately. I learned a lot and had fun. Most enjoyable class I've taken at Yale",
    "TAKE IT! I'm a math major, but I have to say, THIS IS THE BEST COURSE AT YALE!",
    "Yes absolutly. Fun and interesting. not too much work",
    "Great course for those who know a little about music but nothing about its history or structure. Workload is light, though the tests aren't necessarily a breeze. Lectures are great -- you listen to music for a good portion each one. Prof Wright is great. And you really do learn a lot",
    "Fun and low stress introduction to the fundamentals and history of classical music. One note, most people in the class have had some musical experience, so the beginning might be a bit tough if you actually have none (as the course description says).",
    "I came upon this class by chance, after seeing the recording on Yale Open Courses. You should definitely take it! It will not only enrich your capacity for culture and music, but also your entire Yale experience. I found Listening to Music to be a welcome change from my other classes, since the lectures, papers, and tests engaged me in a completely different way. It is a great class and I recommend it whole-heartedly.",
    "absolutely take it. its fun, informative -- you're homework is listening to awesome music",
    "Good course for beginners in music.",
    "Great class, easy workload, interesting material for people with music or non-music history, just study in depth for tests and you're set",
    "Yes, definitely! Best humanity credit every. The materials are interesting and Professor Wright is great!",
    "This is an absolutely great course for the beginner. There was excellent coverage of simple theory, but my personal favorite portion of the class was the time devoted to history. I felt like I learned a lot about the different styles of music, not to mention, I enjoyed \"discovering\" new pieces each lecture. The course definitely had its intended effect. I'm always on the lookout for classical music to add to my iTunes.On the flip side, if you are pretty knowledgeable in classical music already, or are looking for a straight music theory class, then Music 112 isn't for you. As I said, this is definitely a class for the beginner.",
    "Yes, I would absolutely one hundred percent recommend the class to another Yale student. It was one of my favorite classes at Yale and a must take. You will particularly enjoy it if you played music growing up but have since lost touch with it. Professor Wright wrote the textbook and invented the course. But more importantly he is awesome and really cares about his students. Summary of the course: attend lecture and section. Weekly assignments online- super short. 2-3 page paper and 5 page paper. 2 midterms and a final. Sounds like a lot but it is totally manageable and a nice break from studying for other classes. Grade breaks down into many pieces. Take it!! Its awesome",
    "not the gut class i thought it was. 2 midterms, midterm paper, final, final paper, and you actually gotta pay attention, do the readings, go to section and keep up or else you'll be screwed. i have zero music background, not even saxophone in 3rd grade like most of the kids in the class, maybe that had something to do with it. mostly though, you'll pull through if you put the effort into it and it's a really fun class - just know it won't necessarily be the worry-free class you were expecting to fill for that fifth class.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to fellow students. Its not too much work and really fun.",
    "No. I started out with high hopes for this class. The beginning of the course was enjoyable and easy; what could be better than just listening to beautiful music and answering some questions about it, right? WRONG. The class devolved into an enormous ego trip for Professor Wright. He treats his students like idiots and is extremely condescending. Only take this class if you are confident in your abilities to completely remove your brain and regurgitate the opinions of a bitter, old, egomaniac. If you still want to take this class my only advice is be in one of the TAs' sections.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class for a relaxed introduction to musical elements, forms, and styles. You do not have to have any music background! You really come away with a great appreciation for music, especially classical music.",
    "An easy class. Not sure what grade I got. Overall, lukewarm.",
    "This was a course that taught people like me, people without a musical background, the basics of music. Things such as style, genre, and form are things that we think about inherently in music but we cannot put our finger on those sorts of things without the type of knowledge we gained in this class. I would recommend this course to someone that is serious about learning about music.",
    "Yes, if you want to learn some things about music, but take it Credit D if you're not a pro!",
    "If you know nothing about music, TAKE THIS CREDIT D!! It is not \"clapping for credit\" unless you have an extensive music background. That said, do take it if you've never been exposed to music or music history before because you will be glad that you did. Music now has a whole new meaning for me because I can understand it much more and where it came from.",
    "I would absolutely recommend MUSI 112 to any student. I have no musical background and found myself captivated by the class. It really is amazing.",
    "Great class. Really interesting and entertaining. The professor really cares about his students.",
    "MUSI 112 is a very relaxing course that does not require too much effort. Prof. Wright has a great sense of humor and keeps every class session highly entertaining. Overall this is a great introduction to classical music for those who have no background, but if you have some background in music history and theory, don't take this course as it will be a waste of time.",
    "Definitely take this class. It was my savior with a really heavy science schedule to just be able to go and listen to music twice a week and have it explained to me.",
    "Very interesting class, but do not underestimate the amount of work needed; I recommend it to any student who wants to gain an introductory level of understanding on music theory or music history",
    "I would recommend it for a student who wants a relatively easy and different course to change up their schedule and broaden their education.",
    "Take this class! It is very fairly taught, such that students with no background in music are not at a disadvantage. Classical music is everywhere, and even if you don't intend to listen to it for fun, it is good to have a better appreciation and understanding of the genre when you do encounter it in life. Plus this is just a fun class that requires relatively little work."
