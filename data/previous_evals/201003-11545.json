    "The lecture time could have been used much more wisely. Knowing that we were ultimately accountable for knowing the tree species was the main factor driving our learning. The slide-driven lectures did little in the way of preparing us for what we ultimately needed to know. There needed to be more synthesis of material rather than a litany of species in each lecture. Field trips and practicing ID were the most useful."

   "question_text": "The things about this course most in need of improvement are:",
   "comments": [
    "powerpoint slides need to be revised. focus more on cladistics and systematics rather than going through each order and family. focus less on tropical plants, more on regional or at least national ecosystems.",
    "Make the slide presentations more natural. More time should be spent on reviewing the natural\/evolutionary history of groups and how they are related rather than going through a list of example species and their features. I know a few scattered facts about phylogenetics now, but no comprehensive understanding.",
    "Sometimes there was a lack of communication of expectations between the instructor and students, as well as between the instructor and her TA.",
    "I think more time looking at specimens and understanding how the families and orders are different would have been helpful.",
    "There is significant room for improvement:1. Most taxonomy\/systematics classes teach a systematic method for field identification that is based on the dichotomous keys used in the most prominent local flora guide. Both in lecture and in the field, students were given characters haphazardly. It is clear that the professor knows the species, but a more systematic explanation of the deductions used to arrive at the species identification would be appreciated.2. The midterm field practicum tested material that was not heavily emphasized in lecture (e.g. bark and twig characters) and some material that had yet to even be covered. I appreciate some of the logistical constraints (i.e. deciduousness), but the midterm left many students frustrated.3. Fresh specimens (and herbarium specimens) were provided in class once. I find that spending hands-on time with fresh specimens in class and taking as much time as is needed to really memorize the distinguishing traits is byfar the best way for me to become proficient in their identification."

    "I am happy this coures is offered. It would be embarrassing to graduate from the oldest school of forestry in the country and not know at least the basic northeastern forest species. The course also helps to synthesize other classes like Stand Dynamics and Silviculture by providing familiarity with the autecology of the major New England forest species that are so often referenced."

    "Spend as much time as possible looking at trees on the streets of New Haven and in the parks.",
    "You will learn the key New England forest species. You will become proficient in their field identification. You will probably enjoy the friendliness and easy-going disposition of Prof. Camp. You will probably not enjoy the midterm field practicum as it takes place when only half of the species you are responsible for have been covered in lecture."
