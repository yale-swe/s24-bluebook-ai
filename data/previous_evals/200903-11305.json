    "Even though it might be a little painful, you really need to take this class to do any further study in math. It's a crash course in sequences, real functions, and calculus. Peter Jones is frustrating and hard to follow most of the time he's on-topic (which is very little), but he's pretty helpful when doing the homework. Very essential foundation in analysis.",
    "A good course overall. The lectures aren't too helpful for learning the material, but are essential if you want to do well in the exam. The exams are taken almost completely out of past years' exams (which are posted). about 1\/3 of the exams will be regurgitating \"big theorems\" that one proves in class.Not extremely rigourous: both the book and the professor will make logical jumps that you'll have to live with. If you're willing to sift through the unfortunate circularities that you're bound to encounter, a reasonably thorough treatment.",
    "An extremely tough but extremely interesting class. Expect to work five to ten hours a week on problem sets, and spend an extremely long time studying for finals. The material is the basic material for a first course in Analysis. If Professor Jones is teaching it, take it with him. Work hard, and you will do well.",
    "I would definitely recommend it. Be cautious if you aren't familiar with proof-based math. Peter Jones was an awesome professor; lectures were definitely something to look forward to just to hear all his ridiculous anecdotes. At the same time, it's Analysis, so know what you're getting yourself into. The material isn't particularly difficult conceptually, but you'll spend a lot of late nights working on the problem sets.",
    "Math 301 was great. The class did not cover a whole lot of material, so we were able to go into a lot of depth for what we did cover. The problem sets were challenging but definitely doable (except for a couple problems, which I suspect only Peter Jones could figure out on his own). Jones's lectures were interesting, and Jones himself is a very livelyteacher.Be warned that Math 301 is difficult. I'd say it's about the same level as Math 230, so if you survived that class you should be fine. The jump up from other freshman math classes may be very difficult.",
    "Take Math 301. If you're considering a math major, this class will convince you to do it. It's hard, it's intense, it's a lot of work, but it's a ton of fun. Professor Jones makes the class (so I can't speak to anyone else), and the class builds camaraderie and self-confidence. 301 trumps 300 every time.",
    "This will probably be the best math class you take at Yale. That may or may not be a good thing (depending on how much you like this class), but you should take it nonetheless",
    "Good god. really hard. take it if you have to (or if you have to take an analysis course in general, as I hear 300 is no better)",
    "Math 301 was my favorite class this semester. It's a lot of work and pretty difficult, but at the same time, what you learn is very interesting. And Peter Jones is the best.",
    "NOT GOOD.It's a lot of work, which is to be expected, but on top of that it's plain not a good class. Prof. Jones is really nice, except he's one of those professors who is always trying to be \"clever\" - always telling stories and taking polls about random math. It makes the class more entertaining at first but soon enough you realize that all this is at the expense of your analysis education. When he does stuff on the board, it is often entirely incomprehensible because he writes all over the place and often provides poor justifications for steps. I took notes throughout but found them completely useless (except for the theorems that he makes you regurgitate exactly to his method on the exams) because of the mess Jones makes. Luckily, the book is alright to follow.It's too bad because this is really important stuff in math and mostly you just have to put up with a bad class.",
    "301 rocks. It's very time-consuming, but not at all hard, if that makes sense - I probably could have handled the math itself as a freshman, though probably not the psychological toll that 20+-hour-a-week problem sets can have. It's very gorgeous material, Professor Jones is a hilarious instructor with mad lecturing and question-answering skills (seriously - during office hours, which most of the class goes to, he will give you a perfect solution to just about any question you ask him), and the exams are fair. Not easy, but fair. Even if you got burned out on math somewhere down the line, take this class just for fun - you won't regret it!",
    "Good course. Very much a typical math class, spiced up the professor, who is crazy but also kind of awesome. The professor is very thorough and you will learn a lot about analysis but the concepts are difficult and the problems sets are very painful. Take only if a math major or really interested in nonpractical math.",
    "this class is good. if you're a math major you should WANT to take this class even if it weren't mandatory. fo real.",
    "Math 301 is a strong introduction to real analysis. The problem sets are difficult and time consuming, but Professor Jones is always willing to help during office hours. The material is interesting and I would recommend the class to another student if the student is going to major in Math. The class is difficult but manageable if you are willing to put adequate time into it.",
    "A tough course that you should look to take if you want to do higher level mathematics or want a challenge.",
    "Derive the world. Recommended if one does not procrastinate and does not mind staying up late to do homework and truly finds mathematics interesting.",
    "Take it if you're interested in higher math, and do the homework, you'll learn a lot of important skills.",
    "301 is as good as a math class anyone could hope to take. Professor Jones is a phenomenal professor, spicing up his real analysis lectures with anecdotes and jokes, which I enjoyed (but perhaps others may have found annoying). He was very good about answering questions during office hours, which were conveniently scheduled right after hour TTh classes, and were very helpful for completing the homework. The problem sets were manageable- I would say there were about three problem sets in a row that were much easier than the others, and a few that were ridiculously hard (i.e.. everyone in a room and having no clue how to do a certain problem). The rest were in-between. The tests were half proof, half problem, where the proofs were basically announced beforehand. Recommended",
    "I would recommend it to any math major. It's a great course. You really learn how to prove things, and Peter Jones is a great professor.",
    "It's hard. The homework will be a large time commitment. Peter Jones will go on crazy, funny tangents in class and say \"oh!\" in a very comical way. And he'll give you a good idea of what to expect on the exams, but his claim that there are no surprises is a bit too strong. If you think you might be able to handle it, go for it. If you survive the first few homeworks, and have at least one friend, you might be ok. I had a lot of fun.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to anyone with a talent for math. You don't really need any prerequisites (though being familiar with proofs is extremely helpful). You will learn a lot if you put the time in, and Peter Jones does a great job of making the classes interesting to be in.",
    "The course is quite boring, even if you like analysis, but this is the nature of the subject matter, not the instructors fault. If you really want to do analysis, this is a great course. If you just want to dip into analysis, this is still a good course. If your just curious, it is best to avoid."
