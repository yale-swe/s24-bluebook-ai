   "comments": [
    "English 120 is really, really good at teaching you to think carefully. You read slowly, and you consider every word as you write. Or, at least, I did. I also learned to listen better to other people, and to express my thoughts more clearly. It fostered such a sense of community. It was so fun. It was a joy, every single class, and Ehrgood is a superstar. He is the best. The absolute best 120 professor. You MUST take the class with him.",
    "Yes, I think the 1-on-1 meetings are absolutely necessary to improving as a writer, and I think that that was definitely accomplished. On one hand, I definitely see that there are areas that I need to improve in, but on the other hand, I know I am a better writer for having taken this course and exposing me to what I need to work on. My love for English has been solidified, and because of 120 I will be coming back for more. That beings said, students should be aware that it is a hard class. Not because of the workload, but because it requires a LOT of introspection in the essays.",
    "Yes I recommend it because it helps you develop important writing skills and just having all these personal essays you wrote at the end of the year makes you feel better about yourself. Also, I took it for fun at first because I didn't think it would be relevant to the academic type of essays I would be writing for my other classes. But boy was I wrong. I noticed my writing improving for even my research papers.",
    "I would tell another student that English 120 is for any writer who wants to learn about style. It is certainly not a class for research papers crammed with facts. Any writer who feels they could stand to improve their voice or nuance should take this class!",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend the class. The skills learned in this course can be applied to any type of writing.",
    "English 120 is a class that focuses on reading, evaluating, and writing personal essays. It is centered around five big essays written throughout the course of the semester and focuses on the nuances of writing that distinguish a good writer from an excellent writer.",
    "English 120 is a class targeted towards students who want to develop a distinctive personal style of writing. I would recommend it wholeheartedly to any student who was interested in writing -- in particular, interested in learning to write beautifully. In order to enjoy and benefit from this class, however, you have to be interested in words and willing to \"zoom in\" on your writing far more than you do in most classes. I would not recommend English 120 to a student who did not care about these things.",
    "Yes!",
    "Take it if you get into Ehrgood's section!",
    "English 120 is like the dream internship at the New Yorker that doesn't really exist. This class is a patient, thorough investigation of the non-creative, non-fiction, long-form essay. We inspect essays, and then we fiddle with them, playing \"parlor games\" in which we change out words, rearrange sentences, and splice paragraphs to see the effect on the piece as a whole. By the end of the course, an English 120 student will still let beautiful writing enchant her, but she'll marvel at the mechanics of the writer's sleight of hand instead of being dumbfounded by the feat itself. And then she'll have the courage to copy those writers and conjure some magic of her own. This class makes you realize that what is obvious to you might be unfathomable to someone else, and writing well is the only way to make that person see what you see. In other words, it's absolutely necessary.",
    "I would recommend 120 to students who love the written word and have some sort of curiosity about it."
