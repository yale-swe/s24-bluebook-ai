    "Great class!! I am blown away by how much Chinese we learned in a semester. I, along with most people in the class, entered the course knowing no Chinese and am now able to have basic conversations.",
    "I learned how to converse in Chinese in a confident and skillful way through only a semester of learning. I felt through focus on my tones, vocabulary, and grammar that I developed a solid foundation of the language and left with a grasp of Chinese.",
    "I learned how to read write speak basic Chinese in an incredibly short amount of time!",
    "I learned a lot of introductory chinese in such a short period of time!",
    "I was able to speak, read and write in Chinese and I am extremely proud of the progress I have made in only a single semester.",
    "I developed the ability to read, write, interpret and speak Chinese characters and words. I learned how to engage with an incredibly rigorous curriculum of foreign-language learning, and I learned to appreciate the work that goes into learning a language!",
    "Completed Integrated Chinese Level 1 Part 1: Learned 100s of Vocab Words and Characters, Learned basic sentence structures, proper pinyin pronunciation, and limited colloquial terms. Its really amazing how much you learn in only 3 months."

   "comments": [
    "Very difficult course with lengthly nightly homework and daily quizzes. Although it is hard, the daily class meetings and extensive homework and preparation necessary are needed to learn a language!",
    "I struggled with learning and speaking the proper tones, but--with the oral presentations and tutoring every week--I have been working on improving it. I felt confident in my grasp of vocabulary and grammar--and ability to ask and answer questions.",
    "Lots of work but really helpful as chinese is very foreign relative to english",
    "All around great!",
    "I got much better at writing and speaking Chinese",
    "Strengths: class is structured well with very helpful homework assignments and supplementary material Weakness: class moves too quickly and many grammar lessons or intricacies of vocabulary can be neglected due to the course's pace",
    "The strengths of the course were how the intensive nature balanced writing and speaking, never one over the other. I thought a weakness was that there was little drilling of writing characters in class, which was something I struggled with; rather, there was more so a focus on identifying characters.",
    "Strengths: --Engaging --Excellent Professor --Daily quizzes forced you to constantly prepare and not fall behind --Grammer and Vocabulary was taught clearly --Lots of classroom speaking time Weaknesses: --Lots of Homework and Studying (also a strength!)"

    "Yes!! If you want to learn Chinese then yes.",
    "Yes, since this course allows one to learn Chinese an organized, structured way where one feels like they are really learning and understanding to the language and accumulating greater knowledge everyday.",
    "Yes, if you are willing to put in the effort.",
    "100 times yes!! Its hard work but extremely rewarding to learn the basics of chinese so fast",
    "Yes of course! The Chinese program at yale is great!",
    "Highly recommend but it is a lot of time.",
    "Absolutely! If you want to learn Chinese, or even satisfy your language requirement by taking a fulfilling course, I recommend Chinese! The laoshi are so kind and caring and engaging, and the class is predictable in a way that allows you to accurately see your status and progress in the course.",
    "If you have even a hint of interest to learn Chinese, do it! You have access to one of the best, if not the best, Chinese-language departments in the United States that provides excellent teaching and lots of room for growth."
