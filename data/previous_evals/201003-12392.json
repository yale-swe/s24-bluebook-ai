    "It's a pretty chill class. I hate to throw the word gut around there, but it's a nice easy 5th credit and a great way to get a humanities credit.Just so you know, the format of the class is that you come in, you play music for an hour, you take about a 15 minute break where the Professor will talk about the music and play some recordings of it, and then you play again for the last 45 minutes. It's not a normal classroom setting.There are some simple written assignments, but they're really easy.The music can get pretty redundant at times though.",
    "Absolutely.",
    "Absolutely, even if you aren't interested in early music this is a wonderful supplement to any music education!",
    "This class is a delight to take if you have the time on Monday evenings and would like an accessible introduction to baroque performance. The typical class functions like an orchestra rehearsal, and Professor Mealy often brings chocolates to help students make it to 9pm! You get a baroque bow if you are a string player, which is really fun to play with and very helpful in learning and emulating period styles. Robert Mealy is an excellent player and instructor, very friendly and welcomes meetings in office hours, or just chatting about anything you were curios about pertaining to baroque music. I sincerely hope I get to work with him more in the future! Aside from occasional boredom if you are a non-string player or a non-melody instrument, I cannot think of anything but good reviews for this class. The readings are short and interesting, and the final exam is a concert! Take it."
