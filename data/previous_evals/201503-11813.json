    "Weekly projects, culminating in a speech synthesizer. You learn how to analyze speech and other signals as well as create them from scratch. If you are curious about how Siri talks to you, take this class. The workload is not awful and the midterm and final are fair.",
    "Applied Digital Signal Processing is a great course. It is definitely challenging and a lot of work, but very rewarding because you do learn a lot. After EE310, I used to say that I was not really into the Signals and System branch of EE, but I actually really enjoyed this class and the material. I would definitely recommend this if you need a 400-level engineering elective. Kuc is an amazing lecturer, especially because the material we cover is his research interest, and he is awesome in a small class setting (7 students took the class my year). Be aware that you will write a ton of Matlab code.",
    "This is perhaps the best electrical engineering class at Yale. The course seamlessly introduces theory and then demonstrates it with engaging practical projects. It solidifies intuition for several theoretical ideas while also driving home realistic considerations. You'll be amazed by how much theoretical knowledge you gain while also proud of what you build by the end, such as a voice synthesis system. I wish all my engineering classes had felt like 450!!"
