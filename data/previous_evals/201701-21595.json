   "comments": [
    "I learned a lot about law to be honest! I had never taken a political science course so this was really interesting to get exposed to that sort of material. It was also great because we learned about current events.",
    "Critical thinking and concise writing, especially when referring to legal cases and jargon.",
    "I learned a ton about Bioethics, generally a bunch about the american legal system and some law basics. I really understand the american healthcare system very well now, including the confusing nature of the insurance landscape etc.",
    "I learned a lot of law basics, which was pretty interesting.",
    "overview on bioethics and current events about bioethics",
    "I learned more about the legal system and how to make some legal arguments.",
    "thinking about bioethics through the lens of the law, not through morals",
    "This class was not as good as the hype. Latham is a cool guy, but I hate how he lectured without a PPT. The class was 2 midterms and a final, which was fine. Section was pointless. Easy breezy class.",
    "The ins-and-outs of (as the name of the class says) bioethics and law. Great ethical conversations surrounding a broad range of historical and contemporary topics. Great intersectional discussion of biology and ethics.",
    "I became much more aware of current and historical public health issues. Not only did we learn the baseline of every issue, but from a legal standpoint, I learned why cases were decided they way they were. It was really cool being able to take a legal standpoint on these issues that i have heard about for such a long time.",
    "I learned so much about the field of bioethics and about typical public health law today. The variety of information really applicable to the medical situations we find ourselves in currently.",
    "Excellent overview of bioethical legal conundrums,",

    "A great course to take for getting into law or if you are interested in the ethics of medicine or other topics in the course. Worth taking. Makes you think and re-evaluate a lot of things you thought you knew. Good topics to discuss with classmates.",
    "This course definitely gave me a new way of looking at Bioethics and made me much more knowledgeable about the current state of US health and bioethics law.",
    "I learned a lot about how the American legal system accommodates the rapidly changing challenges and innovations in bioethics. This included the relationship between states and the federal government; the history and current events of American healthcare; and reading case law on topics spanning reproductive rights, organ donation, and more. The course also expected students to be able to write well about legal topics.",
    "The history of law regarding bioethical issues, and how the law has been shaped by Supreme Court rulings that have set precedents.",

    "I learned how to analyze a technical field in the lens of law.",
    "This course presents issues very well, though there isn't much debate over ethics. Really Professor Latham explains the history behind key law decisions and policy making in bioethical issues, but there is no talk about what's right or wrong ethically. Still a great class.",
    "It strengthened my understanding of how the legal system in the United States operates; it also gave me a taste of the sort of work I would do if I decide to pursue law school in the future.",
    "Learned a lot about the balance between morals\/ liberties and Federal\/ state law. Very interesting course with a ton of information on the U.S. legal system and how we came to be this way through experience.",

    "This course provided an overview of important legal cases and reasoning grounding relevant bioethics issues in society.",
    "A lot of new understanding about how the law works! I came in for the bioethics, and wish we could've gone more in depth into the philosophical grounding of it, but at the same time understanding the legal frameworks that guide practical decisions is also really interesting.",
    "I've really gained an in-depth knowledge of a variety of bioethics issues, which have really informed my world view.",
    "I received a great basic introduction to the field of bioethics and legal writing\/analysis.",
    "I have taken away a lot of basic knowledge of law and bioethics.",
    "I learned how to use law cases to respond to questions.",

    "Good introduction to law concepts",
    "The American legal system, health care, genetic technology and the law, etc.",
    "I learned a good amount about the law in many bioethics areas - doctor-patient relationship, right-to-die and assisted suicide, assisted reproduction, and many others.",

I learned the historical debates and precedents that our legal system today rests upon, especially with regard to hot issues like abortion, reproductive technology, etc..",
    "I learned so much about ethical issues in biology and the law applied to these issues! This course really made me develop a new perspective on these moral questions that can apply to all human beings and especially to medical fields.",
    "Useful knowledge! I'm a stem major so the things I learn in class don't tend to help me in everyday life. This class taught me things about the world that everyone should know: healthcare systems of the world, organ donation, abortion, right to die, the list is long. Also I learned how to read case law (which was totally unfamiliar) and organize an argument based on it.",
    "I have never been in a law-based class before. I learnt an AWFUL lot and I am so happy I took this class. It was one of my most enjoyable classes at Yale, helped by having a great TA (Ahsan).",
    "I learned how to read a case book, think about larger themes and trends in law, and discuss how the law views bioethics questions.",
    "In broad terms, I learned about bioethics and the law, and how the two interact. Sometimes bioethics drives the law, and other times the law drives bioethics, and I learned about this interaction.",
    "I learned to think more critically about our current health care system and bioethics in America.",
    "This is an awesome class. The lectures are engaging and the content even more so. It's a law class so obviously you learn about the law in America, specifically in the context of Bioethics. The cases are super interesting and the questions we discuss in section challenge those of us who haven't grappled with similar material before.",
    "Having never been exposed to the healthcare system before, PLSC 257 has given me a really solid grounding in a system that I will inevitably need to navigate as an adult.",
    "Honestly, didn't gain that much.",
    "I really appreciated the coursework about the ACA! I had been hearing what ObamaCare was for so long, but never knew to what anyone was referring. I feel like a much more informed citizen of the states because I now know a little bit about how health insurance works. I also really appreciated all of the coursework on assisted reproduction.",

    "This course taught me all of the basics behind bioethics and gave me great insight into the way the law works regarding these various topics.",
    "I learned more about important bioethics questions currently prevalent in society -- abortion, organ donation, and assisted reproduction to name a few. Learning specific cases as well as the legality of the issues was interesting.",
    "Awesome intro course. Great knowledge and low workload.",
    "Bioethics and Law helped me better synthesize information and connect details across a wide variety of case studies to identify the overarching themes that connected them.",
    "I learned how to brief law cases and understand the incredibly complex nature of American law in bioethics.",
    "- Not much skills or insights. Did learn quite a bit about specific cases in law and see how courts approach complex moral and ethical issues. I have no experience in law, but as an engineer I am interested in the more moral and ethical implications of law, which this class explored.",
    "Learned about several important topics facing modern Bioethics and Law, also learned a fair bit of constitutional law that is important to the field of bioethics.",
    "I learned a lot about some of the most controversial and interesting topics in American bioethics and law.",
    "I learned so much about both the American legal system and contemporary issues in bioethics so interesting!",
    "This class is a great intro course to the topics of law, specifically related to topics in bioethics of course. Specific law cases and then general thinking in law are learned in this course.",
    "The course talked about many areas of bioethics and the associated law. The class mainly covers US law on the state and federal level and rulings from the state and federal courts.",
    "I gained a foundation to bioethics law in the US.",
    "critical thinking, evaluating ethics v. the law, learning about medical ethics",
    "Bioethics and Law is a multifaceted course that effectively teaches both. I pet hice issues as well as methods of formulating a legal argument. I learned a lot about the legal and healthcare systems of the US as well as how courts think about issues of biology and ethics in an ever changing world. I learned to think through issues in terms of the specific rights they implicate and to understand the complicated balance of justice involved in these cases.",
    "Interesting material, presented in a compelling way. This course pushed me to understand the way that courts work, while also exposing me to the world of medicine and government.",

    "current issues in modern age, how to critically engage with them and relevant cases",
    "Very thought provoking and incredibly interesting. Take this course at some point during your time at yale",
    "From this course, I've learned about the historical, medical, and legal development of various critical topics of bioethics: abortion, patenting of life forms, cloning, IVF, right to die, physician-assisted suicide, organ donation, sterilization, human research, national healthcare, national health policies, informed consent, et cetera.",

    "We covered a variety of topics such as organ donations, public health, end of life care, etc.",
    "Different aspects and application of the law",
    "This course was an excellent course about how the law treats issues of bioethics, and I learned a lot about the legality of such issues. I am involved in STEM and chose to take this course because I am also involved in genetic engineering, so bioethics is a big concern to me. This course helped develop insight into the legal aspect of these STEM fields, although did not focus on such topics 100% (which I did not expect anyway).",
    "I learned a lot about law and healthcare policy thay I was not familiar with and that is very useful to everyone (whether in law or not).",
    "This course taught me how to read court cases, think critically about the current state of the American health care system, and assess where I personally stand regarding several regulations.",
    "The most important thing that I learned in this class is that American federal law is an imperfect but evolving construct; not something that is gleaned from philosophers or handed down from on high, but a system born out of basic human empathy and justice for individuals. In this class, you learn how various facets of American law and how the law has been adapted to account for questions of ethics.",
    "Absolutely loved this class. Lecture was amazing. Section was great. Learned really important and relevant information about the state of public health and how the law has responded. So glad I took this.",
    "I learned so much in this course about bioethics in this country.",
    "I learned so much about the American legal system! I truly can't express how much this class taught me not only did I gain a much better understanding of bioethics and American law, but so much of the information and cases and concepts that were taught have stuck with me, which doesn't happen too often.",
    "I learned how to evaluate case law and analyze legal arguments. I also gained greater perspective about the U.S. (as well as international) health care system, as well as recent advances in technology and how they've applied to bioethics as a field.",
    "This course taught information pertinent to law, medicine, healthcare, politics, etc. that I think every student should know. All of the information was relevant and applicable, and we were not required to memorize any specific details beyond a reasonable degree.",
    "Learned many law cases and how to apply them to arguments.",
    "Actually in incredibly interesting class, with lots of significant implications with changes going on in American healthcare right now. Highly recommend!",
    "I learned a lot of information about bioethics and law.",
    "This class taught me a lot about the law in bioethics. More specifically, I felt that I learned necessary information about the healthcare system in an easy to understand way. I felt the same about the legal system as well.",
    "I learned how to study case law - and many of the current issues in bioethics.",
    "I learned about major bioethical issues in United States history. I also learned how to write a legal analysis.",
    "I learned a more argumentative, lawyer, proof-based like way of thinking. Also learned quite a bit about the intricacies and bioethics that I didn't know about before",
    "I learned about how American law has handled various issues in bioethics, such as organ donation and artificial reproduction. I learned how to apply basic legal analysis to hypothetical legal cases with respect to bioethics issues.",
    "I got a very approachable and interesting overview of the American healthcare system and health law. This helped me learn how to understand and analyze legal cases that pertain to health law. This course helped me form more informed opinions about national healthcare policies.",
    "Learned a lot about bioethical law, both from a constitutional perspective and a statutory perspective.",
    "thinking about US law and law cases analytically, as applied to bioethics cases",
    "Through this course, I learned a great deal about how to interpret law, and how to build a case and evaluate the strength or constitutionality of a case.",
    "Learned a great deal about the history of bioethics in the United States, also became more familiar with the judicial system of the U.S. I can now speak in depth about cases and terminology I previously only had a very basic understanding of.",
    "I learned alot more than what I could've imagined about the American legal system in a relatively easy class and enjoyed every minute of it.",
    "In this class I learned about bioethical issues that pose legal challenges in the world right now and also about the origins of bioethics and the first issues that bioethics had to address. I also learned about the logic that one takes when discussing a legal issue and determining how it would be evaluated in court.",
    "A fascinating intro course into the complexities of public health law. The lectures were always engaging, even if Professor Latham occasionally let his political views get the best of his instruction of the material. Though you could still do well without doing the readings or even attending lecture, I would highly recommend doing both to get the most out of it. Both are incredibly informative and interesting, so it shouldn't be too hard anyway! Definitely recommend this class!",
    "I developed an incredible understanding of the case law relevant to bioethics. This is one of the most rigorous courses at Yale. Definitely recommend!",
    "Incredible must take class",
    "I learned how to reason ethically and apply law to controversial cases.",

    "Great insight into the world of bioethics and the legal basis for how many of these ideas are understood. Not so much how we argue each side, but how the courts have interpreted the various issues.",
    "Learned lots!",
    "I learned a lot about the US legal system with regards to healthcare, changing ideas of what exactly providing healthcare means, and how far America still has to go with regards to providing its citizens with comprehensive healthcare.",
    "Learned a lot about laws and ethics regarding bioethics.",
    "I now have learned so many things about bioethics and current debates and disputes in society. I have learned not only the history but the legal guidelines on where things are going and the potential future outcomes.",
    "Bioethical dilemmas and how the legal system handled these cases",
    "Learned so much about topics that are sooo relevant to our society. Was not fed the professors opinion but learned all angles of arguments to be better educated on the overall scope of the issues",
    "I learned a lot about how to approach legal issues and the way that the US legal and health care systems interact.",
    "Very interesting class",
    "I gained a far better understanding of the American Health Care System, as well as those in other countries. Furthermore, I learned about important legal cases regarding biomedical issues and those that carry ethical implications along with them. After taking this course, I learned how to apply knowledge of existing bioethical laws into potential laws.",
    "How to approach modern law.",
    "I learned about major issues in bioethics and some of the history of bioethics in the United States. I learned the basics of legal analysis and got to learn more about the American health care system and legal system.

    "I really learned how to analyze cases and to think critically",
    "This course was great at covering a very wide range of topics in bioethics.

    "How to think legalistically, and about bioethics biggest questions.",
    "A better legal understanding of health care in this country and abroad.",
    "I learned how to work with information that was presented in a big lecture class. For the first time I was presented with material concerning the law.",
    "Incredibly well taught course that blends the ethical questions and legal questions that surround the human body and our rights.",
    "I believe I developed a basic understanding of the legal complications that could arise within physician-patient relationships as well as the rationale that the court uses to resolve them.",
    "Looking back on this class I realize that I learned a lot. We basically went through all the most controversial issues related to modern day medicine. In each case we would boil down exactly what made the issue so controversial and examine how the law handled it.",
    "I learned a lot about different topics in bioethics, both from the historical and legal perspective. I also learned a lot about the legal system and how the law works.",
    "I learned how advancements in medical technology (birth control, prolongation of life, assisted reproduction, etc.) have created legal and ethical problems, leading to the establishment of the modern field of bioethics. I now know a lot more about the current state of bioethics law in the United Statesespecially in the areas of health insurance, reproductive rights, assisted reproduction, and the right to refuse life-saving treatment. I also improved my understanding many important concepts from constitutional law (federalism, substantive due process rights, the penumbra, the equal protection clause, etc.) and learned how they apply to bioethics issues. Finally, thanks to my TA, I learned the general structure for taking notes on cases (Facts, Question, Holding, Reasoning) and how to write a legal analysis.",
    "Out of all of the classes that I took this semester, I felt as though the content of this course was the most applicable to the real world. Learning about the health insurance system in the United States and how the United States ranks compared to other countries with our health care was important; additionally, it was great to learn what fundamental rights regarding bioethics that humans have.",
    "This class has opened me to the enigma of bioethical issues and understand the legal justifications for moral bioethics. I learned much about the issues quite in depth, and these information can help me to form stances on specific issues.",
    "I learned about the law behind major issues in medicine and public health.",
    "I truly grasped legal language and information.",
    "An introduction to the legal and healthcare system in the U.S. and exposure to readings of court cases.",
    "I learned a lot about American law from this class. One of the most interesting skills I developed was a greater knowledge of Constitutional law, particularly 14th amendment due process analysis and how it affects so much of our lives and so many bioethics issues. I also gained a lot of knowledge about how laws are set and developed, and the history and changes of laws over time.",
    "Most interesting and important class I have taken at Yale. I actually learned things that will be relevant in my future life, which is not something I can say about many classes I've taken here. This is a must take!",
    "I learned how to examine medical related cases and analyze them ethically. I learned about different approaches to medical ethics and different important topics concerning the health rights of people.",
    "The state of health care (USA and globally). Laws regarding informed consent (patient and human research), organ donation, abortion, end-of-life care, physician-assisted suicide, and public health (preventing the spread of infectious diseases and encouraging healthy lives). Gray areas, such as \"what are parents, legally\" and \"what is death, legally\" - although less of a focus in teasing out these gray areas and seeing the reasoning behind judges' decisions than in other legal classes I have taken. I am okay with that - in a class focused on bioethics I would rather study the standards than the reasoning behind, although I hope that Latham's other philosophy-focused class does tease these ideas a bit more.",
    "Mad law stuff and public health stuff",
    "Basic understanding of issues and law regarding bioethics.",
    "I learned a lot of relevant information regarding medical\/bio related legislature and court rulings.",
    "This course taught me to synthesize themes in health care, and to take note of the trends that are present in countries today compared to several decades ago."

   "comments": [
    "Strengths is Professor Latham - he is an incredible lecturer and cares about the subject matter. The readings were also great if you had time to read them.",
    "I think the course was very well formatted, both in lecture and section. My only suggestion would be perhaps lecture slides to help follow along, but Professor Latham is a very good speaker.",
    "Very engaging lectures, super interesting topic, not a lot of work required overall. I think the readings were kinda boring, but I also didn't really do them and it was totally fine (I took it for a grade not credit\/D)",
    "Solid course, very interesting, seems like most of the important material that you need to know for the test is covered in section and not as much in lecture.",
    "Latham is a really good lecturer",
    "Good lectures and interesting topics",
    "Strengths: Latham's lectures are very interesting the course material itself is interesting my TA actually made section interesting Weaknesses: Grading is super subjective- if you have an easy TA you're set, but its virtually impossible to get an A in a super easy class when your TA is tough",
    "no one does the readings grades are sooooo subjective on midterms, and test how you write under time constraints more than test how much you actually know the material",
    "great lecture, latham is engaging",
    "Section should be made more of a priority. Grading breakdown was fine. PowerPoints could be effective.",
    "FANTASTIC lecture, very appropriate level of readings, interesting material. No need for improvement!",
    "I think the class could be smaller and the discussion sections could be more engaging.",
    "Extremely engaging, well streamlined.",
    "Its harder to get a good grade in the class because everyone writes the right answer but you have to go even more above and beyond.",
    "The strengths are the lectures. The sections were not productive at all, and I think it would have been nice to have participation\/ or other assignments included, instead of just 3 exams for a grade.",
    "Possibly a paper would have forced students to engage with the material more. But i truly loved this course, from lectures, to the readings, to sections and even the exams.",
    "The readings are very dense and not as relevant to the exam, so it would be more helpful to have more concentrated readings that are more relevant to the course material.",
    "Course material is really engaging and well laid out. Assignments are clear and simple to complete. One weakness is the slight vagueness (can occur) in how questions need to be answered (but this is a B+ \/ A- distinction).",
    "More pointed lectures, clearer outline for what is important to know for midterms and final",
    "The lectures were incredible - responsive to recent events while adequately covering historical background, engaging, and also personally relevant. Latham is one of the best lecturers I've had at Yale. That being said, there was definitely inconsistencies in the sections in terms of TF quality and structure. I felt like the reading responses added additional work with little benefit - 200 words on cases doesn't really help students engage with them more deeply, but might make them do the reading itself. I also DO NOT think that written, timed exams are the best way to test knowledge for this course or a students understanding of the cases, but am unsure of an alternative exam format given the number of students in the course.",
    "The course is amazing; please don't change it.",
    "It's a fantastic and captivating course. My only gripe is that Latham is a great storyteller who really draws out his lectures and emphasizes things through repetition, which can be a weakness in that it prevents exploring a variety of topics timewise. I sometimes wish we had covered more material in class.",
    "I really enjoyed this course! I learned a lot both in section and lecture.",
    "Strengths: well-organized by content. one less class than planned, which helped save my life.",
    "The lecture was very interesting, Professor Latham is a very engaging lecturer and the topics brought forth in class were, on the whole, very interesting. At some points, I feel that the legal jargon could have been explained a little better by the TAs, but that is not Professor Latham's fault.",
    "Professor Latham is an incredible lecturer -- I so appreciated the time he dedicated to making the lectures engaging and interesting!",
    "Overall, this was one of my favorite courses at Yale. I found the lecture style very engaging. I heard that grading was kind of subjective and varied a lot by TA last year, but I don't know how true that was; that's the only negative thing that I could think of.",
    "I went into this course with no legal knowledge, and it was still incredibly interesting and informative. I think the course does a really good job of condensing large issues into main points and you really leave the course with a better understanding of the law governing bioethics in America.",
    "The course is great, I have no complaints about the structure.",
    "Lectures were ok, TFs grading varies a lot. Could be better organized and more interesting readings incorporated.",
    "This course is really excellent - the lectures are interesting, albeit somewhat repetitive at times. I thought the material was very relevant and I learned a lot.",
    "There were no weaknesses and the strengths included the lecture and the weighting of the class assignments.",
    "Professor Latham is great lecturer and providers detailed content",
    "The strengths - good interdisciplinary focus, the professor was amazing Weaknesses - huge class size, not much interaction",
    "The lectures are incredible, and you learn so much just by going to class. It's amazing that you can learn so much while also having such a low workload. I have no suggestions for how the course could be improved - it was very well taught.",
    "Professor Latham's lectures were fantastically enjoyable and full of information. The pacing was spot on to help me both get a solid understanding of the material, but also not too repetitive. The more key concepts were explained clearly and emphasized, but supplementary material was constantly used to keep things interesting. A++",
    "Strengths: lectures were very engaging, professor was amazing speaker and kept us attentive, topics were interesting, fair grading and exam format Weaknesses: section wasn't that useful in my opinion",
    "I thought this course was great. The readings were a bit excessive; if there had been 20 pages assigned instead of 150 per week, I might have done some of them. There was also a good bit of discrepancy between TA grading.",
    "Lecture was very interesting. The exams were enjoyable to take (never thought I could say that about an exam!)",
    "This class is very accessible to people with no experience in bioethics\/law\/political science. Prof. Latham knows that most of his students do not have experience, as do the TAs, and that was very helpful.",
    "Professor Latham is INCREDIBLE! He is seriously the most intelligent, accessible, engaging professor I have ever had and he is the biggest strength of this class.",
    "Ideally, longer lectures and shorter discussion sections. Latham was amazing.",
    "Professor Latham is an amazing lecturer and you will learn a lot. If you come to class, you will find it engaging and really interesting!",
    "Very interesting lectures, topical essay questions, low workload - all in all, great course",
    "Lectures seem to inform what topics should be focused on in the readings. If you miss something in lecture it can be hard to figure out what to focus on in the readings.",
    "I thought Prof. Latham was an excellent lecturer and the class was paced well, but I wish that we had time to explore some of the subjects more deeply, either in section or by writing a research paper. Perhaps next year, one of the midterms or the final could be replaced with a paper, which would allow for deeper engagement with the material.",
    "More engagement with the readings. Was pretty frustrating that people could do well without doing any of the work. Also, the grading is messed up. Some section like Asahn's, got special treatment by being given power points and \"help\" right before the test about what the questions \"might\" be. Almost everyone in that section I talked to got an A, while most of the people in my section did not, which seems unlikely to happen by chance, Definitely was not equal treatment across sections. Brutal.",
    "Definitely a great lecture course! Learned a lot about really important topics. My only comment is that the assisted suicide\/ end of life units seemed really long and the assisted reproduction seemed kind of short. The course could be improved by having a better balance of topics. I also really didn't enjoy my TA, which prevented me from truly enjoying the course.",
    "Professor Latham is a wonderful, engaging lecturer and I really enjoyed the format of his lectures. The content of the course was all very interesting and thought-provoking. The major weakness of the course was how sections were conducted and the lack of uniformity across the sections. I understand that this is hard to achieve with such a large class size and so many different TFs, but it was frustrating to see how drastically different my experience was from other students. For example, my TF did not return our exams to us and only sent us our grades via email. Most other TFs handed back the exams which gave their students the opportunity to review their work and get feedback through written comments. My section received no such feedback, and that was an unfair disadvantage that I had going into future exams.",
    "Slides during lecture. It's very hard to follow what he was saying and often difficult to know what to take notes on cause he just talked without stopping.",
    "Section participation was not included in the grade, so a lot of students could have done very well in the class without doing the readings or any work which I didn't like Having done all the readings and participated in section a lot I would have preferred that my TA be able to consider that when grading us, considering much of the section came unprepared and didn't participate. Also, the final exam questions were the same ones given a few days prior to some athletes doing a make up exam which allowed them to be spread to a lot of other athletes who then had an advantage when going into the final, so I think the questions definitely should have been changed. Your grade on the exams also really depended on your TA; for instance, one of the TA's was friends with all the kids in his section so he just promised them all A's as long as they regurgitated what he told them to say on his section slides. Besides for that I really enjoyed this course, both the readings and the lectures, as it deals with really interesting material that is becoming more and more relevant now that Trump is president.",
    "Strengths Interesting material, well taught Weaknesses More emphasis on last couple of lectures would be great, issues outside of the book such as plastic surgery or something. Like more out there things would nicely compliment the strong basis the class already offers",
    "Very interesting material! Lectures were always enjoyable but not essential. Quality of instruction varies depending on TA though",
    "This is a great course. Super interesting, not too much work, I wouldn't change anything",
    "Strengths: Amazing lectures, fair exams Weaknesses: I wish the readings had been more applicable to the content of the course",
    "I have no complaints about this course. I think it was organized and taught very well. I found lectures to be extremely engaging and thought discussion sections augmented my understanding of the material efficiently.",
    "The first half of the class is fascinating. However, after the second midterm, the quality of the lectures really goes down. The last third of the class is spent discussing patents on end without many cases to really discuss. My biggest complaint is that some lectures are fascinating and great while others are largely dry and don't cover much material.",
    "I wish section were a review of the cases in the casebook, whose readings we did not cover in lecture. Discussions themselves during discussion section were a waste of time- I would have much rather gone over the readings.",
    "The class is extremely well structured, thanks to Professor Latham's extensive knowledge of the material. I greatly enjoyed both lecture and section, the latter of which provided a forum for students to delve more deeply into the topics explained in the former. The course textbook is extremely interesting; and I read it cover to cover! I am very grateful that the textbook and course material was so well integrated; everything covered in lecture was also discussed in the textbook, with additional insights from Professor Latham. This was also reflected in the exam material, which was intellectually challenging but clearly related to what we learned in class.",
    "I felt that this course was very informative and interesting. I always came out of this class thinking, \"wow, I learned something pretty interesting today.\"",
    "Professor Latham is amazing! This course has no weaknesses that I could identify.",
    "- Lectures are engaging - Workload is light and reading is optional but very interesting (in my opinion). Reading makes the lectures much more useful. - Only real work for this class comes during preparation for exams",
    "wonderful course! no weaknesses!",
    "I think there should be a paper instead of a second midterm. The tests are the only assessments and it is relatively doable to not do any of the reading and just study hard for the tests.",
    "I really liked this course the lectures were always engaging and covering super interesting materials. I liked the fact that there weren't slides, and the lectures consisted only of Professor Latham lecturing, because he is such a great speaker. I'm not sure how standardized the teaching and grading was among sections, so I think that could be improved.",
    "This topics covered in this class and the professor are two great strengths. The biggest weakness of this class is how big of a lecture it is. With the crazy number of students in the class, it is hard to be really engaged with the material. I could imagine this class being amazing as a larger seminar with ~50 people in it.",
    "wonderful class!",
    "The course is able to cover a wide range of bioethics topics. I would have been more interested to learn more about the field of bioethics with relation to artificial intelligence.",
    "The content was very interesting and the lectures were clear and engaging. Section did not have a clear agenda, and I feel that the section experience varied a lot by TF. Exams were straightforward and fair. There was a lot of reading, but it is definitely not necessary to do all of it.",
    "this course is AWESOME -- very interesting, incredibly low workload, easy exams. professor latham is awesome and the material is so interesting. no weaknesses!!",
    "The strengths of this course were the content of the material and the assessment structure. Weekly reading responses kept me up to date with the material and helped raise important questions before cram time. The exams were very fair. The only weakness is the number of students enrolled diluting the quality of discussion in sections, but I would NOT recommend limiting enrollment further.",
    "The professor was amazing, and the material engaging.",
    "Latham is a fantastic lecturer and the TAs are all very knowledgeable in terms of familiarity with the subject matter.",
    "Very rigid, easy structure to the course that encourages students to attend the lecture but doesn't put unnecessary stress on them",
    "Loved his class and the material",
    "PROS: -constantly interesting material -controversy was welcome CONS: -very large course, so not much interaction with Prof. Latham -material felt repetitive\/slow at times",
    "Very well taught lecture. Interesting topics. No real negatives apart from not having enough time to truly talk about the reasoning of the cases (as in debating them). This is not a fault of the course though, but because there is so much to cover, it's nearly impossible to have time to debate the cases.",
    "Having review sessions or uploading practice exams (or a grading rubric of a past exam) would be helpful.",
    "Great lecturer, good topic.",
    "The information covered in the course is very relevant and important. It is easy to relate to as a lot of bioethics topics are covered in the news now. I found a little bit of a cross over between this class and my ECON 110 class. However, the lectures were not productive and convoluted. My TA, Samantha Godwin, was not helpful in section and did not facilitate learning about the topic being covered. She also took an excessive amount of time to grade exams and never even returned them.",
    "Professor Latham was very engaging in lectures and always successfully integrated relevant topics in bioethics and law. I looked forward to lecture each week.",
    "Strength: Intriguing course material and the lectures were very interesting as well.",
    "Overall no weaknesses very good course",
    "Strengths: Great lectures and organization of sections for such a large class. My TF was available for feedback, and was extremely helpful. Weaknesses: N\/A",
    "Case studies are very interesting and the topics as well. Just beware of some ethic and moral dilemmas.",
    "This course was an excellent introduction to topics in bioethics. Professor Latham's lecture style was very engaging--I appreciated that he allowed students in a 500 person class to ask questions. To improve this course, I would ask that there is a bit more time spent towards ethics.",
    "This was my favorite course that I have taken at Yale.",
    "The strengths of the course are Prof Latham's lectures I was never bored for a minute in his lectures and absorbed so much. The readings were actually pretty interesting too (though I didn't complete them all) and definitely enriched my understanding of the law.",
    "Lectures are very interesting, and my section was particularly helpful in facilitating learning (but I had a really great TA). The cases are interesting to read and the exams asked us to synthesize a lot of information, which helped me to connect more concepts. However, the exams were also strangely worded, in that the questions felt like they came out of the blue. I studied really hard for the exams and felt like I had a strong grasp on the material, but I never felt like I could express that on the exams. I do not believe that my scores on the test truly reflect what I knew, and that made studying for\/taking each exam very frustrating and nerve-wracking. While lectures were interesting, it seemed like Professor Latham was teaching mostly from memory. He often stopped to go back and clarify a concept or introduce a term he should have mentioned before. This made it difficult for me to organize my notes, connect concepts, and study for exams.",
    "Professor does not post lecture notes so engagement is difficult.",
    "I think the only thing that could be improved is more standardization of grading across Teaching Assistants.",
    "The lectures are really interesting, but the readings are quite long.",
    "The professor of this course and the way that he lectures is very strong. I felt that I learned a lot in a clear and concise manner.",
    "Latham is an amazing lecturer - very engaging.",
    "The course material is very interesting, and the exams are fair.",
    "This course provides a solid introduction to many of the major bioethics issues that are currently facing American society, and it also helps students develop a basic understanding of legal reasoning. The lectures are interesting, engaging, and clear.",
    "Greater consistency between what the TA looked for on exams and what the professor emphasized in class.",
    "It was a great class! I don't have any complaints -- Pro. Latham was great and the course is extremely well-designed. Maybe having a mini research project about health law would have been interesting, and a great way to give students a way to personalize the course according to individual interests.",
    "I wish the class had focused a little more on the changing nature of jurisprudence like Constitutional Law does, rather than just looking at various bioethics issues and discussing the related case\/statutory law. I wish I'd gotten a chance to write an essay and develop my own thoughts; the class seemed to reward students who were good at re-iterating common talking points rather than thinking for themselves\/developing an in-depth viewpoint. Section was my best chance to think in-depth. Also the class is super gutty if you choose to make it so. I studied the book really hard and learned a lot but I doubt I did much better than students who studied the night before the tests without ever looking at the book.",
    "I loved learning about all the cases and the material was highly engaging. As a pre-med, I liked learning about a lot of these issues from the legal rather than medical perspective to get a different view and think about questions that I hadn't before",
    "I would say depending on the TA, sometimes there was not a lot of carry over from lecture to class. I don't think that has anything to do to necessarily with the quality of the section, but sometimes in class it seems as if what we hear in lecture versus what we are then tested on during exams are different. That is why I don't think lectures were as valuable as they could have been. Sections were sometimes useful, but if there was more structure involved then I feel it could have been more beneficial in terms of us students actually learning material versus debating and discussing different ways to approach topics.",
    "The lecture\/material is very interesting, the section is very engaging, and the workload is very minor. No clear weaknesses.",
    "I loved it. It included a clear outline of the law in various topics, which organized it in a way for me to follow it easily.",
    "This class is incredible. The topics are extremely interesting and Professor Latham is a fantastic instructor. I enjoyed the emphasis placed on case law in the middle portion of the course and appreciated that the exams asked us to evaluate various scenarios from a legal perspective. I can't think of any specific ways to improve this course.",
    "I didn't have any specific complaints about the class.",
    "Latham was an incredible professor. Material always felt interesting and relevant. I can honestly say this course has no weaknesses.",
    "I honestly don't think Dr. Latham could be any better. He is literally so smart, interesting, and a cool guy.",
    "This class should go over effective writing strategies at some point since every exam is writing essays. Many TAs don't clarify a specific writing style that should be used (although mine did). I also think that more feedback after the exams per individual would help a lot and allow students to be able to improve in very specific, clear cut ways.",
    "The current day relevance is a major strength of this course. Additionally it makes legal frameworks access and easy to understand.",
    "There is little assessment",
    "Very interesting material, lectures can be a little disorganized.",
    "Fantastic introduction to law.",
    "The course material is very interesting. I sometimes thought there were more interesting resources available as readings for some of the topics, though.",
    "Strengths were seminars and interesting lectures. Weakness was getting grades back too late.",
    "I thought It was awesome. No complaints!",
    "I wish the lectures were better organized, but Prof Latham was highly engaging nevertheless.",
    "Strengths: Prof Latham is a phenomenal professor and his lectures are so structured and interesting , sections",
    "This course is very interesting and the lecture are engaging. Grading is somewhat dependent on which TF you get.",
    "The grading amongst TAs varies. Also, I felt that the expectations for exams were not clearly laid out at the beginning, as most exam questions are broad and expect nearly every point mentioned on that topic to be discussed.",
    "Strengths: very well organized, clear lectures, interesting material, exams are well spaced out and grading system is clear from outset Weakness: would like to have more supplemental readings. I wasn't a big fan of the law book, but I know that's pretty central to the course",
    "Lectures were great and section was helpful. I think the readings were often posted late and not essential to the course. Maybe better and\/or shorter readings could be used and perhaps explained in lecture.",
    "Super interesting class, great lectures and content. It would be more helpful if the sections and TAs were more cohesive. I feel like each week from friends different TAs would teach or debate different things and when it came time to the exams each TA graded a little bit differently.",
    "Strengths: 1. This course does a fantastic job of doing what it says on the tin, which is providing an overview of major issues in both bioethics and law. The material is riveting and the lectures were almost always compelling. 2. The readings were fascinating, though I understand not everyone will enjoy reading law cases. Weaknesses: 1. Somewhat arbitrary grading. There didn't seem to be a standardized rubric shared between TAs for determining grades, which meant your performance in the course was very much dependent on your TA's preferences\/style of grading. More so, there weren't always clear guidelines as to what determined, say, a B+ vs. an A- in your grades, which could be stressful. If you are persistent in understanding what your TA is looking for in a good essay response, though, you should be fine. 2. Excessive reading. This was only a minor issue and it's definitely not unique to this course, but the professor assigned way too much reading i.e. basically the whole casebook. This wasn't much of a problem because the important cases were whichever ones were mentioned in lecture, so if you had no time you'd know what you needed to read, but more doable reading would have been appreciated.",
    "This course is taught in engaging lectures but the material is simply not it taught at a deep or interesting level.",
    "Strengths: The lectures are fun and easy to follow. Also, there isn't too much reading you have to do for the class. I really did feel like I learned a lot about bioethics. Weaknesses: It's a very large lecture classroom with little interaction from the students. Also, sections were useless.",
    "The strength of the course is the light workload and breadth of the course topics covered. The weakness of the course is that the experience depends on your TA. Not all TAs were good or put in the time to make discussion sections an important part of the course. Another weakness of the course was that there seemed to be no standardized procedure for exam preparation or grading. Some TAs went above and beyond providing their students with multiple review sessions, extensive powerpoint slides, and breakdowns of how to tackle practice exam questions. Other TAs didn't even bother doing a review in section. Another issue was grading. They claim that TAs exchange exams to cross-grade, but I find that hard to believe. If that was the case then why do some sections hand out A grades to everyone and other sections seem to give students mostly B and B- grades. Where is the standardization????",
    "I think the lectures were incredibly interesting and and the readings were relevant and intriguing as well.",
    "It's not a crazy amount of work but gives a good, engaging overview of bioethics.",
    "Boring reading, having just one textbook.",
    "It is extremely interesting and current, however a weakness could be that I felt that my experience was better or more interesting as a result of my TF.",
    "The greatest strength of this course was clearly the lecturer. Even though the material was highly interesting and relevant, the reason for which so many people enjoyed this course is because the professor is such an engaging lecturer.",
    "Strengths - incredible lectures, keep you engaged throughout. Weaknesses - I would really have enjoyed writing a paper for the class.",
    "I think that the course offers an abundance of intriguing information but could use some visual aids to facilitate the students' absorption\/comprehension of the material.",
    "Strength is that the subject matter is interesting and that the course is taught in an organized fashion. Prof. Latham is an excellent lecturer. The perfect 5th class.",
    "I think the biggest strength of the course was that the lectures were extremely engaging, regardless of the topic. I also liked that even though the class was focused on the law side of bioethics, we didn't exclusively focus on that, and also talked about the historical background and contemporary issues.",
    "The lectures are excellent Prof. Latham is entertaining, knowledgeable, and easy to follow. Just by listening to him, I got a better sense of how the American legal system works. The readings are also very interesting, albeit long. I generally skimmed them, but took detailed notes on each case in the textbook (which I thought were the most interesting parts). Pretty much everyone I know who took the class did the same thing. I would recommend cutting down on the reading, but making clear that it must be done carefully and thoroughly. Highlight important readings and cases that you expect every student to know inside and out. I can sense that Prof. Latham wants to cut down on the perception that this is a gut class, and has tried to do that by limiting the number of A and A- grades given on the exams. I dont think thats the way to go. The exams were fairly easy, so this just resulted in nitpicky grading. Instead, I would convert the weekly reading responses into legitimate assignments: 1-2 page graded essays that refer to the source material. The essay questions should be standardized across the class and should emphasize important topics and cases from the reading. Allow students to drop the lowest 1-2, but no more. Among other things, you can the reading responses to teach students how they are expected to write a legal analysis (like the ones we wrote for the second exams). Then, the exams can be made a little bit more challenging (but dont make them longer! Its already a good test of how fast you can write). Perhaps they should include one essay part, and one part that simply tests students knowledge of the relevant concepts and cases. Also, one final suggestion: I would recommend eliminating the lectures where Prof. Latham talks about biology (i.e. the nucleus is like the yolk and the cytoplasm is like the egg white). I understand that some students might not have the necessary background, but it would be better to assign that as reading. Its clear that Prof. Latham has a lot of legal knowledge, and the best lectures were the ones that were centered around the law.",
    "Would benefit from having a bigger chalkboard\/brighter chalk, because a lot of the time it was hard to see what was on the board.",
    "I loved the lectures. They were always very interesting. I think the grading could be made more uniform.",
    "It is a great course, very interesting with a very helpful and engaged professor.",
    "Professor Latham was very good at explaining concepts, structuring the course and his lectures were very straightforward. The topics were really interesting and touched on a range of issues that still matter today.",
    "One major weakness is that the class completely changes based on the TA you have. TAs differ IMMENSELY in how harshly they grade. Some give out mainly As and others give out mainly Bs. Some give out helpful study materials and others do not.",
    "This course is fantastic. Its strengths are in the way material is presented, as a kind of story of the development of law around a particular issue (e.g. abortion law) through chronological explanation of relevant cases. Also, it is strong simply because the subject matter is fascinating, Professor Latham is excellent and my TA was great.",
    "Amazing course! Lectures were fantastic and covered really interesting issues. Section could have been better, but I think that was just my TF. Exams were interesting and fair.",
    "This course was really amazing and I enjoyed it very much. This class really tuned in on certain rights of people, some more controversial than others. This course also involved current events, mainly occurring in the US, but also approaches made by other countries. This course interrelated medicine and ethics in a very strong manner.",
    "Efficiently taught, although things got a little muddled or less organized in the last units of the class (starting after physician-assisted suicide). Presented intriguing ideas. I personally believed that going to lecture was worth it to hear interesting concepts and discussion. A good TA is a boon and makes section worth going to - I can't speak for a bad TA, but am not certain that the class is easy with one. Would have appreciated an organized list of cases and standards to know - I am sure the TAs were told what to cover but sometimes seemed up to TA discretion and I am not sure if that is good (given that they are the ones grading our exams and knowledge there isn't anything wrong with it, but I would like to know as much as possible and feared missing out on knowledge other TAs might be teaching).",
    "Chill",
    "Extremely interesting content and very helpful sections.",
    "One of the best laid out lecture-based classes. Though talking to some other students, a lot of people thought a more paper instead of one of the midterms would be a way to add depth to the class.",
    "The biggest strength of the class is the folksy teaching style that Professor Latham has in which each class is basically him talking to us, not even really lecturing, about whatever the topic is. For some reason, I felt like I learned more because of that. In addition, the readings are really awesome, and the cases have really interesting commentaries and outcomes that make it not a huge chore to do class readings. One of the weaknesses of the class though is how some of the science around reproductive techniques and other areas of bioethics was a little lackluster and incomplete. However, this was not a huge issue since it is not a science class."

   "comments": [
    "yes",
    "Yes! It is a great course that will expose you and make you think about things relevant to your health in the United States. Being pre-med, it was really interesting to see cases and the state of bioethics, as it will affect me in the future I am sure.",
    "Yes, definitely. You think about a lot of controversial, yet interesting topics that will play an important role in law and politics in the future.",
    "Oh for sure. It may be a gut, but it's still a really great course. One of the best I have taken at Yale. Latham is a great lecturer.",
    "Yes I would - take this class if you want to familiarize yourself with basic law and learn about some interesting cases that have shaped issues such as reproductive rights, right to die, and organ donation.",
    "recommend- lectures are interesting and the class doesn't require much work as long as you attend lecture",
    "Great 5th class. No essays, just come to class, learn the case names and importance and take the tests. It's easy and you learn about an interesting and important topic.",
    "Yeah in terms of workload it is a gut. There is no need to do the readings, and minimal studying the night before the exam is good enough for you to roll the dice and hope your TA is an easy grader. Mine is harsh, so I could get a B+ or A- I find the lectures and sections very interesting, and have learned a lot of interesting stuff. I personally enjoyed this class, and liked taking it. I would suggest this as a perfect 5th credit.",
    "definitely. its super interesting its a gut, but not an easy A depending on your TA",
    "it's one of the most popular classes at this school for a reason",
    "This course is a fantastic intro to important issues in bioethics. Topics ranged from reproductive rights to end of life care to genetic patent law, and Prof. Latham was incredibly skilled at presenting each topic in a relatively unbiased manner that respects each side of an issue. The workload is extremely light, only a weekly reading response that's not even graded, and you can miss two of them for free. This class is relevant no matter what your major is, whether you're pre-med or as far-removed from STEM as possible. Given the new administration and the uncertain future of healthcare in America, it's even more important to take classes like this and understand exactly how the American healthcare system works. Definitely would recommend!",
    "This class was fine; easy breezy. The workload was manageable-- 2 midterms and a final (with a section that who knows what it counted for). Latham was an interesting guy, but beware- no PowerPoints. Was never stressed about grades but it's not as gutty as it seems. B+ on everything kind of class.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. I didn't just learn about bioethics, I also learned a lot about the state of US health care, which is especially interesting at this point in time.",
    "TAKE THE CLASS. Professor Latham is a fantastic lecturer with a phenomenal understanding of the material and a great sense of humor. The readings lined up exactly with what we discussed in class (SO READ THEM) and helped tie up any loose ends that one may have had in the rush that comes with a 50 minute lecture. Latham always is approachable after and DURING lecture. TFs great as well.",
    "Yes i would totally recommend this course. If you are pre-med or if you are thinking about studying public health, this is an awesome start up course. It was interesting and the professor is amazing at lecturing. He is super chill and really enthusiastic about what he is teaching. It is actually fun going to lecture.",
    "I'd highly recommend this. Prof. Latham is a really engaging lecturer, and the topics are very relevant and interesting.",
    "Great course, great credit\/d",
    "The class and the lectures are interesting but sections are badly organised and there's not a lot of rooming for forming one's own opinion on the topics",
    "Definitely interesting",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student, but probably as a credit d fail class. I did not like the sections at all, and the exams are worth a lot which can be difficult to do well in.",
    "Yes!! True gut so take it if you need an easy 5th class that is not a waste of your time.",
    "Bioethics is a good 5th credit. It is pretty interesting and does not require a lot of work. The course offers a nice overview of current bioethics questions (organ market, surrogacy, anonymity in sperm donation, etc.) and of related policy debates (legal definition of parenthood in the age of IVF techniques, legal definition of death, etc.). Prof. Latham is very engaging and a great lecturer. The course is mostly about memorizing facts, which makes the class less interesting as it sounds. You won't be doing much legal reasoning, unfortunately!",
    "I would! It is a very good class",
    "A must take for any student at Yale if you have an interest in basic law or ethics.",
    "If you ar interested in polysci, go for it! If you've never taken a polysci class, it will be a bit more difficult than expected most likely.",
    "Take this course! Really interesting course if you're a STEM major looking for an extra credit. Section requires minimal preparation, thus the only real work is studying before each midterm and the final. Exams were very straightforward for the most part, all they involve is memorizing important cases and applying them. Professor is a great lecturer, but there are no slides so make sure you come to class every day. Also, you don't really need the textbook to be successful in the course. I just made case briefs for important cases mentioned in class and that was sufficient.",
    "100%. I would advise them to shop TF sections, but they definitely should take it. That being said, the content of this course can be pretty personal and, at times, difficult. But the best courses ought to do that - make you consider your own approach to decisions and those of people around you.",
    "I absolutely loved this class! Stephen Latham is a greta lecturer, and the course material was very interesting.",
    "A chill class that's a must take for pre-meds. Prof. Latham makes this clear at the first lecture, but note that this is NOT an ethics course -- it is rather a history of American healthcare policy\/law, and how courts have formulated decisions regarding bioethical issues. The precedents you learn about are essential if you're planning on entering medicine one day, and although you'll probably learn about the relevant law in med school anyway, it's nice to be able to explore them in more detail. It's also a great class to take Credit\/D\/F, since the workload is super light and it's basically impossible to fail if you show up to class.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. I think it can be interesting to both STEM and humanities majors because it focuses on both the scientific side of the law but also the human, more political side of the law as well.",
    "Absolutely take this class! Even if there are topics that you disagree with or you think are morally dubious, you can explain it away using the law that you learn, to keep it more impersonal.",
    "Definitely! Great chance to learn what the actual law is for a lot of controversial issues.",
    "I would recommend this course as Professor Latham is wonderful, his lectures were always clear and relatively easy to follow. I think that students should be careful as to who they choose as their TA, however, because some TAs are not nearly as helpful as others.",
    "Yes! I especially recommend if you are taking it Credit\/D. It is hard to get an A in the class, but super chill to get B\/B+. If you take it Credit\/D, all you have to do is go to lecture sometimes and study a bit to pass.",
    "Not an overly- challenging class. Definitely learned a lot of interesting information. Light workload.",
    "Yeah, it's a good and not difficult course. Professor Latham is an interesting dreamy dad lecturer who'll keep you pretty engaged.",
    "Definitely, very interesting.",
    "Really interesting information and not a lot of work - overall a really great class!",
    "Yes -- the topics covered by the course are fascinating and relevant but won't add an incredible amount of work to your current course load.",
    "YES!",
    "Yes! If you are at all interested in medical ethics or how ethics is shaping the scientific field, take this class!",
    "Would definitely recommend. The grading may be a bit hard at times, but for a good survey of how bioethical issues are treated by the law, this is the place to go. There's guaranteed to be at least one topic that'll pull you in deeply, and that'll really allow you to appreciate the difficulty of legal work in this area.",
    "I would definitely recommend Bioethics and Law to another student. The material was fascinating, the lectures and sections were engaging, and all of the concepts taught are highly relevant to everyday life regardless of your major or professional aspirations.",
    "Definitely - most people know that Bioethics is a class to take at Yale.",
    "Yes! Good 5th class or class to take Cr\/D.",
    "I would. It is a nice large lecture in which you still learn a lot.",
    "Absolutely take this course if you're interested in the medical field (or other related fields) and want to get a better grasp of what the legal realities of medicine are. This class should appeal to anyone with any interest in human rights, however.",
    "Definitely, take this class if you are at all interested in law. If not, the bioethics conversations will keep you interested throughout.",
    "I loved this course. It's one of my favorite classes at Yale. The material was super interesting.",
    "It's a great social science class to take if it is not going towards your major. Latham is a very engaging lecturer and I think it's one of those classes that teach you information that will be useful or handy to have in your back pocket in the future.",
    "If you are interested in law I would recommend this course",
    "Yes, especially if you are interested in studying the law",
    "I absolutely recommend this course! You will learn a lot about some really interesting and important topics, and somehow it's very low workload at the same time.",
    "Very interesting material and great lecture. Definitely need to study for midterms and finals but they're not bad if you do. Beware of bad TAs.",
    "Take this class if you can ever fit it in! I didn't even need this class to graduate, but I am so glad I had it. Professor Latham's lectures were fantastically enjoyable and full of information. The pacing was spot on to give both a solid understanding of the material, but was not too repetitive. The key concepts were explained clearly and emphasized, but supplementary material was constantly used to keep things interesting. The casebook is required reading, but if you are careful to take note of all the cases that are covered in class and section, you can also get the same information online for free. The casebook is helpful because the cases in it are summarizes of just the most important parts.",
    "Yes, interesting course that raises important questions. Lower workload but still very engaging.",
    "Yes! A must take for every Yalie! You will learn so much about ethical issues and start to question things about human life and advancement.",
    "Yes! Go to lecture!!! I didn't do any of the readings because they were long and deathly boring, but lecture was engaging and fun and I learned so much that I can't believe no one had told me before. There should be more courses, or required courses, or something, that teach you actual useful information for being a good citizen of the world. Finding a good TA is also key.",
    "Definitely take it, even if you have never studied law before! Incredible course",
    "TAKE THIS COURSE! Professor Latham is INCREDIBLE! He is seriously the most intelligent, accessible, engaging professor I have ever had and he is the biggest strength of this class.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student because it covered very relevant and interesting topics. Anyone who wants to learn more about controversial ideas and learn about the history\/law surrounding these topics should take this course. Latham is very engaging, makes lectures very fun. You don't technically have to attend the lectures, but I would suggest you do because Latham is one of my favorite lecturers at Yale. Highly recommend!",
    "Absolutely take this class if you can. I know everyone says it, but it's actually a class that you will gain so much from. Somehow Professor Latham is able to stand up and teach twice a week without slides and be the most interest, compelling lecturer I've had at Yale. While grading seems to depend pretty strongly on your TA (so maybe start it Credit\/D), all of the TAs are brilliant and helpful.",
    "Take bioethics! A great Yale class that teaches you a lot about the basics of the us legal and healthcare system.",
    "Absolutely: TAKE THIS CLASS!!!",
    "Yes",
    "I would recommend PLSC 257 to anyone who is planning on using any aspect of the US healthcare system. Also, I think it is really important for pre-med students to take this class.",
    "Not really, I mean it is a gut in the way that there's no work. However, it is pretty hard to get a flat A. If you are trying to do no work but get a A- B+ B, take it. If you want an A, do a but more work in a more interesting seminar.",
    "Definitely! The lectures are great!",
    "Yes, but only if you have a good TF. Professor Latham is amazing and you will learn a lot from him, but your experience in the class and the grades you receive will be largely related to who your TF is.",
    "It really depends on your TA. My TA was great, but some of my friends were not as lucky.",
    "Yes! Super interesting course and Latham is a great professor.",
    "TAKE THIS",
    "YES, VERY INTERESTING VERY EASY",
    "Yes, this is a must-take class with fairly low workload.",
    "Absolutely. The course i engaging and not too much of a workload.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to anyone because you learn about a lot of topical issues. Everyone should be informed about the American legal system and laws concerning things like abortion, public health, and end of life care. This is a great 5th course as long as you have the right TA. I'd start the course Credit D and then see how you do after the first exam.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course. Professor Latham is an exceptionally skilled lecturer and the material is relevant, important and interesting too!",
    "Yes! These are very pertinent and relevant questions circulating around society currently. It was great to learn more about healthcare in the United States and other legal questions. The lectures are largely interesting and the material is easy to understand and remember.",
    "Excellent and low workload.",
    "Absolutely take this course. If you are interested in law, current events, social issues, or bioethics specifically, you will love the class.",
    "This class is really interesting and not very work-intensive. Definitely an enjoyable and illuminating experience.",
    "HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. I'm a history major with some reservations about taking the course (mainly because I wasn't sure if I'd be interested), but I WAS HOOKED. The workload is super chill (midterm, final, and some short reading responses for section) and the readings are basically optional. Midterm and final are both very fair. Professor Latham is very clear and funny, and I always learned something new and interesting in each lecture. TFs are all solid, from my understanding. Excellent course.",
    "If interested, go to the first lecture. Thinking back, it's a fairly good representation of Prof. Latham's teaching style.",
    "Absolutely - I learned so much over the course of the semester. After every class I felt much more knowledgeable about several topics that face American bioethics and health care law today.",
    "Yes!!",
    "I definitely would. It will always be relative to current events and you will feel so well informed.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course very manageable workload and super interesting material! Every lecture was engaging and practical, and Prof Latham is great.",
    "Yes, this is a great course! Take it.",
    "Yes! This course is the perfect balance of workload and material - you feel infinitely more knowledgeable about bioethics after every class. The topics covered are ones that are popularly debated in American politics and law.",
    "I would definitely recommend taking this class; the material is very interesting and the lectures are always very engaging and informative.",
    "Yes!",
    "YES 100% recommend. the material is very interesting, makes going to class and studying for the exams much easier. professor latham is awesome, very though provoking issues discussed. the workload is very low, with only 2 midterms (non cumulative) and 1 cumulative final. very manageable! definitely recommend.",
    "Yes. Take this course if you are interested in healthcare or law or current events. Also take this course if you are just looking for a great professor who knows a lot about interesting stuff.",
    "Yes, really interesting class. A Yale classic. Latham is a fantastic lecturer",
    "I have already recommended this class. It is one of the best classes I have taken while at Yale, the professor is the best lecturer I have had; he is able to present all material, even uninteresting legal background, in an engaging way. He was amazing.",
    "Anyone who pursues medicine should take this course to understand the legal and ethical issues that arise in any healthcare profession.",
    "Very easy-going class that teaches you a lot as long as you're willing to engage with the class. It's valuable knowledge for anyone, regardless of what you're studying.",
    "Yes absolutely. His is my first law class and I feel like I learned so much about ethics and problems facing medical community today",
    "Yes. Interesting and fun content.",
    "Yes.",
    "Definitely. Very interesting topics and a good professor.",
    "very interesting and relevant, easy to follow and understand, great professor",
    "yes",
    "Take this course. For sure. No regrets at all; probably my favorite course at yale so far",
    "I would absolutely recommend everyone to take this class. It's an incredible class that definitely changed my viewpoints on many controversial topics that often pop up in the news. I've always been aiming for med school, but this one class is seriously making me consider going to law school.",
    "The perfect fifth classinteresting lectures with a very manageable workload and intuitive midterms.",
    "Yes, good survey bioethics\/law course with not much work (2 midterms and a final).",
    "Absolutely MUST TAKE !!!!",
    "Would recommend - take it! It gave me a new perspective on the complexity of bioethics issues.",
    "I would recommend this course, but there are many strengths and weaknesses. It is easier to take this course if you know how it is run and what you are getting into.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student! The course content was very interesting and had relevance to current events.",
    "I would. It is useful material",
    "Yes, this course is great for students who may not have a strong background in PLSC or related fields. It is also taught at a fair but challenging pace that requires you to keep up with the material.",
    "Yes. I think learning the basics of American law and healthcare systems are essential. It is also interesting and not too hard.",
    "I would definitely recommend this excellent course. Professor Latham is very engaging, and the topics covered in this course encourages you to think and evaluate critically.",
    "Absolutely take this course - as Senior taking it my last spring semester, this was really a high note to end my Yale courses on.",
    "Yes! Take this course! You learn really important and relevant material that is unique to this type of course. The lectures are fascinating and I even enjoyed reading the textbook.",
    "Take this class! It's applicable to everyone and so well taught!",
    "Yes, it's an important field to study - the material covered is fascinating and very relevant.",
    "Fantastic course. Really well-organized, good range of material, and Latham is a truly great lecturer.",
    "Absolutely! This is a course I think everyone at Yale should take. It's incredibly interesting and not too much work, you really can't lose.",
    "Not sure I'd recommend. I came into the course thinking it would be a less-stressful credit with interesting material. I was right about the material, but not about the rest of the class. The exams are (as many students have stated before) tricky in a way that may guarantee you will not get an A, even if you study hard and pay attention in class. I worked very hard to prepare for the exams, but the questions always felt like they came out of the blue, and were oddly-worded. I feel very strongly that my scores on the exams did not reflect how much I knew. This also had something to do with the timing--the two essay questions on the midterm are pretty broad and you need to move fast to answer them in 50 minutes. Also, I think the quality of your experience would vary widely by your TA. I was lucky, because mine was awesome. But I had a friend who didn't even receive his second midterm grade before he took the final (luckily for him, he wasn't considering whether he was going to credit\/D the class or that would've been a struggle). While I really enjoyed the material, and loved my TA and section (which was surprisingly interesting and helpful), if I were to decide again I might end up taking a different class. You can find easier\/less stressful courses to round out your semester somewhere else.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to any and every Yale student. Regardless of what you are studying, you learn information that is important in everyone's everyday lives. The workload\/difficulty are not too challenging, which makes the course relatively stress-free and much more enjoyable. Lectures are interesting and engaging, despite being so large.",
    "Yes; but beware of the exams they are quite challenging.",
    "Take it. Not only was it one of the most interesting classes I've taken at Yale but this class works extremely well as a fifth class. There's two midterms and a final which are all a series of essays. It's a lot of memorization and I got more out of section than lecture. Your experience in the class still hinges on who your TA is but I've heard nothing but good things this year. The class tackles end of life care, reproductive rights, healthcare, ownership of the body, informed consent, human test subjects, vaccinations and more. Latham keeps it topical to what's going on in the news and I've come out of knowing so much more about healthcare, the law, and the history of this country.",
    "I would recommend this course because it teaches you about the U.S. legal system and healthcare and will bring light to things that any citizen should know but most do now. It does this in a way that is clear and easy to understand.",
    "Yes I would recommend this course to other students. It was very interesting and cool to learn about, and it was not too much work.",
    "PLSC 257 is a great course about bioethical history in the United States. The material is fascinating, and the professor is very engaging.",
    "I'm not sure. For students who don't know a lot about how to write about law, it can be kind of harsh in terms of grading and generally daunting",
    "This is a wonderful introduction to a variety of important bioethics issues and how they have been treated by the American legal system. It's an important course for anyone interested in medicine or law, and really for anyone who wants to be an informed, engaged citizen at a time when biotechnology is rapidly shaping our society.",
    "Great class, definitely gutty. Get a good TA and you won't even have to do any of the reading.",
    "Yes, take it! Steven Latham is terrific, and the course is extremely organized and well-designed. The workload is very manageable (2 exams + final, and weekly reading response) and you get to have a very approachable and interesting overview of American healthcare and healthcare law. Every single class was super interesting.",
    "Yeah, great class. The professor is great, the subject material is interesting, and it's only a lot of work if you choose to do all the assigned reading.",
    "Yes good lecture course, interesting with not too much work",
    "I would. For those interested in bioethics and\/or law, this would be an interesting course to begin learning about different cases, or for someone more experienced in Constitutional Law, to have them learn about the history behind an area that is not discussed in depth very often.",
    "Excellent course, I would highly recommend it for anyone at Yale. The material is easy to understand but at the same time engaging and interesting. The lecture is only 50 minutes and interesting (until the last few chapters\/units), the the section is enjoyable, and there are no papers.",
    "Yes, it's a fun and relatively easy lecture class. Aside from that, it is a very interesting class.",
    "I would absolutely take this class. It is extremely interesting, and you get to discuss a lot of ethical questions in the medical field that you may not have thought about before. It is an extremely low workload two midterms and a final but is one of those classes that is enjoyable every lecture. Professor Latham is very organized and speaks clearly and includes interesting facts so that class doesn't get boring. This is one of those rare courses that doesn't require a ton of work but is still really interesting.",
    "A fascinating intro course into the complexities of public health law. The lectures were always engaging, even if Professor Latham occasionally let his political views get the best of his instruction of the material. Though you could still do well without doing the readings or even attending lecture, I would highly recommend doing both to get the most out of it. Both are incredibly informative and interesting, so it shouldn't be too hard anyway! Definitely recommend this class!",
    "One of the best courses at Yale! Definitely recommend.",
    "Yes amazin class",
    "Yes",
    "This class was really interesting. I didn't know anything about the subject before taking this class so I learned a lot but it was still manageable for a non political science major. I would definitely recommend.",
    "Yes I literally tell everyone to take this course.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course because it focuses on issues that are extremely important in our current world that other classes don't necessarily deal with. These topics are great to know about in conversation and in developing opinions of possible government policies and actions. The workload is also very light, so this allows you to take the class without interfering with the rest of your schedule and it allows you to think more deeply about the material without just worrying about what's on the surface and your grade.",
    "This course is interesting and relevant and the workload is reasonable, so I would recommend.",
    "Good class, interesting material, lots of learning potential.",
    "Absolutely.",
    "Definitely take the class! Professor Latham was a great lecturer and really engaged in the issue.",
    "Yes, very useful information about the bioethics world.",
    "Yes it was amazing! Not much work and so rewarding.",
    "Absolutely- the class taught me how to think in a legal framework.",
    "YES plz youll learn so much and will have so many interesting topics and controversials issues to debate over dinner",
    "Yes, really interesting course without too much work.",
    "Definitely.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. The material is so interesting and you really want to go to lecture. It is not necessary to do a lot of work outside of class.",
    "Interesting lectures and not too difficult",
    "Yes, this was one of my favorite classes.",
    "It's easy. It's fun. And it covers important concepts that you should probably know to be a better citizen. Take it. The readings seem like a lot but really they are not.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. It doesn't matter if you're a bio major, pre-med, interested in ethics, etc... Everyone has something to gain from this course because so many of the issues we touch on are so relevant to everyday life in the 21st century. You not only get to explore issues about bioethics, but also get a great intro into American law. Professor Latham is incredibly clear and well organized, which makes lecture a really enjoyable experience. Take this class.",
    "I definitely would recommend this course to another student, especially if you have an interest in law. It was easily one of the best courses I've taken at Yale.",
    "This is a great class. With only three exams and section attendance counting to your grade it might be considered a \"gut,\" but if so it's by far the best gut I've had at Yale. Most of those type of classes are easy to do well in but are ultimately boring and devoid of much educational value. Not this class, which features utterly fascinating course material, compelling lectures that bring out the best of said material, and readings that pose thoughtful and challenging questions. In some ways Bioethics and Law is the ideal gut: you don't work too much but if you at least consistently attend lecture you'll get a ton out of the course. Now, that being said, grading here can be deceptively hard. If you just do some quick studying the day before the exam and go to lectures on a semi-regular basis, you can probably get by with a B, and with a little more work a B+ or A-. But to get to that A you'll need to put in a respectable amount of work understanding the lectures and the relevant readings and really internalizing that information in a manner that goes beyond rote memorization. Ultimately I'd say this is a good thing, though, because the material is so fascinating that I didn't mind immersing myself in it. Great stuff. (Also, not the class focuses more on technical law than the moral questions raised by these bioethics questions, which don't get as much spotlight, though they are discussed. I found the focus on law fascinating so I didn't mind, but others might). Professor Latham gave lectures that were consistently illuminating and entertaining. While they weren't necessarily always mind-blowing or jaw-dropping, they were always well-structured and were almost never mundane\/boring. Professor Latham managed to break down the massive and dense field of bioethics law into something not only easy to understand, but fun to learn and highly memorable. I have no complaints at all about Professor Latham's teaching style, which made note-taking easy and learning fun. My TA, Lisa Wang, was fantastic and really dedicated to helping you learn; she was, in other words, a TA who really cared about your success. Take it with her if she's still teaching it. Overall a great course--take it if you get the chance.",
    "If you know the basics of law surrounding deeply politicized issues, this class is not an wngaging exploration of those issues. If you are interested in them and want a gut, this class is fine. And if you don't know no way the basics and want to o, this class is going great.",
    "This course is not needed for my major, but it seemed interesting. I would definitely recommend this course to anyone, even if they are not initially interested in bioethics. Professor Latham does a great job of making the lectures interesting.",
    "Yes, take this course before you graduate Yale!",
    "Yes, absolutely. The course was thought provoking and really, really interesting.",
    "Yes.",
    "Yes! Definitely take this course. It doesn't matter what discipline this is interesting and relevant information for someone in any major. This class teaches many things that should be fundamental to being a well informed citizen.",
    "It was amazing.",
    "I would absolutely reccomend this course because it is interesting no matter what field you want to go into and it provides you with valuable knowledge that one can use not only for class but everyday.",
    "I would recommend this course to any other student looking for a course with a low workload, but with material that is objectively interesting to all students.",
    "Take it! It lives up to its reputation of being a low workload yet super engaging and interesting class. Professor Latham's lectures are great and the exams are very fair. It's also somehow fun to learn about some laws, cases or medical conditions. I'd really recommend taking this class!",
    "Close your eyes and take the course. You don't even need to shop it. It's fascinating and surprisingly valuable knowledge to have.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course because it sheds light onto the policy side of medicine, which is often overshadowed by the academia, especially in undergraduate years.",
    "This is the perfect 5th class. Interesting subject matter, well taught and a very reasonable course load.",
    "I would recommend this class to another student. It was a great way to learn about different topics in bioethics, many of which are relevant to one's own life.",
    "This class really should be called The Law of Bioethics because while ethics and biology surface occasionally, it is centered around the law. Prof. Latham is a very entertaining lecturer, and he has a ton of legal knowledge. He also gives a couple of lectures on biology\/ethics (assisted reproduction, abortion ethics, etc.) but you can tell hes a little out of his element on those topics. Youll learn a lot about how the American legal system works, and how that applies to the healthcare system we have today. The reading is also really interesting, albeit long. I would suggest skimming most of it, and reading the cases very carefully (along with certain other important essays, such as the five types of healthcare systems, the three models of public health, etc.) I know this class has a reputation as a gut course, and in the sense that there isnt a lot of work, that is true. The reading responses are very easy, there are no essays, and it doesnt take that much time (1-2 days) to study for exams. However, the professor doesnt want to give out too many As, and therefore the grading for the exams can be very nitpicky, and its not really an easy A (not that it should be). Overall, I would recommend it, but thats something you should keep in mind if you are highly focused on your GPA.",
    "I loved this class and think that if you have the opportunity to take this class, definitely take it. Professor Latham is a great lecturer and I learned a lot from this course that I will be able to use in the future.",
    "I definitely would recommend this class to another student if they are interested in not only bioethicsl issues but also in the law in general. This class offers a good introduction to the basics of the American legal system.",
    "Interesting class on bioethics with not a lot of work. Weekly readings and then essay-style midterms and final. We discussed organ donation, informed consent, redefining death, incompetence, public health, reproductive rights, physician assisted suicide, right to die and many important cases. It was cool learning a lot of the cases, but to me this class feels like a lot of stuff you can learn by reading a bunch of Atlantic articles on the topic. Good fifth class though. Discussion sections were interesting.",
    "It is an easy B+\/A- or a good credit\/d class. I would recommend to another student if you're more interested in the law aspect of bioethics and law. The lectures are very interesting.",
    "Really really good and very minimal work, although it seems like the amount of work week to week depends drastically on the TF that you get. I didn't really do the readings (there is a PDF available online, but it's formatted terribly), so it was basically a 3 hour a week class (two lectures and section), with a night before each exam spent reviewing. Tests were very doable, and it was cool to learn about things like insurance and finally understand how those things work.",
    "Yes, this course is amazing! You learn so much about the history of bioethics and the current law surrounding these issues. Dr. Latham does a great job of illustrating the complexities of these issues.",
    "Yes, it is a great course that every Yale student should take.",
    "This was a great, interesting and chill course to take. You get introduced to the U.S. healthcare and legal systems in the beginning, and then dive into issues like reproductive rights, end of life care, etc. The sections really helped with the material, the lectures were straightforward and well organized, and you get to read into court cases that were and still are relevant in establishing certain principles that are still used today. It was only two midterms and a final, all essays. It was super fun to learn about and a pretty easy course if you're willing to put in some work, would definitely recommend it as a 5th credit",
    "Such an interesting course would definitely recommend.",
    "Only if you get a fair TA.",
    "I absolutely would. Many of the topics are extremely relevant and currently debated issues, such as abortion and physician assisted suicide. Many other topics discussed will become central to political, ethical and legal debates in the near future, especially those discussed at the end of the course like cloning and other artificial insemination techniques. Knowledge of these issues is important to being aware of important and contentious medical and biological questions. Also, it gives a basic understanding of America's legal and political system, and gives in depth insight into America's healthcare system. This was invaluable information, especially for a foreign student like myself but also for anyone who lives in this country. All of the material is very well explained in an engaging way. Lectures are a pleasure to attend.",
    "Absolutely, take this class! You'll learn things that will be relevant and important later in life and are also incredibly interesting. The exams are fair and the workload is super light (you really don't need to do the reading). Favorite class I've taken at Yale!",
    "Must take before graduating",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student, even if you are not a political science major! It is very well taught and it has been my favorite class at Yale thus far.",
    "This class covers very interesting material. I personally recommend going to class, as I found Latham's lectures very intriguing as well as the best way to learn the material (minimal studying was done before exams - in fact, my method of studying was to read through the notes from class). The textbook is fascinating but you don't need it - my TA did have us do case briefs but you can find what you need online. I did enjoy having it, though, as it was often a good clarification of in-class points if needed.",
    "Yah yah, yah yah, yah yaaaah",
    "Yes. This class was very interesting, and not very stressful.",
    "Yes, I would recommend as long as you don't get Samantha Godwin as a TF. She ruined the course for me.",
    "It is both interesting and relevant",
    "I would recommend this class to another student. It's an interesting class that touches on a lot of really relevant topics in modern society, especially on issues such as abortion and reproductive assistance techniques. Overall, the course is not too much work, and the readings are interesting, making it a good class to take for fun or if you are interested in the material."
