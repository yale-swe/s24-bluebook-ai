   "comments": [
    "Take the course if you are actually really interested in the material. If you are only casually interested, it may not be worth it. You'll need to memorize a lot of very specific facts about random Popes and theologians you probably don't care for.",
    "Winroth is a very charming and engaging professor, but make sure you're prepared to do the work he wants you to do. The material isn't hard, but he makes you write two long papers in addition to his midterm and final tests, and it gets bothersome, especially if you haven't done the reading. That said, he's a great professor, and the class is interesting.",
    "The material was very interesting. Difficult assignments\/ papers. Due to the structure of the final exam, it was hard to show that you actually learned anything, as it only asked about small details, not any of the themes of the course. This was quite frustrating. Would recommend for material alone, but be aware of what you are getting into.",
    "It was a good intro into Medieval history. I personally found it interesting and the attitudes of the professor and TA helped it seem really laid-back and fun."
