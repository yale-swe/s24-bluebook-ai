   "comments": [
    "Take this class! Even if you have no knowledge of Spanish and Portuguese like i did, all films have subtitles and you'll watch some amazing movies!",
    "A good class if you enjoy watching lots of movies and are interested in Lat Am culture and history. Lecture were a bit tedious at times.",
    "Take it if you are remotely interested in Latin America, or just want to exercise your Portuguese\/Spanish listening abilities. Or if you want to go past the skewed perceptions that Europeans and Americans have of Latin America.",
    "This is a pretty good class with a good professor. Don't take it if you won't invest time into watching the movies, though. You won't get anything out of the class if you do not watch the films before lecture. Most of the films were great, so it isn't a hassle to watch them.",
    "Professor Moreira gets it. He knows SO MUCH about the history of each country and the topics of the movie. Every class is mind-blowing. Funny, sensitive, sweet and caring, Professor Moreira is simply amazing! There are two papers, three short assignments and a online forum post before each class due for this class. All are manageable as the films mostly really interesting and there's always something to say about each one. TAKE THIS CLASS!!",
    "a whirlwind journey through a lot of great latin american film. be prepared to see a lot of film. it will be amazing, though at times seem daunting. professor moreira will frame the movies in an insightful manner. i would definitely recommend the course. i loved it."
