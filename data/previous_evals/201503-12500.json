    "Take it with Luis if possible! He is a really great and really helpful instructor! Also the course in general really is not too much work and it will really improve your Spanish..",
    "Spanish 130 is a pretty standard language class. Luis is amazing!! If you have to take a Spanish class take it with him.",
    "Spanish 130 12 is probably the best section, I definitely would recommend it.",
    "It's a much needed recap of L1 and L2 with added information. I would certainly recommend this course. It's an essential step.",
    "Its good. Definitely take with Luis. He's the best!",
    "If you want to take L3, definitely take it with Luis. He is hilarious, very easy going, and very accessible.",
    "I would recommend it because it' is great at helping students feel more comfortable in Spanish conversation.",
    "There is a good amount of memorization in regards to the vocabulary. There is some new grammar. Some stories are difficult to understand.",
    "This is when Spanish gets hard. If you are just taking it to learn Spanish shop it and see. But if it is for a requirement then you have to take it."
