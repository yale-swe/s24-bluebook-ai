   "comments": [
    "The course is useful for students who hope to take an interdisciplinary approach to their work. It goes over the craft of scholarly research in urban studies, making it accessible for students from Architecture, Am Studies, and History alike. I would recommend the course if you already have a research topic in mind and spent some time thinking about the interpretive framework you would like to use in your research, since this seminar goes by very quickly and does not spend much time familiarizing students with the field of urban studies.",
    "It's unique in being a good overview of \"cultural geography\" while at the same time helping undertake a specific project. I definitely recommend it.",
    "I would recommend this class to students who had a good idea going in what their projects would be."

   "comments": [
    "This course helped me think more deeply about a subject I had already begun researching, and it enabled me to produce a piece of work I hope to submit to a journal for publication. I am not yet sure if my research project will grow into a dissertation topic.",
    "It gave me a way to look different at common problems within my discipline, which of course contributes to my dissertation research.",
    "One of the best and most useful class periods was the second one where Professor Hayden went through the sources power point. That was immensely helpful and a way of thinking about research material which was new to me. This course allowed me to work on my dissertation research."
