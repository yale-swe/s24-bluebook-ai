   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend the course. The course is an examination of solitude (mainly solitude, networks not so much, to the course's benefit, I think) a wide range of literature, including literature, criticism, sociology, and religious writing. I would recommend the course for its interesting subject matter and also for the instructor.",
    "A discussion-based seminar loosely guided by the topic of solitude. Discussions are punctuated by one or two student presentations a week. At this moment, I would probably recommend the course with caveats. For instance, I think this could be changed by inclusion of more structure to guide discussions. Critical articles on topics would be appreciated additions. That being said, I enjoyed the selection of texts and thought the range was impressive and a good choice.",
    "I'm not sure that I would recommend this class unless someone wanted to get to know and work with Amy and hadn't had that opportunity before. The class is about different modes of solitude (mostly artistic and religious) and the ways in which those modes are or are not necessarily contingent on the social. The texts range from the 19th to 21st centuries some French but mostly American. Students will read some great books and meet a great professor, but I'm not sure how much else they will take away from the course.",
    "It is a unique course on a topic you will rarely see critically analyzed; I have already recommended friends to take a class with Amy.",
    "I would certainly recommend this course to another student, as it provided interesting frameworks through which one might view solitude in literature and in other contexts. It also offered an interesting way to read a diverse assortment of books along one loose interrogative path."

   "comments": [
    "Coming from a background in literature and religion, the course bolstered my understanding of language of current scholarship on literature. My presentation for class familiarized me with a monograph that will be very helpful in my ongoing research. The final paper was also a helpful one for me in integrating the course with my particular interests. THANK YOU PROF. HUNGERFORD!",
    "My favorite week of this course was the lyric theory week. I found that week most helpful for gaining access to an important slice of the discipline. And it may very well contribute to my research in later years. Moreover, Amy herself always has a terrific view of the discipline in mind, and she can always anchor classroom comments and\/or seminar papers in the context of the discipline, which is truly invaluable.",
    "The class gave me a chance to practice two essential components of the profession: giving a presentation and writing an article-length paper, one that I hope to keep working on."
