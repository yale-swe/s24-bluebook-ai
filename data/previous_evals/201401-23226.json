    "Great way for Div Students to learn about the theologies and the canon-development of Jewish texts in the century around Jesus' time - from 2nd Temple Judaism through the 5th\/6th century -- theologies that interact with the development of Christianity and are foundational to contemporary Judaism.Yes, I'd recommend the class. I am a 3rd year MDiv and this has one of the most reasonable workloads of any class I've taken which meant I actually was able to do most of the reading.",
    "I would recommend it. It's a great course to learn about 1000 years worth of history",
    "I would recommend Judaic Studies 721 to anyone who seeks to gain information about early Judaic history and culture."

    "This course gave me enthusiasm to continue learning about Judaism. Brilliant course!",
    "Great introduction for me to the development of rabbinic judaism. Will be very helpful in the future."
