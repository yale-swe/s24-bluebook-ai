    "I would recommend it to a student who wanted experience working in a team.",
    "I would recommend a course like this one to other CS students because it includes major software topics not covered elsewhere: testing, software design patterns, validation\/verification, web applications. The course is very project driven, which is sort of a nice complement to more traditional homework-driven courses.",
    "The course is basically a project course where you design some piece of software. Technically it can be whatever you want (but it does need to be approved by the Professor). Most of the homeworks are based on this project, but most of the lectures are about software engineering in general. I think the project part is very useful for all computer science majors (and even other majors), but the software engineering part maybe isn't as helpful for everyone. Although perhaps it is a nice overview of what the field entails."
