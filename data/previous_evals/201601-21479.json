    "A MUST-TAKE if you are interested in nonprofits, humanitarianism, or international development in general. SO many amazing opportunities to learn, grow, and network. CPB has so many connections she is so helpful. Nothing bad to say about this class!",
    "Recommend if interested!",
    "This class is completely fascinating. Professor Panter-Brick is the best teacher, so amazing and kind and genuine. She is realistic about the fact that students won't do every single reading every week. We had tea and biscuits every class! We had some engaging guest lecturers and overall very manageable course load and extremely interesting stuff. :)",
    "I would recommend this class whole heartedly along with any class taught by Catherine Panter Brick.",
    "YES! Take it! If you are at all interested in working with an NGO in the future or if you know you are that person that wants to help others and try and help the world in some small way then take this class.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course. You will learn a variety of perspectives to help you navigate and analyze the humanitarian landscape, and just better understand current events. Definitely felt more focused on ethics and big questions than on nitty-gritty logistics. The course was interesting, engaging, and not too stressful. Learning from Professor Panter-Brick is a pleasure.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. Professor Panter-Brick was fantastic, and the environment of the class was relaxed while still being engaging. The material was super interesting, though the focus was definitely on medical humanitarianism. I would take this class again if I could.",
    "Take it if you can! Professor Panter-Brick is a fantastic seminar leader, and the class topics are incredibly fascinating. You're thinking about humanitarian interventions from all sorts of perspectives, and it really gets you thinking about the type of development and humanitarian work that happens in the world. Definitely take!",
    "Take this class! Panter-Brick is an amazing professor, and the class was an absolute joy. There is a fair amount of writing, but the in-class discussions are really great.",
    "The class is an anthropological take on humanitarianism. It puts the human in humanitarianism, which is something that is too often disregarded in humanitarian context. Master Panter-Brick is extremely passionate about teaching her students how to think critically about humanitarianism. You have to write three 2-3 page single spaced critical analyses about the weekly readings that she assigns. The readings were never too long averaging around 75 pages per week, and are always easy and enjoyable reads. She brings in world renowned workers in the field and challenges you to come up with problems and solutions to ethical dilemmas that face humanitarians during their work. I was lucky to attend the release of her newest book \"medical humanitarians\" and read the entire thing. It's a book that puts a spotlight on humanitarians themselves, and merges anthropology with politics and ethics. Class is small, and discussions are chill and interesting. It's very easy to excel in the class if you give a damn. Other than attendance, three critical analyses (which are extremely easy to finish since they have an open deadline), you will have to write a 3000-4000 word paper at the end of the semester about any topic of interest relating to the course. I highly recommend this course if you are passionate about becoming a developer in the humanitarian world. Master PB is extremely intelligent, and is willing to help you a lot as long as you show interest and work in her course. The class was an easy A for me, even though others said it was hard. I did quite minimal work; I just did it with some passion.",
