    "This is fairly difficult class in a lot of work",
    "A solid amount of work but a doable amount. the class gets you much better at Latin, but you're gonna have to put in some effort.",
    "I went into this class not having taken Latin for two years and not knowing really what to expect. Prof. Peirano was great in being accommodating to different levels of Latin coming into the course. I left the course able to read more difficult Latin texts than before.I would only recommend this class if you have the basics of the grammar down and need help to identify the parts of a difficult prose sentence to make it make sense. I spent a large part of my time preparing for this class by making very long vocab lists. Prof. Peirano was very cheery, even at 9 in the morning, which really helped. She was helpful in answering questions and identifying weaknesses. The quizzes and exams started off pretty easy and slowly increased in difficulty.",
    "I would recommend this course to other Latin students, but only if they had a better grasp of Latin grammar than most of the students in the course with me. I am not sure what level the course is designed to be, but most of the students needed more than a cursory review of grammar, which is all we covered. Students with a higher level of competence should be able to read Livy comfortably and enjoy the class at a reasonable pace."
