    "Instructor: Kyra Alexandra Prats \u00a0Kyra, was exceptional in her position. Her comments were often and constructive.",
    "Instructor: Kyra Alexandra Prats \u00a0Kyra was extremely helpful, and went out of her way to ensure the forest group understood what was expected of us as far as our management plan and presentation. She was always proactive in setting expectations and giving advice, so we weren't held up waiting for her to get to things. In lab she was a great resource for the specific techniques that many of us were unfamiliar with, and at the Branford property she was a great help with tree ID. All that said, I also think Kyra did a good job of not just telling us the answers, but instead letting us figure things out for ourselves.",
    "Instructor: Kyra Alexandra Prats \u00a0Kyra was super helpful! She went above and beyond to help us with field work, developing our management plan and editing our plan. She was always willing and happy to meet with us outside of class\/lab hours. Best teacher assistant I've ever had!",
    "Instructor: Taylor Renee Ganz \u00a0Offered help and was responsive to questions. When we were working on something that she was not familiar with, she was able to tell us who to talk to.",
    "Instructor: Taylor Renee Ganz \u00a0Accessible but not always helpful. Probably not entirely her fault though - the structure of the class kept her very separate from our lecture material.",
    "Instructor: Taylor Renee Ganz \u00a0Taylor was rarely available to meet with our team and was not helpful when she did meet with us. I found myself going to the other TAs in the class for guidance she Taylor never gave complete or relevant answers to questions. We would sometimes ask if we were doing things correctly and she would respond with vague answers as if she wanted us to be independent but it just seemed like she didn't know the answers. She blamed team members for not doing extra hours in the lab and was completely unhelpful in the isotope lab. We were essentially left to our own devices and weren't given the skills or guidance to conduct our research properly.",
    "Instructor: Taylor Renee Ganz \u00a0She is okay.",
    "Instructor: Taylor Renee Ganz \u00a0Good overall but was not a specialist in our ecosystem",
    "Instructor: Taylor Renee Ganz \u00a0Taylor knows quite a bit about water, but not much about salt marshes, so she was not particularly helpful as we put together our final projects.",

    "Overall I really appreciated the flip lecture format for the first half of the class. That said, in the instances with especially complex content I think it would have been helpful to have a second in-class lecture that is basically a repeat in order to reinforce the material. The Q&A periods were helpful, but sometimes it's hard to know what your question actually is or how to articulate it. I would have enjoyed a last field trip towards the end of the course, since we didn't know that much in the beginning. It would have been exciting to see the contrast.",
    "For Question 3 - I decline to answer this question because I only audited the course so my perception of the workload is likely not an accurate reflection of the actual workload. Similarly, for Questions 8-10, I did not attend the field portion of this course since I was auditing. This includes all questions regarding the Teaching Fellow, since they were mostly involved with the field lab portion of the course.",
    "Both professors were amazing.",
    "Question 15: This course was valuable in ways I was not expecting. I went into it thinking it would be a standard ecological science course. While the science was an important part of the course, it was much more heavily focused on the philosophical aspects of environmental management and on systems thinking. Rather than coming away with a bunch of new science concepts in my head, I came away with new ways of thinking about how humans interact with nature as a whole.",

I appreciated the large-scope of the lectures, and the incorporation of big questions about the role of science, economics\/cost-benefit analysis, the peer review process, etc. I also found both projects very helpful in cementing my understanding of certain concepts and developing a deeper understanding of some specific issues\/places.",
    "I found the flipped class format to be especially useful in this course. I believe it allowed for productive conversation during class time. I also appreciated the professors reviewing any questions about the recorded lecture at the beginning of each class.",
    "The thinking process this class lends to other systems.",
    "The course itself was an interesting introduction to ecosystem science, and was great at zooming in and out between the current science and the value of it to management and policy.",
    "I gained the most from Os's lectures on systems thinking and how we need to rethink our relationship with nature in the anthropocene. These lectures were very well thought out and provided numerous examples of the concepts we were discussing. On several occasions, we would end class and immediately sit down at the tables in Kroon to keep discussing the material presented in the lecture.",

    "Being able to conduct some field work was immensely helpful. I would love it if there were more field-based classes at FES.",
    "Getting out in the field was great. We learned new skills and how to take field samples, analyze them in the lab, and report them in reports. The lectures were also very good- especially in the second half when Oz lectured.",
    "The big picture of how to understand ecosystem and the explanations from professor Os.",
    "The overall message, contextual lectures, reading critiques",
    "The twist that the course took, from being very rooted in the physical\/mechanical functioning of ecosystems to exploring the implications of accounting for humans in the environment, was a bit unexpected and pleasantly surprising. Writing management plans was also a useful exercise.",

    "The group size of the management plan group was my biggest complaint -- too big! This was problematic for a number of reasons (diffusion of responsibility, hard to schedule meeting times that work for everyone, some people get off without doing much, you don't get to be involved in everything personally).",
    "From my experience of auditing the course, I do not see any major areas of improvement.",
    "Balanced work between in class and out of class work, throughout the semester.",
    "At the beginning of the course, the pace was to fast and the material presented seemed too advanced. This is an introductory course that doesn't have prerequisites. The first classes were really hard to follow without any background on the topics.",
    "The beginning of the semester is very information heavy. It's important that we have all this information in order to get the most out of the second half of the semester, but I think it could have been presented in a clearer fashion. I think rather than have classes that go beyond what we watched in the online lectures, it would have been beneficial to very slowly review the same material. I think this portion of the course should be taught with the understanding that many students have almost no ecological science background. Slightly more organization on the front end could have improved this.",
    "It would have been helpful for better explanation at the beginning of the semester as to how the curse would be structured. The course was very front loaded (rightfully so) with a lot of scientific material, but that situation was only brought up halfway through the semester. Warning or preparing us at the beginning of the course's overall structure would have been helpful.",
    "It would be helpful if the TAs engaged in class work as well so they had a better understanding of what the course content includes. Hiring decisions should be more thoughtful since our TA was relatively useless. She didn't appear to know the material herself.",
    "The workload was strenuous in the beginning with all of our other courses. The professors lightened the load after multiple student requests. Some readings I felt were poor choices for the class.",
    "probably a little bit more credit hours and less workload every week.",
    "It was sometimes heavy on the group work (two simultaneous group projects) and the groups were too large for the final project.",

    "I admit that this relationship felt slightly tenuous to start, but looking back I understand that we had to get started with the lab component right off in order to meet our end of semester deadline. I think it might have been helpful to have a lecture devoted to the goals of the management plan project, the different components of work, and the final product upfront. This would have given us a little more context for the specific labs as we made our way through the semester. Perhaps we could have been given a few example plans to read upfront to get a better sense of what we were shooting for? These could be from past students, or professional management plans developed by foresters, etc. I'd also add that the tour of the isotope lab went completely over my head. I basically had no idea what they were talking about or how it related to our lab. I also found it difficult to ask questions because I didn't understand a lot of the words they were using. It might be helpful to have Mark and\/or Os present for the tour next year in order to target it more to our class.",

We were given instructions for the 2nd and 3rd part of the assignment a day before the 1st part was due. If I had been aware of the requirements of the entire project in the beginning, I would have chosen a different system to work on for the semester that I would have gained more from.",
    "Group work is a blessing and a curse. The size of the groups for final projects was frustrating (too large). I am unsure if that is the intent (learn how to work with large groups), or a function of the number of TAs available and the property where field work takes place. In any case, if the groups could be smaller each individual might learn more and the quality of work could improve.",
    "Overall I found both group projects challenging, but that is largely a personality issue as I tend to prefer working independently. That said, I found the management plan group project especially unwieldy given the large group size. With a group that size there is automatically a diffusion of responsibility, and some people end up doing more work than others. In addition, no one seems to fully understand everything. In future years I think it would helpful to cap the group size at 7 or 8 maximum. I liked that we kept the same group for the budget project throughout the three phases. We definitely improved from project to project as far as working together, etc.",
    "I felt many others did not put in the requisite amount of work.",
    "Different levels of commitment and large group sizes. Besides that, very useful.",
    "I think the main disadvantage of the group work was that it made it challenging for the people who had less experience in this subject area to ever feel caught up. With big groups, it was easy to feel like certain people had a very strong understanding and didn't need to slow down to explain everything to those who were having more trouble. I think this course could benefit from some more individual work, especially at the beginning as we are becoming familiar with the material. On the other hand, the advantage of the group work was that there were a lot of opportunities to learn from fellow students and share ideas and discuss the material outside of class. Group work is always good to help prepare for future careers.",
    "The small group projects were advantageous for my own personal knowledge, writing skills, and collation abilities. The larger group (of 13!) was really quite difficult. In the end we pulled everything off but it was hard to work together without leadership and stratification.",
