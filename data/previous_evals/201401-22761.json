   "comments": [
    "French 854 is a survey of Racine and Corneille's major plays. This course is an excellent foundation for someone who either wants to gain a foundational understanding of 17th century French drama (particularly French graduate students), or someone specializating in the century and who would like to read these plays in proximity and quick succession to maybe try and see links between them that a more relaxed and dispersed reading schedule would not allow.",
    "We covered several major works by 17th-century playwrights Corneille and Racine in a relatively chronological order, touching on major issues in French theater of the time through that lens. I would recommend the course. It was a pleasure to take, and I now have a much better understanding of these authors, the period, and tragic theater in general."

   "comments": [
    "This course allowed me to acquire foundational knowledge for any scholar of French literature, irrespective of their speciality.",
    "I had no previous knowledge of French theater or either of these playwrights. Although I do not expect to study the 17th century as part of my dissertation, the course provided knowledge which is essential background for anyone pursuing a career in French Literature."
