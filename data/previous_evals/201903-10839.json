As far as the course material, I primarily learned how the topics outlined in the syllabus are illustrated using graphs. Skills\/insights: I learned that it is essential to go to peer tutors and TAs during their office hours with even the most seemingly insignificant questions.

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strength - Berry's teaching style, powerpoint presentation style and class material organization, problem sets were helpful to solidify understanding Weaknesses - can be boring sometimes Areas of improvement - more interactive questions in class to check understanding\/progress, the curve can be difficult",
    "The big picture lectures always came before the section, where we learned more technical and applicable material. I was very confused in lectures.",
    "I think the course is fine overall.",
    "Strengths: scope of topics, applicability of material Weakness: in my opinion, few students in an introductory economics class will go on to become economists. However, they will all be voters who need to be educated on the arguments for and against common economic policies. Therefore, I would've liked to see more time spent on the theory\/philosophy of micro-economics and less emphasis on memorizing graphs most of us will never draw again after semester's end.",
    "Strengths: it is a good introduction and starting point into the world of economics and informs students about what more advanced courses would be like. Having sections helps reinforce the concepts learnt in class. Weaknesses: the lecture style make engagement with the course material limited.",
    "Strengths: if you want to take econ, you will have taken econ. Weaknesses: Kind of just math in disguise. But seriously. Unclear how to improve ones skills.",
    "Weaknesses: Lectures are pretty boring and sections are also very boring Strengths: The very generous curve. Just go to class and section and you'll probably get a good grade",
    "This course offers a tremendous amount of resources for help. Office hours are held incredibly often and discussion sections help cement what you learned the previous week in class. I can't really think of any weaknesses of the course, as I thought that it was handled incredibly well.",
    "Lectures are engaging. Wish there were more frequent assessments",
    "This course was in many ways an extension of AP Economics. Most topics were similar to ones covered there, with a little extra detail and a couple more chapters at the end. It was well-taught but very standard and uninteresting.",
    "strengths - lots of TAs who can help you with what you don't understand weaknesses - boring material, going to lecture is not worth it",
    "Strengths: There are plenty of resources to help you if you are lost or confused. The TA's and peer tutors are very active in providing practice problems and extra work.",
    "Strengths: The final third of the semester was engaging and brought many of the models and ideas from the beginning together. Weaknesses: The first two thirds of the semester were very dry. While Professor Berry worked to keep lectures interesting, I still found myself constantly checking the time which I never do in other classes. The topics are pretty dry and theoretical and Berry's teaching style felt a bit repetitive. It was hard to understand when a new topic was being introduced and how topics related to one another.",
    "Strengths: -Good theoretical grounding. -Ideologically diverse arguments. Weaknesses: -People arrived at different skill levels, making it difficult to move at a pace that suited everyone.",
    "Lectures are very helpful and clear.",
    "Strengths: problem-sets and exams are almost exact replicas of what is taught in lecture; the material is very interesting Weaknesses: lectures are often a bit dry",
    "I think the lectures were a bit quickly paced and didn't introduce new topics as thoroughly as I would have preferred. The problem sets and exams were much more focused on the math rather than the concepts, and I think there could have been a better balance between the two.",
    "Excellent course",
    "I thought the professor could be more clear in his teaching I felt as though he never came to a conclusion in his slides and that made it more difficult to understand the take away messages that he was trying to see.",
    "The large lecture does not always command attention.",
    "Strengths- providing old materials for review to prepare for exams Weaknesses- It was very easy to disengage from the course due to its large size. While the problem sets would be helpful for bettering your understanding, there was very much a culture of going to peer tutoring to get the answers to problem sets. After the first few problem sets, they stopped posting the lecture slides as presented until after the problem set for that week was due. While I know this was done to encourage class attendance, it made it difficult for some concepts that Professor Berry covered super quickly.",
    "A strength was that the instructor was very meticulous in his teachings. A weakness was that the sections were not helpful in whatever shape or form",
    "Strengths: Wonderful TAs, engaging professor, manageable workload. Weaknesses: Really felt like you were in a 300 person lecture, no personal connection with Professor Berry",
    "I think it's a very good survey course. If anything, I wish the professor's notes on our slides were a bit more legible, but that's too big of an issue.",
    "I did not enjoy that it was in a huge lecture hall. I think it is incredibly discouraging that students that placed into higher level econ classes are able to take this class because, since it is graded on a curve, students who have never taken econ before face the misfortune of getting bad grades because their peers are more knowledgeable about the topic from the start.",
    "I appreciate the efforts to make the course matter in the real world. The lectures often don't cover content very systematically, such that students have to rely a bit too much on sections and independent review to learn how to actually do problem, for example. Moreover, problems in problem sets and exams are often unclear or inconsistent. In many cases, answer keys aren't very accurate or explain answers clearly.",
    "Strengths: not too much work, entertaining lectures, helpful presentations that are posted after problem sets are due Weaknesses: TFs were pretty brutal. I feel like they graded everything haphazardly, and I never got a real explanation for getting points taken. Also, the problems sets aren't super helpful when preparing for the tests, even though they're very similar in structure. When studying for exams, don't bother with the problem sets, just do his practice exams, they're harder.",
    "Strengths: Well taught, loved the instructors and TFs in the course, material was easy to learn Weaknesses: Too many example problems taught during class instead of general methods and theoretical applications",
    "Strengths: I thought the last few weeks were great. We had the tools to talk about carbon pricing, government subsidies, and other real-world examples of what we'd been learning. Definitely made the material interesting in ways that I hadn't found it for the earlier part of the year.",
    "The strength of this course was the way in which topics were applied to real-world scenarios so one is able to see the effects of market changes in society. The weakness was the influx of information covered in class, some of which is covered once and dismissed.",
    "Weaknesses: Lectures were long and hard to follow. Professors notes on slides were hard to look back on and study. Strength: Good use of peer tutors.",
    "The content that is taught in the course within the context of lecture is interesting, but what is taught in lecture and section and what is done on psets is very different than what is expected from you on the midterms and finals.",
    "Strengths: Online lecture slides were helpful. Also there was an abundance of old materials for review that was invaluable for studying for midterms and final. Weaknesses: Section wasn't helpful, and sometimes I felt like they didn't explain some concepts they should have considering everyone is new to econ.",
    "Strengths - Professor Berry made it engaging with many dad jokes between tough concepts. Weaknesses - the nature of the concepts (not a huge amount of ways to link it all back to the economy). Forced a certain method of studying - had to take notes in class (I prefer just watching) otherwise one would be disadvantaged when doing the problem set.",
    "The course is a good introduction to economics and how concepts can be applied to policy. Professor Berry in general keeps lectures engaging, although they can get repetitive. Lectures also are not sufficient for understanding material and some extrapolation is required for problem sets. This imbalance could be improved by focusing more on concepts in lectures and math on the problem sets.",
    "Very structured. Exams are difficult",
    "Honestly, I found the lectures quite boring, however, I understand that it is an intro course.",
    "I loved this class! I think the lectures were engaging and the sections really helped to solidify the material! I think it would have been helpful if the concepts were connected to the problem solving more directly in lecture.",
    "Strengths: extensive support structure meant that the material was ingrained into the student. Weaknesses. none.",
    "Lots of review material from previous years which was helpful and sections\/office hours were really helpful.",
    "In my opinion, this course relied too heavily on whether you were good at understanding and solving word problems, and not so much whether you understood concepts. For example, you could thoroughly understand what Pareto efficiency was, but then get to the pset or the test and not even be able to start a problem because you couldn't understand what the question was asking about the concept. Therefore, I think grades end up reflecting how good you are at algebra or word problems, or in my case, how much time you spent in office hours having TAs explain the questions to you. However, on the other hand, a strength of the course was definitely the amount of help available if you sought it out (numerous office hours by TAs or peer tutors).",
    "Strengths - Professor Berry is a talented lecturer, and makes the content engaging. Weaknesses - The speed at which material is introduced is very slow, to the point where it is easy to disengage during lectures. The course is limited by the low level of mathematics that it is assumed students know. The material only loosely corresponds to the textbook, which makes it difficult to catch up if you miss class.",
    "The class is extremely dull, and moves very fast paced. Lectures are rather boring, and it's tough for anybody to stay focused. Lectures aren't always extremely clear either, as I typically have to review the textbook before doing some homework problems.",
    "The course provides a solid foundation of microeconomic theory. The lectures are a suitable channel for content, even though the material doesn't necessarily flow well between certain parts. The course could be improved if unit transitions were more clearly highlighted, connections between the units were emphasized, and the line of reasoning while explaining economic concepts is continually reinforced to remind students how a conclusion was reached.",
    "One strength of this course is the impressive amount of online materials provided. We received old problem sets, solutions to old problem sets, old exams, solutions to old exams etc. These materials are beyond helpful when studying. Because this course is in a lecture format, it tends to be less engaging. The lecture slides are often confusing and unclear if you go back and look back at them after class.",
    "Strengths: the curve helps a lot! And the TA's are extremely helpful. Weaknesses: the way the course is lectured is not as intuitive as it seems, and isn't very compatible with the textbook either. You need to do a lot of connecting work to fully grasp concepts and it is a lot harder if you are not already a 'mathy' person.",
    "Strength: clear presentation of the lecturer; The TF sections are very helpful Weakness, or rather a small improvement: professor could post the slides before the lecture",
    "Strengths: the course covers a wide range of topics and by the end of it I felt like I had a good understanding of basic microeconomics. I thought that even though a lot of topics didn't immediately make sense, as the course progressed they do gradually become more clear. The peer tutors are also very helpful. Weaknesses: While Professor Berry is extremely engaging, the course itself is very fast paced and is just not as well structured as it should be. The powerpoint presentations with the professor's notes are uploaded AFTER the problem sets are due. If someone misses parts of slides while taking notes in class, it becomes difficult to refer back to what was covered. The slides also don't give good explanations so if you miss something in class, referring to the slides won't help. Considering how big this class is, I think the lectures should also be recorded. While someone might argue that if lectures are recorded (or even if presentations are uploaded on time) people will stop coming to class. At the end of the day, I think it is more important for students to learn the material however they choose to do it than just show up to class and not gain as much. Considering how lectures were not as effective as they could've been, I wouldn't have been able to get through this course without the textbook and peer tutors.",
    "The strengths are that you learn a lot without that much work. The weaknesses are that the lectures are very long.",
    "I thought that it provided me with the tools to talk simplistically about economics in my every-day life. With that said, I thought that the lectures were often very fast-paced, which wasn't very conducive to processing the material. Additionally, our tests were heavily math-based, but we really only learned math in section. I went to every lecture and section, studied for the final for over thirty hours, and the math still confused me. So, I think that more math should've been covered in lectures in order to warrant math-heavy tests.",
    "I think the course emphasizes memorization over critical thinking. For example, one third of the exams are definitions of words. Moreover, there is a lot of students who don't understand the material but simply memorize solutions to problems. On the other hand, there is a lot of support for students in the class.",
    "The meeting times for this lecture were very long and sometimes made it hard to stay fully attentive, especially given that it was in such a large lecture hall with so many other students.",
    "Lots of peer tutoring hours but often they were over crowded and many times even no seats. There was little opportunity for individualized questions.",
    "The strengths of this course include support from TAs and peer tutors. The weakness of the course is the fast pace of the course.",
    "For a lecture course, this course was well structured in material and fair in grading.",
    "I feel that the course could be better suited to prepare students for tests. We were mostly taught conceptually and tested mathematically which was not always the best method for me.",
    "Clear lectures. Could be better reinforced",
    "Weakness: laptop ban, not putting as-presented slides up until the week after (I ended up not attending lecture AND not having access to any information to make up for it), low-energy lecture, lack of discussion on lecture topics in section",
    "Strengths: Interesting topics Weaknesses: Course goes by too fast and no explicit reinforcement of materials, therefore students are always concerned with learning the new lessons rather than understanding the lessons that were already taught.",
    "The lectures have very clear structures. The discussion sessions complement the lectures well.",
    "I did not find sections to be helpful and was overwhelmed by the size of the lecture",
    "A lot of practice problems to help students understand through trial and error.",
    "The amount of material covered is not too overwhelming, and it was all taught very well.",
    "This course is really fair and there a numerous opportunities to get help if you're not understanding the material. And the assignments aren't too difficult.",
    "Even though the class was a huge lecture, I felt that it was very well structured and allowed to me gain a lot from the classes, despite an environment where asking question during the class was hard. I did feel at times that due to the need to stick to the course schedule, certain topics were covered a lot faster than others, which made it harder to grasp the concept.",
    "Lectures were informative if often dull. It is good for what it is.",
    "It's possible that I simply do not like STEM lecture style courses, however this course was quite poorly designed for student learning. The lecture is huge and not very engaging so you have to struggle to pay attention. I found my particular section unhelpful and confusing. The best part of this class, besides the curve, is the ample amount of peer tutoring and office hours available. I would not have survived without the help of peer tutors who cover weekly problem sets.",
    "Great lecture content and section format.",
    "One weakness that I found was that the lectures were so big it was often hard to focus. It would be great if lecture videos could be posted online.",
    "Steve Berry is the strength. However, the TAs are not all the same. I found Daniela to be the most helpful so by the end of term I was attending both her section and the one I was assigned to.",
    "This course could be improved by making sections mandatory and making them more engaging. They were actually very helpful in applying lecture material to the problem sets, but because they weren't mandatory a lot of people didn't go. This would cement the material more in students' minds and prepare them better for the exams.",
    "It is very boring, this is the classic 500 student lecture class.",
    "The strengths of this course are how all lectures are posted for us online after class, allowing me to focus on the material in class and not focus so much about writing down every single thing. With this said, a weakness of this course was how the \"as presented\" lectures were not posted until a week after the problem set was due, making it quite difficult to study after class based on that days' lecture. I also disliked how there were problems sets due right before mid terms and the final, as I wanted to focus on studying rather than completing problem sets.",
    "The PowerPoint slides were not easy to navigate through. Could be more organized with neater handwriting. Good lectures.",
    "The strength is that the information is really accessible (because theres several office hours, PowerPoints are published, and theres a textbook), and Berry is an incredible professor. The weaknesses are that many kids in the class have advanced economics knowledge, while others are taking their first economics class. The helpfulness of the TAs was very differentiated many of them would teach review sessions using different concepts or methods than what we learned in class. This is particularly frustrating because lectures include no math, so you have to learn how to do problems in section.",
    "strengths - graduate teaching assistants are really helpful especially HELENA on friday mornings!! weaknesses - lecture notes always put up late",
    "strengths - lectures were pretty great weaknesses - not enough practice\/ clarity about we can answer questions. it would also be great if lectures included more on the logical nature of the system\/ explanations on how things make sense intuitively as well, not just mathematically",
    "Strength was that it was an informative lecture, while weaknesses include speed at which lectures are presented and overall pace of class.",
    "The strengths of the course are that the subject matter was taught well and the pace of the class allowed for students to keep up with the material. I thought the section discussion could have been improved through better explanations and more student involvement. I also thought there should have been a way to teach how to apply economic knowledge to various types of problems.",
    "The peer tutor sessions were vital to my completion of the problem sets, they were very helpful and informative. I found my section to be unhelpful and confusing",
    "Problems from class do not necessarily reflect the difficulty of the problems on p-sets\/discussion sections\/exams. Having the past exams\/p-sets available on Canvas was extremely useful.",
    "I did not find the lectures to be completely congruent with the exams, and the course could have been taught with more detail.",
    "The strengths of the course was the professor--he always tried his best to engage his students. There were no obvious weaknesses of the course.",
    "Interesting content yet it is very easy to fall behind in the material and lose focus during lecture because of the mere size of the class",
    "Section TAs varied tremendously",
    "Good introductory course covering a wide range of topics. Psets seemed to be too leniently graded.",
    "Poorly taught by lecturer and TAs.",
    "A strength is that it taught all of the information well and clearly. Although it was weak in the sense that it was unclear what I needed to study. I had to guess which terms I needed etc",
    "The course is strong as is. I have no recommendations for improvement.",
    "Strengths: Berry was a great lecturer with organized notes. Weaknesses: different levels of difficulty between midterms and final.",
    "I think that it does cover a lot of material very well I certainly learned the requisite econ. It is, however, a difficult lecture to stay engaged with at some times. Also, I think that the way the lecture slides are given to the students makes note taking difficult. I wish they would post the prepared slides earlier, so I could perhaps take notes directly onto it.",
    "Large section is hard to learn in and TAs dont seem to be on the same page as the professor.",
    "I found that professor Barry was very knowledgeable but incredibly not engaging. The class which Daniela Morse taught was by far the most engaging and informative lecture of the semester",
    "It was taught at a good speed, but more practical problems could have been done during lectures.",
    "The class is good at teaching the theory, but the actual problems you have to do for the Psets and exams are far too removed from what is taught in class. Berry will cover a topic, and it will make sense, but you won't actually know how to do anything until maybe section and even then it can be hard to bridge the gap between lecture and problems.",
    "Very clearly structure to the course - the slides are fantastic, and really help in preparing for midterms and final.",
    "The lecture does a good job of explaining broad concepts but does not cover the mathematical applications that are actually used on exams and psets.",
    "Strengths: overall quantitative understanding, weakness: lack in conceptual understanding",
    "The lectures are not engaging at all.",
    "lecture was good. section was bad.",
    "The strength of this course is Professor Berry. He makes it very enjoyable.",
    "I felt that the large lecture was helpful, but sometimes the lectures could include practice problems.",
    "Im good at getting the work done weekly. One weakness was understanding the information the first time I leaned it.",
    "weakness its hard to follow the lecture slides while the teacher speaks because he says different things sometimes",
    "Its a great class for learning basic economic skills. Its a huge class so youre bound to have friends in your class so thats also a plus. The thing is that I found some classes to be so boring and Ive been prone to fall asleep in class but its ok because I relearn the material.",
    "Diverse information.",
    "The course was a little dry. More in class examples might improve understanding for the problem sets.",
    "The psets were helpful but far more difficult than the midterms and final",
    "I think more available practice problems with walkthroughs would be helpful.",
    "The lectures teach the general concepts well, but the tests cover problem solving which is supposed to be covered in section. I attended every section and found them entirely unhelpful. Strength of the course is Professor Berry who did the best he could with boring subject material.",
    "I think the professor was very engaging, especially since the class was a large lecture class. I also thought the material was well organized and the right amount of difficulty.",
    "more questions like the TA section problems in psets or a more in-depth focus on understanding these questions and topics in section",
    "The lectures were great and the exams came straight from the lectures so if you pay attention and study the slides you do very well, the weakness is that it is a lecture class so its harder to build a good relationship with the professor and it can be easy to get distracted.",
    "Very good class for a lecture. Not much one on one with the professor because of the size but TAs were always very accessible.",
    "Sometimes too much material are allocated to the discussion sections and there isnt enough time to cover all of the material.",
    "Prof. Berry was great.",
    "Strengths: Prof Berrys dad jokes and the fact that he works out example problems for us during each lecture. The TAs and peer tutors were also great! Weaknesses: This is probably just because Econ 115 is a lecture class, but I never felt like I was learning anything during the lecture since I was so busy writing down notes. It wasnt until I did my psets that I could grasp the material.",
    "Very large lecture, can be hard to get individual help, however the peer tutoring and ta office hours are very accessible and frequent.",
    "Strengths were the availability of sections but could have had some better TAs.",
    "The lectures went by very quickly and were not in-depth. I found myself learning mostly by attending peer-tutoring sessions and sections as well as self-reviewing lecture slides.",
    "Professor Berry was an excellent lecturer and made class both enjoyable and easy to understand. He explained concepts very well and the problem sets were also quite helpful in practicing concepts that would appear on the midterms and final exam. Another strength of the course is that there were plenty of resources to succeed in the class, including exams, problem sets, and lecture figures from previous years and helpful discussion section content. I do not have any suggestions for improving the course.",
    "Professor OH; lectures posted before psets are due.",
    "Strengths were the materials taught, weaknesses were how they were taught: long and confusing\/needlessly repetitive lectures and one sentence questions worded using two paragraphs",
    "I understood the concepts very well in class but at times struggled to put all of the different ideas together in larger problems.",
    "Strengths: lots of resources, including peer tutoring which really helped with the psets and section, which for me was essential to doing the psets because the lectures are a lot more conceptual. Weaknesses: Prof. Berry often goes very fast so it's hard to catch everything but the lectures are always posted. Also, a lot of the material in the slides ends up not being relevant to the class exams\/psets",
    "course taught us how to be good economist citizens",
    "This is probably a class that all Yale students should take, since it is really helpful for thinking about the economy and consumer behavior. The strength of the class is that it provides this basic overview. The weakness of the course is that it does skip over some significant topics quite quickly, and the sections were large enough that it was sometimes hard to ask questions (though this *was* possible in office hours).",
    "I felt like there was little structure or sense of end goal. Perhaps I would describe it as disjointed. I was disappointed when there were spelling mistakes on the final and recycled questions from previous finals.",
    "Please post the lecture slides right away. You said to wait a week to post them, so to incentivize students to attend lectures. If attending lectures really is an advantage to learning, why punish people who don't go further by not posting the slides? I had taken an econ class, so most of the material was review. I also learn well alone and completed all of the p-sets by myself. I would have had much higher engagement with the class if the slides were posted in correspondence with the problem sets.",
    "I think that Prof. Berry should post the blank slides before class. He lectures very quickly and his handwriting tends to be quite messy. I think students will be able to focus more on what he is saying rather than trying to get the notes down. I also think that some of the problem set and exam questions were poorly written and occasionally had typos. I think that he should allow his assistant professor, Dr. Morar, to guest lecture a few classes she is very engaging. The location of the lecture hall was very hard to find and to access. I was inclined not to take the class because of a disability considering it's located in Marsh Hall. The course should weigh the problem sets more, maybe 25%. I found the psets much more challenging that the exam questions after all, we spend more time on the psets than exams. The syllabus also didn't lay out how many psets there were and when they were due at the beginning of the course. The expectation that psets should be: handed in in-person, at the beginning of class is frustrating. Marsh Hall is isolated from the rest of campus and therefore a long, uphill walk. ECON 115 is not an upper-level math class and therefore psets should be turned in like other work for similar classes: online.",
    "Strengths: For an intro lecture-style course, it was very engaging. Weaknesses: None.",
    "It's not a particularly exciting or interesting class, but it does provide some fundamental economic skills. If you've never taken economics in high school (like I haven't), then it will definitely be a much larger quantity of work to learn the skills, even if nothing itself is really that tricky. Just be prepared to do the work (psets every week, two midterms, and final) and go to lecture and push through it if it's required for your major.",
    "I felt as if more practical applications was involved. I really was interested in the conceptual items, but I felt like the transition from the concepts to the actual tested material was difficult.",
    "strengths are short problem sets so students are not stressed out. weaknesses are dry lectures, lack of supplemental materials and extra practice problems, and a plethora of concepts that fail to be connected to one another from lecture to lecture. more supplemental materials would help a lot, something or anything to make the lectures a little more engaging, and a list of formulas and the concepts that they apply to posted on canvas would also be helpful."

   "comments": [
    "Yes -- basic understanding of economics helps understand issues from climate change to healthcare !",
    "No, unless you took AP econ or have an econ background, take the seminar lectures.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. Even if you aren't going to major in economics, I think having an understanding of the field (albeit very basic) is an essential life skill. As demonstrated by this course, economics is so much more than finance.",
    "I would recommend it but only because it contains essential life knowledge and is a requisite for numerous major at Yale. I would not recommend it on the basis of quality of instruction.",
    "No.. I wish I didnt take this, honestly. I used to be interested in this subject but I am really discouraged now",
    "Yes. Everyone should take intro econ.... everyone....",
    "If you want an easy QR grade or need it for your major, sure. It's kind of necessary to take the better econ classes but this itself isn't that good",
    "I would definitely recommend this course if Professor Berry is teaching it. He made each lecture incredibly interesting and often threw in some real world examples to help us understand concepts (as well as some truly excellent dad jokes). If you need a SO credit, this class has a very manageable workload and could be taken as a fifth or even sixth class. However, I'm not sure if I'd recommend it if someone else is teaching it. Friends of mine who have taken it with other professors have said that they didn't find the course very interesting, and I could see why. I didn't find material itself super engaging (though I'm not an econ major), but I thought that Professor Berry did a truly excellent job at making the class both fun and informative. Also the class is curved so that at least 40% will get an A or A- which really reduces the stress surrounding grades.",
    "It is a good introductory course to learn about economy",
    "Maybe. If you want to major in Econ and need it as a prereq, sure. But if you're looking for something interesting or exciting, you likely won't find it here. Introductory economics is dry, and unless you're really invested in the class or the subject, I suggest you be a little more creative in your course selection.",
    "Yes, because everyone should learn Micro at some point. No, because it's not fun.",
    "Take it if you have to. If you just want to learn, take it Credit D\/Fail",
    "Yes. I think it is important to have a basic understanding of the market and how the economy functions.",
    "ONLY IF STEVEN BERRY TEACHES IT AGAIN OMG THIS MAN MADE ME WET",
    "I think a lot of people feel like economics is something you \"have to take\" at Yale but I'm not sure that this is the case. I personally didn't enjoy the material that much but did come away with a better understanding of many of the models and key concepts of economics. It wasn't a waste of time but got tiring and unless this is right up your alley, I would have preferred to use the QR credit on something like statistics.",
    "This course, or its seminar variation, is a must-take for anyone interested in economics at Yale.",
    "Yes. I highly recommend the lecture class over seminar because the professor is better in my opinion.",
    "Yes, I'd recommend this course to anyone interested in learning basic economics. The lectures themselves are fast-paced and sometimes seem all over the place, but if you take the time to look over the new material and read the textbook, it is manageable.",
    "I would recommend to a student who has taken Econ in high school in some capacity so that it is easier to keep up with the material covered in lectures.",
    "Yes, it was an excellent introduction to microeconomics",
    "Yes - good intro level Econ",
    "I would however with caution, because the class was difficult and while there were peer tutors you needed to put in a lot of attention and effort to understand the class.",
    "If you want to major in econ go ahead.",
    "Yes. It was a good class and the content is interesting.",
    "If you are actually interested in econ and are motivated to engage in the content, yes.",
    "I would recommend this course because it is a good workload and comprehensive introduction to microeconomics.",
    "If you are thinking of majoring in Econ or EP&E, I would take this class to see if you truly care about the subject matter. I would not recommend to someone looking for an easy QR credit, but instead to someone with actual interest in economics.",
    "Yes! As a required course for a few majors, it's very well-taught and the professor makes it pretty interesting.",
    "If they have already taken any kind of econ at any point, yes.",
    "Yes, I think if someone who has never taken economics before wants to try it out (like me), then this class would be a good fit.",
    "Yes, especially if you are interested in econ. If you just want a QR requirement, this is still a decent choice because it discusses a lot of things that are generally important to understand.",
    "Yes: this is a solid though unremarkable QR credit that offers valuable basic knowledge. I would recommend taking the lecture with Professor Berry, whose enthusiasm and dad jokes injected interest into otherwise dry material.",
    "Most definitely! This course taught me a great deal of information in a logical sequence, and the course instructors and TFs were all highly motivated and engaged with the material.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this class to anyone who is curious to learn about the basic dynamics which drive the market, and how certain events impact both consumers and firms. I also recommend having a basic understanding of economics before taking, and ensuring you are proficient at algebra.",
    "Yes, for completing prerequisites for Econ.",
    "I would if you need an econ pre req, but I would not if you are looking for a QR credit. It's interesting if you are interested in the material and going into econ, but if you aren't interested in econ, don't take this.",
    "Absolutely, this course gives you a new perspective of how to make decision in our world. I was completely naive about economics coming in, and I've left with a newfound appreciation for it. Grading, workload, etc. are all very manageable.",
    "Yes, gives great foundational skills.",
    "If you have ever wondered what economics is about, then this course is a decent introduction to the field and the frame of thinking required for econ. It is, however, a lot of graphs and solving linear equations (a result of marginal analysis), resulting in minimal conceptual understanding after the course.",
    "Yes. If you work hard you will learn a lot",
    "If it is required for your major then yes. If you want some kind of intro to the world of econ, then I guess so.",
    "Yes it was",
    "Yes, I recommend this class to everyone. I loved how big it was and I thought the content was relevant and engaging.",
    "Yes, a great introduction to economics with so much support from instructuors, TFs and peer tutors. Really well structured course.",
    "Yes, it is good to have a basic understanding of economics and It changes the way you think.",
    "Well, obviously a lot of students need this class as a prerequisite. But if you are like me, and took it just to try to learn, be aware that if this subject doesn't come to you naturally, it will require a good amount of weekly commitment in order to stay afloat in this class.",
    "I would recommend this to another student -- Professor Berry is an entertaining lecturer, and his Teaching Assistants were there to help, even outside of the short discussion sections.",
    "No, probably not unless they have to take it. It is just your basic intro lecture not much more to it.",
    "I would not recommend this course to anyone who does not have to take it. The material would be interesting, but the speed at which it is presented makes the class pretty dull.",
    "If you're like me, and you're not an Econ major, I would not recommend this course. I took it because I expected it to be extremely interesting and useful, but a good portion of the class is just memorizing terms, doing some basic math, and drawing graphs. I never really felt interested about any of the topics we learned, and the pace of the class makes it very hard to retain any information after the fact.",
    "I would highly recommend this course because it is a great introduction to economics that I found to be quite insightful.",
    "I would recommend it because I think a lot of students need to take microeconomics for their major or for their personal interest. I think it's a staple, but I wouldn't say it's something you would be missing out on if you didn't have the opportunity to take it.",
    "I would only recommend this course if you believe you are ready to put in extra work for a QR credit if you are a humanities major, OR if you are planning on majoring in economics.",
    "Yes! If you are interested in economics and want to get a taste of econ in a less stressful way.",
    "Even though the course is really fast paced, I think it is really fulfilling because at the end of the semester you will feel like you have learned a lot. However, keep in mind that because of how large the class is and how the course is organized (lecture presentations uploaded after psets are due, no recorded lectures despite number of students), lectures can get confusing and it is really easy to fall behind. When this happens, the textbooks and peer tutors will become integral for survival.",
    "I would recommend this course because it is a good intro course that gives a good overview of microeconomics. The workload is not bad (1 pset a week, doable in 2 hours) but the material is interesting and you learn a lot.",
    "Yes, I believe it provided a good introduction to microeconomics.",
    "Yes, it was difficult but expanded by knowledge.",
    "I would not recommend this course to another student. The lecture is fast-paced and often times I found myself confused by the lecture. I would have much rather preferred learning this material in a smaller seminar setting where I could be more comfortable with asking questions.",
    "Yes, as it gives the first ideas and theories of microeconomics and is important for everyone to learn.",
    "Whether the student wants to major in economics or simply have a taste of this area, this course would be an appropriate introduction.",
    "Yes",
    "I would only recommend this course to a student that is taking math classes at Yale or took high level Econ in high school. Otherwise it is not a very good idea.",
    "Yes. It was a good course for learning about microeconomics",
    "No, I would suggest taking a seminar if they think there is any chance of them having trouble engaging with the content of a lecture",
    "Yes. The professor is a terrific lecturer and the TA is very helpful as well.",
    "no",
    "Yes if this is of interest. The professor is good and the TFs are amazing. However, it does take a lot of effort on your own part to understand the content so if youre not willing to do that then you will struggle big time.",
    "Yes, but mainly because it is a required prerequisite for the economics major.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone interested in learning basic microeconomics. You learn pretty essential analysis skills that can be applied not just in econ.",
    "Students who are majoring in economics are required to take this course. For those who are not economics majors looking to have a basic understanding of economics, this course is a quite a bit more analytical and technical than one would expect from an introductory economics course. Though I have yet to take introductory macroeconomics, I would assume that ECON 116 would be a more beneficial course for those just wanting to have a taste of economics.",
    "As a student who had no prior experience with Econ, I would definitely recommend this course to a person looking for an introduction to the subject. The class provided a detailed introduction, allowing a person make an informed decision about whether they're suited for Econ.",
    "yes, if you are interested in economics.",
    "Yes, a basic knowledge of economics is a useful life skill.",
    "I would only recommend this course to another student for two reasons. One: if it's a prerequisite for a major such as Global Affairs. Two: if you are a non-STEM major looking for a relatively doable and relevant QR credit. If you are a STEM major, this class is not useful in regards to intellectual stimulation or organized comprehension of economics. I would recommend the smaller seminar (if you can get it) that encourages questions.",
    "Yes, you will gain a new way of thinking and understanding of how markets work and how consumers behave.",
    "Yes, it provides a good foundational understanding of economics.",
    "yes",
    "Yes. This course provides a framework crucial to any more advanced economic study and alone provides the foundation necessary for any jobs on the periphery of economics. It was extremely useful in understanding economic literature and the relation of applied mathematics to economics as well.",
    "I would recommend this to another student if you feel as though you have a strong foundation of economics coming into the course.",
    "I would recommend it to those who can take the time to look at past materials for study purposes.",
    "Its an okay way to figure out whether you want to consider pursuing economics, but i dont think you gain many practical skills that can apply to the real world. However, definitely evaluate whether you think you can succeed with the first midterm, and be prepared to drop it if you need to.",
    "yes because it is a requirement for econ degree. but otherwise no",
    "If the student is interested in economics, I would recommend but if not it would not be a good placement.",
    "I would recommend this course to most students even if they do not have a huge interest in the subject because it is important for people to know the material taught in this course. In life, it is good to have at least a brief introduction to the subject as it is important to know or have some sort of foundation in it for many careers.",
    "If you are curious about Econ I definitely recommend this course",
    "Yes. I just wanted to try out Econ, and, having completed the course, I would do it again. Prof Berry was funny (strong dad vibe) and used interesting real-world examples to illustrate points. (He wrote an oped in the Washington Post a few years ago if you want to cry reading his defense of you.) I enjoy understanding and being able to make Econ jokes now. I even use Yale's free subscription to the Economist now. This class also challenges political views and makes students recognize the real advantages and flaws in markets.",
    "I would recommend this course to someone who is actually wanting to major in economics.",
    "I think introductory microeconomics is very interesting however I wish it was taught in smaller seminar sections in order to really engage with the material and thoroughly understand it. I would recommend taking intro micro in the small seminar option.",
    "Yes if you like economics",
    "Yes, this course is a great introduction to economical concepts. I recommend it for anyone considering economics or is undecided in their major.",
    "Yes if they're looking to gain a basic knowledge of micro.",
    "Nah",
    "No, I thought it was taught in a very confusing way.",
    "Yes. Basic Econ skills were taught that are helpful for later",
    "Yes definitely for someone who is interesting in Econ as a potential major.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class to any student curious about economics, resource allocation, etc. Its a class with material that transcends the discipline and is taught in a manner that can interest anyone.",
    "Yes, basics everyone should know",
    "Yes, especially is Berry is teaching it.",
    "I would if you are somewhat interested in econ but not totally committed to the subject. This is certainly an easier and less informative class than the seminar. Besides for the midterms, no one is checking in to make sure you know the material. Conversely, however, it is a lot less work than the seminar and the grading is much easier.",
    "Not unless it is necessary to take as a prerequisite.",
    "Econ 115 is not particularly hard and is a great source of knowledge that I think all people should have going into life. Pretty fundamentally essential.",
    "Yes!",
    "Yes. It's a good intro econ class and the topics are important for everyone to have a basic understanding of. Take it with Berry if you can, because he's great.",
    "Yes! I recommended this class to all of my peers!",
    "I definitely would the topics covered were extremely interesting and useful.",
    "No, take the seminar.",
    "eh not really",
    "I would recommend this course to someone who knows that they already like economics.",
    "Hell nah except if you a snake or realllllly need it...",
    "Yes I would as microeconomics is necessary for life in general and this course gives a good overview.",
    "No because I really disliked the course.",
    "Yes. A good intro class to understanding micro and learning skills to be in a lecture class. The workload is a good amount.",
    "Yes! Good introduction to economics and economics specifically at Yale.",
    "yes",
    "I would recommend because I think everyone should take at least one Econ class in their lives because its just a good skill.",
    "Yes, if they like economics.",
    "This course is formulaic. The problem sets are difficult, but its not too difficult if you put in the time.",
    "Yes I would, I believe that this course was very helpful to me and I think that it is a great course for any student to take whether they like economics or not because it goes over things all people should know.",
    "I mean you have to take the course for the economics major. As far as taking it for a QR credit, theres probably other courses either easier or more interesting.",
    "Yes. It's a very solid introduction to microeconomics and the course covered a lot of real world applications.",
    "Yes, because I think it provides a good basic economics lecture class for those seeking to pursue econ in the future.",
    "Yes its a good introduction to economics with an accurate representation of Yales interdisciplinary nature as well as its workload",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to all Yale students, Econ majors and non majors.",
    "Yes. Even if just to fulfill a humanities credit its a great course on essential topics.",
    "Yes, the course provides good foundation knowledge for the economics major.",
    "Yes",
    "My answer depends on what type of class you believe that you learn best in. If seminars are more conducive to your ability to absorb information, then no, I do not recommend this class. If, on the other hand, you enjoy the opportunity to learn more on your own\/with the help of TAs and peer tutors, then yes, I do recommend Econ 115.",
    "Yes, as a foundation for other learning",
    "Yes because its a necessity for Econ major.",
    "Yes. Regardless of your major or academic interests, this course does help develop a more well-rounded view of what goes into decisions made by small firms and consumers.",

    "Yes, I believe that its a great introduction to the world of economics. The class is great for those interested in the major.",

    "I would recommend this to other students since it gives a good idea on the world of economics.",
    "Yes, if that student thinks they might be interested in economics.",
    "i would recommend the course to an econ major or someone who wants a basic knowledge of econ through the intro \/ intermediate sequence. if you want to take the course just because everyone takes econ, please think again and have an actual reason why you would be taking this class."
