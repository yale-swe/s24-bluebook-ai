   "comments": [
    "Absolutely take this class! It is a great writing and humanities credit, and if you love literature, you'll love this class and its exploration of about 20 works throughout history. There is a lot of reading that you need to keep on top of, but it is totally doable. There are only 4 papers and a final, so the workload is not too much as long as you keep up with the reading.",
    "A challenging literature course; I'd recommend it to any student who is willing to invest the time and effort it takes to closely read literature from The Iliad to modern plays. If a student is not as interested, I might not recommend it; I never tried it, but I imagine getting behind on readings in this course would be very tough for a student.",
    "I would recommend the course to another student interested in the works read and interested in theater. I would warn that the reading for this class is pretty extensive.",
    "This class, along with the other literature courses, is perfect for anyone who wants to read more than they want to write. While there are quite a few pages to be read for each class, the texts are all well worth the time.",
    "English 129 covers tragedy from the Iliad (not a play, but fits well into the theme of the course) to modern times. It moves very quickly and for most classes you need to read a new play. The plays are well chosen for the most part and cover the basics of theatre. It's a very good introduction to theatre accessible to all students no matter the back ground or major, and Professor Roach did an excellent job leading discussions. As someone who definitely isn't a humanities major I have no problems saying that this is one of the best courses I've taken at yale I would take it again given the chance.",
    "Without a doubt take Tragedy--and, if you can, take it with Professor Roach. If you like theatre--and this is really the only form of theatre; everyone else is reacting to it--this class is a must.",
    "Absolutely! I came in thinking, \"Do I really want to spend this semester reading a bunch of depressing plays\" THAT IS NOT AT ALL WHAT THIS COURSE IS ABOUT. Tragedy is so much more than bad things happening to good people, or good things happening to bad people, or whatever you may initially think. It is deeply rooted in themes such as honor and justice, sacrifice and love, amongst others. As others will tell you, the amount of reading TO BEGIN WITH is a lot, because you start by reading the Iliad pretty quickly. However, this is a necessary evil that does not last too long, and then you have a very rich set of ideas to take with you into your readings thereafter. Finally, the grading is based on section participation (and thus reading), four papers, and a final. These are all manageable. The papers are only 4-6 pages each. This is a course for human beings, not just English majors, or students who feel the need to relate their recent breakups to something much more significant.",
    "Engl 129 with Professor Roach is a must-take English class! Tragedies may sound depressing, but you will be surprised. Aside from opening your eyes to the world, Professor Roach is a wonderful and approachable professor who sincerely cares about improving your writing skills. I strongly recommend you to embark on this exciting journey with him!"
