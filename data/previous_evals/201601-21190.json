   "comments": [
    "It's likely that if you're reading this, you're a physics major and have to take this class, but have no fear! It's an amazing class, and lots of fun! You'll learn a lot of new physics, and improve your experimental skills. All the TFs are fun and cool, and Steve Lamoreaux is an amazing professor. There really aren't any downsides to this class, especially if you can get a friend to take it with.",
    "Very useful class if you want to experimental research in the future. The students would benefit a lot from updated handouts, especially for the ising model experiment, since it's mandatory. The handouts are very outdated and they are not super intuitive, so it can get very annoying at times. I really enjoyed the Superconducting Tunnel Junction experiment. It was the hardest, but Ben was by far the best TA ever. If Ben is TAing and you can do this experiment, just do it. Your experience with each experiment varies a lot depending on the TA you get. I think it would also be nice if we had only two experiments and only 3 hours per week, because 6 hours per week limits us a lot when we're trying to pick other classes. Anyhow, if you're looking at this, you probably have to take this class, so just take it out of your way.",
    "Great course, and not too much work if you don't wait until the last minute!",
    "Unlike most other lab courses, this one is actually enjoyable. All of the experiments are very interesting and appropriate for undergrads. Your success in an experiment is very dependent on your TA, however, so choose experiments by TA instead of topic."
