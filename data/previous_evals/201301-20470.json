    "Take it! It's a great way to satisfy the research seminar requirements and develop a larger project.",
    "I would describe it as a research\/writing seminar that is quite open-ended in terms of the subject of one's project, but united by its focus on interdisciplinary methods (however one wishes to define this). Although each student approached \"interdisciplinarity\" differently, I would say the class was primarily grounded in historical and anthropological methods. I would recommend the class to American Studies students, but recommend to students outside that department only if they know they will be getting an outside perspective (which is certainly valuable).",
    "I would recommend it wholeheartedly and describe it as a seminar tailor-made to help you write that first chapter of the dissertation or, at the very least, write an article that can serve as a model for that first chapter of the dissertation."
