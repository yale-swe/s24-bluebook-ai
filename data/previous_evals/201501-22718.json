    "A great course for anyone interested in film or Polish history and enjoyable with a manageable workload(only two papers and weekly responses).",
    "I would recommend this course to other students at Yale because it is an interesting class that was fun to go to. I always looked forward to Monday and Wednesday afternoons because I got to attend this class. The films were super interesting, and they are films that I never would have watched otherwise had I not taken this class.",
    "Recommend it only if you're interested in watching old films for the Communism times",
    "This was a great course! We watched a ton of great movies, most of which I probably never would have seen. I learned a ton about Polish history and Communism in the Soviet Bloc and it was fascinating to see how different Polish filmmakers treated the issues. Prof. Illakowicz is a great professor. She is brilliant and so clearly loves all the films she teaches. She is very helpful when it comes to writing the papers and met with me multiple times to flesh out my ideas for them. More than any professor Ive had, she pushes all of her students to analyze the works closely and dig deeper, often leading to very interesting discussions. That said, many students in our class were very quiet and we sometimes had trouble keeping discussion alive, but I think she did an impressive job igniting conversation considering."
