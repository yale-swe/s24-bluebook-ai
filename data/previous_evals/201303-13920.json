   "comments": [
    "I would absolutely recommend this course, not just to an Americanist, but to anyone who is interested in the history of classification, representation, observation, and imaging. It's a course that develops a thorough foundation in some very broad intellectual issues, enabling future (more focused) study in any of these areas.",
    "I would recommend the course to students who have a stronger background in the history of science (or an interest to pursue this material independently). I think this would have greatly improved my experience and given me more confidence in choosing and writing the term paper.",
    "Definitely take this course if you want a rich history in late eighteenth century modes of knowledge circulation; particularly in the American context."

   "comments": [
    "I came in knowing that I was interested in the history of observation, disciplining of vision, and the emergence of modernity. Since the course offered some great opportunities to pursue research in these areas, I was able to develop a project along these lines that I hope to refine beyond the seminar. The coursework definitely provided ample material that ought to help me in more advanced years as my research takes shape.",
    "The theoretical bent to the course was challenging and a good counterpoint, I believe, to my usual methodology. It was interesting to explore something completely out of my area of specialization. But I would have preferred stronger direction and less thematic-focused sessions, which did not really coalesce into something more substantial for me.",
    "I do not have a sense of how this course contributed to my knowledge of my discipline - in some ways it seems unrelated, yet it is an engaging sub-field.",
    "Great exposure to a time period I hadn't yet been exposed to."
