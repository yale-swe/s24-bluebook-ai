    "Not as interesting as it should be",
    "One of the best classes I've had at Yale. Professor Brodsky does an excellent job covering the material and letting students have a personal learning experience. Not too much work, and material is not very difficult. You will be rewarded for your effort very fairly in this class.",
    "I highly recommend this course--it's a great way to learn about something you wouldn't learn about otherwise. Just stay up to date on the reading, and you'll have a great time.",
    "I would recommend the class for anyone who likes music and wants a glimpse into the world of early music. It can be frustrating at times trying to decipher what a lecture was about but overall it was a pleasant experience.",
    "I don't know whether to recommend this class or not. I honestly don't. It's so different from anything else at Yale...sometimes in a good way. If you want to learn about a lot of ancient music, though, go for it.",
    "This is, hands-down, one of the best courses I have taken at Yale. It was not only a new way of thinking about music, but a new way of thinking about the world. Prof. Brodsky's lectures were consistently transcendent; he puts so much effort into them, and they become an all-encompassing immersive experience. In a lecture that ended at 3:45, I usually checked my watch for the first time at 3:50. Not a lot of work either \u0097 a pretty easy way to expand your horizons and try something new that will make you a better person.",
    "Just what is sounds like: starting with Gregorian chant you progress through organum, motet (sacred and secular), chanson (many varieties), morality play, cyclic mass, early music drama, madrigal, baroque opera, lyric opera, and then the instrumental age of the 17th and 18th centuries with the sonata, toccata, cantata, concerto... this is music that all people enmeshed in the western tradition (that's you) should know about.",
    "Take it! Music won't be the same experience for you!"
