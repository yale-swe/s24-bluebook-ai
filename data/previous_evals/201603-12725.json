   "comments": [
    "I enjoy the lectures a lot.",
    "Strengths: very straightforward, professors asked questions to check understanding, material was relevant (mostly), not too much homework or reading Weaknesses: quite dry, but what do you expect for a statistics course? sometimes glossed over certain topics without giving explanation and used terms unfamiliar to newbies.",
    "The course is appropriately paced. The labs could most likely be done independently with a TA walking around, instead of the TA walking us through it.",
    "The lab portion was not useful at all - I have gained no knowledge of how to use SPSS and never used it to do the homework. At the beginning, the course was taught at a high school level as there were high school students in the first week fo the course. I liked the nightly homework assignments as they cemented the knowledge we reviewed in class.",
    "It's a lot of information packed into a two-week course. Overall, it was a little much to be absorbed"

    "I would recommend this to anyone who is interested in biostatistics.",
    "Good for newcomers to statistics, especially in medical research. Nice that it was intensive to get it out of the way, and to learn all at the same time.",
    "Yes. I thought that the course provided a good overview of biostatisticsal methods in a short-period of time.",
    "I would because despite its flaws, the course helped me remember what I knew about statistics."
