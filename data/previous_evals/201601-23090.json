   "comments": [
    "The Death of God is a survey of a strand of European intellectual history from the early 1800s to the present tracing attitudes towards religion and the Christian God. The course raises questions about how to define religion, what the relationship is between the sacred and profane, the connection between religion and art\/aesthetics, and the relationship between religion\/the religious impulse and revolutionary politics. The course is structured around a fascinating array of texts, including Goethe, Kandinsky, Nietzsche, Marx, Kierkegaard, and Baudrillard. Professor Khawaja is outstanding, truly one of the most impressive professors I've had the pleasure of learning from. I would strongly recommend this course.",
    "This was a quirky philosophy of religion \/ art theory class. You read some interesting pieces and have stimulating discussions. I often felt confused along the way, but in the end I felt like I did gain a solid grasp of the major themes of the course. I would recommend if you enjoy heavy topics in philosophy of religion and philosophy of art, and if you don't mind a course whose syllabus isn't extremely cohesive, but keep in mind that this is not your standard religious studies class.",
    "Every reading is interesting, but requires a good deal of time to complete and process.",
    "An intense seminar tackling intense readings. Really rewarding and I enjoyed the class overall - I definitely feel like I learned a lot, although still not clear what I learned. Highly recommend if you're interested in the readings and asking deep questions!",
    "A wild mix of theology, philosophy, and aesthetics and a lot of open-eneded investigations into some seriously difficult and seriously fascinating texts. Professor Khawaja is also great, brilliant, and is herself so endlessly curious. If you are looking for structure, you may find the open-endedness of the papers and the seminar frustrating, but would recommend if you are up the challenge of developing your own lines of inquiry.",
    "This class has a lot of potential to be great. At best it is an aesthetic approach to the death of God problem. Professor Khawaja has a lot to say, so take advantage of her office hours if you're interested in continuing the discussion."
