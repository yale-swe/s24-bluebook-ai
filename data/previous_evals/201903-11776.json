    "I really liked the semi-flexible deadlines we had for certain parts of the thesis--it was a great way of keeping us on track. I also liked that sometimes we had class once every two weeks so that we have time to work on our theses and consult the TA\/professor. I also liked that we get to hear about each other's projects and progress in class."
