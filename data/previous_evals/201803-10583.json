    "Strengths: excellent lectures, great problem sets, an overall good approach to a term project Weaknesses: perhaps too few problem sets, maybe 4 or 5 instead would have been better for the purpose of cementing some of the more complicated topics into our minds Improvement: building a semi-analytical model of galaxy formation would be a great idea, so whenever Frank has time to put together that component for a future rendition of this course, I think it would be very helpful as a 5th problem set. Also, perhaps there is too much material in the class? I feel like we spend a very small amount of time on any one thing in particular, and I probably could have learned more overall if we had focused more time on individual topics instead of covering so much stuff.",
    "Strength- good focus on the physics of structure formation, good overview of the scientific papers in various topics Weakness- should incorporate some relativistic perturbation theory"

    "Absolutely. Frank's the best lecturer I've had in my time at Yale. To be fair, at face value this isn't the hardest thing to achieve, as the first-year grad course instructors in physics are particularly not good. Frank's class blew all of them out of the water.",
    "Yes definitely. This is by far the best course I have done in Yale Astronomy. Instructors taking other Astronomy courses should learn from the organization and presentation of this course.",
    "yes"
