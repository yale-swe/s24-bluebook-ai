   "comments": [
    "I wouldn't recommend it. There are much better seminars out there. The readings are interesting, but that's your main source of information from the class. Negroponte and Wittenstein, while nice and interesting people, use this seminar as a venue to tell their career stories rather than actually teach the class.",
    "Hard to say. On one hand, the workload isn't crazy for a seminar and most of it is very interesting if you find the intelligence world interesting, which you probably do if you're even checking out the class. Professor Wittenstein and Ambassador Negroponte are both former practitioners, although not really from the sexy intelligence collection kind of things. That being said, I thought they deferred to students a little bit too much. I like that they value our opinions but one of the great things about taking a class from \"experts\" is that they can provide insights you might not find in books. Ambassador Negroponte would grace us with a couple short stories every class, but Professor Wittenstein rarely shared any sort of specific knowledge gained from being a CIA analyst, either deferring to the readings, Negroponte, or one of the pompous grad students in the class. The class being based on discussion also means that the other students really make a difference. We had a few grad students who liked nothing more than to pontificate and debate with one another, so that was really annoying. Overall, an interesting and unique course but don't expect to walk away at the semester feeling like your life has been changed.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. Taking a class like this one is really an incredible opportunity to read interesting things and talk to amazing people. The professors alone are some of the most interesting people I've ever met, and some weeks there were guests brought in to guest teach that I never dreamed of meeting, let alone getting to discuss foreign policy and intelligence with. The readings for the course were a lot of work, so don't take this class if you're not willing to put in the time and the effort to do the work. You'll get a lot more out of it if you're able to participate in the discussions every day. Grades are based on participation, a group project (threat assessment briefing project), a briefing memo, and a final paper on an intelligence topic. The projects are interesting and don't necessarily take as much time as they seem, although the final paper takes significant effort. Definitely recommend this course.",
    "This is a great class to take if you're interested in how the intelligence community in the US operates, and what sort of work an intelligence analyst does. Not a great class if you're only interested in learning about CIA-influenced foreign policy, this is more about the workings of the intelligence community than its overseas actions.",
    "It is a very good course if you are interested in intelligence (intelligence is really the focus of the class). The assignments were interesting and the professors cannot be beat in terms of their backgrounds. However, I wish they had spoken\/lectured more and that the class was less discussion-based.",
    "I would wholeheartdly reccommend the course for those students interested in national security issues, foreign policy and international affairs. I think this course is really high level and provides for a great opportunity to further ones knoweldge, and immerse oneself in issues which stand at the front of public diplomacy today.",
    "It's a great class, definitely recommend it.",
    "If you can get in to the class, you're in for a good time. Amazing subject to study, with sensitive and secretive issues being discussed in an academic environment between former decision makers, former soldiers and diplomats, plus a few college undergraduates. Bring your a-game.",
    "GLBL 392 provides a good overview of the Intelligence Community. Each week the class covers a different topic, such as Cyber Security, Terrorism, etc. Almost the entire class time is class discussion. Overall I learned a lot from the class. This was due in large part to the fact that my classmates were very experienced. Professors Wittenstein and Negroponte are REALLY knowledgeable, so if you take the class make sure to take advantage of this opportunity to ask them things. As with most 9:25 seminars, some classes could be kind of boring. It's not the most engaging seminar I've taken but overall I'd recommend taking it if you're interested in the Intelligence Community.",
    "DEFINITELY take",
    "I would recommend, but I would also say that the class was not as critical as I had hoped.",
    "Would absolutely recommend this course. Unlike any other course I've taken at Yale.",
    "Good overview of intelligence issues in foreign policy. Discussion sometimes veers away from intelligence into more generic discussions.",
    "Take it, even if you only take it to listen to Negroponte and Wittenstein's stories about their time working in intelligence in the US government. The class my year had a bunch of students in it who were also intelligence professionals in other countries (mostly from the grad school) and that made for amazing discussions on a topic that's already pretty interesting."
