    "Take this class! German is a great language to learn, and the class goes at a reasonable pace. The homework is not bad at all, and going to class is actually fun.",
    "Highly recommended. The German department is great, and ist ias a good language to learn to get your requirement out of the way. There is a strong emphasis on speaking whoch is good to learn to become conversational quickly.",
    "I have already recommended this course to all of my friends, provided that Ansgar is teaching. You can get so much out of this course if you put the effort into it, and thus, I would highly recommend my peers take German 1 with Ansgar.",
    "Take it!",
    "Take this course if you want to learn German.",
    "Excellent class! Ansgar Mohnkern was great, but he's probably not going to be at Yale next year. Luckily, the German department as a whole seems to be very adept at makingthis class enjoyable yet substantive and as thorough as a first-semester language course can reasonably be expected to be. This semester, my class got a sampling of other teachers from the department (since Ansgar had to miss a few weeks), and while they obviously had different styles and capabilities, they all seemed personable and successful at teaching the material. So whoever you have, you'll almost certainly be in good hands."
