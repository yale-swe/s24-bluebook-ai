    "Very interesting, useful, demanding.",
    "Provides a nuanced and multifaceted look at \"Renaissance Italy,\" a subject which is often limited to studies of the classics and culture. Should be required for anyone interested in early modern Europe.",
    "HIST 632 gives participants deep knowledge of foundational readings in the history of medieval and early modern Italy. For anyone without a solid foothold in this field, Francesca's course is invaluable for orienting students within the past few decades of the historiography and furthermore in bringing us in direct contact with ongoing debates (as evidenced by our speakers series)."

   "question_text": "How did this course deepen your knowledge of your discipline\/profession? To what extent did this course contribute to your dissertation\/research?",
   "comments": [
    "While there are many things I could put here, I would emphasize the underlying question of the course: how do linguistic\/national historiographies approach topics differently, and what can we as historians do to breach these differences? This is question that is rarely discussed in other courses, yet seems to be the central epidemiological quandary of historians today.",
    "The course's speaker series was especially helpful. The perspectives offered by scholars such as Fusaro and Tommasino were inspiring in the way that they encouraged letting our primary sources guide our research and that it is indeed possible to shed new light on classics within the historiography, such as Ginzburg's The Cheese and the Worms. Francesca also did a great job describing how to maximize the research process and our historiography papers."
