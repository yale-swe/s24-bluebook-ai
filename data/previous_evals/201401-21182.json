   "comments": [
    "Amazing class! Definitely take it if you're curious to learn more about art and literary history in France. I came into the class having only a little background knowledge (basically none) but Mme. Girard's teaching is so engaging that it really didn't matter. Make sure you're comfortable speaking and reading lots in French.",
    "I would recommend this to someone looking for a different kind of French course. It is very enjoyable as a break from only literature, and the art definitely adds a whole new perspective to the study of the language, not to mention an expanded vocabulary.",
    "FREN 366 is exactly what the course title describes, with more emphasis on artists than writers. We discussed not only their works but also how the writers and artists themselves interacted. Great balance of depth and breadth; we usually spent about a day on each individual artist and writer and I feel I have a really solid grasp of the major works and the artists\/writers of the time. Paper and oral presentation topics were also fairly flexible and were a great opportunity to explore more in depth things we brushed on in class or research a topic that we didn't manage to cover. Professor Girard is incredibly knowledgable and the subject matter of this course is exactly her field of expertise. She'll easily answer any questions you have but also spent the majority of the course essentially lecturing to our class of 6 students. Example: we took a class trip to the Marville exhibit at the Met and she spent 3 hours talking about essentially every photo in the exhibit individually. At some point towards the middle of the semester, we got a little off the syllabus so the readings no longer corresponded to the lectures and there were many readings we barely discussed that all. This was the first time this course was taught so it's unclear how and if it might change if taught in the future, but there was A LOT of reading (sometimes 80+ pages of primary sources), which is not evident on the syllabus posted online. It was usually pretty interesting and not a terribly difficult for L5 French but just too much, especially since I had other reading-heavy courses.",
    "Yes I recommend, even if you think you aren't interested in art. I would take this course just for the professor."
