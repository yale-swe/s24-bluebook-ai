    "Awesome, AWESOME class. Professor Gage is a great discussion leader and a passionate professor. The subject matter focuses on domestic communism mainly pre-McCarthy so if you're looking for a Cold War perspective this might not be your best bet. It has a lot of reading and you NEED to do it, but I would really suggest it to anyone who is interested in Communism or government response to civilian unrest or potential treason.",
    "This was by far my favorite class this semester. Professor Gage is a Badass, and it's fascinating stuff. I recommend it highly. The readings are a lot, but they are worth it.",
    "I would absolutely recommend communism and anticommunism--professor Gage is one of the best history profs at Yale, she's really smart and knowledgeable and shows a real interest in helping students. The class discussion is good, though it can lag occasionally. The work is not too much--2 3 page reading responses, a 5 page paper and a final 20 page one--that might sound like a lot, but it is spread out well and professor Gage helps a lot throughout the research paper process. Really great for history students and others alike.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class. It has been one of my favorites at Yale so far, and it has made me love history as a field of study. Even if you are not a history major, take it, because the topic of communism is just such an INTERESTING topic and is so relevant to everything about American society (more so than you might think at first). Professor Gage is also the best! There is a large chunk of reading each week, and it is evident that most people in the class do the reading, so it's rather awkward when you don't. The readings are mostly rather interesting, though, so while the workload is sizeable it's also very doable."
