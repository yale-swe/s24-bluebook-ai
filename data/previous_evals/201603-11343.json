   "comments": [
    "Aspects of musical theater songwriting, which is different than pop and classical in key ways, which you learn in the course.",
    "Lyric writing and rhyme scheme, accompaniment variation, melody writing, song form, collaborating with a lyricist, harmonic structure.",
    "Although it was a lot of work to write and perform a song once every week, this class is one of the most practically useful classes I've taken at Yale. I've developed the skills to write music more proficiently, and Josh really helped push the harmonic trajectory of my songs. This class impacted me immensely and now I'm considering doing more musical theatre in the future.",
    "MUSI 214 required me to be creative and adaptable. This mainly came from the feedback that I received from Professor Rosenblum and my classmates who challenged me to write songs that were more effective in a show.",
    "I developed skills in songwriting and song form through peer commentary and learning through my friends. Through listening and analyzing acclaimed musical theater songs, I now have a better understand of what makes a song interesting, complex, and popular",
    "As someone who has written for musical theater in the past (though almost all music), this class was excellent in expanding my horizons and letting me grapple with my abilities as a lyricist and storyteller of both words and music. I learned how art is not just for the sake of the artist, but that one must take the audience into account, especially in the world of musical theater. It was amazing to see how different minds could take so many approaches with the same source material. I learned how to structure songs effectively (while breaking that structure purposefully when needed). I really was forced (thankfully!!!) to confront the mistakes and weaknesses of my work and focus on revisions, all to improve the message and quality of my pieces. Always write, even if it's not always stellar."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "You get to write several songs, which is the only way to improve at songwriting. And getting a chance to listen to other students' work each week helps give you ideas as well. Yale is also fairly connected to professionals on Broadway, so if you're interested in getting into that world, take this class. Josh gives good practical advice on certain aspects of the business (i.e. that you need to be able to perform your own songs at the piano as a way to pitch them to people.) Also, I've personally written pop in the past which people said \"sounded like musicals\" and having taken this class I now have a clearer sense of which elements of my songs sounded that way and can more consciously choose to either emphasize that, or write differently.",
    "Strengths: Forces students to produce material at a high level each week. Seminar structure allows each student to receive individualized attention and constructive criticism on their pieces. Weaknesses: Not applicable",
    "The main strength is that we get to compose a song every week which can be challenging but really develops you as a composer. The concert at the end of the year also allows you to see your composition performed in full in collaboration with the musical theatre performance class. The assignments were varied and very interesting. I was excited every week to hear what we were assigned to do next. We set lyrics to songs, wrote lyrics to music, wrote both the lyrics and the music, wrote for movie adaptations etc. The only thing I'd say is it would be great if we could see a list of the assignments and how many we have left until our performance. I wanted to write something different for the performance but it turned out we had to decided much earlier than I expected. I also wish we had more time to receive comprehensive feedback and chances to edit our pieces.",
    "The strength of this class is definitely its collaborative nature - after you present a song, you truly feel that the workshopping that the class does on it will help you create a better product afterwards. The weakness of this course only comes from the student's ability to consistently produce a strong product each week. The demanding course load may mean that you have to present a song that's not at its best a couple of times. Managing your time, then, will just be your biggest struggle.",
    "My strengths I believe is a innate sense of a good melody and what makes a song remain interesting throughout. I feel that I could expand my abilities for accompaniment writing and piano playing in general. I could also use more training on writing good lyrics.",
    "It was amazing to get to write a song every week, what an incredible opportunity! And to just spend a lengthy class period listening to others and offering feedback was such an invaluable experience, I gravitate towards that sort of thing, and this class fulfilled it. One weakness I did find is that I wish we spent more time actively critiquing the work and understanding it rather than just going through it and abstractly discussing what we liked and didn't like. The class was conducted casually, though sometimes to a fault. In the future, I encourage students to actively and honestly critique the work, and for Josh to lead the class with a bit more drive and purpose than usual. I think that will make the work of a higher quality and the course ultimately more rewarding. I also think revisions are very important! While I was very grateful for the one course assignment near the end of the semester where we were able to revise our work, I think it would be beneficial to incorporate some mandatory revision during the course itself (whether in lieu of a new song or in addition to one, though the workload is already a lot). Have everyone send their material to Josh for feedback, I wish I did more!"

   "comments": [
    "If you want to write musicals, then take it. Obviously.",
    "Absolutely. I have developed so much as a composer, lyricist and musician in this course. It gave me an excellent foundation to pursue further composition classes at Yale.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS! If you're not scared of hard work. I spent many Thursday nights locked up with a piano. But now I have pieces that I'm very proud of and I really notice how I've improved. I can now easily hear cool harmonies in my head and transfer them down. The concert at the end of the year also allows you to see your composition performed in full, in collaboration with the musical theatre performance class. The assignments were varied and very interesting. I was excited every week to hear what we were assigned to do next. We set lyrics to songs, wrote lyrics to music, wrote both the lyrics and the music, wrote for movie adaptations, we collaborated with the lyric writing class etc. The only thing I'd say is it would be great if we could see a list of the assignments and how many we have left until our performance. I wanted to write something different for the performance but it turned out we had to decided much earlier than I expected. I also wish we had more time to receive comprehensive feedback and chances to edit our pieces. But anyways, this class CHANGED me. I'm now looking for more opportunities to write for musical theatre.",
    "This is great class for developing your songwriting skills, and I would definitely recommend it to someone who plans to write more music in the future either intensely or for fun. Beware, though, the class is fairly fast paced, so if you want each of songs to be the best quality, you should start them early and make time throughout the week to revisit it.",
    "Absolutely! I would recommend this course to anyone who loves musical theater, loves writing songs, and who wants to make some wonderful and talented friends through support and love for music.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student! Know, however, going in, that while the class does welcome students of all abilities and backgrounds musically, many participants will have substantial music experience. The ability to notate work is ESSENTIAL in the class (though the music lab in Stoeckel catalyzed that process, so great that it's open for 24 hours!). Truly, the amount of effort and care that one puts into the class will decide how much a student will get out of it, and the more one puts in, the more rewarding the experience will be. This was my favorite class during my first semester at Yale, and I'm so glad Yale offers courses like these, that combine intellectual thought and logic with creativity and love for the material and for the art. And fun! The class was both challenging and fun, which is exactly what a class should be."
