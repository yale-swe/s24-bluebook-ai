    "This course really helped me develop my writing skill. Although I previously took an writing credit, this class helped much more. Now, I am much more confident in my writing, and I feel that I am prepared to write essays for any other classes.",
    "I developed a much better understanding of how to complicate my academic writing . While my academic writing of old was very stale, Professor Wilson's class introduced me to more nuanced approaches to getting a point across. It also encouraged me to think more deeply about how other writers are crafting their argument in the texts we read.",
    "I honed my writing skills and became a more analytical thinker.",
    "I learned how to write well."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "This course was very interesting and definitely the right amount of work. While four essays (and even more drafts) is very daunting, the workload was manageable and definitely benefited me in the long run. The only complaint would be that besides the papers we did very few writing practices, which I feel could be helpful and fun.",
    "A strength is the opportunity for lots of feedback on papers if you choose to put in effort into your preliminary draft. Furthermore, Prof Wilson is a fair and often generous grader. A weakness would be that several of the readings are somewhat dry, but this is the case wth most ENGL 114 classes. At least in Consumer Culture in the U.S., the readings never become too repetitive as the focus of the readings shifts throughout the semester.",
    "The strength of this course lies in the class discussions",
    "Strengths: A beautifully organized course that surveys over some of the major themes in advertisements through a number of very well thought out readings. Everything about this class is really organized, which makes for a really cohesive feel. The trip to the med school was especially memorable. I also thought that Professor Willson was very good at facilitating our discussions, allowing everyone to feel included in the argument, and like all our opinions were valid ones to have. The feedback we got both in writing workshops and on graded papers helped me become all in all a better writer. Weaknesses: Not enough time in the semester. Room for Improvements: I know that some sections of 114 force students to go to the professor for 1-on-1's about paper drafts. I know Professor Willson might be busy but that really would have made approaching him outside of class just a bit less scary (not that he's a scary guy)."

    "Absolutely! This was honestly one of my favorite classes this semester. While the work load seems intimidating, it is very well organized and maneagable. Also, Andrew Willson is so helpful and understanding, so the class is guaranteed to be enjoyable Not only will you develop your writing skill, but the content is extremely fascinating as well.",
    "I would recommend this course to any student looking to take care of a writing credit or fulfill English requirement for either major or Pre-Med. Andrew is a very fun professor who always keeps the class on a lighter note. Also, I learned quite a lot about how to improve my own academic writing.",
    "This is a fantastic course. I've now had Professor Willson for two semesters of English courses, and all I can say is that he's a phenomenal teacher -- I think the best I've had at Yale. He's kind, witty, thoughtful, and always keeps the class engaged no matter the topic at hand. Your writing will improve tremendously. Absolutely take this course.",
    "A little word of advice: if you really want to take this class, wait until you're at least a sophomore. It's really hard to get in off the lottery, but if you show up the first day for the waiting list, Prof Willson prioritizes nonfreshmen so I got in easily. Anyways, in terms of the course, YES YES YES YES YES YES. It is by far the best 114 section available. While most of your 114 peers might strugglebus through the entire semester, I could honestly say without a doubt this is the most fulfilling class out of 4 semesters worth of classes. Professor Willson organized one powerful class that is really not too heavy on the reading. As the title alludes to, this section focuses on advertisements throughout american history. Your first paper is literally on a commercial, while your big research paper can also be on images. Yet that's also what made it so interesting: you can see what you're talking about in class and talk about it with works from critics who have spent their whole lives doing this. There's also a cool unit on just reading the Great Gatsby that opened my eyes to the complex and beautiful message that Fitzgerald encrypted within the book's beautifully written descriptions. All in all, I enjoyed writing each paper and can say that this class made me a stronger writer. So if you get in, take it. You will not regret it."
