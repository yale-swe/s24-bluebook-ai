    "Su laoshi's stories are great and the lectures were all very interesting, but as far as learning Chinese goes, this probably isn't the best class. I would still take it though because Su laoshi is very entertaining and it's a chill way to get a Chinese credit while learning a reasonable amount about China.",
    "Yes, taking class with Su Wei is entertaining, and you will learn as much in this class as any upper-level Chinese language class at Yale.",
    "If you're advanced enough, and you're looking to continue work in Chinese and understanding Chinese culture, it's a good course. Don't expect to greatly improve your language skills outside of reading capabilities and traditional characters.",
    "Definitely take this class if you are looking for a good L5."
