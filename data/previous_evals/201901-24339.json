I also think my pronunciation has improved drastically, even though I still can't roll my r's.",

    "Excellently constructed, vocabulary was easy and grammar well-taught.",
    "Having class everyday is both great and kinda annoying. It does help though",
    "I understand that immersion is a proven way to teach a language quickly and organically, but teaching even grammar lessons in Spanish got to be confusing - especially when we could only ask questions in Spanish - which personally led to a spiral of being confused and not knowing how to ask a question.",
    "I think the strengths of the course are the constant reinforcement of core concepts and structures, and the daily homework was also really helpful. I think a weakness could be that sometimes some things show up earlier in the course that we don't really go in depth on until later in the course, so more explanation upon first site would be helpful (por vs. para, reflexive verbs like llamarse).",

    "If you want to learn spanish and have no experience or little experience, this is the time and place to do it",
    "You are definitely at a disadvantage if you have never taken Spanish before, especially since the professor will assume that you know certain grammatical constructions\/verb conjugations before you formally learn them. I would suggest taking Latin unless you have taken Spanish before.",
    "If you want to learn spanish, yes.",
    "Yes! Yes! Yes! She's so nice and it's super easy to learn in her class."
