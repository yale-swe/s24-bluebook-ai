    "I would recommend taking this class, especially compared to last semester. It gives you a nice overview of the Chinese you can study in the future.",
    "Hella characters every night. Sometimes it's 30 sometimes it's 50, which is significantly lighter for those coming back from a summer in China. But, if you're going into this class from 130\/140, as I did, expect it to be difficult to remember the characters at first without a TON of studying and practice.",
    "This class is a lot of work, but memorizing characters is necessary for making progress in learning Chinese, and the teachers are very supportive.",
    "I would say this course is a high-level continuation of Chinese learning at Yale. There is definitely less conversational practice and the topics are very academic and not-everyday. I think the pace of progress is slower in this course than in prior Chinese courses (especially since the content isn't life skills or conversational), but perhaps that is expected when you have difficult, academic subjects\/topics. I would recommend this course to another student who is interested in studying Chinese propaganda, politics, and economy and maintaining his\/her Chinese.",
    "It's an alright class but I can't tell if I've learned anything and the work is frankly too much. If you can avoid it, do. Skip it and go to China instead!!"
