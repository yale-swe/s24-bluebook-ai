   "comments": [
    "I really did not like the high-school style micro-managing of discussion.That being said, I enjoyed trying my hand at filmmaking, and the films were fantastic.",
    "Take it! It will enhance your ability to talk about film and appreciate film overall. Just know that some of the films are tedious to watch, however, it's cultural literacy. Tough it out.",
    "It is a great Intro class to authorship theories, which is a key phase in the history of film criticism. I would totally recommend the class to students intersted in film criticism, film studies in general and literary criticism.",
    "Take it if you really like these Italian movies -- don't take it to learn much about auteur theory. Honestly, not a good course, though Prof. Marcus is great.",
    "Yes. If you want a good foundation in film and film theory.",
    "Take this course if it's offered again. The films are challenging, but if you approach them with an open mind, you'll be well rewarded.",
    "Yes! If it\u0092s offered again you should definitely consider taking it. It\u0092s great. Both Professor Marcus and Mike are knowledgeable about the material, are easy to talk to and most of the movies we saw were great. The readings are not too bad, although there are a lot of assignments, but they are fun to do and not too horrible time-wise. Also, auteur theory is a very interesting theoretical path to tread upon and is malleable to use in order to support your arguments, which is always quite fun.",
    "A very rich exploration of three Italian directors' films in the same era, and of theories concerning the author. The course could be related in many ways to two other classes I am taking: \"Tolstoy\" and \"DIONYSUS IN MODERNITY\"I would recommend it to a student. Since it is rich in material, has very good teachers, and it has fun film exercises that give you a chance to imitate these three great directors."
