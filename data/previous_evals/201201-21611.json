   "comments": [
    "You'll take it if you have to. No practical exam, but you write actual lab reports unlike in 205. Start on them ahead of time. And don't do the Millikan lab. The data is very hard to get, and the lab is frustrating.",
    "Good course. A lot of work, difficult and frustrating at times (around 3 am in the morning the night before labs are due), but in the end, very interesting. Don't assume that this course is anything like 205, though. It's worth it if you have the time.",
    "If you're a physics major, you have to do it. If you're not, it's still a good class because you perform significantly more interesting experiments than Physics 205 lab (that class was hell) and you don't have a final exam. The crux of it ends up being: do you get a nice TA that grades you fairly, or do you get someone less...generous.",
    "Way better than PHYS 205L - I definitely enjoyed this lab. You get to do some cool classical physics experiment, and you get to choose which ones you do from a list. I recommend superconductivity, Millikan oil drop (it's a little tedious, but cool to see for yourself), digital logic, x-ray diffraction, and nuclear scattering. There's a lab report each week, but no final practical\/exam.",
    "Fun lab. Much better than 205.I basically chose the labs with the least amount of work (basically, nothing with circuits)",
    "It's much more interesting than 205L and has some really cool experiments. If you're considering taking this class, it's probably necessary for your major\/pre-med stuff. But the ability to choose your own experiments makes this class pretty fun.",
    "If you took Physics 205L and were disenchanted, take this course. It is a lot better, and as long as you choose the right experiments, you get to do super cool stuff and have fun with it. If you're not so used to writing lab reports, you may have some difficulty, since that stuff has a significant learning curve.",
    "very worth if you get a lenient TA, experiments are amazing but begin the reports before the night before or else you'll have 7-8 all-nights lined up in your semester",
    "You probably have to take this if you took 205, but it's a good course anyway. It's better than 205 in my opinion. You choose a partner going into the course, and stick with them the whole time. It's not really a whole class kind of lab environment like 205 was; the whole room is basically you and your partner, with another group maybe nearby doing another lab (no two groups do the same lab on the same day). Two of the weeks in the semester are selected as \"bye\" weeks, which means you won't have lab for those two weeks. Finally, there's no final (written or practical). Great course overall, you learn quite a lot of physics in both the theoretical and practical sense.",
    "A good, fun lab. You get to pick 9 experiments from a list of about twenty, as well as take two weeks off of your choice. I'd recommend the Particle Accelerator, Digital Logic and Superconductivity labs. As long as you know exactly what your TA wants (find out early in the semester), the lab reports are straightforward and easy to do well on.",
    "Pay attention to detail, you'll do fine.",
    "In PHYS 206, you work with the same partner\/group for the entire semester and choose I think ~10 labs to do over the semester. Each week you complete an experiment, the report is due the next week. The work is def. more than 205 since you have to spend time outside of lab to write up the reports and analyze data, which can take a long time depending on the experiments. Error analysis is generally the hardest part of the write-ups, though I have a feeling you could use less rigorous standards when analyzing the error.For the sake of your sanity, DO NOT do the millikan oil drop experiment (the new camera doesn't really make data collecting easier!) or the conservation of momentum lab (data analysis takes forever bc of quantity of data and error).DO select the digital logic lab (fast write up), and the nuclear collision\/scattering lab. The accelerator operator, Larry, is a really nice guy, and doing the lab is very chill.",
    "A fun lab class. You get to choose which labs you want to do, and most of them are actually interesting.",
    "Physics 206 is a lot better than 205. The labs are more manageable and interesting, and you can probably finish all of them in the given amount of time, if not sooner. But the tradeoff is that sometimes lab reports take a long time. I think the coolest lab we did was the charge-to-mass ratio of an electron. Also, try to get Uri as a TA.",
    "Really annoying class to take. Avoid if you can, but you probably can't. Most thought it was better than 205L, but honestly, spending 6+ hours the night before lab every week to finish the lab report gets really old...",
    "I would recommend this lab because you get to do more interesting labs than lower level physics labs.",
    "A lot better than 205. The labs are much shorter. I usually get out before 3, whereas in 205 I never got out before 5. But the lab reports have the potential to make you pull all-nighters if you don't start early. The experiments were a lot more fun, and we actually had a chance to thinkabout what we were doing instead of trying to scribble things down furiously while working on an experiment. The worst part was error analysis. I probably shouldn't say this, but my lab partner and I spent many, many nights fudging error bars and moving around data points to make them fall on a nice curve. If you follow the standard error analysis procedures rigorously, you'll never finish. I'm pretty sure no one ever does proper error analysis in lab anyway.",
    "206L is much more enjoyable than 205L, despite a huge increase in the amount of work needed to do well. 205L was bland, and I thought having to do all the work on the day of the lab prevented me from fully understandingwhat was happening--time was such an unpleasant restraint! Lab reports often took a long time to write, but nonetheless this lab was very interesting. Plus, there's no lab final!On the first day of lab, you pick 9 labs you want to do. This is a rather rushed process, so I felt that the advice from prior reviews and friends was really helpful. The Nuclear Scattering (J3) lab where you use the particle accelerator was worth it just to say you've seen a particle accelerator at work. You don't really do anything in the lab but copy down numbers, but it definitely took the most work to complete--it was REALLY tedious, especially the large equations. I don't regret picking it but get ready for a long write-up! Superconductivity (H4) was easy and fun--you get to splash around liquid nitrogen! The q\/m electron lab (H1) was another fun and easy one with a quick write-up. Digital Logic (C1) is a bit tedious if you don't know anything about circuitry, but it was fun to learn about in the end. Electric field plotting (C1) had a neat write-up involving the approximations of Laplace equation. X-ray diffraction (F1) was a little boring, I thought. The acoustic cavity (E1) was a bit tedious with the machine you have to use. 2D Collisions (B2) was fun to play with, but having to deal with LoggerPro can become a huge pain. In the end, my favorites were H4, C1, and H1.A little advice--doing all of my calculations in excel spreadsheets was a HUGE time saver. And picking a good lab partner can make or break how you do grade-wise and how much you enjoy the course. My lab partner put zero effort in and almost ruined my experience--I just ended up working by myself on all the labs. Dividing the work up in each lab write-up will save you tons of time, I bet!",
    "I personally do not like physics that much, so if you do not need to take it, I would say don't. If you are deciding between this and PHYS160L, I heard PHYS160 is easier with 1 page write-ups, however I doubt the experiments are as interesting.",
    "If you are taking the lab sequence, know that this is far more pleasant than 205L. You choose your lab partner, with whom you remain all semester, and together you choose the labs you wish to perform. The reports are written on your own time, unlike 205L, so do expect a bit more time spent each week. I strongly suggest varying your selected experiments, as your experience will be much more meaningful if you try new things. Good luck!",
    "I would recommend it as a great way to learn the way research works in physics."
