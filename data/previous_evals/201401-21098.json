    "I would recommend this class if you are interested in German history.",
    "Well taught. Low stress. Interesting",
    "This class is a great way to further your German language by applying it to a particular subject area. I definitely recommend this course as a way to continue polishing your German beyond the L5 language course. Also, it was an interesting class and I learned a lot beyond just language. It definitely felt like more work than other language courses Ive taken here, even though it only meets twice a week. There are a lot of readings, sometimes difficult because they are all in German, that you need to stay on top of so that you can participate in class."
