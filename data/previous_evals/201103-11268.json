    "This class should have a field trip every single week; with lectures to complement. There should be routine tests to help students commit a substantial amount of information to memory. Natural history could be better incorporated into the class, which, as it stands, puts much more emphasis on pure identification and classification.",
    "With a little redesign this course could be really great. I didn't get quite the level of abstract taxonomic knowledge I would have liked. But I can also see how others may not be interested in that.",
    "9c: the fieldtrips were where all learning was done. by far the most valuable aspect of class.",
    "I strongly recommend this course to all FES'ers. It should probably be a foundation course, given the importance the material has for all at FES or those interested in anything environmental. How can we graduate students without them knowing the types of trees in the area they're graduating from and spent ~two years in?"

    "lectures. these do not help students to organize their thinking about phylogeny and tree families; they are simply photo albums of different trees (we could look at them in the field!)",
    "Periodic testing throughout the course instead of two big tests. Better connection between morphological characteristics of higher taxonomic classes and genera.",
    "I think planning ahead to know exactly what species you plan to find so that you have some branches accessible. Many species we saw too often and some key ones we either never saw or only saw once and they were hard to learn. I think perhaps this should be a one credit class just about the botany, not about the cladistics.",
