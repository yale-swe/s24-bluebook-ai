   "comments": [
    "Take it. It's low on workload, high on interesting discussion and reading. Oppenheimer's a great guy and he keeps class interesting (plus each week someone brings snacks - c'mon now who can say no to that).",
    "Yes.",
    "Take this class, especially if you're a political science major. It's really unique within the department and you read some interesting works.",
    "If you're looking for a relaxed seminar with fun readings and discussions, definitely take.",
    "I would totally recommend this class to another student, except only if that student is confident enough in themselves to speak up in class and share their views, and not get intimidated by the hipster\/YDN crowd that tends to dominate this class. It's a great class, mind you, so don't let that fact hang you up, except it's a fact nonetheless.But more about the class itself: basically, each week you read different examples of pivotal journalism from the time period, the class progressing sort of chronologically through history. And then each week a student presents a paper on a various paper or magazine, with a final paper at the end. Simple enough, except somehow this class turns out just great. I gotta say, this is one of the few two-hour seminar classes that I've (hardly ever) felt bored in. Oppenheimer entertains as he instructs. And while I can't say that I actually truly learned much in this class (I had done journalism throughout high school and college, and so was somewhat familiar with many of the publications and journalists), this was an incredibly enjoyable and fun class. Take it if you can get in.",
    "This class is basically a book club. If you read the books its great, but don't expect a ton of structure or the class to be tied to the material. I learned more about modern journalism (like magazines and journals) than I did about the classics of american journalism. It's a fun class, but I think you might be able to find better academic experiences teaching this topic (though probably not classes that are as fun).",
    "Oppenheimer is very intelligent and witty. He picked an amazing syllabus with books you'll be glad you've read. The discussion of such masterpieces was at points sub-par, I wish he'd guided the conversation a little more instead of settling for \"what this book meant to me, because I didn't actually do the reading\" type comments. Level of deliberation could have been higher, but overall a great course.",
    "This course, as the professor will tell you, is Mark Oppenheimer's reading club, rather than a true, balanced survey of great journalism. However, the syllabus is fantastic, and all of the readings really are great works of journalism from throughout the twentieth century. I would definitely recommend this class to a fellow student, especially a political science student starved for a class with enjoyable reading and an emphasis on good writing.",
    "this class is about great reporting about white men in suits in marble buildings. it's oppenheimers' book club, essentially.",
    "The class may entertain you, but I don't know if you'll actually learn much. If you're interested, read the books on the reading list on your own\u0097or, even better, get a group of your friends together and wikipedia the books on the reading list and spend a night discussing them without reading them. Occasionally correct the grammar of your friends. This will effectively approximate the class experience.",
    "Someone called it \"book club with Mark Oppenheimer.\" I'd say that's pretty correct. Fun but not much material."
