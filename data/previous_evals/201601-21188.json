   "comments": [
    "The stuff you learn is interesting, and you'll learn it probably in different ways than other physics classes. Take it with a friend, so you can have someone to discuss the topics with and study with when you get to the more complicated stuff.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone. The subject is so interesting, the workload is reasonable, and the teaching is great.",
    "Definitely! It is a great way to understand some of the most fundamental aspects of the universe and physics in a way that is palatable but rigorous. I recommend it as long as you have a solid math and physics grounding.",
    "Do it to get a great overview of three very interesting fields. Has the perfect mix of textbook knowledge accrual and cutting edge research introduction.",
    "PHYS 343 is a good survey course if you just want to learn a little bit of astronomy from a more \"physicsy\"perspective without going too far into it. It's a good elective for the physics major. One strength is that the workload is well spaced the semester. So, even though you do have more work in the end of the semester, especially because of the final project, it doesn't feel like a gigantic burden like physics classes usually feel. The fact that we have only 10 students in the class this year also made it more enjoyable. prof. Natarajan is a good and clear lecturer. The class was a bit disorganized at times, but I assume that it's because she had a lot this semester, besides being the first time she was teaching this course. Since there were no practice problems for 2 of the 3 exams, I felt a bit lost before tests, but nothing extremely overwhelming. Overall, I didn't think it was an easy class, but it wasn't super hard either. It was an interesting course and I'd recommend it to someone looking for a break from conventional physics courses. On a side note, Prof. Natarajan is usually very excited about new astro results and comments about them in class fairly often, and she also brought cookies and cake for us in the last lecture! One thing I'd change in the course is giving 2 lectures instead of only one lecture dedicated to project presentations.",
    "not if it continues to be organized and taught in this way. All the students were very lost because topics like GR cannot be covered in so little time",
    "11 NOT an Astro or Physics major? I would consider it, but it is NOT a gut. Maybe Credit\/D? The class is definitely interesting enough, so I would take it for the sake of it. COURSE Three Modules - Exoplanets, General Relativity, Black Holes. HOMEWORK Very manageable - 6 very short psets (2 per Module) EXAMS Easy - 1 per Module. Study the lecture notes and do the psets, and you are good to go. FINAL PROJECT Did mine in one afternoon and did pretty well."
