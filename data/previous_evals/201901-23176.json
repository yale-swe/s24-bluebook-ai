   "comments": [
    "Having no previous training in prosody, the course taught me to analyze poems. Though focused on Symbolist poetry, the multiplicity of prosody quizzes provided a great poetical context, much needed for understanding the later periods.",
    "More than anything, this course offered a deep dive into a specific literary tradition. The streamlined focus of the course allowed for countless opportunities to improve upon a few of the most important professional practices that are essential for any scholar of literature, namely close reading, thinking about a broader tradition through grounding discussion in specific writers and textual examples, and prosody.",
    "This course offered both an in depth review of Symbolist poetry in Russia, as well as a primer to understanding poetic structures.",
    "I have developed a comprehensive understanding of the kinds of primary and secondary sources I need to work with when doing research on Russian Symbolism, including primary sources in different media and from other time periods (both before and after the Symbolist age)."

  {
   "question_id": "GS403",
   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "As already mentioned, I highly valued the prosody quizzes. I also loved the fact that our final assignment was a conference talk- it was a great opportunity to learn to develop a research in a concise way.",
    "Strengths - Consistent engagement with textual material, close reading, prosody quizzes, wonderful seminar discussions, reading a variety of authors through various modes of discourse (poetry, criticism, the odd prose piece), the final symposium was terrific practice for presenting at conferences Weaknesses - Perhaps these criticisms are unfair considering scheduling constraints, but it is always nice to incorporate more diverse voices and understudied writers, perhaps we could have looked at more examples of Symbolism in different cultural contexts",
    "I think it might be helpful to email students a list of essential poetry terms and tools before the course, but this is not necessary.",
    "The course was very well balanced and allowed me to practice different skills simultaneously. I particularly appreciated the close readings of poetry that we did, including the very close attention we paid to prosody. An opportunity to present my own ideas to the class multiple times during the semester was very valuable as well."

    "I would recommend it to anyone interested in ameliorating prosody skills, and anyone who is interested in Russia's fin de siecle.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to any graduate student at Yale who is interested in literature.",
    "Yes. Even though subject matter did not directly align with my interests, it was an excellent course to take in order to see exactly how to teach a graduate seminar.",
    "Yes, I'd recommend this course to anyone",
    "Yes, I would recommend this class to all graduate students in the humanities who have a reading ability in Russian. Russian poetry is still an underresearched field and it deserves more attention!"
