    "Do not take this class unless you absolutely have to. It is soul-crushing.",
    "I went to all the classes before the first midterm and none between the first and second midterm. I got the same grade within two points on the exams. Draw your own conclusions",
    "The course was pretty good. I know I learned a lot--probability, theorems, confidence intervals, hypothesis testing. I really liked the lecture notes that Professor Chen posts online. Although the textbook was good, a bit advanced, I found the lecture notes a sufficient summary. Professor Chen is good professor. She teaches rather quickly, but will make sure students understand if they voice their questions. And the TA is great! I would recommend this class, especially to math\/econ majors since this is one of the required courses.",
    "It's required for the Econ-Math major. This is the worst class I've taken at Yale. Stay away. If Professor Chen is still teaching and uses lecture notes, you really don't have to go to class. Just know the homework for exams. But seriously - awful.",
    "DO NOT recommend unless very interested in abstract math.",
    "it's required for econ math majors. if you've taken a couple more advanced proof based classes this will be very easy. if not, it could be a little challenging. the course goes into basic probability and statistics (you actually cover less than the regular econometrics course) but you prove everything from the ground up. it gives you a much better understanding of what probability and distributions really mean and why they work the way they do, which was great since ap stats in high school only covered things on a surface level. lectures are pretty useless since the teacher has a strong accent, but if you read the lecture notes and the book carefully, you'll be fine.",
    "Yes.",
    "I understand this course is meant as a fast-paced introduction to probability and statistics covering a year of statistics in a semester, but sometimes I just felt like everything was being made more difficult that it needed to be. Lecture was very difficult to understand and the textbook was graduate level and assumed prior experience with statistics. Problem sets were long and tedious with no real-life applications at all. I came into this course with no statistics background whatsoever, and after taking this course, I still feel like I have absolutely no intuition for statistics whatsoever.",
    "If math and econ major, you have to take it. If not, probably take something else.",
    "I would recommend Economics 135 to the following narrow groups of Yale students: students enrolled in the economics and mathematics combined major, economics majors who want to take a more challenging econometrics course than the Economics 131-132 sequence, and quantitatively minded students who are looking for a social science credit. This course goes well beyond what anyone would expect from an introductory course in statistics and is made to sound deceptively simple by its description in the Yale College Programs of Study. While it is true that the course covers all of the topics listed in the YCPS with depth and breadth, the level at which it covers it is similar to a graduate school level class; this is only exacerbated by the fact that the textbook assigned for the class is a graduate level textbook which is at times very difficult to understand given the sophistication of the mathematics presented. Overall, Professor Chen was really good; she truly cares about her students and wants to make sure that they understand the course material. She posted lecture notes before each class (perhaps the best lecture notes any of my instructors at Yale have posted) with ample examples which was a great complement to her lectures. Even though the class was at 9:00am, it was definitely worth going to as the combination of the lecture and the corresponding lecture notes made understanding the material easier. The weekly homework assignments for the class typically ranged from 10-13 questions and usually mixed theory and application; the theory questions were more heavily emphasized by both the instructor and the examinations (two midterms and a final). Overall, the exams were fair and generated a good distribution of scores. There were no real surprises on these exams and the fact that about one-third of the exam questions come from homework assignments truly gives the students an incentive to work really hard on the homework. As an economics and mathematics major who took this class as a requirement, I do not regret choosing this major and am happy that I have been exposed to a higher level of thinking than that expected in the regular econometrics sequence. I definitely feel I got more out of this class than I would have out of Economics 131 and am happy that the focus of this semester\u0092s work was not narrow, but was a broad introduction to mathematical statistics. I recommend this class without reservation to students comparing the merits of this class and Economics 131.",
    "This course is a mathematical introduction to probability and statistics. It's not spectacular, but it's not bad either (except for the miserable 9 am class time). If you don't like math then I don't know why you're considering this course. If you do and you're reading this review then you're probably an Econ& Math major and have to take this course. I spent an average of 5-6 hours a week on the course, more heavily weighted towards the end of the semester.",
    "Have to take it for Econ Math. Unfortunately.",
    "As you well know, this is the first course in the theoretical math econ course series that poundsevery Econ\/Math major at Yale. As such, it is a great course for deciding whether you can handle grinding through the combined major; trust me, if math 222 linear was the last thing you took, you haven\u0092t had a real taste for the major until now. 1\/4-1\/3 of the students drop out and settle for the standard econ major.Don\u0092t be fooled by the course title: in our semester, this course used a graduate level textbook. During a TA review session, an Econ PhD candidate saw the work we were doing and told us that the graduate department uses the same textbook and does the same problems as our class did. The fact that a graduate-level equivalent econ class is listed as 135 is egregious.Statistical and probability theory forces you to think about numbers in uncomfortable and unfamiliar ways. Unless you\u0092ve taken a course like this, there will be a high learning curve for how to handle new concepts such as random variables. I took a semester at Yale and a semester at high school of applied\/number-crunching Statistics, and trust me when I say that it does not give you an ounce of understanding advantage towards the theoretical side, which is what this course covers.Your weekly problem sets tend to be 12-15 proof-based problems. They are assigned on Thurs and due on Tues; by midway through the class, I literally spent all of Saturday, Sunday, and Monday doing the psets. The tests are almost all problems and proofs taken from the psets, notes, or lectures. The way to do well on these tests is to build a deep understanding of the material by knowing the proofs and approaches like the back of your hand. As such, if you\u0092re a math wiz that generally puts off work until the night before the test and usually does well, you will not do well in this course. The average on the second midterm was a 56, the high score was a 92, the low was a 10, and 4 kids scored below 20. Keep in mind that this was a class of 24 sophomores and juniors who had previously been committed to the major and had been successful in their past Yalemath courses. The kids that did well were the ones who put in the time to re-do the psets early on; this is deep, deep material that takes time to mentally absorb and become familiar with.Many evaluations will probably complain about Prof. Xiaohong Chen, but I found her to be fine. It\u0092s hard to teach a course to students who expect to be able to learn the material two nights before the test. The TA Ji Hyung Lee was excellent and extremely helpful.You should take this course if you want a challenge and are willing to put in huge amounts of time. The material is extremely rewarding if you spend tons of time grappling to achieve understanding; if you put in anything less, you will come out of the class bewildered and having learned very little. This can probably generally be said of the Econ&Math major as a whole.",
    "I would say that Econ 135 is a course with important material that has the potential to be highly interesting. I would recommend this course only if you are willing to spend time learning the material yourself and at TA section. The lectures are very dry and were not too useful to me, but the lecture notes are also very good. You probably have to take this class if you are even thinking about it, but hopefully the above tips will be useful."
