   "comments": [
    "Chinese classes at Yale are awesome, and this one is no exception. You learn lots of grammar and characters and conversational skills. Unfortunately Mu is leaving, but I think that the class will still be great.",
    "It is a great Chinese class, especially since the content is definitely more applicable to real world Chinese texts. You are able to significantly improve your Chinese in all aspects. I would recommend it to those who are willing to learn Chinese at an advanced level.",
    "Take it if you love Chinese and want to improve! Just be prepared to work.",
    "Very similar to Advanced Modern Chinese I. The major difference for me was that there were just a few main topics we learned about, with each getting a few chapters in the textbook. I liked this, and thought it led to a more comprehensive understanding of each topic. Overall, I would recommend the class if you want to further your Chinese.",
    "CHNS 151 is the next step in the Chinese sequence. The workload is heavier than 130\/140, but it is definitely all worth it. Speaking, listening, and vocabulary are the primary focuses. I would definitely recommend this course to any student who wants to make that next jump and feel more confident conversing about topics beyond just the day-to-day subject matter."
