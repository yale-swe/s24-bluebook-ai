    "Professor Burger does not organize his lectures and the class is all over the place. It is interesting to hear him talk, though, because he is such a scholar on this subject.",
    "The workload is a bit less than most that of other Yale courses, but the course is a bit confusing. At times, we were not given enough information to confidently complete the exercises and it was a bit frustration because the only person who wrote on the subject was Professor Burger. The lectures can drag on. Do not take this course if you are interested in learning about the Incas, because the only time he will address them is in the first and last class. I would not consider taking this class again.",
    "Not very interesting, don't bother taking it. Lectures just drone on, and the tests are IMPOSSIBLE.",
    "This class looks at the pre-Incan civilizations in Peru. I would definitely not qualify it as a gut class- you need to pay close attention in lecture and put in some serious studying to do well on the midterm, but overall the subject is interesting and the workload isn't bad.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course.ARCG 232 is a great overview of the Andean cultures prior to the Inca. Don't expect to learn much about the Inca themselves-- we only spent a class or two. Instead, this class is mostly about the development of civilization in Peru: early human settlements, the agricultural revolution, the invention of pottery, and so on.The workload is very light. If you're dedicated to attending lectures and taking notes then you don't really need to do the readings. Dr. Burger is one of the leading experts and he'll tell you basically everything you need to know for the exam.There is an option to write a paper instead of taking the exam, but as long as you're good at history tests the midterm and final shouldn't be too difficult.My greatest regret about this class is not giving it more of my attention. Because it's not very demanding, it's easy to focus on more work-intensive classes and just do the minimum to get through. That makes this the perfect 4th or 5th class in a difficult schedule, but it also means that you miss out on a more in-depth understanding of Andean archaeology.Take ARCG 232! It's really interesting.",
    "Great course \u0097 you will definitely learn a lot about ancient Peru. Professor Burger is incredible; he is one of the biggest figures in the field and will incorporate his personal anecdotes and stories about the controversies of the return of the Peruvian artifacts into his lectures, which are really fascinating. However, the midterm is quite difficult and really detailed so make sure to stay on top of the reading. The final is of equal difficulty, but Professor Burger also provides the option to write a 12-15 page essay in lieu of the exam, which was a nice alternative for some.",
    "It is interesting although it appears more sociocultural and human in its intro while often having a heavy focus on the excavation and object side of archeology--if you aren't used to it can be a bit tough to enjoy.",
    "This is an interesting class, just not always taught the way I would have liked. Burger is a very interesting lecturer, but often doesn't give context as to which site or culture he is talking about, or if he is talking about a culture as a whole or a specific site within a certain culture. If you're looking for a class on the Incas, this isn't it. I would say that about 95% of the material we learned is pre-Inca, which doesn't make it any less interesting, but it is certainly a class on the cultures that came way before the Incas. If you're an altho major looking for a archeology credit, it's a decent option. The workload is pretty minimal and readings are usually tolerable. However, the midterm and final were actually on the more difficult side and definitely required a good amount of studying in order to do well.",
    "This is an incredibly interesting class. The fact that it was at 9 am sucked, but it was worth waking up that early. Richard Burger is entertaining to listen to and has lots of stories. Take good notes and you won't have to do the readings.",
    "The class is not alot of work however I would not recommend this class because lots of people do poorly on the tests since it is not well taught.",
    "No, I would not recommend this course to a fellow student unless major changes were made to the overall organization of Ancient Civilizations of the Andes. Lectures consist of whatever Professor Burger feels like talking about that day. There are no helpful powerpoint presentations posted after and the minutest details might be tested on the midterm of final. Class attendance and extremely detailed note taking is necessary, along with ALL of the readings, to do well. These requirements were only made more difficult by the fact that there were no sections, and the class is a lecture that starts early in the morning. Also, more than half the class failed the midterm. There ended up being a curve of a whole letter grade, but even then, that was not very helpful. Honestly, do not take this course unless you have a strong interested in ancient cultures of the andean region besides the Incas and will be able to make every lecture\/take awesome notes\/do all the readings on your own time .",
    "As a non-anthro major, Ancient Civilizations of the Andes was pretty boring. During shopping period the class appears as if it will be about the Incan civilization. However, it focuses much more heavily on pre-Incan civilizations. There isn't very much work for the class itself other than a midterm and a final exam or final paper. But Professor Burger is great and a very interesting guy! If you enjoy listening to very interesting stories then you will love him!",
    "A solid overview of precolombian cultures of the andes, with one major exception - the inca were barely covered! Decently organized, and very little commitment other than going to class. Burger is an expert and a good lecturer, so take the course if this sort of thing interests you!",
    "ANTH 232 is all about ancient Andean archaeology--focusing mostly on sites in Peru. You go from Paleoindian all the way up to the Inca. Burger is an amazing lecturer--he's really engaging, jolly, and adorable. He's helpful. He's also one of the top people in his field--he's cited in the literature EVERYWHERE. Take this course ONLY if you're interested in Andean archaeology, otherwise you'll be bored out of your mind. You don't have to do all of the reading to get by, but if you do you're better off for it. Overall, a great course. Not too demanding--a couple of short exercises, a midterm, and a final.",
    "Do not take this class, exams are marked hardly and class is incredible boring.",
    "Take this class if you're interested in Peruvian archaeology and you're looking for an easier class (or one to take credit\/D). The professor is very entertaining and brings stories from his own field work into almost every lecture. Some of the assignments seemed like busy work (map quiz and searching for images within an intricate design) but they did not require too much time. I learned a lot about Peru (and that the Incan Empire is only a very tiny portion of Peruvian history) and found the class interesting.",
    "This was an interesting class, however, it was very unorganized, which made it very difficult to study for the midterm and the final when they came around. If you read the books and readings, they help make sense of the chronology of the information, but reading all of the material is also a waste of time seeing as mostly points from the textbooks are focused on. Solely relying on your class notes, however, is a bad idea, because key facts are sometimes left out of lecture.",
    "I would only recommend taking this class if you are very interested in archeology or are extremely good at memorizing facts. The lectures were good and the class was straight forward but major deductions were made on the midterm if one did not know the specific details of archeological sites very well. Therefore, if one doesn't find archeology particularly interesting it seems pointless to memorize so many facts about it.",
    "This is a good fifth class. The workload is extremely light, and the material is interesting, though probably not quite as interesting as you might hope from the title (you only touch upon the incas at the very end of the course, if at all). Try to make it to lecture, and watch out for the exams, and you should get by fine.",
    "Great course. You probably didn't have to do the reading to make an A if you knew the material he covered in class extremely well. But knowing the class lectures moderately well and doing the reading made it easy to get an A.",
    "Yeah if you are interested in the subject. It's not too much work but that doesn't mean that the tests are easy.",
    "I would summarize it as a great introduction to the Andes and to archaeology.",
    "If you are really interested in archaeology, go for it. If not, not really.",
    "A (surprisingly) interesting survey of Andean civilizations, not just the Incas. Professor Burger is a great storyteller, so class is quite nice with him.While not a very difficult class, it's definitely not what I would call a gut, either, since you'll be trying to cram all these dates, locations, and other details into your head before exams, especially since it's not always very clear what's important to take away from the class."
