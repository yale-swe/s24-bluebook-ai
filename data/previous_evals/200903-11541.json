    "yes, well taught and interesting",
    "Hindi is not an especially hard language to learn, and this class combines speaking and writing in a way that allows you to learn a lot without the intense amounts of work as say, Chinese or Arabic. The problem with this class is that it had four teachers per week, which often gives a choppy feel to the proceedings of the classroom. While some of the teachers were very good, others were not at the same level, which made class time frustrating. Also, be prepared for weekly quizzes on fridays.",
    "Good language",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to anyone who has even the slightest interest in the language. Seemaaji and Swapnaji are two of the nicest professors I have ever had, the material was really interesting, and the workload was very light. Grades were based on weekly quizzes (graded quite lightly), a midterm skit, and a final project. All in all, a very rewarding course.",
    "Take it. A fun, not-too-intense language course. Keep up with the work and you'll learn a lot.",
    "If you want to learn Hindi, take it. If you're on the fence, it's probably worth it to take it - not too difficult and it can be a lot of fun!",
    "Yes! It is a beautiful language and the class is fun to go to.",
    "Test every Friday morning. Painfully dull \"lectures\" that are literally verbatim recitations of the textbook chapters. Just...don't.",
    "Elementary Hindi is one of the more laid-back languages out there, but the quality of instruction may fall below your expectations. If you have a passion for Hindi you will make the best out of this class. If you just need to fulfill a language requirement, the grading is very fair, but you might have more work than you expect. Friday quizzes really take a toll on your Thursday nights...",
    "Intro Hindi is not very labor intensive but it is definitely not a \"gut\" class in part because everyone in the class really wants to learn.",
    "I recommend Hindi.",
    "Definitely a good way to get 1.5 credits. So far, I don't know if we're moving quickly enough that I will ever be proficient enough to travel to India and get along easily."
