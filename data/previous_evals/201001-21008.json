   "comments": [
    "The class offered a focused examination of the two primary dynamics of Soviet culture in the 1920s and 1930s, as its name suggests. Discussing things like the purges and the Terror as cultural rather than purely political phenomena was a really refreshing and novel angle.I would absolutely recommend the class to anyone. I had made myself promise not to turn up during shopping period because I was so daunted by the syllabus and knew it would make my semester hectic beyond belief. The temptation really was too strong. And this was easily one of the most interesting and rewarding classes of my Yale experience.",
    "A good look at 20th Century Russian historiography about a range of Soviet topics related to ideology, Utopia, and violence. Reading is rich and extensive, with a good mix of primary and secondary sources, as well as relevant literature.I would recommend the course to another student; it is worth taking.",
    "I would definitely recoommed this course for anyone interested not just in history, but in critical thinking about different approaches to history, in digging deeper into the art of argumentation, in comparing different approaches and evaluating strenghs and weaknesses of each one. Thsi course really shoed me what a phrase 'critical thinking' means in practise."

    "This course helped me to be more familiar with Soviet history and in particular, the main research questions surrounding the period. I also learned a lot about Soviet legal history, crime and criminal justice, which helps with my own research."
