    "If you took Russian 130, you can expect the same thing in 140. There is nightly homework as well as quizzes\/tests for each unit. You do more reading of Russian literature in 140, but it's essentially a continuation of 130. I really enjoyed it and would definitely recommend it!",
    "I would recommend this class if you are continuing from lower level at Yale. It is a decent amount of daily work (well, depends how seriously you take it - i definitely recommend trying to check it by googling), so not a class you can cram for right before exams.",
    "2nd year Russian is extremely well taught and is as engaging as any language class I've taken at Yale. It is still a language, and a fairly tricky on at that, so there's plenty of memorization and that sort of thing, but the class is taught extremely well.",
    "I would not recommend 140 to a student coming in with the same Russian background as I had coming in. I would recommend something higher. Some specific details of constructions and grammar things got clearer for me this year, but there wasn't really any new material.",
    "I would absolutely recommend taking Russian with Irina. She is one of the best Russian instructors I've ever had (probably the best, actually)."
