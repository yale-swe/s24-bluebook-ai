    "There should be no hesitation. Take this class! Professor Adesola is the greatest professor. He always looks out for his students and is very dedicated to helping them to continue to learn the language. Yoruba is difficult but the course is fun and light-hearted. You will laugh all the way through the semester and find that your reading, writing, and speaking skills improve in a way you didn't think was possible.",
    "Definitely it's a great class! Prof. Adesola is a very helpful and thoughtful teacher. It is a low stress but very productive language learning environment.",
    "The easiest and most fun way to get your L3 language credit at Yale.",
    "You learn a lot more cultural things than in level one. Expansion upon food and politics.",
    "I would definitely recommend the class after taking L1 and L2. You should continue learning the language and perfecting it. You never know when you will need it!"
