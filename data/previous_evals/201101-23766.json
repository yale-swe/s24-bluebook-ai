    "Absolutely. There is no shortage of demand for this course, but in case you got in and are wondering whether to take it, definitely do! It's one of the best courses I've taken at Yale. Grading is lenient and appropriate.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class to anyone who has an interest in law or famous court cases.",
    "I'd definitely recommend it, as long as it's offered and Yale keeps the college seminar program--which it absolutely should!",
    "Take it. It's really interesting material even if you aren't that interested in the law. It's not a lot of much work, just reading or watching videos before seminar, a midterm (take home), and a final paper.",
    "Absolutely take this class if you can. Mr. Ford is the man, and the course material is definitely worth learning about. Best class I've taken at Yale.",
    "Definitely take it - its a wonderful class that gives you the change to learn about these trials that have really affected the nation's culture.",
    "I would recommend this class. You basically just get exposed to a bunch of different cases which you really should know about and then go in depth to one for a final paper. Jack Ford is really fun to be in class with--I never minded going--and the entire setting is laid back. There's a decent amount of reading but its pretty straightforward and you don't need to do it all. Wikipedia the case and read the transcripts.Also, the class was almost entirely seniors (and athletes) and it was kind of exactly what a second semester senior is looking for. Less formulaic and more discussion based; less absurd amounts of facts and memorization and more just learning general information that educated people should be aware of.",
    "Take it if you can."
