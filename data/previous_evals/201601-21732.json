    "Victorian poetry. Poems great. Brisman is brilliant, but an acquired taste. So shop the class before you take it, many people find him a difficult grader. He is a very good professor though and does really get to the heart of the poems. As a senior seminar no long paper, which is nice. Just three short ones on a shared theme or topic.",
    "I would recommend ENGL 412. The Victorian poets aren't always as strongly read as, say, the Romantics or more modern poets, but their work is integral to a complete understand of those schools of poetry - in addition to being worthwhile entirely on its own.",
    "I would highly recommend this course if you like poetry. Tennyson and Browning are both wonderful, and the other poets in the course are great as well. Professor Brisman is so amazing and I recommend everyone take a course with him at some point.",
    "It has been one of my greatest joys at Yale to spend time with Professor Brisman, and I wholeheartedly recommend any of his classes to anyone interested in English literature. You will know whether the class is for you after the first meeting, which you should absolutely attend if you are considering the course. It is particularly helpful to take Professor Brisman's Romantic Poetry (English 250) course before taking English 412. Having the Romantics in the back of your mind makes reading the Victorians entirely different, and in my opinion incalculably enriches your experience and understanding."
