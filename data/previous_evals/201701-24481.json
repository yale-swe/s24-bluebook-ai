    "Interact, interpret, internalize. LAWFair, MPOWER. Koh has a bunch of acronyms and tool-sets that I think are valuable to non-lawyers. It is also valuable to know the laws of war and international law as a policy-maker.",
    "I learned a lot of content about international law and procedure. I'm still trying to piece together a framework for how this informs my future work. It seems now like the whole legal framework for international and transnational law is a big blob of details that is constantly in flux. The identity of this body of law and its trajectory both seem unclear, so I'll keep an eye out as this law changes in the future."

  {
   "question_id": "GS403",
   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The strengths are that the course is circular, so you re-learn the same concepts and how they interact with each other. I learned a lot about international law that is talked about on CNN, say, but no one ever bothers to explain it. Here, it was explained. The weakness is that the portion of the course after spring break feels rushed and there's a lot of territory to cover.",
    "Let me caveat all of this by saying this is my first law school class. The slides were sometimes very hard to follow. Often, there were formatting, grammatical, or spelling errors that made the content of the slides unclear. The slides were noted in incomplete sentences, which made them really hard to follow. Other times, the same case was referred to by different names, so it was hard to keep track of what we were talking about and the lessons learned for that case. Often slides were repeated throughout the course. While it can be helpful to revisit main points of previous lectures\/overviews, in this case, it just made the layout of the course pretty confusing. Also, the class was primarily lecture based with cold calling. Which I understand is a trademark of law school. I found it both anxiety-inducing and difficult to learn in this manner. So, all of that over, the class was really interesting in content and it was clear that Koh is incredibly equipped to teach the course."

   "comments": [
    "Yes, I would because it's pretty different than your standard GSAS class. You learn a set of concepts that are valuable to interact with the world, and a tool-kit that you can take out later. No papers, but mild cold-calling (1-3 times a semester), and a final exam that is challenging but predictable.",
    "I think a student would be well served to take another law class before this one, but yes. I think the course was helpful."
