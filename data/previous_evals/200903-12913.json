    "I wouldn't tell someone to take it unless they might need it for their major requirements",
    "take it if you need it",
    "I would absolutely NOT recommend this course to anyone. The teachers could not explain topics well at all, and much of the material on the exams was hardly covered in class if at all. the class was the least engaging class I have ever taken in my life. Waking up to go to that class was a complete struggle. Lectures were essentially pointless because the teachers did not convey topics well anyway. I essentially had to teach myself the material covered in this course. Once again DO NOT take this class unless it is absolutely necessary to do so.",
    "Don't take Math 115 if you don't need it. It's hard, but you do learn a ton. Overall, though it was difficult, I'm glad that I took it.",
    "This class is poorly taught. I took the professor's section because I assumed it would be the best one, which was my mistake. I think a few of the TA's, who led all of the review sessions, teach it better. I would recommend that you shop as many sections as you can to find a good teacher.",
    "I would advise that any one looking to take a Math class should not take this one. If for some reason, Math 115 is needed to fulfill some requirement then I would advise that a different professor be sought out for.",
    "You have to go into Math 115 knowing that it will be a difficult and probably not very fun course.That being said, if you have to take this course (and many science majors require it) you should DEFINITELY TAKE IT WITH PROFESSOR ORSZAG.He is by far the best of the math 115 instructors.",
    "Do not take this class unless you have to it's terrible.",
    "It was hard class. If you are strong in math take it.",
    "Do not take this course unless you have to. It's not worth it.",
    "Only if you absolutly have to. take it spring semester, its easier. ds",
    "Difficult class if you haven't taken calc in a while. But it is manageable - the exams are out of this world though, forreal.",
    "The midterms and final are considerably (and sometimes unreasonably) more difficult than the problem sets. Class is devoted to the proofs of theorems that already appear in the book, leaving you scrambling to learn how to apply them in the actual exercises. During the review sessions before the exams, students discovered that each professor was on a different page. Some students learned concepts mere hours before an exam because their professors did not reach that material in class whereas others did. In short, go to EVERY review session, for there you actually learn how to do problems and catch up with the rest of the Math 115 students.",
    "Math 115 is a class that you just have to get through, whether you are trying to get to higher level math classes or to satisfy a requirement for your major. You really have to work every week to make sure you understand the material because it is impossible to try and learn it all the night before the exams. I definitely recommend Professor Orszag though. He made an effort to review what we needed to know and gave us practice problems during class.",
    "Take it if you have to. Consider Math 120 if you've already had AP Calculus BC.",
    "This course is the best way to transition from Calculus AB to college-level Calc II. A good portion of the material learned is Calc AB material, including solving integrals and volumes of revolution. The rest of the material is Calc BC, and focuses on series, especially Taylor and Maclaurin series. However, the problem is that not a lot of time is actually spent on Taylor series, which was a new topic for most students, and it was incredibly difficult to learn them for the final exam. If you take this class, take it with Professor Orszag, since he heads the class, writes the exams, allows you to resubmit homework, and will make sure to go over the material before the exam. Some of the other professors did not even get to material on the exams until the day of the exam, which was extremely stressful for them.In terms of exams, the two midterms had questions that were either relatively easy or incredibly difficult. The final exam was a bit ridiculous, the last few problems were so far from what we did in class that I'm not sure whythey were on the exam. Also as a note: the final is worth a large portion of your grade, so be sure that you have enough time to study for it.",
    "A challenging, but enlightening, intro. to college math. Don't get ambitious with these math classes, they will make you pay. You want to hit the ground running - don't get sick, or fail to study hard for a mid-term, because you will pay. Do all of the work all of the time - make math a #1 priority and you will survive and thrive. Otherwise you just might survive (maybe).",
    "I would only recommend Mathematics 115 to a fellow student if it is necessary for their major. Even if you did AP BC Calculus in high school, Math 115 is very challenging, and the final is very difficult. Somebody looking for a QR requirement should consider other classes.",
    "The course is recommended to a student who has taken up to Calculus AB.",
    "Regular math class. Take it if you have to or want to know calculus. It's not a bad workload, but not particularly interesting or stimulating. The second half is harder, though.",
    "I tough class if you didn't take BC calculus in high school. Just do alot of practice problems before the test to make sure that you have full grasp of the information covered in class. I would recommend this class to other students because it helps you think of math in a completely different way, just know that you might need a tutor to completely understand the concepts.",
    "DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS UNLESS TRULY NECESSARY",
    "If you need i for pre-med then take it, but if not dont bother. Do 112 instead."
