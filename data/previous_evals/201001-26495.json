   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this class to anyone interested in fun, romance readings as well as good discussion with a lot of romance lovers. The discussion, however, can get dull and repetitive at times. The reading load is not too bad, and it's always fun, so that's a plus.",
    "I would recommend the class to a student looking for light, fun reading, and a book-club feel. The class does not look very long at heavy material but rather focuses on recognizing the tropes of romance novels and what makes characters different and interesting. It's fun, enjoyable and pretty easy course.",
    "Highly recommend--fun reading alongside serious questions of genre and text which most \"highbrow literary\" scholars would do well to take.",
    "A class about the books people in the English department think they are too smart to read. The books are fun and engaging and force us to analyze literature that is very limitedly explored. If its offered and you like to read romance--TAKE IT!",
    "If you love reading romance novels, or just want a fun class with not too much work (besides a novel a week), then take this class!! It's a lot of fun, the readings are thoroughly enjoyable, and the discussions are always entertaining and informative. The professors are very approachable and helpful. They even let us turn in drafts which they commented on to help you improve your writing. And they were always willing to meet with you to discuss paper topics (although expect to come up with your own ideas and just have them okay them; they never actually gave me ideas for the papers). There were only two short papers (about 5 pages each) and one final project (10-15 pages but it could be a creative writing project which was great fun to right!)The problem for me was that it took me a while to know what to look for when reading the novels so that I could participate in discussion. The analysis required here is different than the analysis you did back in high school when you read Grapes of Wrath or Tale of Two Cities. You're not looking for metaphors and symbols and foreshadowing; you're looking to understand why the authors wrote the heroes&heroines the way they did and how they interact with each other, etc. There were questions on the syllabus for each novel that we were supposed to think about, but the discussions in class weren't always centered around those questions. So often times I found myself not knowing what to say until I finally learned how to think that way. Also, the majority of the students were upperclassmen, many of whom were English majors, so that was a bit intimidating because they knew what they were doing. But it shouldn't deter you =) It's not very much work at all and the professors are super sweet! I definitely recommend it. It's not an easy A, but it's not difficult either!",
    "Dear Yalie-Do everything in your power to take this class (...if you are looking for a fun, enjoyable, and thought provoking intro-level literature class)! This course starts off with the mother of Regency Romance, Jane Austin! Then it moves to Georgette Heyer (who is a brilliant writer and crafts amazingly detailed scenes and settings). By week 4 you get the chance to read the stereotypical (yet also fabulous) Romance novels like \"Flame and the Flower\" and \"Dreaming of You.\"As far as workload goes: you read a Romance novel and a few short articles a week (8-12 hours). It is a wonderful break from problem sets and dryer academic reading (I never thought of it as work).Class discussion were amazing because everyone in the class does the full reading and is really engaged in the discussion of plot and character development. It was the best seminar I have been in at Yale.For those of you who end up taking the class, congrats and have fun!!!",
    "I would definitely recommend taking this class if they offer it and if you can get in! It was one of the most fun classes I have taken at Yale.",
    "Definitely take this class. The reading is incredibly fun. It isn't necessarily an easy A, but it is certainly an easy class to motivate oneself to attend every week.",
    "Great class! Take it, especially if you enjoy reading popular literature through a critical lens.",
    "Definitely take this class. The reading is a lot of fun (don't be intimidated if you've never read romance before, not everyone in our class had either) and never felt too long, and the work is interesting and not overloaded. We had a lot of great class discussions. If you're looking for a traditional English\/lit kind of analysis, this is not going to be it, but if you're interested in how romance novels have changed, what works and what doesn't, and maybe even writing a chapter of a romance novel yourself, definitely do it.",
    "I would highly recommend this class, I hope they teach it again!",
    "If you have the opportunity to take Reading the Historical Romance Novel, do not hesitate to do so! The reading, though considerable, is incredibly fun, the class discussions are interesting, and the experience as a whole nothing short of life-changing. Whether you are already a fan of romance novels, or simply intrigued by what is a multi-million dollar chunk of the publishing industry, this class will make you want to read as much as you can wherever you can about the genre of the romance.",
    "If you enjoy romance novels, take it. There isn't much work, though the professors can be tough graders. If you don't know romance novels, I wouldn't necessarily recommend it because it might not be the best introduction to the genre."
