    "Highly recommend",
    "Amazing course, a lot of reading. I would absolutely recommend it to everyone.",
    "I would recommend. Great way to learn about how Buddhist philosophy can inform our western views, and vice versa.",
    "Definitely! Take any class prof. Garfield teaches at Yale. He's not always here so grab the chance!",
    "Perhaps the most life-transforming class I've taken at Yale. It was wonderful to study Buddhist philosophy and engage seriously with a tradition that in some ways I identify as my own. Just as wonderful was recognizing and exploring the affinities between Buddhist philosophy and strands of Western philosophical thought that I was already familiar with (utilitarianism, philosophy of language, philosophy of mind, skepticism, etc). The syllabus seemed daunting initially (averaging half a book a week, the most I've ever read for a course), but I found myself making it through pretty much all the required readings simply because (sans a few bad apples) they were all so interesting. Prof. Garfield was really great in class (also pretty woke, check out the intro to his book, Engaging Buddhism, where he very straightforwardly calls out the indefensible Eurocentrism of Western philosophy departments), and for the benefit of other Yalies, I hope he comes back to run this seminar again someday."
