    "I LOVED this class. Professor Laguna is really engaging, and the course material is really varied and interesting. The class exposes you to a lot of different types of media as well (comic books, tv shows, music, etc), which was refreshing. My section was a little dry and awkward. Not that much work, but try to bring the books to lecture, because Laguna does talk about them and calls on people. Would highly recommend.",
    "Phenomenal class that's a hidden gem in the Yale Course catalog. Lectures are insightful, TFs actually know what they are talking about and the assignments are simple but helpful in allowing you to explore topics as much as you want.",
    "I would recommend this class because it's a good introduction to what ERM classes can offer.",
    "Take it if you think you'll be interested in what the class is. It is a very survey class. It will cover many themes, many Latinx groups, through many different approaches. It also has a strong literary focus because of Laguna's personal pHD in literature. Lots of good readings. Definitely not a heavy workload.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS! this is a great survey course that will introduce you to a whole world of important issues, historical events, and mindsets about Latin@s - particularly in the United States. Professor Laguna is great and the work load and readings are manageable and interesting!",
    "Definitely take this. Laguna is a great lecturer, every class is a great mixture of funny, interesting, and eye-opening. Not too much work (3 papers and reading responses) but you'll learn a lot.",
    "I would recommend this class really to students who have had little to any exposure to Latin American studies, texts, peoples, cultures. This is because the class assumes one has no knowledge at all about Latino studies. Recommended to all students in all areas, especially those in political science and stem majors.",
    "AMST is an introduction to SOME parts of Latin@ studies. It is a class that you can use to learn a lot about Latin@ studies or, if you don't engage at all, you can learn nothing! Professor Laguna is an unwavering enthusiastic Professor who demands and receives respect from his class. I know that this was his first time scaling this class from a seminar to a lecture and I think he did it well. His lectures were repetitive at times and I found I could zone out for a while and come back and we would be in the same place. C'est la vie. I appreciate that Professor Laguna encouraged students to give announcements at the beginning of class. If you can have Karla as a section leader you should! Karla was a great section leader. It was obvious from the first section that she is a more timid person -- she seemed nervous to be speaking to all of us together. But she should't have been! Karla is brilliant and I really appreciated her insight. She is very well read and isn't afraid to show it. She was openly critical of some of Professor Laguna's arguments, which was really interesting. I especially appreciated her criticisms of Enrique's Journey. I agree with her now that it is a very problematic book.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. The workload is manageable, and you learn a lot about the history of US relations with Latin America that provides context for a lot of current issues. Professor Laguna and the TA staff do a great job of bringing in multiple forms of text and media into the class discussion, and are all super knowledgeable and helpful!",
    "Would recommend if you are interested in the issues.",
    "I would recommend this class to ALL other students. I think it is extremely important to understand the history of US- Latin American relations to have a better grasp on why our current perspectives\/ opinions\/ understanding are what they are. After taking this class, I feel I can better engage in discourse regarding Latin America, feel a lot more 'grounded' in who I am as a Latina in the US. It also definitely made me want to take many other classes within the ER&M department. I almost wish I could triple major in ER&M. Definitely take it!",
    "I recommend it if you don't know very much about Latin@ history or Latin American studies; if you have a background in it the class will feel like a lot of review.",
    "A great class that's not too difficult but there is a lot of reading to do",
    "I would recommend this class. Laguna is a very engaging lecturer and he covers a lot of different things, so there's plenty to keep you interested. There's a lot of different kinds of source material - beyond books we also watched movies and commercials and analyzed advertisements and cartoons. The work was manageable with weekly readings, 2 short papers and a final paper. One of my favorites at Yale.",
    "AMST 284 01 is a class where you learn to think about culture through examining art, media, literature, and history to understand why Latin America and the US look the way they do now. It was an amazing class and I think I learmed more than I did in any other Yale class I've taken. Everyone should take Intro to Latino studies!",
    "Everyone at Yale should take this course!",
    "A good class if you're looking to learn a little more about certain Hispanic ethnicities and especially about bananas. Laguna is a funny guy who keeps lecture interesting.",
    "A broad survey course on the role of Latino\/as in the US. Makes you think a lot and you learn a bunch of new things. Take this course!",
    "I would say this is a survey course that can be a bit more tedious than the average Yale course. I would recommend the course to another student but I really hope the time is shortened for future classes.",
    "This is a survey course meant to engage many forms of media and various aspects of Latinidad. It can be slightly reading-heavy, but the discussions and analysis are not super difficult. Would recommend to anyone looking to get their feet wet in Latino Studies, or to someone who would like to study many aspects of Latinidad in one course.",
    "I would recommend it, but maybe not to those who already know a lot about US-Latin American relations. Personally I learned a lot from the class though.",
    "I would recommend this class to any student. It is a great overview of the history and culture of Latinx diasporas in the United States. Professor Laguna is amazing, and his lectures are funny and entertaining.However, don't take this class as a gut! Professor Laguna will ask you about the readings in lecture, and it is embarrassing when no one responds! Come into the class ready to engage, and it will be amazing.",
    "Definitely take this class if you are at all interested in Latin@ groups in the US!! It's not too much work, the readings are really interesting, you get a good overview of all the different groups, and Laguna is a really cool professor.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. Again, the material was great, lecture was engaging, and you get a lot out of it. I feel like that's the most you could ask for.",
    "A great survey on the culture, history, and experience of Latinos. Prof. Laguna is an engaging and fun lecturer and the materials for the class are great. However, it is pretty literature bent, so if that's not your thing, proceed with caution\/perhaps take it credit\/d.",
    "Take this class before you leave yale!",
    "This class provides a very interesting and important introduction to Latin@ studies -- the reading list is amazing, and all of the topics are timely and crucial to know about. I think the format would work much better as a smaller lecture or as a seminar, because the lectures often felt like they were just going over the reading or like they required discussion, which was not possible with such a large class. However, don't let this dissuade you from taking the class -- Professor Laguna was still an engaging lecturer, despite the size of the class. Plus, take it for the topics and readings alone!",
    "This class looks at the historical, political, and social representations and experiences of Latinos and Latinas in America and beyond. I would highly recommend this class. It challenged me to think critically along many different lines including race, class, gender, space, etc.",
    "Intro to Latin@ Studies is an awesome intro course to the field, especially if you are unfamiliar with the field of Latin@ Studies. It covers the history of Latin@s and Latin countries in respect to their relation with the United States -- these are histories that everyone needs to learn, especially (!!!) if you live in the United States. Professor Laguna is an awesome lecturer -- super interesting, funny, and in touch with his students. There is weekly reading -- usually a mix of books, short stories\/poems, and other shorter readings, as well as 3 papers (there isn't a final; just a final essay). The essays are unique in that students are not allowed to use outside research sources, but instead are more of in-depth literary examinations of texts read and material covered in the syllabus. Overall, a fantastic class - would definitely recommend. We need a ton more of this kind of class at Yale.",
    "This class is about the US relations with Latin America. You get to learn about the hard and often devastating truth behind US actions and its consequences on Latin America and Latin Americans in the US. I would recommend this class to everyone.",
    "I would highly recommend the course to other students. There are lots of interesting readings and the course will change your outlook on what latinidad means.",
    "This class changed my life. I absolutely LOVED IT!!! I learned about Latinx culture in the most critical way ever. I never imagined being so surprised by Latinx culture and this class proved me wrong. Don't take an L... take this class!",
    "Definitely take this! The material is very interesting and extremely relevant. The three papers aren't overwhelming, and the syllabus is full of works you will actually enjoy reading. Overall a fun, engaging class that asks some really vital questions.",
    "I would definitely recommend! Great class, great material, very informative, very fun!",
    "AMAZING CLASS. Professor Laguna is seriously one of the most brilliant and charismatic people you'll ever meet. Lecture can move quickly and be a lot of information to take in, especially if you don't have a background in a lot of these topics, but it's so worth it and I honestly learned SO much. The readings are all incredible, try do to most of them if you can, even though they can be long (a book per week or two)! EVERYONE SHOULD TAKE THIS CLASS. If you want to be an educated citizen of the world, you should at least start with Intro to Latino Studies and go from there.",
    "I had high hopes for this course. Overall not terrible but definitely could use some work in making lectures more useful. Lecture was either a lot of historical information in large paragraphs on a single slide or barebones outline of something. It just never felt coherent or like one thing built upon another. Also I know it's a flaw of any survey class but spending roughly a week on a certain country then moving on didn't feel like we had any time to explore any topic in depth. Ultimately I felt like I wasted my time and could've taken a better class.",
    "Take this class! This is one of those amazing classes where you could take it for own knowledge and not for careers or requirements.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class! It is a lot of reading and I do recommend going to the lectures. It isn't that hard but extremely interesting.",
    "This was a wonderful intro to many topics in the humanities, which, as a STEM major, I'm usually not exposed to. I was able to engage in conversation about race, gender, sexuality, and colonialism. Just as importantly, I feel like I learned lot about the mediums in which they appear, and how authors\/people in power use them. Laguna was a really wonderful professor who clearly cares a lot about his students. We had a number of guest lectures, and he always encouraged us to supplement our understanding of Latin@ studies outside of the classroom. My only comment is that I think that we spent a little too much time watching videos\/documentaries in class, when I feel I could have done that at home. Prof. Laguna was wonderfully enthusiastic and approachable. He always answered questions after class, and would always engage the class, even though it was well over 150 people. He had an awesome sense of humor, and made the 75 minutes pass really quickly. Not an overwhelming amount of work, and the time you spend is really rewarding!",
    "would recommend!",
    "This is an excellent course that will provide you with a baseline exposure to the divers forms of La this is an excellent course that will provide you with a baseline exposure to the diverse manifestations of Latinidad and the histories underlinimg the formation of \"Latinos\" as a racial construct in the US. You will furthermore learn to critically analyze media presentations, deconstruct complex academic writing, contextualize histories of Latinos, and understand the socio-political experiences (broadly) of Latinos in the United States. This list is not comprehensive, and you will learn so much more in this course. It is truly an opportunity not to miss.",
    "This course allows you to lean more about a side of history that is usually not taught: the US and their relationship with Latinos as well as Latin America. It taught me to be more of aware of how minorities are portrayed in popular culture and to always question why they are being presented in such a manner. It was also shocking to learn the extent to which the United States had hurt Latin American Countries. I recommend this course as it allows you to be more conscious about the struggles of Latinos in the United States.",
    "Take this course if you want a survey of Latinos in America and the different groups that make up that composition. It is interesting to take even if you are Latino yourself. Laguna is great. The reading list is great. GO TO LECTURE! It's the best part of the course.",
    "A survey course in Latino studies. The first few weeks were about Latinx in the United States, and then we studied different Latino nationalities, once a week. In section we responded to students' reading response questions and talked about the readings.",
    "I'd recommend Intro to Latino\/a Studies to pretty much anyone! Great for those who are new to the topic or to ethnic studies, but also seemed to be great for latino\/a student, being taught about their communities. One of the best parts is the reading list - never too strenuous but a GREAT introduction to lots of different types of Latinx literature and art.",
    "A class that will make you think about American history in a new way. It will also make you reconsider the history of Latin America",
    "A fun course that is very much an intro lecture on all things Latin@. If you're looking to dive into any particular aspect of the Latin@ experience, whether that be a particular ethnic group or topic like dance or fiction, you might want to consider looking elsewhere. Very manageable workload. Sometimes a bit of a pachanga.",
    "I loved this course. Professor Laguna was a wonderful instructor and it was one of my favorite classes. It gave me a chance to explore a topic that I was previously unfamiliar with through a number of different mediums. I also loved reading the novels.",
    "Highly recommended!",
    "TAKE THIS COURSE. Everyone should take at least one ethnic studies course at Yale, and this is a great way to get started. It's definitely a survey course - we covered a huge amount of material, from history and current events to art and literature, but also managed to really get in depth on the important issues. Laguna is an amazing professor, so warm and funny but also very knowledgable. I honestly can't recommend this course enough, it will change the way you think about Yale, yourself, the news you see each day, the movies you watch. Just do it!"
