    "Wonderful. Buonocore is a fabulous professor. If you're on the fence about which language to take, go with Italian. It's not the absolute easiest, but if you've got a working knowledge of French or Spanish, it's very doable, and by the end of L2 you're conversational and know a hell of a lot of subjunctive tenses. More importantly, it's really fun, and occasionally you get free food. It's a 9:30 a.m. class every single morning, and I still found it fun.",
    "ITAL 120 was a good continuation. It was more comprehensive and less erratic than 110. While the material covered was more difficult, I never had to learn an entire unit in one week like I did in 110, which meant that I was able to learn concepts better and with less stress.",
    "Yes definitely. Despite the fact that it is a lot more challenging than Italian 110, it is extremely rewarding.",
    "Great course! You learn so much more Italian. Fun and existing",
    "On the whole a slower class with more complicated subject matter than ITAL 110, but you get to a level where you actually understand quite a bit of Italian.",
    "ITAL 120 is full of Italian grammar and has plenty of Italian vocabulary in useful areas. I would recommend this to anyone who wants to learn Italian at a reasonable pace and has taken ITAL 110 or has a similar level of Italian language skills.",
    "yes - of any language, i would recommend italian",
    "I would highly recommend Ital 120! It is a hard course, like all language courses at Yale, but it gives you a great foundation in the language and you will be able to speak in a limited capacity with natives by the end of this course."
