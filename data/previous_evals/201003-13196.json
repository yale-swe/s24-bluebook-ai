    "I would only recommend it to someone proactive, someone who loves Arabic\/languages or someone with a bit of background with Arabic. Don't do it just to fill your language requirement. Otherwise you'll just be frustrated with the class.",
    "Take the program here only if you REALLY want to take Arabic. otherwise, don't expect anything great.workload is intensive, especially when considering that the language is nothing like English\/other European languages.",
    "Arabic 110 is an interesting and stimulating language class, but it suffers from a case of false advertising. This class teaches Modern Standard Arabic, a highly formal version of the language which is used for reading and writing as well as for speaking in formal or intellectual situations. Most of the course consists of reading, writing, and grammar. If you are looking for work with fluency or pronunciation, this may not be the class for you, as most of the class is conducted in English and we do not speak very much apart from scripted dialogues. I must also stress that since the class teaches MSA, what we learn will not be understood by the majority of Arabs, who speak a number of different dialects. That being said, I think this class is a good linguistic workout for anyone who is interested in the subject and also provides a good foundation for anyone looking to further their knowledge of Arabic in the future.",
    "If you want to learn Arabic, take this course. But be warned, it is a tremendous amount of work. You cannot slack your way through this course.",
    "Arabic is an interesting language and really cool to learn but the program is ridiculously disorganized and overwhelming, especially at first. If you have Aziz the first few weeks there is a 50% chance you will drop the class.",
    "It's a decent class, but very frustrating in the fact that there seems to be little cohesion among the instructors. Schedules would be changed instantly, locations for test would be posted minutes before they were supposed to happen, items required for homework would be posted the night before the assignment was due. It's a lot of work, some of which I feel is unnecessary, but if you Really, Really, Really want to learn \"Standard Arabic\" take it. If you have the opportunity to take it elsewhere (especially somewhere in the Middle East, I recommend taking that route instead).",
    "I would say if you are dedicated in learning the language, take it. If you want to just fulfill the FL requirements, then don't. This class needs dedication. You will have homework every night, a quiz every week, core conversation memorization once a week, four written tests, four listening tests and many MORE! So take it if you are certain that you can give it time and efforts that it requires.",
    "This class is a lot of work (as much as my other classes combined). You will spend a semester very frustrated, and very focused on the language, but you will leave knowing a surprising amount of language for only a few months.",
    "This class is not for the short-fused, organized student.One will find their patience being tested and broken on a day to day basis, due to the burdensome workload and the utter disorganization of the department. The rotation of instructors, which occurs every five days, is an obstacle to the learning of the language.Also, the material covered in no way provides any benefit outside the classroom; basic conversational skills are not a predictable outcome of this class. Be prepared for grammar that makes you want to borrow your head into a mound of dirty snow.This is not said in jest. Be forewarned, O intrepid one, for this is a class that tries mens' souls.",
    "ARBC 110 is a pretty intensive introduction course. There is quite a bit of work due daily. But if you are on top of your assignments and pay attention in class, you should do very well and learn a lot too. I would recommend this class if you are enthusiastic about learning Arabic and have the time to commit to it,",
    "Are you a heritage speaker? You might be ok. But not necessarily. The department is a mess. The professor rotation system is a mess. It is not an even rotation, and if you end up with the worst professor for 9 weeks like my class did, oh well, you're on your own. The professors are nice, but aren't very effective. If you want to speak conversational Arabic, might not want to take this class. If you don't want to spend all night studying core conversations and vocab, don't take this class. If you want to do work for your other classes, don't take this class. If you don't want to be constantly frustrated and ready to pull your hair out, don't take this class.",
    "I would recommend it if and only if you are very committed to learning this language, are very willing to figure out concepts independently, and can give yourself a concrete justification for putting yourself through it. It's a tough language to begin with, and tougher at Yale.",
    "Take it if you really want to learn arabic but definitely not the best language to learn at Yale. It's a lot of information in one semester, but hopefully subsequent levels will help make sense of it all.",
    "Overall, while there are some great teachers in the department, the Introductory Arabic course is extremely poorly organized and administer. As a result this course often impacted negatively on my other classes and the work I was doing for them. I will be discontinuing my study of Arabic at Yale for these reasons (at least until significant changes to the organization and administration of the course are made). I would absolutely not recommend that other students take this course.CONTINUED FROM QUESTION 13. Teacher hand writing - Apart from Shady El Massry, the handwriting displayed by the teachers was poor and as a result extremely difficult to decipher. As a result, the notes that had to be taken were slow and drew concentration from actually learning the concepts.4. Videos in Listening Exams - The listening exams we took often used children's videos that were extremely poorly dubbed and had unusual voices. As a beginner, I find it difficult enough understanding an adult who speaks arabic slowly and properly enunciates each word. When, as in the case of the listening videos, the characters are speaking extremely quickly and in high pitched tones or very unusual accents it is practically impossible to understand. The three specific examples that come to mind are the \"Mugulak video,\" the Arabic \"Bert and Ernie\" video, and the \"Little Red Riding Hood\" cartoon. This of course causes one distress during an exam an often results in poor performance. On more than one occasion I witnessed students leave the listening test crying.5. Final Exams - This ranked as the most distressing elementof the course for number of reasons. Firstly, the first of our two final exams was a take home listening exam to be done over the weekend. I received notification that the take home exam had been posted through the Classes V2 email notification, however, I was out at the time and thus received the email on my phone. When I got home, I went on to classes V2 and to the folder marked \"Final Exam\" - \"Final Listening\" (I would add that at the time there was no answer key in this folder) and downloaded and completed what I thought to be the exam. Then on the Sunday evening (the evening before it was due) I received a message from a friend informing me that I may have done the wrong exam. It turned out our final listening exam was not posted in the \"Final Exam\" folder but in a folder far below titled \"Test.\" I went through the site and there was a total of three documents titled \"Final Listening.\" This meant a test that I had originally been given two days to work on now needed to be completed in a couple hours. When some of the students and I approached Professor Nasser the next day with the issue he was combative and told us that we should have only used the link from the email and not looked for the test on Classes V2--this was the first time I was informed that this was apparently the standard procedure to be followed. I was never briefed at the beginning of the course on a specific method for retrieving resources off of Classes V2. Furthermore, he told us that \"it was not his problem\" that we had done the wrong test. I find it difficult to believe that I have made a significant misjudgment going to a file title \"Final Exam\" and \"Final Listening\" to look for my final listening exam. This leads to the second problem, I have a learning disability and as a result have to be very specific and directed about how I plan and manage my study time. Having to do a rush job of a final listening exam the evening before the final writing exam caused significant upheaval in my study plans and severely detracted from my study for the final written exam. Related to the previous issue, I am registered with Disability Services, and the special provisions were not organized for the exam.",
    "Wow. Too much fun! You learn a lot. You get frustrated. It's really disorganized, so take good and efficient notes. But you can do it!",
    "Only take it if you truly want to learn Arabic. It's one of the worst taught languages at Yale, and a lot of work as well.",
    "Strongly recommended for those interested in Arabic.",
    "I recommend it if you REALLY want to learn Arabic and are willing to put in the work and suffer through the department. if you just need o fulfill a language requirement I would suggest taking another language.",
    "It's an easy A if you do the work--but there is a lot of work. So only take the language if you have an interest in learning the Arabic language and investing a lot of time into it. Not worth it if not. The teacher rotation system is pretty bogus because sometimes you get stuck with one of the worse teachers for weeks and then get a good one for only a week; it's all over the place. Also, realize that you will NOT be able to speak Arabic for a loooooooong time, but the language is really cool and fun to learn. I personally have found it rewarding despite the inconsistencies in instruction.",
    "I would recommend ARBC110 to anyone who is serious about learning the language, and is likely to continue until level 4 or 5. Arabic is a difficult language, you will have to work hard, and you might not come out feeling you know as much as if you had taken a simpler language.",
    "This class is definitely worthwhile if you're really interested in starting to learn Arabic; however, a lot of dedication is necessary to put in the amount of time and effort needed. Also, don't take too many other extremely difficult classes at the same time, for the sake of both your grades and your sanity.",
    "Arabic is a tough language to learn. However, you can skim by and do the bare minimum and get an A- but the latter tests will still be a huge pain. Learn vocab at the beginning of the week, learn grammar when presented, and you'll do well in the class. But if you really want to learn arabic, really spend 2 hours a night on this stuff, and I think that you'll be pretty impressed with yourself by the end of the semester.",
    "Large workload, fascinating language, worth taking but only if your courseload is already not too high.",
    "Only take this class if you need to\/really want to learn arabic more than anything. It's organized terribly, the teachers switch all the time, making it extremely difficult to develop close relationships with any of them, and you never speak out loud in class. It's also tons of work, and really unrewarding.",
    "It is a lot of work and can be very frustrating. However it is def manageable if you have an ounce of common sense and a some advice: 1. Do the homework carefully and on time. 2. Ask questions. All the time; it is the primary way you will learn in this class. 3. Go to office hours. It will make your life sooo much easier. 4. Know how you study best early in the course and use that method. 5. Practice what you've learned, because you will see everything again, and again and again.Do the above and don't worry about grades, they'll work themselves out as long as you follow the advice to the t.",
    "Great if you're interested in beginning the language--you learn a lot. Not a fan of the rotating professor structure though since it can leave you at a disadvantage if you dont necessarily have a access to the same resources or profs as another class section.",
    "I would recommend the course to another student if they were willing to put up with a poorly structured and and at times, poorly taught program. Only their commitment to the language will motivate them to continue. There are a lot of frustrations with the way the course is structured and a student shouldn't have to deal with that."
