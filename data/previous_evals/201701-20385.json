    "I think that the course if run well in terms of homework and midterms. I do believe that there should be a bit more time allowed for the midterms, possibly extending the exams to the whole class period as opposed to just one hour. More importantly, I think that the professor for this course is probably not the right professor for an introduction course to chemistry. More information on this is provided below.",
    "This course was advertised a course for those who have never taken chemistry, bu was implemented like a hard-core chemistry class. Home works were only available online for a short window of time, and were not relative to the text. The teacher would say \"this is very easy\" before talking about any idea, immediately making me feel stupid for not completely understanding it, therefore creating a judgmental environment. The textbook often covered topic at length that our teacher would later label as \"not something we would need to know\", informing us of the hour or so taken to read the material we had wasted. The only time we actually did problems that would be similar to those on the tests were in the practice problems given to us, which often did not have solutions, so there was no way to check answers. (THERE ARE ONLY SOLUTIONS TO THE QUESTIONS HIGHLIGHTED IN BLUE). These types of problems also would not be discussed in class. I never got any feedback from the second midterm, which would have been extremely helpful in preparing for the final. The professor could have been more focused on the students as opposed to his own reputation, as his answer to my wanting to drop the class was that there were only 6 people in the class, implying that my dropping would make him look bad.",

    "If you are looking for an introduction course for an easy science credit, go ahead and take this class. If you're looking to take an enjoyable class, I think that the professor isn't super conducive to this atmosphere. Professor Ganapathi does take the time to explain the topics very well but I really don't think he should be teaching an introductory course. He expects students to understand the information already and acts like you're stupid if you don't understand and need additional explanations.",
    "DO NOT TAKE. Dr. G is a very sweet person, but a harsh grader and very judgmental and passive aggressive. His goal may be to help you learn but he is so smart that he will invariably make you feel inadequate by insisting that everything is very easy and tell you he is disappointed in you... every class. If you take this class, don't be late or miss a single day because Dr. G will make you feel horrible about it for next three of four classes through passive aggressive comments and at times, by outright ignoring you. I struggled with the material and mentioned to Dr. G that I wanted to drop the class, and he told me that I shouldn't because there were only 6 people in the class... implying that it would make him look bad. If you are new to chem or looking for a fun science credit, this is NOT the class to take. I will say that there were some pretty fun in-class demonstrations and experiments, which is the one redeeming quality of this class.",
    "This course covered chemistry applied in real life, such as pollution, global warming, energy production, water quality and polymers. The content was very relevant to life and the chemistry content itself was manageable for someone who is not a STEM major. If you need a Sc credit and wouldn't mind a SCL course at 9AM, this course is honestly not a bad option to consider."
