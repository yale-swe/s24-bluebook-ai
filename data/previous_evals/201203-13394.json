   "comments": [
    "It's a great class. I never got the opportunity to write creative nonfiction in high school. It was all literary analysis papers. I've really been inspired to pursue writing more because of this class.",
    "Yes, I would certainly recommend this classto someone who likes writing, but perhaps doesn't really enjoy reading classical English literature like Moby Dick and Pride and Prejudice. This is a chance to write creatively and really improve your writing.",
    "This course was brilliant. Professor Ehrgood's enthusiasm for language was contagious and I fell in love with the creative non-fiction genre. Take it. It will make you think.",
    "It is a class in which you have a number of readings of essays over a couple weeks of class that follow the theme of your next essay, and then you write a rough draft, workshop people's essays, and turn in the final draft as you start the reading for the next paper. I would recommend it because it did definitely expand my writing ability, and especially made me focus on the voice and tone of my essay, which I think is lost in a lot of writing classes in which you just write for the teacher's ear.",
    "Take it. No brainer.",
    "If you're a science person, might not want to take it--6 essays plus your problem sets isn't fun. It's a great class, but it IS NOT LIFE CHANGING like everyone on Yale's campus makes it out to be. That being said, it's fun, it's pretty easy (some teachers are really hard graders) and definitely a good English class to take all around.",
    "If you can get into Ehrgood's section, take it. It's hard, but in a totally fulfilling kind of way. You read wonderful, beautiful, inspiring pieces, and get to learn from one of the most brilliant people at Yale. Take this class because it's a writing credit, take it because it makes you a better writer and person. Whatever you do, just take it! Seriously. It is so unbelievably awesome.",
    "I strongly recommend English 120. It made me think about the way I read and write in new ways. The reading assignments were usually short and very interesting. I loved hearing the stories of my classmates in the workshops we did for each essay assignment. Professor Ehrgood puts in a lot of office hours to help students produce their very best writing.Professor Ehrgood, as far as I know, is the only English 120 instructor who assigns a lipogram essay, which is written without the letter \"E\". He prepares his students, for this essay all semester, so even if this sounds terrible don't be scared away!English 120 requires students to be active participants in discussion and be willing to share their own work. If you are quiet and afraid of getting feedback on your writing, this is not the class for you.But I would recommend this class to almost anyone. It was the best class of my first semester at Yale.",
    "ENGL 120 is boot camp for your writing skills. But to with which you're excited to go. Sure, there are 5-6 papers throughout the semester (depending on the section), and some prompts may inspire you more than others, but the entire class was somehow both enjoyable and groundbreaking with regards to the quality of my writing. Definitely take this course, regardless of your life goals, as it is both fun and helpful in almost every field. Just make sure you get a good professor, as that makes all the difference. I had Ehrgood, and he was a joy to study under and work with.",
    "You read great essays, you write 5 essays, you revise them. You choose when the class workshops your essay so work hard on that one, though everyone is really nice. Ehrgood is great, but will return stuff late and change up the syllabus a lot. BUT he will absolutely change the way you write no matter how advanced you are. Our section had a lot of juniors and seniors which was nice, including advanced english majors. I would strongly recomend taking it with Ehrgood.",
    "I would definitely recommend the class, especially with Professor Ehrgood. He does things a bit differently, for example the last assignment, which is to write an essay without using the letter e. It was actually a lot of fun, and I'm glad I was given that assignment. I came away from the class feeling like I now have a better command of the English language and how to use it to create artful prose.",
    "The most engaging, most rewarding class I've taken in a while. In the past, I've found myself excited to write assigned essays, and that was certainly the case for all five pieces in this class, but I also had a genuine desire to do all the reading, which has never happened to me. I made tremendous strides in my writing because of this class, noticeably making that leap from an intelligent, but overzealous high school writer to a clean, efficient, and sharp college writer. This was very much the kind of English class any Yale student should take during his four years."
