    "Absolutely. Take it!",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. Professor Herman is a fantastic guy and you get to see some amazing speakers. It is very interesting, the papers are fun to write, and it is one of the best courses I have taken at Yale.",
    "I would recommend this course to everyone. It provides a broad understanding of business and journalism and the guest speakers are remarkable.",
    "TAKE IT. I have no reservations in recommending this course to every Yale student.",
    "Would absolutely recommend this class to ANYONE - the reading selection is amazing, the knowledge learned in it is valuable and it was a lot of fun.",
    "Take this course! This was one of the best courses I have ever taken at Yale! Professor Herman is incredibly committed to his students and teaches you a ton about business journalism. However, if you have any interest in finance, this class is worth taking alone for the numerous speakers and field trips!",
    "Absolutely. Take it.",
    "TAKE IT. Professor Herman is caring, knowledgeable, and willing to challenge the way that you approach both your writing and your thoughts on the economy. You will go on field trips as a class to places like the WSJ, NYTimes, floor of the stock exchange, and the Fed. And you will gain a lot of skills no matter what you want to do with your life. Take it, take it!",
    "This is an amazing course. I learned a lot about journalism and the various aspects of the economy that influence business journalism. The material covered and the professor are truly delightful. As far as work goes, there isn't much, but writing journalism pieces is harder than you might think if you've never done it before. As far as most college seminars go, it's pretty typical--not terribly hard but very rewarding.",
    "If you want to learn about business journalism, I could not think of a better class that could hypothetically be offered than this class with Professor Herman."
