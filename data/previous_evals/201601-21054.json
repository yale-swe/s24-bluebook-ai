   "comments": [
    "It's a solid lab class, albeit a little repetitive. You're usually out by 3:30pm and it's definitely a lot better than gen chem lab.",
    "Not unless it's needed",
    "You prob need to take it. It's not hard. Follow directions and don't overthink things. Format counts more than content.",
    "It is definitely nothing to be afraid about, and can be fun with good lab partners. Grading can sometimes be stressful but overall a solid course.",
    "AMAZING",
    "Good lab course, necessary for pre-medical studies or chemistry-related majors.",
    "Not that bad- you're taking it because you have to, but its actually pretty fun!",
    "Although this course is required for many majors, I still enjoyed it a lot. You should not be afraid or intimidated by this course. It is laid-back, but at the same time you learn a lot of useful things. I recommend this course.",
    "Great lab, but that said, unless it is a requirement, I'd advise taking a full credit course instead (same amount of work most likely).",
    "low commitment, would recommend to a friend (but let's be real: who takes orgo 2 lab if they don't have to...)",
    "I would definitely recommend this lab to fellow students. It is the fun reward after learning lots of bench techniques during first semester organic lab. You get to successfully carry out many complex, synthetically-significant reactions that you learn about in organic chemistry lecture.",
    "overall great course. Dr. D understands the importance of making the most of your time, so she does not make you do a bunch of unnecessary tasks. labs are fairly short, only 3 'reports' throughout the semester. yes the experimental techniques are a bit repetitive from week to week but really its not bad.",
    "I would recommend it to any student who is interested in chemistry\/lab research. It gives you a good grasp of the precision required by lab work, and exposes you to a lab environment. While I'm sure the vast majority of students are taking this for some sort of requirement, it is certainly nothing to fear, but at the same time, I'm sure it depends on your TA.",
    "Chem 223L was a fun lab! I recommend it! Very low stress",
    "Only take it if you need to obviously.",
    "I wouldn't take this unless you had to. While professors and TAs were great, the labs themselves were somewhat mind-numbing.",
    "Very similar course to CHEM 222L in terms of the expectations for students' work. Labs are more interesting and complex this semester, and some more in depth analysis of lab techniques is learned.",
    "Chem 223L offers a chance to apply ones knowledge of organic chemistry while working through enjoyable reactions. The workload is manageable and rewarding. In addition, if a student wishes to pursue the fields of biology or chemistry, this course is an essential, as it will teach important concepts with multiple real-world applications. However, at the same time, it is a very enjoyable course for all majors, because it definitely strengthens ones problem-solving skills. I would definitely recommend this course to another student due to its usefulness and excellent teaching style.",
    "Chances are it's a mandatory class, but it's not too bad at all! Dr. DiMeglio is great.",
    "Not too bad! Not bad if you take it after finishing orgo, but it helps to do them at the same time. More work than you anticipate for half a credit.",
    "This is much better than the gen chem lab.",
    "A good introduction to synthesis of organic compounds. I would recommend it, because it was enjoyable and informative.",
    "CHEM 223L is very similar to CHEM 222L. The lab component of organic chemistry is really quite fun and the experiments help to see concepts from lecture.",
    "CHEM 223L requires a fair amount of prep before lab but is a rewarding course! You learn a ton from the pre-lab assignments and from lectures with the TFs. Dr. DiMeglio will get you excited about learning organic chemistry!",
    "An organized and reasonable lab that complements lecture a little more than it did during first semester orgo lab. Workload is very manageable and content isn't difficult. Pretty much every lab is partner work and there's less new material, so this lab is less work than first semester. Once again you get out earlier than other labs, usually between 3-4 pm.",
    "you are taking this class because you are chem or pre-med but I HATED THIS LAB This course is only about formatting. 75 percent of the work was just regurgitating the same material in the course packet for EPs. Points would be deducted for very very minor inconsistencies with the formatting. Taking up students time on formatting is worthless. All of the chemistry labs need to be redone because they take up horrible amounts of time and result in little gaining of knowledge. STRENGTH: We do learn some very applicable real-life chem techniques! Like NMR spectroscopy! I really do feel like the in class part ofthe lab was very crucial to my development! I often enjoyed it. WE did smell like chemicals afterward and standing up for four hours after a three hours of sleep the night before was not the best.",
    "I recommend taking CHEM 223L, as it is a well-organized laboratory course. You learn interesting reactions and techniques, and towards the end, some of what we learned in class was reflected in the labs.",
    "So much better than genchem lab, and I liked it better than orgo lab 1. You're at the point now where you can actually carry out real reactions, which is cool. Would recommend taking it while doing Orgo II, because the curriculum lines up pretty well",
    "It is a fun class although I felt like I didn't learn anything new for CHEM 222.",
    "It's similar to other Chem labs but a little more straightforward.",
    "Logical follow up to CHEM 222L. It is very much the same as Orgo Lab 1.",
    "who actually wants to take this class youre taking it because you have to good luck",
    "CHEM 223L is fine because it is organized and structured.",
    "Actually a fun course, worth taking to help understand the lecture class",
    "A good overview continuation of organic chemistry laboratory technique.",
    "Good lab, not too much work and actually kind of enjoyable at times. Definitely much, much better than gen chem. Very hard final exam though.",
    "Definitely take this if you enjoy chemistry! It is much better than first semester.",
    "It was a well organized lab with relevant experiments to what was being taught in Freshman Orgo. Not the most fun, but not bad either.",
    "Good course.",
    "Good standard lab class. Dr. Dimeglio is very clear and the labs are straightforward and informative.",
    "CHEM 223L is a good intro lab course for the 2nd semester of organic chemistry. It is very well taught and helps us apply the techniques we learned 1st semester to various reactions.",
    "This class is a class where you will be able to do some of the really cool reactions that you learn about in organic chemistry.",
    "Beware \"easy workload,\" but not much learning goes down\/and still no lecturing like CHEM 221L. Few new lab techniques are learned, and you will continue mixing new reagents in similar manners, with only new arrow pushes.",
    "If you're taking organic chemistry lecture, I would definitely recommend it! It feels rewarding to be able to see reactions like the Diels Alder and aldol condensation actually come to life beyond just learning their mechanisms on paper. It's also nice because many of the techniques are a review from first semester, so you start to really feel comfortable with them and get to just focus on making a cool product!",
    "needed",
    "Take 223 if you need the lab credit. Otherwise, it's a pretty dry 4 hours every week. Also, this class should DEFINITELY be 1 credit rather than 1\/2...what a rip-off. It takes as much time per week as some of my seminars.",
    "Chem 223L is a typical organic chemistry lab. I would recommend it to a student interested in organic chemistry or lab work.",
    "Yes, great lab course for Chem majors\/ pre-med students.",
    "One of the best courses you will take at Yale! Would definitely recommend CHEM 223L to another student because Professor DiMeglio is an incredible lab professor and makes sure her students understand the lab material and procedures. Excellent complement to organic chemistry lecture.",
    "A required lab course that is pretty fun--you make lots of crystals and learn a whole bunch of new lab techniques. No one is really sure how to study for the final though."
