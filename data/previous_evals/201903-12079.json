   "comments": [
    "Strengths include the fact that this is the only course like it at Yale. It's quite unique, and cant really be compared to other courses on most axes. Clear feedback on translations, balanced consistent workload that gradually builds the students' ability.",
    "This class introduces students to the grammatical rules of literary Chinese with a series of texts (some of which are bizarre but super fun at the same time) arranged in increasing order of difficulty. This worked great for me and helped a lot to internalize the rules, which can be very different from that of mandarine that I was used to.",
    "Would be cool if we covered more cultural context in class. But honestly in terms of learning how to read Classical Chinese the curriculum is really good",
    "I loved this course -- nothing to change!"

   "comments": [
    "Yes, this is a great and necessary course if you want to learn how to read premodern Chinese literature in the original language. The class is taught in English, but I would recommend it only to more advanced language learners (at least L5). Mick is very organized, and I always knew what to expect and how to prepare.",
    "Yes, if you're taking this course then you know why you're taking this course. Highly specialized.",
    "This is great if you want to learn some classical texts written in literary Chinese. This is also a great opportunity to learn and think about some of the nuances in translating from Chinese to English, which you get to practice a lot with biweekly assignments. It can take quite a bit of time if you are less comfortable with mandarine since I personally felt my mandarine intuition helped a lot in parsing the texts and making sense of the grammar. There are recitation assignments at the beginning of the semester where you are required to recite a very short sentence (~20 characters) in class. This might be something to consider if you are not a person who likes memorizing stuff.",
    "Yep! You get to tell your friends you can read Classical Chinese and look super Woke. Plus knowing the Chinese in this class helps with reading and understanding the modern Chinese language as well",
    "Yes! Take this class if you're interested in literary Chinese. Don't be afraid of its complexity. This was truly awarding.",
    "surprisingly, this course was the most fun i had that entire semester. maybe that says something about the courses i choose to subject myself to, but i can say without a doubt that mick does a great job at engaging students and getting them into the arduous task of deciphering these ancient moon runes faster than you'd think! it was great fun, and i'd wager that the average makeup of this class has a good mix of undergrads and grad students, which makes for really fun and interesting exchanges in and out of class as well! take this class literary chinese is an amazing (and frustrating) language with a great amount of depth and complexity. you'll have to put in the work, but you'll come out the other side having sampled some of the greats: the analects, the laozi, the shiji... and more..!"
