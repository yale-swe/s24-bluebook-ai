   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this class if you have a background in either conflict studies or public health and specific interests that will help you to hone in on the relevant material and create a more coherent set of takeaway points than the class itself will give you. Otherwise, it may not be useful.",
    "I have mixed feelings about this course. Yes, professor panter-brick is great and yes the course is interesting. But I feel that it is more frustrating than it is interesting. At times I question what I am learning, and at times I wish there was more progression in the course. It just seemed like random articles on resilience from here and there. The course is highly disorganized and having a set syllabus, readings on classes, and a clearer grading policy would give me a peace of mind. The professor and the content is great, but I would not take it unless it fulfills a certain requirement.",
    "Absolutely take this class. I looked forward to the reading and the class every week. The subject matter is incredibly interesting as were the class discussions. It was not imtimidating to speak at all and Professor Panter-Brick ensures that all reading assignments are fair and interesting. You only have to read what you are interested in our of the assigned readings which makes the class very doable work-wise. My advice would be 100% to take this class.",
    "You gain very little practical knowledge. Panter-Brick is nice and cares a lot, and she brings in some really cool people. If you're looking at anthro courses you're probably going to like this class. Could work as a 5th course, would not build a class schedule around it.",
    "Professor Panter-Brick is tough, but genuine and very kind - you will learn a lot. The guest speakers are great. The class is well-structured, covering interesting areas in depth. Be prepared to do the work, and make sure you understand what the class is about - read the syllabus, do some of the initial readings!",
    "A really interesting topic and some great readings, but sometimes class discussions seem to talk in circles and simply come to the frustrating conclusion that everything is extraordinarily complicated to solve.",
    "Yes, I would recommend the class. Professor Panter-Brick is a great instructor and seminar discussion leader. Each week, you choose 3-5 readings from the 10-12 suggested readings so you can focus on what interests you the most. The majority of the readings are great and I think most people just read everything. In the class, you focus on acquiring an intuitive grasp of the term resilience and how it can be applied to creating resilience-based interventions in conflict settings, usually to promote health. As a nonlinear learner, I enjoyed bouncing back and forth between the three topics and making connections between each week's readings and previous week's readings which some more linear learners may find frustrating. Although the links between conflict, resilience, and health were not necessarily explicit or explored every single week, synthesizing all three will be the challenge of the final paper.",
    "If mental health, global economy, conflict and the intersection of health interests you, definitely shop this class."
