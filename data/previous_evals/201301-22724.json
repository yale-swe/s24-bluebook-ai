   "comments": [
    "It's a good class. My Spanish grammar was definitely better after the fact. The class just has a lot of paperwork...busywork...so much that you kinda start to lose track of it all.",
    "I really enjoyed this course, in part because I just really enjoy Spanish grammar for some reason. The course provides a close to excellent review of a range of Spanish grammar topics. Many of the topics aren't new, but are useful to review either because it's something you have forgotten because you learned it a while ago or something that is pretty basic but that you feel like you never really got the hang of (i.e. preterite vs. imperfect, ser vs. estar). There is a lot of emphasis on the subjunctive, which I appreciated, but I felt like more time could have been spent on concepts like por vs. para that I didn't feel I really learned about in lower level Spanish classes. That being said, I'm so glad I took this course. Although you really don't get much speaking practice in this course, I feel like, in the long run, this course actually helped improve my speaking skills. Before I was often held back when speaking by the fear that my grammar was incorrect, but now I feel like I have a much better grasp of grammar and thus will feel more confident when speaking.",
    "I would recommend this class to someone who wants to someone who wants to take an L5 class before the more literature or history based L5 classes. There is homework for every class, generally grammar or comprehension exercises. Profesora Seymour is very enthusiastic and helpful.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to anyone who wants to improve their speaking and writing abilities. It's an amazing way to keep up your spanish, and the daily homework ensures that you never get behind.",
    "Spanish Grammar should be closely considered by any student wanting to reach a native-level fluency with the Spanish language. It rarely feels extremely helpful towards these ends at any specific point during the course, but in the entirety of its repetition and real-world application, the course really helps a student's confidence more than anything. Usually theproblem with speaking fluently is not lacking the knowledge of the correct mechanics, but lacking the confidence and preparation to overcome nerves in order to use what one already knows. This class goes to lengths to resolve this issue."
