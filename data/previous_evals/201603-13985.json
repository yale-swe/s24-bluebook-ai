    "Gender in North Africa has been one of the more eye-opening classes I've taken at Yale. I didn't just leave the class with a more comprehensive understanding of gender and how it intersects with ethnicity, religion, and politics in North Africa and the Middle East developed a framework for understanding and deconstructing colonialist or orientalist perspectives, for interpreting positionality, and for coming to complex conclusions about complicated issues.",
    "I gained an incredible amount of knowledge concerning the ways we can think about gender in the Middle East. It's a bit difficult to describe what I learned other than saying that the course completely transformed the way I look at the Middle East. The most critical insight I think i took away is that my positionally affects the way I evaluate and look at the world. It wasn't until I took this course that I realized how entrenched I was within Western thought (note: the course also critically examines the binary between West vs East, and demonstrates how their construction contributes to the perpetuation of Orientalism). We examined and discussed enough countries in North Africa through the course that I believe I would be comfortable delving into any one of those countries with a stronger sense of the gender dynamics at play.",
    "This course was an amazing introduction to the intersection of gender and area studies. I feel that I have a working knowledge of the issues that gender scholars are concerned with and how the field itself has evolved.",
    "I gained a strong foundation in gender studies. This course gave me a framework for understanding issues, by introducing key vocabulary needed to discuss issues (with critical consideration about words used), the ideas and theories of relevant scholars (Said on Orientalism, Foucault, Spivak, etc.), thought-provoking pieces to read each week, and rich discussions in class where the Professor offered her profound insights and students contributed equally. I gained a breadth and depth of knowledge about topics ranging from gender in Islamic legal thought, to gendered resistance to colonial powers in North Africa, to Raii music, to male infertility, to gendered hierarchies in Moroccan garment factories. I also learned so much about research methods namely ethnography as well as the important of positionality and centering stories around agency.",
    "I gained incredible insight on feminist theories and movements, the significance of positionalitty and qualitative studies, and an abundance of information on the nuances of studying the Middle East and feminism as overarching discursive fields.",
    "This class changed the way I look at the world. It made me aware of critical orientalist narratives and the western-centrism that permeates even human rights efforts. I am more critical of sources of information, and generally a more critical thinker."

   "comments": [
    "The course topics are quite fascinating and I very much enjoyed the structure of the course and the in-class discussions. Occasionally, the reading was a bit heavy.",
    "Content-wise, there is very little I would change about the course. I found the books we read to be fascinating and well-selected, and I really appreciated that we read Zakia's book it was excellent having its author right there in seminar to discuss it with us. The only problems I found with this course were organizational ones: the syllabus was updated so many times throughout the semester that eventually a fifth version had to be uploaded to Classes*v2, leading to frequent confusion about what the week's readings were, which was understandably not conducive to good classroom discussion. There also was some understanding in the class about what reading responses should entail, and it seemed like different people heard different things. I really appreciated the student presentations, but there often wasn't enough time in class for them and they had to be cut short.",
    "I think an obvious strength of the course is that Professor Salime let the student questions guide the trajectory of what we were to discuss that day. She always placed our insights, thoughts, or confusions at the center of the class, so I felt that we were actually building a conversation around what we wanted to learn more about. I think the course content is unique from many other courses I've taken at Yale. Salime was able to balance rigorously discussing the week's readings, and in a way we grew in our understanding of the region, without it necessarily feeling that way; conversation was organic. I honestly can't think of any weaknesses for the course. If it were to be offered again, I would suggest that Salime perhaps consider adding a requirement for students to have taken some form of an introductory sociology course. She herself is a sociologist, and there were times during the course when I felt she wanted to discuss a topic through a sociological lens, but held back because the vast majority of students weren't sociology majors. I actually think it would've been really wonderful for her to combine both the gender and sociological perspective within the course, as I think it would have enriched the conversation even more.",
    "I really enjoyed the model of the course -- weekly readings and discussions. I think that was one of the course strengths because we were able to do our own reflection on the texts and then learn as a group in the discussions.",
    "Fantastic course - very little suggestions for improvements",
    "This course introduced students to a wide array of idea, which was certainly a strength. I would have liked more guided discussion during class, but, as it were, class was a very informative and enjoyable space."

   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this course to a student interested in the Middle East, North Africa, or gender studies. It's not a survey course, but it provides an excellent, in-depth understanding of the regions and the issues to both those familiar with them and those not.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. Through this course, I have completely transformed the way that I look at the Middle East and North Africa. This course provided an incredibly strong foundation in recognizing Orientalism and being able to utilize a double critique with oneself. The course challenged institutions that I once thought of as \"patriarchal\" and demonstrated how crucial it was to place the perspective and lived experiences of women at the center of any evaluation. I think the course is an excellent introduction to further courses in Islam and North Africa. I would strongly urge any student interested in studying the Middle East and\/or North Africa to take a course such as this one, as it will provide a solid introduction to the region. If this course is ever offered again (or any other courses with Salime for the matter), I would urge students to take care in curtailing their projects and media watches to their interests. They're a good opportunity to build off of what we're learning in class in more depth.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to other students. The chance to study with professor Salime is on its own a great reason to take the class. I learned a lot about the politics of academia which is often missing from these type of classes. It's a great way to gain exposure to WGSS.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student! It is one of my favorite courses I've taken at Yale. We are so fortunate to have Professor Salime as a visiting scholar this year, as she has extensive knowledge and expertise in these areas. Professor Salime is a phenomenal instructor, who offers her insights, probes, creates a dynamic classroom environment, and supports all student exploration. Throughout the course, students explore a variety of topics through a gender lens which leads to interesting discussions every class about the application of broader themes (agency, orientalism, sexualization, intersectionality, implications of media). I've learned so much about gender studies, about prominent gender studies scholars, the history of many North African and Middle Eastern countries, and current events. The reading responses (which I really enjoyed writing), media watches, presentation, and final paper really allow you to think critically about issues you are interested in and approach them with the skills you've learned in the course. All semester, I raved about this course and Professor Salime to all my friends--if you have the opportunity to take a course with Professor Salime next semester I highly recommend it.",
    "Would recommend to any students with a remote interest in WGSS\/ PLSC. Anyone interested in acquiring a wider understanding on how to approach the Middle East and feminist movements should definitely take this course, or anything else offered by Professor Salime.",
    "I believe every student should be required to take at least on course of this nature. It is so essential to realize the various agendas at work and to truly acknowledge one's positionality--things that this class can more than aid in accomplishing."
