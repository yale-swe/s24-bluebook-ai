   "comments": [
    "I would really recommend ANTH 453 to anyone interested in health equity. This is a very broad category, which aptly reflects the diverse array of people who ended up in the course. I would especially recommend a course like this to ANYONE thinking of going into the medical profession in any capacity. I don't think enough pre-med students are encouraged to engage in this side of the story, and it will only become more practically and professionally necessary for doctors to be able to deal with the important issues touched upon in this course. It really makes political, ethical, and medical dilemmas appear more human and contributes to a person's understanding of how they might be most effectively addressed, on both a personal and global scale.",
    "Yes!",
    "I would definitely recommend this course because if you do the reading, you will learn immensely and the class gives you the opportunity to get to know Professor Panter-Brick.",
    "I truly enjoyed this course. We talked about health issues that were very relevant from obesity to mental illness. Unlike most other courses which tend to be theory based I enjoyed this course because it was policy\/ intervention based. We would end each class with research highlights which helped us synthesize the major themes of the discussion. These highlights were useful when I went to write both my midterm and final paper and also helped us think about how our message can said succinctly which is a useful skill in general. Professor Panter-Brick is fantastic. She is so knowledgeable about all of the topics and very engaging and personable. She is a very well known authority in the field of medical anthropology and it was a treat to read her research, which has been published in some well known journals, because I know that this work is currently making an impact on health policy globally. I liked the fact that the class was very discussion based and she let us talk freely, interjecting when necessary. I am so glad that I was able to take this seminar with her and know that this is one class I will remember long after I graduate.",
    "Absolutely would recommend it. It's a great introduction to a really important topic, and as a small seminar you get to inform and shape what the class ends up studying."
