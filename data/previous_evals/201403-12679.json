    "I would recommend it to another student. Not a lot of work, just the two papers. Definitely do it - just acknowledge that you're doing it very independently.",
    "Good seminar in bioethics. I recommend taking bioethics and public health law and\/or issues in bioethics with Professor Latham as well. The class itself is heavily centered on him discussing relevant issues, with periodic student input. He did a good job talking about current issues in the field as well (Ebola, Affordable Care Act, etc). I wrote my senior thesis in this class - he was difficult to reach at times and slow to meet with you to help you on your thesis, but this also allows for a lot of freedom to pursue your interests in your essay. Professor Latham is a good professor and knowledgeable in the field of Bioethics, I would recommend any class taught by him - this seminar will give you the closest interaction with him. That being said there were approximately 80 people who wanted in the seminar. I recommend pre-registering and not wasting your time attending if you aren't a senior. He gave priority to seniors. I can't imagine this course getting bad reviews this year, so I expect that the overpopulation of his classroom will be a problem in future semesters as well.",
    "Yes. Every week or every two weeks you discuss a different topic in bioethics and all of the topics covered are quite interesting. The work for this class is pretty manageable and it is a good opportunity to think about applied ethics questions.",
    "good class. i recommend it. not too hard and interesting.",
    "A great class that goes deeper into some of the issues that are also covered in Latham's other classes: Bioethics & Law, and Issues in Bioethics. If you liked any of those classes, you'll like this one as well. Some of the readings are really cool.",
    "I wasn't all that impressed with this course. Latham is really bright and knows so much about his field, but he's not that great at leading seminars. Basically, it's just a lecture with 20 people sitting in a room. He doesn't really facilitate discussion that well; even though we focused on some pretty controversial and interesting topics, I can't say I know where other people in the class stood on those issues. I wish he had opened up the floor more, and given more structure to the class."
