    "This class was phenomenal and thought provoking. Before taking SBNR, I had never thought critically about secularism or religious liberalism and its connections to our current political moment. I am so grateful to have had a chance to think through these issues in such an engaging academic environment.",
    "I learned a lot about how spirituality\/religion is always politicized and how power is dispersed in different situations.",
    "Learned about millennials and myself.",
    "This course teaches you to really define and understand what it means to be spiritual but not religious, such that you realize that the term is steeped in socio-political context of today. Not simple a world religions class, this class urges you to think abotu the ways religion is given an identity in accordance with the state and a historical context of how spiritual but not religious came to be a thing.",
    "Honestly I gained a ridiculous vocabulary in realms where I truly had none before -- religion, WGSS, cultural appropriation -- it was amazing. LOVE this class.",
    "I gained new perspectives on religion, politics, psychology, spirituality, tradition, and more. I gained new ways of thinking about contemporary life and privilege and new ways of being in a class! And interrogated my own spiritual life and journey!",
    "Overview of philosophy on such subjects as belief, ritual, religion, liberalism, authority, and tradition. Studied the history of religious liberalism in the US and its influences from Asian traditions. Also discussed the role of spirituality and personalized religion in the capitalist world. Explored the allure of the \"spiritual but not religious\" category and the reason that the spiritual demographic category known as \"nones\" (nonreligious and not-seeking) is so popular. Read several novels with spiritual and\/or religious themes in relation to key philosophical topics discussed in class.",
    "Really encouraged students to think critically about the practices and classifications they use on a daily basis. A lot of writing, a fair amount of which was introspective and reflective, so students got practice not only writing about themselves and crafting personal essays, but using the discussions and texts of the class to make the information more relevant in the context of the class.",
    "I learned how to evaluate scholarly work as well as novels that dealt with the topics of spirituality, religion, or a lack thereof, in a manner that was careful, thoughtful, and not depoliticizing.",
    "This course was more a good way to get to know Zareena than anything else. but I loved it.",
    "I learned methodologies for studying intellectual history and I learned how to contextualize contemporary American spirituality within a much longer and broader tradition.",
    "I learned quite a bit about the intellectual, social, political, and racial history of spirituality in the United States and the way that relates to other systems of religion in US and abroad. I learned how to look at a text and analyze it across many different subject areas. I developed my skills in cultural critique and understanding the individual as a user within the historical context. That is to say that we are a product of the systems that act on us\/privilege us\/disadvantage us but also we are participants and have agency within those systems.",
    "Learned so much about how to evaluate a demographic to how to view religion in a different way. The first class Zareena said I will not blow your mind or change your world that happens in the readings but I found this statement ironic because Zareena never fails to broaden my way of thinking and truly blow my mind.",
    "This class made me think about what it means to be a statistic, and the ways in which I am my own statistic. It made me think about the millennial generation as a whole, which is important seeing as I am a part of it, and made me think about how being a millennial influences my identity without me even realizing it. This class made me think critically about my own religious involvement, and helped me differentiate the terms spiritual and religious.",
    "This was easily the most meaningful class I have taken at Yale. The central themes and theses that the course was organized around -- understanding SBNR as a white privilege, thinking about how this time in our lives is consequential, contemplating ideas of awe, transcendence, and cosmic importance -- will stay with me long after I leave.",
    "I learned a lot about religion, spirituality, and how they interact with politics and consumerist society. It is a very interesting course and an one of a kind experience. I would highly recommend taking it but if you're not able to at least try to take a class with Zareena!",
    "This class taught me how to think. I learned how to critically consider arguments about spirituality, religion, and the space in between; I learned concepts and labels and buzzwords that can be applied to the discourse between spirituality and religion; I learned just how far the religious impulse permeates in hidden ways, throughout our contemporary world.",
    "I learned so so much. I learned about the importance of religion and how it has changed over the years. I learned that there are different stakes for different people regarding how they express their religious self. I learned how to write a narrative paper, I learned how to properly review a novel. I learned about my own religious self."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "This course was so carefully and creatively designed! I loved the incorporation of art, film, and novels into our work. I also loved how engaged Zareena was with our work. She went above and beyond to read all of our assignments in order to incorporate our thoughts into her lecture material. Zareena's course was truly outstanding.",
    "I think the only way to improve the course would be to make more clear which assignments will be due in the beginning of the semester because the end got a bit overwhelming.",
    "A strength would definitely be the course texts; all very engaging and interesting and relevant. A weakness would be the volume of the texts; the course was very demanding, and sometimes it was hard to appreciate and understand the concepts when there were just so many texts being thrown at us.",
    "Professor Grewal is an amazing lecturer who isn't afraid to challenge student's ideas and the reading list was great. But I do think there could have been less assignments. Maybe 2 less book reviews on top of the formal papers and exams.",
    "This class was phenomenal - it's one of those Yale courses that everyone should take at some point. Professor Grewal is an absolute gem and she makes an effort to get to know each one of her students on a personal level. Strengths of the course include writing a paper on your own religious journey - really rewarding to think about your life story, and getting to discuss religion in an academic setting. The one weakness of the course is that the lectures were not always structured which can be a downside depending on what you are looking for in the class. Either way, this class is a must take.",
    "Incredibly engaging and thought-provoking.",
    "This class is straight up amazing. Don't leave all the reading responses til reading period, though! Aside from that the format of the class is spectacular and shouldn't be changed. Zareena is incredible.",
    "Strengths, the lectures were often knockout fascinating learning sessions that I thought about and discussed with anyone throughout the day. This was an exceptionally stimulating class. Challenged my views on religion and various political ideas. Gave me new ways of thinking about time, against prevailing capitalist logics. Main weaknesses were the unrealistic reading load and section could be pretty lackluster compared to lecture.",
    "The strength of the class comes mainly from the interesting subject matter and Professor Grewal's animated approach to talking about the topics. I think the class would have been better if the professor were less ambitious with regard to what she wanted to talk about in class and had more time to talk organically about the subject matter. Sometimes I felt we were just rushing for the sake of rushing rather than really breaking down these often heady concepts.",
    "Everything is interesting, so most students actually feel compelled to do the readings. However, it might have been helpful to have the reading comprehension \"final exam\" at the end of the semester (or in addition to the midterm) to encourage students to keep reading throughout the entire course, and not taper off after the midterm.",
    "Atrengths: incredibly insightful and documented history Cons: closed mindedness with regards to privileges",
    "Do not expand the size of this course! As a small lecture it is the perfect size.",
    "Other than reorganizing some of the reading schedule (shortening the two weeks for Dept. of Speculation for example), not much else stands out.",
    "I think the largest strength of this class was that it felt like a seminar. It was just the perfect size for Prof Grewal to get to know us and for each of us to feel personally engaged in the material. This class was challenging, which many might see as a weakness but I felt that the challenge inspired me to work harder. This is the sort of class that cannot give you anything you don't put into it - but if you work really hard and do the readings thoroughly it will be incredibly rewarding.",
    "I loved the scope of the course. I think that Professor Grewal did an excellent job of folding in many different perspectives and troubling notions about spirituality and religion that many people held. I think the course succeeded on many fronts. I do think that the syllabus could be tightened a little bit because I think it was challenging to read and take in all the information a novel and several articles a week is a lot for a lecture.",
    "I thought the classes without the slides were better",
    "There is so much built into this course that it sometimes moved at too quick of a pace. We had a long time for some assignments\/readings but for the most part I felt we didn't have enough time to complete all the readings (mostly the novels).",
    "Such beautiful and important material communicated in an efficient and clear way. I felt as if I did not have enough time to really reflect on all that I was learning in the ways that I hoped to because of the sheer volume of material.",
    "The course requires a lot of reading but its definitely worth it, the lectures were always very interesting as well as section. Overall, I would say that it was a very very good course for anyone to take.",
    "At first I thought that Zareena's off-the-cuff, stream-of-consciousness style of teaching might be a bad thing. But I don't know that it is. Her teaching style is a symptom of a fast-moving brain. She knows a lot and cares about exposing her students to her ideas. That said, I think Zareena gets a little overenthusiastic about educating those in her classes--as much as I wish I could've kept up, the reading list was a bit over my head.",
    "It is a lot of reading but out of everything we read there was only one passage that I thought wasn't worth my time reading. You could tell the amount of time and thought Dr. Grewal put into assigning the readings.",
    "Zareena is the strength, she is incredible. The cultural texts were soooo enjoyable, and it was so nice to be carrying a novel around with me again. Yale doesn't naturally give us time to read novels, but this class did. This course acts against alot of \"Yale\" things, and I think it is radical and fresh and fun. The only weakness is that I wish this class could be taken over again."

   "comments": [
    "If you ever have a chance to take a course with Zareena, no matter the subject, please do!!! She is one of Yale's most outstanding professors. Her commitment to her students, thoughtful crafting of course materials\/assignments, and enthusiasm\/passion for what she teaches is unparalleled.",
    "Yes, absolutely! I think this class is a must-take. Every Yale student should take a religion course, especially one with Zareena. So cool",
    "I would definitely recommend the class. It's a different style of lecture where everyone for the most part was very engaged. The readings are very interesting, the novels were fun to read, and we got to go on field trips! Zareena is awesome, and everyone at Yale should take a class with her before graduating.",
    "1000x over I would recommend this course. Although demanding, this was the clas that I looked forward to going to each week. Zareena is an incredible, caring, brilliant professor. Each class feels valuable, and you walk out not just feeling like you learned something, you just feel better. The course helps you really reflect on yourself, and helps you decipher and stand strong in a very rapidly and often scarily changing world.",
    "Yes I would especially if you've never taken or have only taken a few American Studies courses, this was a good way to really engage with the material. Also the prof is just great.",
    "LOVED THIS CLASS - WOULD TOTALLY RECOMMEND!",
    "Zareena will blow your mind in every class, no question.",
    "AMAZING! Yes, do it. Zareena is incredible and puts SO MUCH WORK in. Disclaimer that lectures aren't the most organized so if you're looking for an organized, structured lecture with concise powerpoints, this isn't for you. If you're looking to have your mind blown and life paradigm shifted, it totally is.",
    "Amazing learning experience from a professor with astonishing energy, intellect, verve, humor and moral light. She weaves together diverse disciplines and topics to give us a new consciousness of arguments in religious studies and the anthropology of whiteness.",
    "Very heavy reading load, and a decent writing load. I wrote more in this class than I did in my WR credit this semester. The academic readings are often long and dense, and in addition to the academic readings, the class reads a novel every two weeks. If you are not willing to challenge yourself with a lot of reading, this is not the class for you. The discussions are very interesting and Professor Grewal is great, but in order to participate you must synthesize a lot of information.",
    "This is such a great course! It's a lot of reading and writing, but most of it is self-reflection or taking oral histories, and it will really change the way you think of your own spirituality, and the way you have been conditioned to conceptualize spirituality. I think a lot of us at Yale are looking for something we maybe haven't been able to find yet in our lives, and this class might be able to help you think about that more critically. Zareena is an extremely engaging professor and every class is something you look forward to.",
    "Yes",
    "Absolutely",
    "YASSSS",
    "Only take this class if you are willing to keep up with a rigorous reading load. It is difficult, but 100% worth taking if you are willing to put in the effort. If you are planning on credit\/d-ing it, take it seriously. Doing the readings is essential to getting anything out of this course, but if you read thoroughly and take the course seriously it will be an incredibly rewarding. This is probably one of the best classes I've taken at Yale.",
    "Yes, I think that anything Professor Grewal teaches is worth taking.",
    "Absolutely. Particularly if you yourself identify as spiritual but not religious, this class will help think through what that means in a political context.",
    "Take any course you can with Zareena but this class really helped understand millenials and the broader concepts of religion.",
    "Absolutely. The course material is interesting and applicable and if you engage with it on any level, it will touch your own life.",
    "Yes, this course is so important. I would recommend it to a student that was not taking a heavy workload though because it is a LOT of reading that you absolutely HAVE to do.",
    "Yes!!!",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class to other students! There is a fairly high workload with all the readings but they are very interesting on their own and can lead to your mind being blown when paired with the lectures. This topic isn't normally taught like this and would definitely recommend to anybody to has any interest in spirituality or religion.",
    "Take this class. Regardless of who you are or what your major is. Everyone's perspective matters. This class literally teaches you how to live. Be prepared for a lot of feedback and a healthy dose of intellectual criticism; but don't be too alarmed. Zareena seems to care more about teaching and leaving an impression on her students than she does about damaging GPAs. I want to say that her teaching style is revolutionary but that sounds awfully dramatic.",
    "One of the best courses I have taken at Yale.",
    "This was my favorite class at Yale. It is reflective and intellectual. The readings are both challenging and fun. Zareena is so very entertaining and lecture is mind blowing and engaging and honestly so surreal. The course is radical and raw, it draws from pop references and philosophy, and made me think about the world in a completely different way.",
    "I took this course because the topic is so important for understanding modern day culture and I was intrigued by the audacity of the syllabus. Unfortunately, the professor was not up to the challenge. Besides showing up 5 minutes late to almost every lecture, she didn't seem to know what she was doing (at times simply reading out loud long passages from the material and repeating \"you get it?\" and at others spiraling into personal anecdotes that were off topic). At the beginning of the semester lectures had unreadable slides which we never actually covered in any order and by the second half the professor stopped making them altogether. When it comes to teaching this was by far the worst professor I've come across at Yale. I would recommend simply teaching yourself the materials because the arguments are still super intriguing!"
