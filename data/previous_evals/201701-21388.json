   "comments": [
    "I learned a lot about Shakespeare's different comedies and romances, and through Professor Nicholson's lectures, felt able to more solidly contextualize these plays within the context of their time.",
    "I learned better how to analyze a text, especially in Shakespeare.",
    "This is a wide survey course that covers all of Shakespeare's comedies, so you definitely get a lot of knowledge about Shakespeare in general.",
    "I learned to engage with Shakespeare's works in both literary and cultural-historical contexts.",
    "As someone who hadn't had much exposure to Shakespeare before taking this course, this class was transformative for me in helping me better understand Shakespeare's important role in the history of English language\/literature, and especially his comedies - which were all very fun reads!!! Prof. Nicholson was incredible in helping us think through complex ideas\/issues like the genre of comedy itself, gender bending, queer desires, race, etc - all issues that helped us situate the works in our contemporary moment and think through why Shakespeare's works have been & will continue to be important across temporal limits.",
    "Close reading, essay-style analysis, etc.",
    "I learned a lot about writing a paper, not just one that follows grammar rules but also one that is meaningful and insightful. I also learned a lot about the differences and similarities in Shakespheare's plays and about the time period.",
    "close reading and literary analysis",
    "I learned quite a bit about Shakespeare and how his work fits into English literature as a whole. I also felt like I got a good sense of theater and how to read Shakespeare plays both as plays and as work to be performed.",
    "Developed my writing skills.",
    "Shakespeare Comedies and Romances takes you through a broad swath of plays. It's enjoyable and linked themes across all of the comedies and romances as the title suggests. Would recommend to a student interested in English.",
    "I definitely became more aware of the themes and other continuities between Shakespeare's comedies--particularly the problematizing of gender, marriage, political and judicial ideals.",
    "Essay writing and close reading of Shakespearean text.",
    "I took this course to fulfill my final pre-1800s requirement for the English major. I was admittedly unenthusiastic since I do not find myself drawn more to contemporary literature. That being said within a few weeks of the course, I found myself fully engaged with Professor Nicholson's lectures and the texts. I had read a few Shakespeare plays in high school, but not since and I found myself looking forward to reading the plays. This course allowed me to dig into a new play each week in a way I had not been able to in high school. I was especially interested in the gender bending themes that occur in many of the plays.",
    "Catherine Nicholson was a great lecturer and I enjoyed being in her class so much. Overall, I learned so many different things about Shakespeare, life, and plays and I am so happy I took this class."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Catherine Nicholson is truly phenomenal and was so interesting to listen to, however she really neglected to focus on close readings of the text, which is what our essays are about and how we are evaluated in our exams. She made minimal references to actual quotes, preferring to talk around the text as opposed to directly to the text. This was difficult because once a week section did not feel like enough time to cover the themes of the plays in close detail.",
    "I think that the biggest strength of the course is its wide scope and carefully constructed essay topics. I think it honestly does a good job given its goal.",
    "Strength: An interesting and wide-ranging survey of Shakespeare's plays Weakness: Seemingly disjointed lectures and readings; absurdly specific terms on exams.",
    "One of the best things about this course was the manageability of the reading materials. Although this course required a lot of reading (a book each week), the length of the works selected was perfect for the amount of time allotted. A weakness could maybe be that it was difficult to take in all of the themes from lectures, but the tests seems to be cognizant of this difficulty and we're very manageable.",
    "Great lecture -- but one hour isn't enough to have a solid section on Shakespeare.",
    "I thought it was a very strong course -- Professor Nicholson was a great lecturer. I would have preferred to have the TF lectures be 2 per lecture, rather than giving them each a whole block (Professor Nicholson's lectures were so strong that it was a shame to have a reduced number from her).",
    "You will read Shakespeare plays. That is wonderful. There is nothing more wonderful written in English. You will hear lectures by Nicholson, a magnificently talented and engaging lecturer with a very fast mind, close textual awareness, and capacious historical understanding. Downside: you may not have a TA who is very good at leading interesting sections or motivating you to write top notch papers.",
    "Great course!",
    "Professor Nicholson's lectures were incredible each an every time. She is a great speaker and knows how to present material in the most engaging way possible. That being said, I felt as though the lectures given by the teaching assistant's left something to be desired. I'm not sure I gained much from these classes. I understand that they are important for the TA's to gain experience lecturing but the material they presented on was not as compelling as I wished.",
    "However, because this is a lecture, the class has the potential to be either really good or bad, depending on who your TF is."

   "comments": [
    "If you are committed to a lot of reading and a fast pace and are able to independently analyze texts (the lectures won't do it for you), this is a great, more scholarly option for English majors.",
    "I would recommend starting off with it Credit\/D, as the grading depends a lot on the TA you happen to get, but it is a very interesting course.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student -- I took it as a credit\/D, which was great, and it's a good way to force yourself to read a lot of Shakespeare and start to understand it.",
    "Yes! Wonderful survey of Shakespeare's comedies--engaging and fascinating lectures.",
    "Definitely, a great introduction to Shakespeare and the professor is excellent!",
    "Wonderful and engaging lectures, and the non-Shakespeare texts were really interesting additions to the course. It helped me develop an understanding and appreciation of Shakespeare's plays both as literary works and as significant socio-cultural gems.",
    "If not just for Professor Nicholson, I would recommend this course because the material was incredibly interesting. I personally have loved being able to see where many pop culture references draw from, and seeing the roots of Shakespeare in modern day media.",
    "HIGHLY RECOMMEND this class to anyone who wants to learn more about Shakespeare's comedies! Prof. Nicholson is absolutely incredible and truly such a gem in the English department. She brings to light issues like queer desires, gender-bending\/cross-dressing (which is so important in the comedies), spatial politics, the genre of comedy itself, etc., that made the course so fascinating in a way one might not expect from a typical Shakespeare course. It was also a class that was accessible and interesting for English majors and non-majors alike. You read a play a week and write 3 papers in total, which is really not bad at all in comparison to other WR credit courses. Highly highly recommend!",
    "Yes, take it!",
    "Cathy Nicholson is the best lecturer I've ever had at Yale. She is entertaining, brilliant, and clearly incredibly knowledgeable. I'm not an English major or anything close, but I promised myself I wouldn't leave my liberal arts education without taking a Shakespeare class, and I could not be happier with Comedies & Romances.",
    "Yes!",
    "Yes -- it's a decent amount of work (three essays, a midterm and a final), but the essays are pretty spread out, and the exams are quite easy.",
    "Fantastic survey course, and Cathy Nicholson is amazing.",
    "Yes if you really want to improve your writing and no if you are looking for an easy writing credit.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course! There are great lectures and the plays are very enjoyable. I will say that the reading load is heavy, so keep that in mind when choosing.",
    "I would. Learned a lot. Very good introduction to Shakespeare.",
    "Shakespeare Comedies and Romances takes you through a broad swath of plays. It's enjoyable and linked themes across all of the comedies and romances as the title suggests. Would recommend to a student interested in English.",
    "Take it! But spend time attending to (reading about, discussing with your tf) the unique interpretative problems of writing about drama as opposed to lyric poetry (signed, an english major).",
    "Yes! Professor Nicholson is brilliant!",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. Shakespeare's texts are all timeless classics. I myself would be unlikely to pick up a Shakespeare play to read for pleasure, but this course gave me an excuse to be exposed to some truly fantastic texts."
