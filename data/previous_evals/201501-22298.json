   "comments": [
    "Take it if you have any interest in Brazil. Professor Schwartz is a world expert and I felt like I still had a good depth of understanding even though it is a survey course. Reading is very manageable and test\/paper were fair.",
    "Great history course! His slides don't have text only pictures, which means you're going to actually go to class. Stuart keeps it interesting and fun. Definitely recommend it for a history or non-history major.",
    "Yes! Take this magnificent course!",
    "Yes!!",
    "Its a great class. Not too much work you probably dont have to buy all the books. You have fun and learn a ton. Some of the readings are really boring listening to lecture first helps.",
    "Yes take this course, the workload is manageable and it's a real treat to listen to the professor. Will give you an excellent sense of a less frequently studied region in our very Euro centric approach to things in high school and at Yale generally",
    "Highly recommended if you're at all interested in Brazil. It's a great class with a professor whose passion for the material is contagious. The tests can be rough, but the workload is otherwise not terrible. Take the Portuguese section if you want some language practice.",
    "This was a good history lecture. Professor Schwartz focuses primarily on the colonial and imperial periods (1580-1800), whereas modern Brazil received only 3-4 lectures. No background knowledge is assumed, so it's a solid way to fulfill the geographic requirement.",
    "The history of a fascinating country taught by an expert professor. I would absolutely recommend it!"
