    "Yes! It was a great class and I love RNA.",
    "Absolutely. Each week you read two primary papers regarding functions of RNA. The professors have first hand experience in the field and lead great discussions. The work load is relatively light but you still learn a lot from it. Grading is 100% participation, so everyone comes prepared, has an excellent discussion, and then you don't need to worry about working for the class for another 5 days.",

    "This course provided me with in depth knowledge about a field of biology that I do not work or specialize in. I definitely feel like I came out of it as a better scientist even if the specific information doesn't really apply to my work.",
    "It might just be enrichment, but it's a fundamental piece of biology so I think it's good to know regardless."
