   "comments": [
    "I became a better American, able to trace inequality to its roots and understand how we got here today. I have a much better understanding of the deep-seated structural inequalities that America is a long way from fixing.",
    "I learned about how inequality was created systemically.",
    "Through this course, I gained a lens through which to view America and American inequality in a new light. I learned that the status of the worst off in America isn't by accident, but rather, through conscious discriminatory policies. I am now better equipped to try and right some of these historical wrongs.",
    "I learned different political science based approaches to understanding inequality in the US.",
    "I learned a lot about how inequality arose in the United States and that institutional forces do work. I think this instilled a sense of ambivalence in me about inequality because since it is ultimately rooted in systems, my individual actions can do little to alter them. I learned how to read dense, interesting material fast.",
    "Great class that spoke to American history in a way I have never learned it before",
    "I learned to read and generally to take in material more quickly, to better synthesize my thoughts in a persuasive, coherent argument, and to join what I had learned in the reading with my everyday and lecture experiences.",
    "I felt much more at ease making use of and interpreting statistics and other hard data after this -- as an English\/WGSS major this was very new to me and I appreciated it greatly. I also felt like I developed a strong sense of historical trendlines and an ability to trace issues across time periods.",
    "This course focuses heavily on the way someone's position in American society is affected by race and gender. The readings in the course, coupled with the lecture, force you to question every law ever written, your own actions and think more about your communities at home and in New Haven. The material is very upsetting but incredibly important. I think (and hope) this course will change the way many people in the lecture continue their lives.",
    "I learned about \"stealth benefits\" that accrue to those with higher incomes. I learned that wealthy people are even bigger beneficiaries of government money than poor people.",
    "great class, amazing class, must take, stay woke class",
    "I learned about racial cartels and the policies in place to oppressive the poor and people of color. I learned about the why inequalities persist in the US and how the welfare system in the US differs from European countries.",
    "An absolutely phenomenal course that completely flipped everything I thought I knew about the welfare state, inequality, and government policy.",
    "I learned so much about the structural causes of inequality. Many of the terms I learned in this class I had heard about in other setting but was never given the vocabulary to discuss them formally. I think this class is essential for any Yale student. It is our responsibility to have some base knowledge of how policy shapes inequality.",
    "I gained an understanding of the literature on the study of inequality in the US. This enabled me to parse, synthesize and construct theories about inequality and recommend policy solutions to address them.",
    "I learned a lot about policy that can be used to address deep-rooted inequalities in the United States.",
    "History of serious and conscious efforts on policy side and the legacy they have today.",
    "I learned about many of the policies that make healthcare, education, or employment inaccessible to many subsets of the population.",
    "I learned SO MUCH in this course. Before taking this course, I had been familiar with topics related to poverty and inequality, but after taking this course, I know so much more about the theoretical and historical background behind U.S. social policy, why our welfare state is exceptionally small compared to other countries, and why inequality hasn't lessened, especially for poor blacks who have been systemically locked into poverty and the ghetto. The course was broken into 5 sections: inequality and redistribution on the whole, racial and gender inequality, political development of the welfare state, consequences of inequality, and the future of inequality. Some examples of topics include: spatial inequality, American exceptionalism, racial cartels, the carceral state, the motherhood penalty, contesting injustice, and more. I have a much deeper understanding of the history of US inequality and why things are in their present (TERRIBLE) state.",
    "I learned a lot about systemic inequality.",
    "Very timely course. Gave me a better understanding of the roots of inequality that pervade modern America. I feel more informed regarding discussions of race and poverty politics. Much insight into the American minority experience.",
    "I learned that the topics of urban poverty and welfare are taught primarily for privileged, affluent, white students.",
    "This class gave me the necessary empirical support I need to discuss about the deep racial and gender inequality that exists in the US. I already knew racial minorities and women were extremely disadvantaged under the current social, political and economic system in America, but this class taught me about the concrete data that backs this up.",
    "I learned a lot about inequality that I didn't previously know.",
    "It is not that the professor necessarily taught me anything I did not know. She helped me understand why the things I see in my community are the way they are.",
    "An understanding of the different forms and root causes of inequality in the U.S., with a particular emphasis on the impact of racially-biased institutions in creating pervasive, multi-generational poverty.",
    "I learned a great deal about the drivers of political, social, and economic inequality that plague America today. I learned about the development of these issues, the beliefs and behaviors that perpetuated this problem, and the lasting impacts of unfair social practice and policy.",
    "I definitely broadened my perspective and gained a new viewpoint concerning (primarily racial) inequality in the US.",
    "I learned so much about social inequality and historical policies that shape today's inequality. Excellent class.",
    "How to critically analyze inequality with a multidisciplinary lens",
    "This course gives you a very empirically grounded perspective on inequality and racial\/gender disparities in America. It teaches you new theories about inequality. It also gives you a lot of political science vocab and theories through interesting books!",
    "Professor Weaver introduced me to a topic that I'd never before learned about and did it in an interdisciplinary manner that showed the interconnectedness of history, sociology, and political science.",
    "This course gave me a comprehensive overview of inequality politics and systems in the US. It introduced me to the most consequential works of the past half century and gave me the statistics to back up my political opinions.",
    "I learned a ton about the structural factors that lead to inequality, and left with a far richer vocabulary and a far deeper sense of the ways in which policy affects the social realities of people within the US",
    "I had a great exposure to many of current issues that, due to my more removed, privileged background, I hadn't had in my life.",
    "Survey of Social Policy as it relates to inequality. the history of certain policies, why inequality persists, different explanations for inequality. Focus on race, gender, poverty.",
    "I learned so much about inequality in America. I think I understand so much more about US history involving racial and class subjugation, and also so much more about political processes in the United States. This class touched on many subjects I was familiar from current events and history as well as subjects I had learned about in other classes, but delved into them much more.",
    "The course provided a fascinating insight into the often unseen, structural inequalities underlying disadvantage and discrimination in the US.",
    "I came into this course thinking that I would be overwhelmed by the workload, but I ended up really enjoying this course. This course was my first introduction to the field of political science and it really got me interested in the subject, since I am very interested in critical race studies.",
    "This was my first political science course at Yale. I knew general knowledge (the \"what\") when it came to inequality but not the \"how\". This course explained how inequalities came to be with emphasis on the political infrastructure and history in the US.",
    "I gained a broad introduction to current academic thought regarding the nature of political, social, and political inequality in the U.S."

   "comments": [
    "This is the best class i've ever taken at Yale. Vesla Weaver is brilliant. Her lectures were amazing, the readings were really interesting. There were a LOT of readings and I wasn't doing all of them by the end of the course. A book per lecture is a lot to ask.",
    "The strengths of this course was Professor Weaver's intellect and the structure of the course. Professor Weaver was very knowledgable on every single subject we discussed and created a class through which we could try to build up our abilities. I believe the only weakness was that it was a lot of work at times. For an undergraduate course, we read a lot of dense material. However, I will say that the dense material prepared me for more advanced coursework.",
    "I would have liked to have heard more of Vesla Weaver's ideas and arguments, instead of summaries of other scholars' arguments. I also think there could have been more of a clear arc across the lectures.",
    "The class was taught wonderfully. The TFs were super intelligent on the topic. I loved that there was a lot of reading because it pushed me to be a better student (as a freshman who had never taken a class with so much reading). Three Worlds of Relief was my least favorite reading, but I do think engaging with Latinx inequality is essential.",
    "Strengths are the masterfully done lectures but the readings are too much",
    "The course is strong in its selection of readings and in the quality of its lecturer. Professor Weaver is very charismatic, and she chose readings that were wide in scope but generally well-written and interesting, as well as yielding different insights and lacking in the usually dreaded redundancy. The weakness of the course seemed to lie in the difference between the expectations of Professor Weaver and her syllabus. I did all of the readings, and came to class only to find Professor Weaver lecturing to a body of students that, it would seem, she assumed had not done the reading. Her lectures included full paragraphs excised from books we had read, and largely summarized instead of moving beyond the text. While synthesizing ideas from different texts and summarizing them would have been nice if I had not read the readings, I was altogether highly disappointed that she did not move beyond the readings to a deeper analysis or an extrapolation of issues to modern day. I felt a bit gipped, by actually doing the readings I didn't get much out of class, and by going to class I didn't much need to do the readings. I feel like she should expect more from her class, and if that results in a smaller class size at least it will result in a better class. She could, of course, lessen the number of readings, if her assumption is that it is too much for most students to keep up with.",
    "Strengths: Professor Weaver. She is a spectacular lecturer and lecture was always clear an informative. Also the readings were lovely. Weaknesses: I think more consistency with the course's approach to gender might be nice?",
    "It's an incredible course and I think within the constraints of some semester lecture can't be improved much",
    "This course is incredibly interesting and well taught. It makes you question almost every political decision made in the U.S. and how it relates to race. The readings (especially the books) assigned were engaging. Some weeks, there was a lot of reading though.",
    "Reduce the reading load by a bit to make it more accessible. Maybe assign specific chapters in the books that are assigned.",
    "It's certainly a strong foundational course. However, it is tragically too oriented on the past and doesn't push students to consider solutions. I'm very, very thankful for the way Professor Weaver centred race, gender and class but there was not enough to time to consider actual solutions beyond the obvious e.g. de-segregate neighbourhoods.",
    "This was was absolutely amazing! By far my favorite class at Yale. I love Weaver's lecturing style and the assignments were engaging. I enjoyed writing my papers! One weakness is that the powerpoint isn't very helpful. I wish she had a hand out with the outline of the lecture so that it's easier to follow.",
    "The syllabus is wonderful and the themes of the course are very important. I did think that the reading workload was very high and it was hard to do all of the assigned reading.",
    "Lot of information that I really wanted\/needed to learn, in an academic setting as opposed to an article confirming my own biases. The papers were an excellent chance to explore topics I wanted to investigate further, and the book selection was top notch. Could have been benefitted from a slight restructuring so it flowed more from one topic to another smoother. Also, LGTBQ people, particular those of color, seemed almost entirely absent, despite being one of the most marginalized groups with the worst outcomes from being on the receiving end of inequality. I wrote an op ed about LGBTQ youth to this end, and I think it merits more, meaningful encorporation into the course.",
    "Strengths: Excellent explanations, helpful TAs, and good survey of literature Weaknesses: None come to mind",
    "Execellent material but a lot of it -- reading load could feel excessively heavy. Lectures were brilliant.",
    "This course was absolutely fantastic but one suggestion would be to incorporate more readings that pertain to inequality based on ability and that includes nonbinary and trans people.",
    "The material is really interesting and important but Professor Weaver is not the best at laying out an argument in a lecture format, I felt confused fairly regularly if I had not done all of the reading, and if I did I felt like she was not explaining it well.",
    "Extremely important and relevant. Things that we should all be conscious of.",
    "The lecturer and the readings were the two strongest parts of this class. Both were interesting and engaging. However, there were many readings, and it was often times difficult to complete all of them.",
    "IT IS WONDERFUL. VESLA WEAVER IS AN AMAZING LECTURER.",
    "Sometimes I felt like the course could use a little more balance (ie, this is just one example, but we talked a lot about how the EITC was bad because it divided populations, but we didn't talk about how it's also successful because it has more widespread political support). Obviously our system is deeply flawed and biased, but it sometimes seemed like our focus, week after week, was simply finding problems in very single program\/policy. This is important to do, absolutely, because none of them are perfect and some are quite bad, but it seemed like there could be opportunities to a) discuss what the intention was and why it didn't work (because surely not EVERY program is ill-intentioned from the start) or b) offer incremental solutions that may not fix the problem but could certainly help. Instead, our \"solutions\" week at the very end just focused on massive (and seemingly unrealistic, given the current political climate) systems overhauls.",
    "Never received much feedback on papers. Slides didn't really help much for taking notes. After the midterm, the incentive to do the readings was lost. Maybe course would be better with a final exam, or at least no midterm, but only papers.",
    "This course's material and the way it is taught by Professor Weaver and the TFs is, in and of itself, offensive. It is taught in such a way that makes it seem as though all black people in America suffer in abject poverty with no prospects of education, success, or growth. As someone who was raised in a poor black neighborhood in America's second most segregated city, I found myself constantly being hurt as the professor and other students relegated myself, my family, and the people I grew up with to stereotypes and statistics for the sake of seeming altruistic and motivated. It was offensive. Many of my friends in the class felt similarly, especially those who are also black. I have many questions about this course, but one that I found myself asking constantly is why this course is cross-listed with African American studies. For many of the white students in the course, this is likely one of the few, if not the only, AfAm class they will take. It is an absolute shame that the lessons on life in Black America that they were taught in this course had narratives of poverty, segregation, and crime. Is this really what AfAm courses are? If the structure and content of this course is not changed, I hope at the very least it ceases to be listed as a course in the African American studies major. I grew up surrounded by a poor, segregated, black neighborhood. Despite the lessons of this course, many people chose to live in our neighborhood, had access to great education, were hopeful for the futures of their children, and worked to maintain a standard of living. It was emotionally exhausting to go to lecture and section and hear my professor, classmates, and TF talk about Black America like so world far, far away from all of them. It was even more hurtful not to be listened to because my white classmates who believed their internships entitled them to speaking with authority occupied nearly all the space for discussion. The first two weeks of the course where the focus was on analyzing policies and not peoples' lifestyles was wildly exciting and engaging, though this did not hold true for the entire semester.As a low-income, black student, this course frustrated me, saddened me, and drained me on a weekly basis. Please consider changing the language used to discuss the course content so that this is not true for future students.",
    "It's an amazing class, and Dr. Weaver is a great lecturer. I have no suggestions for improvement aside for wishing that it was a seminar, so we had more time to discuss the material in a small group.",
    "I really enjoyed the depth of this class in relation to black inequality but I felt like female inequality and Latino inequality was very underdeveloped.",
    "There were definitely a lot of readings, but the class is so amazing. It really sucks that she's leaving.",
    "I loved this course! Professor Weaver gave really engaging lectures, and the class made you consider causes of inequality that are never really discussed in the dialogue about inequality. It changed my perspective about how inequality arises and persists, and I left with a much deeper understanding of income-related issues and their historical roots. Overall, this class changed how I view the world and the system. The only weakness I can think of is that it almost felt as though lecture could have been longer (especially by the end it felt like we were trying to talk about way more than what can be covered in 50 minutes). It also felt as though the course neglected a few sources of inequality (namely, gender-based inequality)--one or two more lectures could definitely have been dedicated to that subject, and gender and race could have been linked a little more explicitly.",
    "The course provides a great deal of information about a particularly interesting topic, and the subjects were always extremely interesting and made lots of sense. The reading load is very high for a lecture course, but this is understandable as it was intended to be a seminar. Lectures were very informative, but could have benefited from having more concrete information included on slides.",
    "TA's didn't seem to care much. The lectures were a little stiff but overall good material, delivered straightforwardly.",
    "Everything was great from lecture to section.",
    "Strengths: engaging, thought-provoking lectures and readings Weaknesses: sacrifices depth for breadth, but understandably so",
    "The course is extremely engaging, especially with Prof. Weaver, who is an amazing lecturer and person! It's always both factual and theoretical, and provides a pretty comprehensive overview of theories in the field. It also routinely incorporates the readings into the lectures and exams, which is really nice. It can be hard to follow at times because there's a lot of information at once, but you'll get the hang of it eventually!",
    "The course content was great, as were the assignments! I was slightly confused, though, about the class's trajectory at the start. US Social Policy implies that well cover the social policy gambit, but we really only discussed economic and racial inequality. I wish that we had learned about a wider range of issues, as I felt that women in the workplace was the only expansion beyond those two themes.",
    "The course's content was phenomenal. I learned so much. I wish lectures were longer, because there was always more to discuss, and Prof W often didn't have enough time to wrap up the ideas in the short 50 min slot. I also wish the quiz had been latermany people checked out once there was less incentive to internalize the information.",
    "Please consider posting lecture slides online! Additionally, though all the readings were\/seemed quite interesting, a more balanced, reduced courseload might be beneficial for really comprehending the subject material.",
    "This course is very well organized and covers material exceptionally well in an engaging manner. The readings we had to do were all wonderful, but it was impossible to keep up with them do to limited time. I wish we had fewer mandatory readings and possibly additional suggested readings recommended for the papers etc. (Like reading only certain chapters of some books instead of their entirety.) I think the structure of the class in terms of exams and papers was really well done, I felt that what I wrote was very interesting and meaningful and not too much.",
    "The content was fascinating, and Professor Weaver delivered it wonderfully. The syllabus could have been more logically organized, as lectures jumped back and forth between discussions and got a little repetitive towards the end. Understanding the history of inequality was great and central to the class's message, but a little time at the end of each lecture\/in a couple of specific lectures to focus on current inequalities would have made it better.",
    "I felt like this course was a good political science course but not a good African American studies course. There was more focus on the political and the political process (which was good) but not enough focus on race or intersectionality. One classmate spoke to me about how this course was basically saying \"black people are poor\" but didn't expand beyond this.",
    "Strengths: All the material we covered felt very important, and it was interesting to be able to put the various academic perspectives in conversation with each other in section. I also appreciated the reading responses we were assigned in section - it provided a good opportunity to go more in depth into a set of readings. Weaknesses: We covered a lot of material in the course, which isn't necessarily a bad thing, but I found it challenging at times throughout the semester to keep up with the readings and devote them the time and energy they deserved. And with this class, I felt like the readings were particularly important for understanding the material. So maybe it would be helpful to assign priorities to readings? I.e. identify certain readings as top priorities (must read), others as #2 priorities (should read), and others as #3 priorities (will be beneficial to read if you have time)."

    "This is the best course I've taken at Yale and I frankly think it's imperative that everyone take it. You will learn so much and be a better person for it.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. It is important to learn the ways through which inequality has been exacerbated in order to fix the many issues that Yale students hope to address.",
    "Some of the content was really interesting and some of it felt repetitive or apparent. It's worth taking to get to know Vesla Weaver, who's brilliant and loves her students.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to someone who loves the material. If they love the material, they will learn so much through assessment forms that are really conducive to learning and readings that are novel. If you don't like the material and aren't going to do the readings or show up, don't take this class.",
    "Yes!",
    "If their goal was, like mine, to become more educated in the topic at hand, then I would recommend they take the course purely as incentive to read the readings off the syllabi. I'm not sure that I would recommend that they both read and go to class, because of the aforementioned redundancy.",
    "Professor Weaver is a big part what makes this class excellent and it's really a bummer that she'll be leaving. Otherwise: this is a great political science class for students beginning to skim the surface of issues of inequality. Weaver provides clear and compelling evidence for every assertion and really explains this fantastically without simplifying. It's a lecture, so it's what you make of it, but if you can get there, I'd say this is a great course for someone who either has less experience with progressive politics OR a WGSS\/ER&M -type who doesn't get to take many classes with Clear, Concrete Facts. I'm the latter and it was really wonderful to learn concrete information about historical trendlines as opposed to staying in the theory realm.",
    "Yes!!",
    "I would strongly recommend this course to any student at Yale, no matter their major or interests. The material taught is extremely well presented and very important.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS! Professor Weaver's lectures are amazing, and the material is fascinating and answered so many of my questions about our society. And the writing assignments are incredibly engaging.",
    "YES TAKE IT. Ive taken many classes that touch on inequality, but this was the best one, especially if you try to really engage with the readings on a two-tier welfare system.",
    "Yes Professor Weaver is amazing and I had a great Tf as well. I got a lot of feedback on my writing an my TF was always available to help",
    "Yes.",
    "Yes",
    "YES ABSOLUTELY! Vesla Weaver is an excellent professor and you could tell she genuinely cares about what she teachers. I learned to see policies in a different light after this class. The course covers a whole range of inequalities from racial to gender to economical, but also allows you to explore the topic you find most interesting with very open ended writing assignments. By far the best course I have taken so far.",
    "An absolutely phenomenal course that completely flipped everything I thought I knew about the welfare state, inequality, and government policy. Professor Weaver is brilliant and I'm so glad I had the chance to take a course with her before I graduated.",
    "Absolutely! Weaver is an excellent teacher-- insanely smart, very welcoming, and plans challenging and engaging lectures. The subject material is so important and every Yale student should take a class like this\/that covers this syllabus material.",
    "Take it!",
    "Great class, you'll learn a lot of things you NEED TO KNOW about how our society functions and how we got to our current state of affairs. Weaver is a badass. There are decent amount of assignments (midterm, 3 papers) but they're straightforward and easy to do well on.",
    "100%",
    "Yes. If you want to understand why the US has such high levels of inequality and why peoples and races seem to be locked into cycles of poverty, this is the class.",
    "Totally take it. No class quite like it and the content is essential for anyone who cares about issues of social injustice and inequality. Brace for a heavy reading load.",
    "Absolutely loved this course as it is a great introductory course for those who are interested in studying the conjunction between policy and racial and gender inequality.",
    "I think it may be hit-or-miss based on your TA (I got a miss), but the material is thought-provoking and important. I think I would recommend taking it Credit\/D",
    "Yes. Everyone should take this class. Everyone should take a class with Weaver.",
    "I took this Credit\/D but still found the lectures incredibly informative and was excited to absorb all of Prof. Weaver's knowledge. I really wonderful introduction to why inequality exists in the US.",
    "Yes, I would re3commend this course to another student. I think it is a very important class for students to take as it spoke about many subjects that people never learn about in school.",
    "10\/10 would recommend if you care about social policy and inequality. Very well organized and covers a variety of topics. The course isn't difficult. There was quite a bit of reading so you can't expect to complete all of it thoroughly for each class (I did hear that Weaver would be lessening the reading load though). Just go to every lecture and make sure you understand the main ideas behind each reading. You'll get a lot out of the class by doing most of the readings. Prof Weaver is a great lecturer, and quite inspiring. Each lecture felt like I was attending a talk at a prestigious conference because Weaver is just so amazing; she explains the topics very clearly, whips out interesting graphs, data, and photos, and offers anecdotes from her own research and life.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. I took this as a senior and definitely learned a lot of new things that have been able to shape my perspectives on a lot of very pertinent topics. There are a lot of readings but they're really worthwhile (although you can get away with not doing them). If you want to broaden your horizons under an incredible professor, you should absolutely take this class.",
    "ABSOLUTELY TAKE THIS COURSE. The lectures were riveting, the readings were super interesting, and Professor Weaver is a goddess. This is one of those classes at Yale that holds your interest throughout the semester and that you are really glad you took. I learned so much and cannot wait to take more classes like this one. This class should be a requirement for every student at Yale.",
    "The class made a rough transition from seminar to lecture. It covers an overwhelming amount of (interesting) material and requires a large variety of assessments. It requires the level of dedication of a seminar for one to do well. It is not a class one can take casually or is hard to manage a Cr\/D in. However, Prof. Weaver is an incredible lecturer and it was amazing to watch her take down preconceived notions of our country's social policy and welfare system. The class enabled me to talk about my policy opinions intelligently and thoughtfully. I now have solid facts, studies, and more to back up or shape my understanding of the world.",
    "Very timely course. Cool lectures from Prof. Weaver. Readings are GREAT, and give much insight into the American minority experience. Came away with much better understanding of inequality and its sources.",
    "No.",
    "YESSS TAKE IT!!!! I would absolutely recommend this to any student wanting to learn about inequality in America!",
    "This is a class every student should take. As future leaders of the world, these are problems we should familiarize ourselves with.",
    "Yes, but she's leaving. This class certainly opens your eyes to a lot of the reasons behind so many injustices not only exist but persist.",
    "Yes!!! Definitely take this class; lecture is engaging, most of the readings are interesting, and other than writing and reading the course load isn't too heavy. This class will change the way you view the U.S. and the way you think about poverty, and it will enable you to have intelligent discussions about inequality, its causes, and any possible solutions (which, especially now, is very relevant). Overall, 10\/10 would recommend.",
    "This is an interesting and important course for anyone studying American Politics. It provides a great deal of background about unequal practice in the American system, and it applies theories about inequality to events throughout history. The subject matter covered is interesting and enlightening, and provides lots of information about a growing field.",
    "I took it CR\/D\/Fail and I would recommend that other people who are interested in gaining a new perspective without doing a lot of reading do the same. I can't speak to whether this is a good\/great class for someone taking it for a letter grade.",
    "Definitely. A must take for all Yale students to learn about policy and inequality.",
    "A tour at breakneck speed through various dimensions of inequality. Highly engaging and thought-provoking. Appreciated studying inequality from the perspectives of history, sociology, and economics, rather than political science alone. Sacrificed depth for breadth, but still covered a ton of ground. Prof Weaver is one-of-a-kind.",
    "Yes!!! This is a must-take corse because it's so interesting and will give you so many new insights into inequality!",
    "Professor Weaver is a great instructor and was always incredibly prepared for class. However, be aware that the class does NOT cover US Social Policy - it just covers economic and racial inequality. Still, the information within these themes was great.",
    "Absolutely, though as a more advanced course following an introductory one.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to anyone who wants to be knowledgeable about the sources of inequality in this country and related past and present policies.",
    "Definitely. I wish that everyone at Yale had to take this course, this knowledge is so important to being a US citizen and voter.",
    "Yes, it will open your eyes into the historical, structural reasons for current inequalities, and the horrifying extent of these inequalities.",
    "Yes! Very interesting and engaging, a lot of reading but definitely worth it.",
    "I would. However, I would let the student know that this course is more political science focused than AfAm. Also, the reading load can be overwhelming at times.",
    "Yes! I would definitely recommend this course. The material is all very relevant and important. That being said, we covered a lot of material and there is a considerable amount of reading. It's a lecture so you can get away with skimming\/skipping some of it, but the more of the reading that you do, the more you will take away from the course. In this class, the books\/articles assigned were a particularly important part of learning the material."
