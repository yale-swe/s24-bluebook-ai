    "Take it! Very interesting!",
    "Astr 110 is a basic intro astronomy course, covering the geometry of the night sky, our solar system, and star formation. It requires frequent use of basic algebra. Professor Edwards is amazing--she is incredibly engaged, approachable energetic, and makes sure that every class is interactive. She made sure that we observed the stars, used telescopes to look at the sun, did pair work, etc.--so it was always worth attending lecture! I felt cared for in the class. She elevated what would have been a basic intro science class was elevated to a truly enjoyable learning experience. If you're looking for an easier science class, but still genuinely want to learn, this class is perfect!",
    "If you have no prior exposure to Astronomy, this class may be really interesting for you. As far as the math is concerned, a basic understanding of high-school level physics and Algebra 2 is plenty to do very well. The homework shouldn't take you more than two hours per week, and there is no true final exam (there is an in-class exam on the last day). Professor Edwards is awesome and definitely accessible to students whenever you need help.",
    "This is a great, fun, class. Not too math-y for an English major to take for a QR credit, but not too dumbed-down for a science kid to take for fun to learn about the stars either. PERFECT. Everyone should take it.",
    "Astro 110 is basically a course for beginners in astronomy. I would definitely recommend this class to other students. It covers interesting topics in a manner that is not too terribly difficult. There is math in it but nothing higher than basic algebra, so don't worry about higher level math being a major issue in the class. I wouldn't say the class is easy, seeing that I plan on majoring in Astronomy,but it isn't too terribly difficult as long as you go to class and put the work in.",
    "This course is an introduction to astronomical concepts focusing on the solar system and stars, as well as teaching the scientific tools necessary to study these things.",
    "A basic introduction to astronomy. Good if you want to explore it but too basic if you are looking to major in it.",
    "ASTR 110 provides a sound and manageable foundation of Astronomy for students without prior knowledge of it. The course follows the syllabus outlined in the textbook closely, and with the textbook, concepts and information are easily accessed and understood. There is much help rendered by the professor and by TAs during sections, and sufficient preparation before the midterms. It is an interesting look at mathematical tools used in Astronomy, features of planets, and the processes stars undergo. I found the last section of the course (on stars) most interesting. The first provided a useful foundation for the rest of the course, while the second was a little dry in its overload of information about planets.",
    "The concepts are very interesting, and the workload is completely manageable. But study for the midterms and the final!",
    "A good intro astronomy class that's not too demanding.",
    "Relatively easy, but a ton of busy work and particularly harsh grading.",
    "It's a fairly easy course in astronomy. Do the work, do the reading and you should be fine. There's some fascinating material covered, and Professor Edwards is a very dynamic teacher, which helps at 9am. Good for a QR and a SC, so it's a great way to get either of these (looking at you HU majors). I learned a lot about our solar system and the life cycles of stars.",
    "ASTR 110 is a solid course for a student looking for a SC credit. We learned about the universe starting from basic tools of the trade, moving into the planets and other astronomical objects in our solar system, from there going onto the sun and the life cycle of other stars, and concluding with black holes. I thoroughly enjoyed the material and was able to gain a greater appreciation for the universe. Professor Edwards is a lively, fun teacher to have as well. As for coursework, it isn't too much: problem sets, 3 tests, weekly quizzes (they are short), and an observing session (one of my favorite parts of the class). I would highly recommend taking it.",
    "I obviously took this because I needed a QR. It wasn't that it was particularly hard but lecture and the testable content weren't actually related which made it an annoying amount of work for somebody who just wanted some cursory knowledge of astronomy. If you take this, read the textbook chapters and go to lecture but you don't have to pay attention at all during lecture.",
    "If you are looking for a gut QR or Sc, do NOT take this course. There are bi-weekly (or sometimes weekly) problem sets, weekly quizzes, three tough exams. Lecture attendance is also required - there are in-class assignments to turn in for participation points at almost every lecture and you get marked off if you are not there. It was also an hour and fifteen minute 9AM lecture this semester, which was just very long and difficult to be on time\/stay engaged. Some of the material is interesting, but you have to teach yourself most of the math stuff. And the textbook is super dense. So the course ends up being a lot of work.",
    "If you are looking for a laid back survey course to astronomy, then I recommend this class. I have always been interested in astronomy, but I didn't want to take a high stakes class in the subject. This was exactly what I was looking for. The problem sets might feel a little bit unnecessary, and I wish that there were more observation sessions, but overall the professor was great, the material was far reaching, and I enjoyed the course and came out knowing much more about astronomy in general than I had known before.",
    "Loved the class, really great overview of astronomy with enough detail to warrant being a full class but not so much that it becomes too stressful or otherwise specific.",
    "Unless you're really interested in astronomy, and get excited about what some times seems like tedious science, then I wouldn't recommend it. I would tell anyone to shop it. Astronomy is such a bright subject, and brimming with inspiration. If ASTR-110 can somehow find a way to dispense that little bit of romance in the stars onto the students, then I'd recommend it to anyone. For now, I felt it missed the mark just a bit.",
    "I would recommend it because I learned a lot and it was difficult and yet not impossible.",
    "I would recommend this course to a fellow student, not only because it is both a science and math credit, but also because students can work at their own pace. Assignments and tests were fair, and if you didn't understand the material, you could simply reread the textbook to enhance your understanding. I never missed a lecture, but they were not really necessary, as I felt they did not add much extra that the textbook would have left out.",
    "A broad course for the novice to astronomy.",
    "Awesome! If you like star-gazing but want to go further into the science of the celestial spheres, take this class. It's a manageable workload, you learn a significant amount and come out with a basic knowledge of the universe."
