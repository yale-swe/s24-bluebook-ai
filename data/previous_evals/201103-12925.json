   "comments": [
    "I think this class is really fun, Professor Titus is really great and makes class interesting. The class starts of really easy and then all of a sudden you get a lot of grammar thrown at you at once, which can be difficult to keep up with, but the class is still really good.",
    "Highly recommended.",
    "Russian is a fun language to learn. It is somewhat difficult but it's worth the effort. Julia is a good professor and David is an amazing TA. If you like Russian, you should take this course!There is homework every day but it is usually really easy. You have to study for the tests.",
    "I would definitely recommend Russian 110 to anyone interested in the language - the professors and TAs are all incredibly dedicated and clearly invested in the course, there's more than enough help available if you needed, and the courseload is both manageable and productive. Russian has a reputation for being a difficult language, but the course makes you pick it up almost effortlessly. Definitely one of my favorite classes at Yale.",
    "I would recommend Russian 110 to any student interested in taking a language. No one really thinks about taking it because it seems obscure or simply weird. The workload was more than I was expecting in a L1 course, but I am so glad I took it and I would recommend this class to everyone.",
    "Don't take this class if you want an easy language credit. It's not impossible, but it does require that you actually do everything that is asked of you. It's not overwhelming, but you need to give it the attention it deserves. If you're willing to do that, I'd say this is definitely the class for you!",
    "Yes. It is a difficult language but the course goes at a manageable pace.",
    "This course teaches the basics of Russian language. If you are curious about Russian language and culture and are willing to put in the time to learn, TAKE THIS COURSE! You will be amazed at how much Russian you'll know after only a few months. The workload is not too heavy (usually a small homework assignment to complete every night) and the instruction is incredible. Julia is great!",
    "RECOMMEND.Come MotivatedThis was not an easy language for me because this is the first European language I've learned. Conjugations, tenses, and genders and all were tough for me, but that being said, it probably isn't so bad if you have experience with other European languages.",
    "I would strongly recommend this course, especially to those with passion for Russian literature \/ politics. It's very well organized and super fun to participate. Plus, Russian is a VERY useful language when one is traveling in Eurasia.",
    "I would recommend it to any student who enjoys some facet of foreign culture or languages. It is much more than just a language class."
