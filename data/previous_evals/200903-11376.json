   "comments": [
    "TAKE IT! The class is wonderful and Professor Lee-Smith is really great.",
    "The class is laid back, friendly, and fun. Compared to the other East Asian languages, the workload seems pretty light, but you still do learn a lot. Professor is cheerful and energetic and makes you willing to go to class even at 9:25 in the morning. A great language class to take.",
    "Yes.... You will actually look forward to getting up in the morning and going to class. It's also just great that for once, everyone was pretty much in the same boat and learning together with other students is fun.",
    "Class is so much fun :) It doesn't feel like there's a ton of work (definitely much less than the other Asian languages), but you actually learn more quickly than you think you are. For presentations and things, don't be afraid to be ridiculous and you will have so much fun :) Being on time for class without missing breakfast is kind of a killer, but same goes for every other 9:20 class",
    "I would recommend this class-- it is very interesting and well-taught. As with many intro languages, though, it is a lot of work and memorizing is hard at first.",
    "If you can find an excuse to take Korean, do. It\u0092s a lot of fun, not nearly as hard as you might think, and the teacher is wonderful. For most, it might not have as much practical value, but for East Asian Studies majors or those looking at careers in Asia, this may be one of the most enjoyable practical classes for you at Yale.",
    "If you want to take the funnestlanguage class, take Korean L1. The teacher is fabulously entertaining and always makes you laugh. The challenge of learning a new language is forgotten by how much fun you are having, listening to short stories, role playing in class, and creating skits with classmates to practice new grammar. The integration of Korean culture comes from individual research that is presented in class for 10 minutes (in English). The work load is managable and the space for strong friendship and growth great.",
    "This is one of the best classes I have ever taken. If you're at all interested in Korean, I highly recommend you take this class. The work is manageable, the classes are lively, the professor is fun and kind, and you'll be amazed by your progress at the end of the semester.If you've had little to no exposure to Korean, you'll do fine in this class. If you're like me, you'll find yourself excited to wake up early every morning and head of to Korean class.",
    "Absolutely. If you have any interest in learning Korean, now is the time to do it. Not only is Professor Lee-Smith amazing, but the class is well-structured and kept at a good pace for picking up a lot within the first semester.",
    "Yes i would definitely recommend. It is just a lot of fun, even though it is kind of early in the morning",
    "My favorite class of the semester! I would without a doubt recommend the class to everyone. It's strange to think that so much fun is possible in a class! The absolute best! I also ended up with a good grasp on the language considering the short amount of time."
