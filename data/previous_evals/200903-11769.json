   "comments": [
    "The course is okay, using mainly stat-mech to look at biological systems. Unless you like stat-mech don't take this course.",
    "Biological physics attempts to explain biological concepts through physics-based models. No biological knowledge is necessary, though I imagine it would have helped some. Prof. Mochrie often acted as if he didn't know what he was talking about when it came to biology, though it seemed he actually did. He was friendly and accommodating.Homework was often poorly written, especially book problems. Beware the textbook-- Physical Biology of the Cell. Hopefully it will be changed.",
    "I would recommend this to any students who wants to know how biological systems work at the physical level. It is a fascinating topic. The student should have a pretty strong knowledge of into physics.",
    "This class is fascinating. I highly recommend it, but to fully appreciate it requires a bit of work and reading. I have the textbook with me over break because I want to read it and understand it better."
