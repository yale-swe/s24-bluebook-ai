    "A class which not only illuminates what a good story is, but also teaches us a lot about life and people.",
    "The professor doesn't follow her own syllabus. Deadlines are often switched around with little notice, which is especially difficult when you are trying to arrange equipment rentals and interviews\/shoots. The class is very independent: you will not receive any practical lessons about filming, there is no one to keep you on schedule for assignments, and screenings and readings are only for personal benefit - they are often not discussed in class but are required. The final project screening was completely disorganized. There was no predetermined order of the screening, so it lasted three hours, and we were expected to remain for the duration and bring friends for credit.The class taught me a lot, but much of the learning that occurred was independent."
