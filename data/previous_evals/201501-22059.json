    "Take it if you're geo or environmental sciences because it'll look really really good for jobs and it's one of the only skill-based classes that yale offers, but take it credit\/D\/fail because the grading is pretty unpredictable and the classes are a bit dry. The weekly assignments may or may not make you cry out of frustration with the program (another reason to take it credit\/d).",
    "so the other responses probably make it pretty clear but this class is not good for procrastinators (dana's pretty upfront that it is not a good idea to wait til reading week to do your entire project so fair warning). otherwise it's as much work as you want to put into it: weekly homework assignments only graded complete\/incomplete, though you'll want to keep up with it so that doing the final project is easier, in terms of knowing what tools you can use. but yeah it's pretty cool what gis can do for visualizing data!",
    "Time intensive, sometimes very frustrating if you dont know how to work the program.",
    "This course provides a very solid overview of the arcGIS software. The only grade in the course is the final project, but it's up to you to keep up with the weekly assignments so you don't fall behind. Dana is incredibly helpful and will provide you with basically anything you need to succeed in your project. The only downside is that it meets Tuesday mornings at 9 for two hours.",
    "If you know that there is no other way to motivate yourself to learn ArcGIS other than through a class, take this. If you have any other alternative available, don't.",
    "EVST 290 teaches the program ArcGIS through a series of assignments that all lead up to a final project of your choosing. The class allows for a huge amount of freedom, and is very self-directed. While this freedom is cool, it can also be intimidating - you really have to hold yourself accountable in your project and work on it during the entire semester. It was also easy to get sucked into the topic of the project, as opposed to the GIS work, which is what the class is really about. Still, for those interested in learning how to use the program, this is a great starting point.",
    "Easily one of the top five classes I have taken at Yale. The material is often challenging if you don't have much experience with remote sensing or computing, but the class is well organized and the work is manageable as long as you stay on top of it. Dana is a superb teacher who expects a lot of his students but offers a lot of help as well. You get as much out of this class as you put in.",
    "Amazing class that may require a lot of effort but leaves you very satisfied having picked a very practical and cool-to-use skill (ArcGIS) that you can apply in a variety of fields. The course is very final-project driven, but do not let this scare you away from taking it! The material in the class builds well over the course of the semester, and the homework assignments are well-crafted in order to give you the opportunity to get a good working knowledge of the techniques explained in that week's class. This is the first class Ive taken where Piazza has been used well: feedback was extremely quick (rarely did a question remain unanswered for more than a couple of hours), and seeing other students questions was very helpful in solving my own problems along the way. Professor Tomlin's teaching style is unique and demanding, but is a refreshing breather from the typical overly paternalistic teacher-student relationship that you deal with in most Yale classes. It may surprise you at first, but I very much appreciated Professor Tomlin's approach by the end of the semester. Dont wait until the last week before starting your final project in earnest. Luckily, the homework assignments are structured to push you to do some work towards the final project over the course of the semester. This is the kind of class where the more time you put in, the more you get out of it (in terms of learning some of the ins and outs of the ArcGIS software), and I definitely encourage you to devote a lot of time outside the classroom if you decide to take the class. It is very rewarding!"
