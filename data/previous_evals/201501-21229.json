    "NBIO 597 consists of reading about 3-5 original research papers per week, followed by presentations and discussions. The work load is fair, although the readings for some weeks are very challenging and take quite a bit of time to understand. It's a great way to read some groundbreaking work in the field of neuroeconomics, but may be difficult for people who have no neuroscience background.",
    "Listen to BOTH professors! This course may not give you the most scientific growth...but it will open your eyes and cultivate you to be a better human being. Grad students are meant to do science for more than science.",
    "I recommend this class. Daeyeol and Ifat and complementary. No pressure. Students with various background. Good overview\/basis for understanding what is neuroeconimics and where the field is at.",
    "Yes I would recommend this class for those interested in learning about neuroeconomics."

   "comments": [
    "It was very helpful to read original papers in the field, and I now feel much more informed when I'm reading other research papers on a variety of related topics (neuroscience, psychology, cognitive science, and economics).",
    "Eye-opening course. Wonderful. May not related to my own research. But it is definitely worth it."
