    "YOU SHOULD TAKE THIS CLASS! Professor Wolenski is amazing (you should take it just to be his friend). There is also a strong sense of a bond among all the students as the Professor and TAs encourage such camaraderie. Scientifically, you learn a lot (for example I was always intimidated by western blots but this class familiarized me well with that technique). Its awesome and everyone has a fantastic time. Note: I get that its a large time commitment but you don't have to do any lab write-ups outside of class. Besides a big presentation in the second half of the semester, most of the work you do is inside the classroom!",
    "Hands down one of the best classes I've taken at Yale. You are lucky if you get a spot, so TAKE IT!",
    "This is a great course, take it if you can manage to get in!",
    "TAKE THE COURSE!Professor Wolenski is by far the best teacher I've had at Yale and his dedication to the course is awe-inspirng. You will never take a lab course you enjoy as much and learn as much from as this one.Contact him at least a year in advance if you want to take the course.",
    "Fantastic class that teaches you the most important techniques in cell biology research. A must take.",
    "Yes!",
    "This class was great! There were no lab reports or homework. We did spend quite a bit of time in lab and sometimes came into lab when class was not scheduled. The class did require that you give two formal talks but both were great experiences. It teaches you how to present scientific work and that is a skill that will be important in years to come.",
    "you learn an amazing amount of stuff. you will want to go to lab. you will miss it when it is over. you want to take it. you will love it",
    "MCDB 344L and 345L are by far the best two labs I have taken at Yale. Professor Wolenski is one of the nicest, funniest, most approachable professors you will ever come across. He fosters a great sense of friendship and community among the students in the lab. He encourages students to collaborate and to serve as teachers to one another. The lab is very low-stress, in contrast to most of the other lab courses I have taken here. I developed a solid understanding of a wide variety of fundamental lab techniques. I would definitely recommend that students contact Professor Wolenski at least a year and a half in advance so that they can have the opportunity to take this lab!",
    "Definitely take it, but you have to sign up at least a year in advance. This class is a great opportunity to do interesting experiments and really get to know a professor.",
    "This course is essential for mastering several key lab techniques in cell biology. The reason that the course is so effective is that it allows students to develop these skills in sequence of related experiments. For example, we carried out a series of experiments over several classes that began with the purification of a DNA plasmid, the transient transfection of mammalian cells with this plasmid, and then purification and identification of the resultant protein product. Above all, I recommend taking this course for the opportunity to work with Dr. Wolenski. He is the best professor I have ever had at Yale.",
    "I would strongly recommend Dr. Wolenski's lab courses. You'll learn about relevant science, hear speakers from a variety of backgrounds, make friends with your classmates (really!), and gain a great mentor in Dr. Wolenski. Be prepared to spend considerable time in lab, but the limited out-of-class work makes up for that aspect. In sum, this was easily the best lab class I've taken at Yale.",
    "The best biology lab at Yale!! Wolenski is the best and everyone has a great time in this lab. It's really hard to get into, so you need to get in touch with Wolenski your freshman or sophomore year to take it your junior or senior year.",
    "BEST CLASS EVER. You learn so much, not just about lab techniques but also how to work with others, how to give a good science talk, what makes a successful experiment, and much more. The class becomes really close and your Yale career will be improved many times over by having made the acquaintance of Dr. Wolenski.",
    "Yes. Just do it. Be prepared to spend a lot of time in lab, but the time flies by. There is a lot of fun mixed in as well.",
    "AMAZING CLASS. Best ever. Take it if you can get in because it's the best lab class at Yale. Wolenski is a genius + the nicest professor."
