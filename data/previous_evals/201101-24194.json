    "It's integrals\/derivatives in 3D ... you are doing work with vectors and multiple integrals.Material is tougher than 115 but the tests seem easier ...You should be fairly strong in math because the course work is difficult to conceptualize. But otherwise, fine class",
    "It is a challenging course which is not explained very well in lecture. It seems as though sometimes things are assumed of you and that is why it is crucial to find a professor who can clearly and simply explain exactly what it is you are trying to do.",
    "hard",
    "If you need to take the class, do not be afraid to do so. It isn't too difficult if you are good in math.",
    "Challenging but definitely doable if you put the time into it. I didn't get much from the class itself because the teacher has to go over stuff pretty quickly, and so I rarely went, but if you spend time on the homework making sure you understand what you're doing and then get some solid studying in before the midterms\/finals, then you'll do really well.",
    "I took math 120 after having taken BC calculus in high school. I skipped 115 and went straight to 120. I struggled to really understand the material being taught in this course, but maybe that was just because it was at 9 am, a time when I don't function. Take this course if you need to.",
    "I would definitely recommend it. Grading is weird and unfair in some sections in comparison to others. It depends on the instructor and the overall policy.",
    "Yes, I would..I really enjoyed the material. The grading is difficult, but if you like math then I would say go for it. If things don't go as you plan, you can drop it. That was my plan, but I ended up sticking with it because I liked the material. Go to office hours, use tutoring, and make a study group to at least check homeworks with. The midterms are doable and even sometimes fun, but the final is deadly. I would do it again."
