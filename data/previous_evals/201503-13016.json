    "This is definitely one of those courses you should take regardless of your major if you really buy into that \"liberal arts\" concept that Yale sold you on.",
    "Aas a dancer this class gave me the best of both worlds. I could spend class time doing my hobby and get a grade for it. The readings were enlightening and enjoyable, though you don't have to stress about doing it all. We had a writing assignment in the middle of the semester about a genre of dance and had a 8-12 page paper that could incorporate our own reflection of the course. Good as a 5th class, though it does take up two hours on Tue\/Thur so prepare for that afternoon chunk if you are doing a lab or another afternoon course. As long as you are prompt, respectful, and pay attention in class you should be golden. I wish that there were more dance classes like this at Yale.",
    "This was a wonderful class. TAKE IT IF YOU CAN!!! Come ready to move and dance (i.e. not much room for laziness) and be pushed out of your comfort zone a little. it's capped at 20 but it's going to be 20 interesting people you will get to know pretty well! It was a fantastic experience. A really casual atmosphere, readings that are interesting and not much work and a very memorable semester with a cool professor and cool classmates with a lot of personality.",
    "Students need to take this class!",
    "This is class is a basic introduction to the West African Dance Style and is enjoyable throughout. Workload is mainly confined to participation in the classroom, short readings and a final paper. Overall a really fun class with a really dedicated instructor who really wants to help you improve.",
    "ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC CLASS! LACINA COULIBALY IS ONE OF THE BEST TEACHERS I HAVE EVER HAD AT YALE, AND IN LIFE. EVERYONE MUST TAKE!",
    "AFST 435 is an excellent class where students can be exposed to and learn about West African dance from an expert of the field. I would highly recommend the class to students who are interested in dance, willing to dance rigorously, and learn and experience a new art form.",
    "Yes, if you are interested in philosophies of dance. Yes, if you want to take a enjoyable and educational dance class for credit. Yes, if you want to learn more about West African culture.",
    "TAKE IT! Also people who complain about his accent are lazy af.",
    "I have already recommended it to all.",
    "Dance and discussion, exploring the world of West African dance from its roots to its existence in the world today."
