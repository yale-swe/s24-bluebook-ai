    "The midterms are difficult, and the practice exams are too watered down. Psets are annoying, but you can do it without stressing.",
    "I thought this was a good into to calc class. The course itself was run very well and appreciated how the instructors made sure to communicate expectations to us throughout the semester (what we needed to know for exams, reminders, etc.).",
    "Math 112 will teach you the basics of calculus. It is good to take it early on if you will need it for a major. It is quite hard, though, and problems on the exams are really challenging. Professor Zhao is an excellent professor, whom I highly recommend. However, his accent is sometimes hard to understand so if you struggle with that, perhaps consider shopping around sections.",
    "In the future, I'm not sure whether or not i would've preferred another teacher, but Zhao was by no means a bad professor.",
    "This class would be very difficult without a background in calculus. I would not recommend this class to someone without a background in calculus.",
    "Math 112 teaches you the concepts and skills of differential calculus. I would recommend this course to another student; calculus is a challenging and interesting subject.",
    "Math 112 will give you a good intro to basic calculus. If you need it for your major, it's not bad. If you just need a qr credit, don't take 112 unless you like math, are interested in learning something new, and don't mind working hard."
