    "I would summarize Latin 390 as a truly excellent course taught by a truly excellent professor. I would recommend it both to those interested in Latin specifically and to those interested in language more generally. The compositions, assigned readings, and \"little talks\" (given weekly about a variety of subjects related to the Latin language and its change over time) were a lot of fun.",
    "Only take it if you absolutely have to. Hours upon hours of work and too many pop quizzes",
    "Latin 390 is a course in the history of Latin and Latin prose style (the \"stylistics\" in the course title). The assignments for the class have almost no bearing on this subject - they're prose compositions from Bradley's Arnold, a 19th-century textbook which desperately needs a 21st-century update. These teach you the \"syntax\" in the course title.Taking prose composition classes like Greek 390 and Latin 390 is a great way to improve your reading speed and fluency in ancient languages. After taking this class, I was able to read Latin about twice as fast as I had before; I think this is mostly the result of studying Bradley's Arnold closely and spending a lot of time on the compositions. This was worth the substantial time and effort the class took, and I would encourage anyone planning to do 2 or more semesters of L5 Latin (or to do research that requires Latin) to take this course. It will be a good experience, albeit not a fun one.",
    "Latin 390 is both a prose composition course and a stylistic review of Latin literature from its beginnings to Tacitus. I'm not going to major in the Classics, but I nevertheless quite enjoyed this course. If you are really interested in writing in Latin and understanding Latin a good deal better, I would recommend this course, though it is a lot of work, since the compositions take a long time.",
    "Tough, but good. Take it."
