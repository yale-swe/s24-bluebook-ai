I learned about the importance of intention in performance and how to engage effectively with a fellow actor. I gained skills in breaking down a story and making prepared decisions while remaining flexible and open during the performance."

    "The class was great. Greg really took the note that warm-ups were needed for an 8:25a class from past reviews. We did them every morning! The small size was really nice because it meant everyone was given a sizable amount of time to work with Greg, too.",
    "This course was strong in that it provided enough time for each student to be heard.",
    "I personally really enjoyed this class and found it very helpful to work the way we did. The class is structured around performances, where scenes are performed every class and the rest o the time is spent watching the other performances. I found myself learning not just from the critiques and suggestions directed towards me, but also from the other actors in the scenes."

    "I would definitely recommend this to anyone who is looking for a rigorous acting class where they can really work on their skills!"
