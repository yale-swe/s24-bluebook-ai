    "I would definitely recommend this class to a fellow student. Every play you read is a literary masterpiece, and highly relevant to our modern understanding of the world around us. even if you hate english, this sort of knowledge may help you in any career that you choose. you essentially read two plays per week, one for each class. I actually really enjoyed this fast-paced nature of the class because the class time is enough to discuss all of the most important themes in each play without going into too much detail, which would 1) make us seem like over-ambitious scholars who read too deeply into literature, and 2) be futile because we would not remember what we learned after the class is over.",
    "It's a lot of reading and a good class if you want a reason to read a lot of classic plays."
