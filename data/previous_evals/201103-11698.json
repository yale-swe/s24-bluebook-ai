    "Great idea, less than ideal execution. The work is manageable (especially considering most people at the most skim the admittedly sizable reading assignments) and the material interesting (although this does depend on who \"teaches\" the modules), but the class was not organized very well, felt disjointed frequently, and seemed to lack direction. I definitely don't regret taking the class but I'd advise against taking the class just because there's a cool name attached to it.",
    "No, don't do it to yourself. The course is a lot of work for little return. The names of the professors sound great, but few are good instructors.",
    "This class was a HUGE regret. Thank goodness I took it credit\/d\/fail. I really do NOT recommend it. WuDunn was an awful, awful lecturer, mostly because she didn't lecture. She just tried to make people discuss things that she should have been teaching. McChrystal was great (educationally), Lamb was lackluster educationally but was still interesting, Natrass was good (standard lecturer)...but at least she taught us and we learned. The policy memos were an awful experience, especially because most of them did not even follow standard policy memo (especially McChrystal's) and Lamb's had nothing to do with what he talked about in class!!! There is SO much reading. So don't take it with a bunch of other courses with heavy reading...just don't take it...!",
    "For the love of God do not take this class. Run. Run away now, as fast as you can, and don't look back. Where do I begin? I was sucked into the course because I dropped into one of the lectures McCrystal was teaching and it was fantastic. Terribly organized. Spotty teaching, with McCrystal and Nattrass being the high points [especially McCrystal), Lamb being entertaining more for his personality, life wisdom, and quotes from romantic English poets than anything else, and WuDunn being just absolutely terrible (boring, disorganized, half ofour lectures weren't even on China). While the policy memos weren't hard and didn't take too long to write, they varied in effort necessary and style, which made me feel like I hadn't learned anything about how to write a policy memo by the end of the course because each one was so different. We didn't even know the course was curved until after the time to switch from Cr\/D\/F had passed. TAs were alright. I had Jason Mangone, and he was pretty good. Didn't seem to engaged in the course, but wasn't too hard of a grader, responded to questions by emails quickly and clearly, and took rough drafts a week in advance or so to edit. Seemed better than the other TAs. I wish the four teachers coordinated more. Class was stressful because there was anywhere from 60-100 pages per lecture, and you had to do it because the lecturers would purposely call on people to grill them about very specific questions on the reading and embarrass them. At best, I feel like a got a very shallow view of China and the AIDS epidemic. Middle East was covered pretty well, but we spent 6 weeks on it. The readings were generally interesting and worth reading, however. Overall, I just feel like I would have intellectually matured much else in a different course.",
    "I might recommend it- be sure and look over what the different units will be so you know you think theyre interesting. also, its a lot of reading so be prepared.",
    "ONLY ONLY ONLY take it if you're really interested in becoming a global affairs major or something like it. Even though it's a 101 class, they expect a lot from you even though most of us aren't that knowledgable of global affairs. It's kind of unfair. It's not an easy A. Lots of reading!!!",
    "Do not blindly take this class when you find out it is guest lectured by a bunch of famous people. Many of the stories and lectures are incredibly interesting, but the format of the class is fundamentally flawed. It is a largish lecture (about 120 people maybe?), but Professor Levinsohn tries to make it a seminar by encouraging the guest lecturers to call on people at random. This made the class fairly stressful for me to go to personally. The readings were sometimes very interesting, but often unnecessarily long and dense. The biggest flaw with the class was that most of the lecturers are not professors, and therefore do not know how to teach. Their modules were quite disorganized and I often left lecture thinking, \"That was interesting, but what am I supposed to have just learned?\" However, I might have enjoyed the class a lot more if I had had a more talkative section. In short, interesting stories, bad format.",
    "Interesting course on current issues. Lots of reading so be sure to have a slight interest at least in the topics. Four policy memos and a final make up your grade. Sort of unclear how the policy memos are graded but the topics for the memos were all interesting. Overall a solid course, if somewhat disorganized.",
    "I would recommend this class depending on the lecturers who will be teaching it. The first two modules with Stan and Graeme were fantastic, the third with Sheryl WuDunn was abysmal, and the last with Nicoli Nattrass was good. That said, this class was worth taking just to be taught by Stanley McChrystal.",
    "Global Affairs 101 is really an introduction to some major world issues. The lecturers are big-shot, sure, but they aren't necessarily good teachers. The topics themselves are very interesting, and would be worth reading into yourself, but don't expect to gain THAT much knowledge from the lectures. It was just a good experience to be in the presence of the invited lecture speakers.",
    "Global Affairs 101 is a very good class. The guest lecturers are terrific, and writing the policy memos can be very interesting. If one of the modules does not appeal to you it can be a little tough to get through those three weeks of readings and lectures, but the majority of the class is so great, I would definitely recommend it.",
    "The main weakness of this course is that, while the lecturers are interesting, they are not academics. Consequently, most of the lectures in this course were not organized enough to take much away from them. This affected the policy memo assignments, where we were often asked to propose policy for issues that we simply did not have enough background knowledge to solve.",
    "An interesting course- don't expect to get a systematic understanding of anything out of it, but if you're looking for some useful insights on a few problems take it.",
    "This was a fantastic course that did a great job of covering a wide variety of topics in an engaging manner. The cycling of instructors keeps the course fresh, but many times you wish one instructor could stay longer and another stay shorter. The class is very accessible for students of all political caliberand knowledge.",
    "An amazing class that everyone who is interested in global studies should take.",
    "would recommend, worth meeting these people and hearing what they have to say",
    "If you are interested in global affairs as a major you should try it out. How good the class is really depends on who the lecturer is. I learned a lot about the middle east and HIV\/AIDS, and women's issues and I'm gladi took it.",
    "This is not supposed to be a gut class. It's not a class you can take for fun. If you really want to major in something related to global affairs, political science etc then this class may be slightly useful.",
    "This is a great class! A lot of people will probably claim that it is disorganized and over-hyped, but don't pay too much attention to them. If the list of professors for this semester sounds interesting, then go ahead and take it. I liked three out of four modules we had, and I loved two. If Generals Lamb and McChrystal are teaching again, then definitely sign up. It was my favorite class of the semester, and it's a great opportunity to hear and talk with fascinating\/important people (At one point, I think we had four generals in the room)",
    "I would definitely take Global Affairs 101. Sometimes at Yale we forget that there is a world outside of our little bubble, but this class really taught me to pay attention to the news and read the paper. Because of this class, you will be able to have a better grasp on problems that are large issues in the world today.",
    "This class is awesome. 4 modules, 4 rotating professors. Ours were mostly amazing. General Stan McChrystal on the Wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, Sheryl WuDunn on China\/Development, and Prof. Nicoli Nattrass on AIDS policy. Lt. Gen. Graeme Lamb was not that good. He was a really nice guy, but I really don't feel like I learned anything from him.You write policy memos (4 x 15%) and a final, which wasn't too bad this year (40%). I'd totally recommend the class.",
    "A disappointment.I wouldn't recommend it because the class is a big let-down.Not at all what it sounded like it would be.",
    "A survey of the history of various problems facing the world and enacted responses. I would recommend the course to another student for its relevance to everyday life and the quality of lectors.",
    "NO.",
    "Take it, if you are interested in the modules. Don't take it just to see a famous professor.",
    "I would not know whether to recommend this course to another student, as the modules change each year and I feel as though the course depends strongly on whether the speaker for each module is interesting and can effectively get their point across.",
    "Overall, the concept of the class, learning about global issues from professionals in the field is great. I would say that for the first and last modules, I did learn a great deal. However, the quality of the course really depends on who is teaching each module.",
    "I would recommend it if you are interested in the modules being taught.",
    "A fair amount of reading, four policy memos, and a final. Generally, not a very stressful class until the final. I would recommend it IF you're interested in the issues and you think you'll do the reading. DON'T just take it for the famous lecturers because they're not amazing (besides Nicoli).",
    "I fiercely recommend taking this course. To be mentored by so many highly qualified experts in one semester is a rare privilege, and the writing of policy memos seriously develops both your writing and your critical thinking. Especially for those amongst us who seek careers in policy and decision-making, this is a must-take course.",
    "I would still recommend it because the topics of the class are so relevant and only at Yale would you get to listen to people like McCrystal lecture.",
    "Yes--take it! It changes from year to year depending on the lecturer, but this year's lecturers--Graeme Lamb, Stan McChrystal, Sheryl WuDunn and Nicoli Nattrass were all true experts of their fields and mostly great speakers. Usuallyyou get to know them only through seminars, so it's great that you have an opportunity to have them teach you in a lecture. Policy memos are more fun to write than your average essay. If you think you might be interested in Global Affairs, this is a great sampler!",
    "If you feel that lots of courses at yale are not \"real world\" or applicable enough or topical enough, take this class. It's all of those things and more. The professors are great, and they have not been stuck in academia their whole lives so they are real people!",
    "great",
    "This class is one of those that makes you remember why we're so lucky to go to Yale. Getting to hear about these issues from the people who live and work with these issues every day is incredibly valuable. This class made me decide to apply to the global affairs major.",
    "Global Affairs is an engaging, interesting class that covers global topics that one should know about considering today's increasingly globalized world. Take it, but be prepared for lots of reading, and the potential for lecturers who aren't as interesting as this year's (Each year's modules changes, so the lecturers for this year won't be the same as next year's).",
    "This is a very general overview of a few topics. For someone who has never taken anything in the social sciences or really has any interest in that area I found it challenging but ultimately really rewarding as it really does let you get to know a few issues really well. And some of the guest lecturers are really really fantastic.",
    "summary and exploration of current event topics, i'm pretty sure it changes each year depending on what's going on in the world, but this year we covered the middle east, the rise of china, and the HIV\/AIDS epidemic. assignments were 4 policy memos (~5 pages each) where we had to advise the president on what the US should do in hypothetical situations pertaining to the topic we were covering; and then a final",
    "I would summarize Global Affairs 101 as a great way to learn about the world around you. Whether you are an international student, a fervent politician or a science major, there is something for you to connect with in this class.",
    "Fantastic class. A lot a lot a lot of reading.",
    "Make sure you have checked who is teaching each module beforehand, because a bad module can be really terrible.",
    "Global Affairs was probably the most interesting course I took this semester. The topics we studied were extremely varied, and not all that connected, but having experts in each subject teach the lectures made them relevant and eye opening. The amount of reading assigned for each lecture is immense, but for the most part, intriguing. I would definitely recommend this course to any student because taking a course taught by such significant lecturers is a once in a life time opportunity, and the topics we covered were different, yet all very interesting.",
    "It was a lot to handle and if you do not bring a wealth of knowledge, this will be a very difficult class for you. The reading was very unreasonable, at times 90 pages a night. I would not recommend this class for a fellow student.",
    "Not as exciting as advertised. Often ill-defined paper assignments. Interesting readings, but grading can be frustrating. The final was straightforward. I suppose it depends on who is teaching next year, but some of the instructors were terrible. Although the module system sounds cool in theory, it can be somewhat frustrating when you feel you have only really cursorily looked over some very large topics.",
    "It gives you some basics on certain parts of international relations. It's not at all a theoretical course. It's much more focused on hands-on sorts of things, which is great to balance out all the theory you get at Yale. That being said, the course could still use some work and honestly, it wasn't one of my favorite courses.",
    "A great class for those interested in the international sector, but a lot of work.",
    "I would not recommend it because of its lack of organization.",
    "This a great course if you are interested in the people teaching it. You have to be willing to take a class that might not be as structured (no textbook, a lot of readings, alternative teaching style...) as a traditional lecture. However this also comes with peeks. People speak up in class and we actually had debates and discussions pretty often. It also is worth it because it provides unique insight from people who are the front line of global problems we are reading about daily. It is a unique class and one of those that remind you of Yale's uniqueness.",
    "While I personally got a great experience from taking the course, I feel like I was in the minority, especially among many freshmen I knew taking it. I applied myself to learning about the issues and researching for the policy memos, but the actual class was poorly organized, had a weird grading scale and didn't actually teach me as much as I would've hoped. Therefore, it is important not to be tempted by the big names that will come in to teach the modules and to take this course only if you are genuinely interested in writing about policy, and specifically answering questions for policy memos, some of which aren't even about suggesting policy (which is what a policy memo is)! Writing about the Middle East in 30 years is not a policy memo, it is a prediction of the future based on the present. It isn't giving policy recommendations. This course opens you to world issues through a general survey which is great as a freshman trying to figure out what you want to do, especially if you know you want to go into global affairs. However, it is also extremely difficult as a freshman because you are often in class with upper classmen global affairs majors who already have an extensive knowledge to write the memos. This makes it hard to catch up to them and requires a lot of research (or good \"fluff-writing\" skills) to do well on the memos. Not only do you have to adjust to the standards of writing a college essay, but memos are a completely different style of writing apart from regular essays. It is such a poorly organized class that you really have to motivate yourself to get anything from the class individually, and you shouldn't get lured in by all the big names of interesting people who will be teaching you.",
    "Don't necessarily be drawn in by the high profile lecturers. They often don't have teaching experience. I would recommend sitting in the McChrystal lectures without taking the class. My time would have been best spentelsewhere.",
    "I would recommend this course because it will teach you so much about the relationships between the particular countries in study, and it provides insight into some conflicts that are arising today. However, the policy memos were graded very subjectively.",
    "Really depends on who the lecturers are. This year, Nicole Natrass was fantastic, Stanley Mchrystal was good, Sheryll Wudunn asked too many questions, though still interesting, and General Laemb tended to ramble a little much. Readings can be a bit difficult to keep up with, but as an intro class it is a good survey of alot of topics.",
    "Give it serious thought - feels often more like a semester-long master's tea than learning anything concrete. Policy memos don't follow the readings and readings are extraneous at times and really overwhelming all of the time. But some of the units were interesting and it was a good way to have intimate conversations with world-leading figures in each of the fields discussed.",
    "Great class! Do the readings, and ask your TF what they look for in memos, and ask them if they'll read drafts.",
    "Class did not reach its potential. Although it is exciting to hear many of the \"celebrity guests\" in class, there is much lost by not having true Yale professors",
    "Although this course jumps around quite a bit and I found the readings somewhat frustrating, I think this course is a good introduction to a huge range of issues involved in contemporary international politics. Moreover, through the lectures of such important figures such as Gen. McChrystal and Gen. Lamb, I gained a fascinating insight into power and the qualities of leadership. It was also incredible to get their first hand perspective on events taking place in the Middle East as they were defining them.",
    "Take a look at who the visiting lecturers are. Only take the course if someone truly special is lecturing. Otherwise the course is just too incoherent and frustrating",
    "Global Affairs is a survey of interesting topics relating to real world problems. The class teaches you how to think big and how to think about consequences. I would recommend it to anyone interested in the world.",
    "Overall I felt the class was very disorganized. The policy memos were always asking for different things. Also they expected the students to write informed responses on topics which we had often times only touched on in lecture. I felt some of the modules were well done and others were not. It is totally based on who the lecturers are but since it is different every year its hard to tell if next semester the class will be good.",
    "Global Affairs is a very good class to take for those interested in understanding some aspects of modern day international relations. The speakers (who, essentially, are the teachers) are very interesting, and they are very generous in offering their specialized knowledge. My biggest complaint about the course is that we only covered four different modules: the Middle East, China, women in the world, and AIDS. Because the course is titled Global Affairs, I thought that we would be covering a much broader range of global topics.",
    "I would say, if you're somewhat interested in current events, take it, but don't feel like its going to be the greatest class you'll ever take.",
    "Global Affairs 101 sounds like a lot of fun, but in my opinion doesn't live up to the hype. The speakers know what they are talking about, but lectures can be boring (punctuated by random wake-up calls into the audience for answers) and often are disjointed from the sizable reading assignments, which are sometimes tedious (reading entire UN reports on global AIDS). The policy memo assignments are really frustrating; several didn't even correspond to what we had been discussing in class or reading for homework. The final is reasonable. I would not recommend Global Affairs 101 to any student who, like I was, is looking for a fun course to round out a schedule. It is not as enjoyable as you would think and is furthermore surprisingly difficult to do well in. If you take it, start it out credit\/d\/fail.",
    "Yes, fascinating class especially if Lamb and McCrystal are lecturing again. Not difficult, and a good way to get insight into a few different areas of global affairs. Please do not do all the reading - most ppl in the class are freshmen and do it but it will take hours (especially for HIV) and is not all necessary.",
    "I would recommend this course, particularly if there is a module you are interested in. It offers you the opportunity to understand the topic from a practitioner's point of view.",
    "Take this class! Probably my favorite class at Yale. The work is not too bad (4 short papers\/policy memos which are actually really interesting to write, and a final exam which is based on the reading). Keeping up on the reading really helps, but the readings are all really intriguing and tie in well with the course material. If you can, get Leslie as a T.A., she is a lot of fun and really helps you get through the class.",
    "Where else will you get a chance to hear from and speak to people the likes of Generals McChrystal and Lamb. Solid introduction to the Security side of the major and even though lacking on the Development front, well worth your time and effort.Memos require creativity and research, while the exam warrants attention in class and doing readings.",
    "GLBL 101 is a sampler of various global affairs topics. It is not really an introduction but rather a tasting menu. Take the course if you are interested in the module topics - for us it was Modern Middle East, Rise of China, and AIDS in South Africa. It is a big lecture course, with some interaction depending on the preference of the module lecturers. It can be at times disjointed. Quality of the experience totally depends on the people who will be teaching each module.",
    "This class is fantastic if you are really interested in global affairs and are willing to put in a lot of work. It is intensive, but you learn a ton.",
    "I would not recommend this course. It felt like a circus. Disorganized. Arbitrary. Unpleasant.",
    "I would summarize it as a good introduction to international affairs if a bit selective in its topics. It is divided into three modules, in our case Middle East, China, and AIDS. If you're looking for a comprehensive review of international relations or maybe something more theory-based, do not take this class. If you are interested in the topics, take it, the lecturers will certianly impart knowledge you won't get from academics!",
    "Somewhat disorganized as none of the topics really transition well into the others. That being said, all modules were quite interesting with some cool lecturers.",
    "GLBL 101 accomplishes its goal of illustrating the complexity of global affairs. The chance to hear the perspectives of the experts themselves in diverse modules (ours were Middle East, China, and HIV\/AIDS) is a very unique one that students should make the most of even if they don't have interests directly related to global affaits.",
    "I would recommend the class to a student that has an interest in the course, keeping in mind the extensive reading that the course requires.",
    "A decent, but uneven introduction to some of the world's major issues. You'll learn enough to have a decent understanding of the subjects, but if you have a serious interest in any of the topics you would probably be better off take a more in-depth course.",
    "Yes I would. I loved this class. You learn about many topics and do so deeply.",
    "It's an interesting class if you have some basic knowledge about international relations, or you will be really confused. You can learn a lot of things after a semester's reading, discussion about global affairs. You also have to write 4 political memos without a WR credit...but this can improve your writing skills.",
    "Take it! I thoroughly enjoyed GLBL 101; favorite course this semester. But it really depends on what each module is about. Make sure you like the topics and be prepared to do hours of research to write policy memos. Lots of reading, but worth it.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class. I enjoyed it a lot and learned so much.",
    "Lots of reading, but the material is very interesting. It's extremely difficult to read everything for class without compromising other classes",
    "a horrible excuse for what it could be. A waste of potential and time",
    "I would recommend it to anyone thinking of becoming a global affairs major.",
    "I would recommend this course to a fellow student, regardless of whether they are planning on going into the Global Affairs or Political Science major. I believe that it is necessary for people to learn about the world they live in, and this course gives a good look at the world as it stands today, and presents intriguing questions on the future of circumstances that are developing as we speak. It is definitely a worthwhile course, simply for the fact that it opens your eyes."
