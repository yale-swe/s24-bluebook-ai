    "Take it with Francesco because he's funny and you watch a lot of movies. Pretty fun.",
    "I would recommend it if you are serious about pursuing Italian as a language and improving",
    "I would recommend FRANCESCO!!",
    "You probably have to take it for language requirements so take it, its a good class if you take it with a good professor and its not super hard.",
    "Third year Italian course that you should take if you are an Italian student and if they asked which instructor\/section they should pick, obviously I would recommend Francesco for reasons stated above.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone who is serious about learning the depths of Italian grammar.",
    "Absolutely amazing course. Incredibly fair, it never felt as if it actually required the time that its designation as a 1.5-credit course would suggest. It's fun, engaging, and immersing... especially if you get Francesco. Kinda wish I could take it again.",
    "Francesco is fantastic--class was absolutely hilarious, he's a generous grader, and he's a genuinely good teacher. The workload is mostly a repeat of intro, so nothing too stressful or challenging."
