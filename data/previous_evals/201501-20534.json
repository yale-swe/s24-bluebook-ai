    "Watching Professor Stepto lead the course was a wonderful lesson in watching how a great professor advises and helps students reach their full potential. He was firm while also being supportive, and his advice and suggestions were always excellent. In this sense, it deepened my knowledge of the profession of teaching, advising, and mentoring. This course contributed greatly to my research, as it steadily guided me as I worked to complete my prospectus and forced me to take important steps toward completing my prospectus that I would have put off for later dates without the guidance from the course."
