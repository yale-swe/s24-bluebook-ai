    "I learned how to craft different types of creative non-fiction essays (location, personal experience, humor, cultural artifact, and profile). I also learned how to recognize writing techniques used by authors of modern essays, in order to make their pieces more engaging.",
    "Developed writing skills in how to write nonfiction creatively and accurately at the same time.",
    "I learned how to write in different styles and using different techniques.",
    "I learned a lot about the craft of writing, developed better close-reading skills, and gained a greater appreciation for essayists in the creative nonfiction tradition.",
    "This course greatly helped me in improving my writing skills.",
    "I learned how to write creative nonfiction--something I had never done before.",
    "Learned how to write creative non-fiction essays.",
    "I dont think I became a better writer but I became a better reader certainly.",
    "How to glean good writing from good reading, how to structure my thoughts coherently in an essay. Very similar to AP Language I thought, at times redundant (not a critique of the course in any way)"

   "comments": [
    "We read a wide variety of essays (many from the New Yorker!) that were very engaging and not too long. The homework was pretty enjoyable and did not take up a lot of my time outside of class. Some authors include Mindy Kaling, Malcolm Gladwell, and Joan Didion. We had 5 units (1 for each essay), and for each unit, we had a workshop in class where we would discuss 3 rough drafts written by our peers. The workshops very helpful because both giving and receiving feedback made me think about how I could improve my own essay. The workload and deadlines were very fair.",
    "Strengths: well spread out workload, very manageable. No signficant weaknesses.",
    "I enjoyed reading authors' works and observing their writing styles. I think the student participation in the class was really great and made the class very interesting. It could be improved by eliminating some of the feedback during workshops - we comment before, comment during class, and write a letter after.",
    "I think a major strength of this course is how it's paced. It picks up kind of quickly, but is very consistent and manageable throughout the whole semester. I also really loved the readings, and the workshop process.",
    "I loved the idea of having a \"creative non-fiction\" course. The topics we wrote about were very intriguing and allowed me to improve upon my creative writing techniques. It was helpful to read examples on each type of essay we were writing.",
    "Very fun to be able to write personal essays in a creative way.",
    "The course is graded strangely and grades are based in random factors as it is a creative writing course and it was unclear as to what the basis was for many of my grades.",
    "Strength: the reading responses were at times annoying, but overall a big strength because it actually made you accountable to read the pieces (which are usually engaging and fun to read, but easy to push off among psets and other obligations). Plus, it was an easy 10% of your grade. Weakness: I personally found finding an essay topic very challenging, and I wish there had been some structure put in place to come up with topics or bounce ideas around w peers. Also, the peer review sessions were helpful 90% of the time, but sometimes they got off track or focussed to much on one detail of the essay instead of helping the entire essay."

    "Yes!! This class was genuinely my favorite class of the semester. I'm a CS major so it was wonderful to take a break from psets and read interesting short works from the New Yorker or The Norton Reader. I also had so so much fun writing the essays. I've never taken a creative writing course before and have only written research papers or argumentative essays. With ENGL120, I had the freedom to write about a personal experience or person or cultural artifact that I found interesting and exciting. I never felt too stressed by the work - for me, this class was very enjoyable because I was able to use my creativity to write about what I wanted to write about. It also gave me the chance to branch out and try writing humor and profile essays, which I have never done before. I do think I improved as a writer of creative non-fiction\/personal writing.",
    "Yes, helps a student learn how to be a good creative nonfiction writer.",
    "Yes, this class is fun and interesting.",
    "I would totally recommend this course!! You become a much better writer and the readings and assignments are much more enjoyable than a lot of academic essay writing classes.",
    "This class grants a lot of freedom in terms of what you can write about. Our class discussions were intriguing; I received much feedback on my papers, which was extremely helpful in improving my writing.",
    "Of course! I pushed myself in this class more than I ever have.",
    "Absolutely! Definitely a must take English class!",
    "I think it is graded unfairly but a fun class.",
    "I enjoyed the course although I felt it was a little redundant having taken AP Language (depends on your HS teacher probably). Either way it was an enjoyable experience, not easy but I got a lot out of it and was proud of my writing (and saw drastic improvements)."
