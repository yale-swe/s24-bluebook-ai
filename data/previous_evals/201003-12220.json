    "Research course. Nature of research and experience depends on the lab.",
    "A good opportunity to pursue research, but makes for a stressful last week with required attendance to 6 hours of presentations, a 12 minute presentation yourself, and a 12 page paper due.",
    "Yes. It's just research for credit... pretty standard. It's going to vary a lot based on who your PI and lab are. I've had a very good experience. It might be worth doing 495... you're going to spend way more than 12 hours a week in lab anyway.",
    "Well you have to do it. There's no way around it.",
    "Yes! Basically, you identify with a mentor and a research project, prepare a presentation and a research report at the end of the term. Definitely a great experience if you put work into it.",
    "Yes",
    "This is a great course to take before senior year because it gives you extra lab experience. The hours are very flexible for most mentors, you just have to work with them. Your mentor grades the paper so as long as you worked well with them you should do well in the class."
