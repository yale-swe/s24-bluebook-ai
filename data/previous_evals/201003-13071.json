    "Professor Powell is a fabulous instructor who is always willing to answer any question. The final paper is a lot of fun to do. Overall, very highly recommended!",
    "I would definitely recommmend this class to another student.",
    "A great seminar that will to familiarize you with both the history of parties and leaders in the United States Congress as well presenting various theories about the party system.",
    "I would recommend the course. If you're interested in Congress and politics, you should take the course. The readings can be relatively heavy, but you will get a lot out of them. The final essay is reasonable.",
    "The class is great if you are interested in the United States Congress, specifically, the role that parties play in its operation. Professor Powell is a great professor, and really makes the two hours an enjoyable experience. The class is difficult, but not incredibly so, and the readings are often interesting.",
    "A great class that well exceeded my expectations. Powell is a good seminar leader and also a very nice person. You will cover most of the important literature about Congress (one of the benefits of choosing a class that is so well-focused) and you will learn a fair bit about the internal workings of Congress, even if you come in with a lot of prior knowledge. The literature on Congress is really interesting and well-established so there is a lot of \"meat\" in the course.Most of the students in this year's seminar seemed to come in with a lot of knowledge about Congress, which made for a lot of interesting discussion. On the flip side, I can imagine how someone who doesn't read a lof of news would have been lost in our discussion."
