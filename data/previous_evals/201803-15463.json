   "comments": [
    "The course focused on the very interesting topic of resentment and ressentiment as moral emotions. While the readings were very interesting, class discussions were weak and dominated by the professor. Students did not get much opportunity to explore their own thinking on the ideas presented in the readings or hear from others because most of class time was devoted to hearing insights from the professor. Class discussions often focused around his opinions of the text or his personal musings about related subjects and we rarely covered the questions that were most interesting to me, personally. The coursework consisted of three one page assignments, a presentation, and a final paper. One of my one page papers was graded a few weeks after I turned it in and the other two were not graded until after the class had ended. We never received feedback on the presentations. After barely mentioning the final paper in class, the professor emailed us a few days before it was due and told us that because we had so little time left to write the paper, it essentially did not have to be very good. Grading seemed largely based on whether or not we agreed with the professor's views of the text. Also, I found the underlying ideas that the course I was based around to often be sexist\/racist. Although the professor did not agree with me about this, I found many of the texts difficult to take seriously because of this. Even though I brought this up with the professor, we never had a meaningful discussion of it in class.",
    "relevant theme and interesting texts, very manageable workload and chill professor, a small seminar where you can really engage with the texts"

    "I would not recommend this class to other students. It did not cater to students' needs or interests and most of what I learned came from the readings.",
    "yes, but its really up to you to make the most out of the discussions since the seminar is so small if you dont prepare well or arent willing to speak a lot the discussions will languish"
