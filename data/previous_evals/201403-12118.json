   "comments": [
    "It was a fine class. A little dry at times, but Professor Jorgensen had a great sense of humor too. There was hardly any work at all, which was nice most of the time, but at the end I wished there had been more problem sets so I could have been better prepared for the tests. Not bad, though.",
    "A light-workload elective for chemistry people. Be aware that a more accurate name for the class would be Physical Organic Chemistry. The accent is placed on conformational analysis, electronic effects, hydrogen bonding, solvent effects on organic reactions, host-guest chemistry, acid-base equilibria, and, at the very end, pericyclic reaction, which are probably the closest you'll get to traditional organic chemistry (though the explanation for how they work comes from molecular orbital theory and is awesome). Prof. Jorgensen is an OK lecturer and his exams are fair, but half of the material of the class is not that interesting. Still, this is probably one of the easiest chemistry electives you can take. You should take it if you are a chemistry major.",
    "It's definitely a valuable class, but I wouldn't take it unless you are either a grad student in organic\/inorganic chemistry or are looking to become a grad student or pursue a career in chemistry. It's not particularly enjoyable and you won't find it satisfying unless you are planning to make practical use of the concepts you learn in class.",
    "Yes, I would say it's one of the better taught classes and the material is pretty understandable. Very reasonable.",
    "This class is a great class for chemistry majors to take to fulfill the 400 level requirements for the major. The workload is not terrible and you do take away some interesting information about conformational analysis, host-guest chemistry, solvent effects and pericyclic reactions to name several of the topics. It was not totally necessary to have taken PChem before this, so if someone interested in chemistry but not wanting to flounder in an upper level class, I would recommend this class to them."
