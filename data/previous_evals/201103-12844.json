   "comments": [
    "If you like reading about nature this course is for you. The reading list is top-notch (Darwin, Thoreau, Rachel Carson etc) and they aren't too long. Professor Peterson gives assigned readings and then highlights portions to focus on if you don't have time to read them all which is awesome because if you do the highlighted reading you can participate in class without having to do the full assignment which you can catch up on later.",
    "Nature Writing has been one of my favorite classes at Yale. Professor Peterson is awesome... she's incredibly nice, very engaging in class discussions, and always willing to provide feedback on essay drafts. The workload is very manageable, and the class is designed such that we can delve deeper into writers that interest us more. I also loved that we as a class were able to vote on the final book. Overall, a great experience and a must-take, even for non-English or Environmental Studies majors (I'm a premed).",
    "Nature Writing in the English Speaking World brings together a fascinating range of familiar and unfamiliar texts, which make a new kind of sense in concert. Highly recommended for anyone interested in the ways people conceptualize the natural world.That said, do some advance thinking about thekind of analysis you are used to. I think both literary types and environmental studies types can succeed in the course and learn a great deal, but it can help to consider how you may differ from the other people in discussion -- which can be slightly frustrating at times both to those accustomed to intentionally nuanced readings and those accustomed to more normative approaches.",
    "This is a great course that allows you to read some of the best nature writing texts of the last century. Take it if you love nature and reading great authors.",
    "I would WHOLEHEARTEDLY recommend english 248 to another student. It is necessary to take this course and if more people took this course, maybe they would appreciate nature more and some of our current ecological problems would not be so difficult to tackle. The readings, are not boring at all, although I went into the course thinking that they might become boring at some point, they never did. This is a great course which isn't stressful at ALL and allows you to really appreciate nature and see life in a more optimistic light.",
    "This is an excellent seminar in which you read selected works from a number of influential nature writers, as well as the entirety of some of the most well-known books in the genre. Discussions are engaging, and professor Peterson wonderful. As if these weren't reason enough, you also take a field trip to Walden Pond!",
    "I recommend this class. You have the opportunity to read some wonderful pieces, and enjoy yourself in the process.",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend this class to a fellow student. The readings are actually enjoyable, the workload is definitely manageable, and the discussions are interesting and easy to contribute to."
