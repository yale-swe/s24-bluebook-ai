   "comments": [
    "Take this class if you are a G&G major. Tectonics basically rules the world of geology. If you are not in the major, I'm not sure if you will care about tectonics.",
    "I absolutely loved this class. The small size, fun professors, and interesting material made it really enjoyable for me. And the trip to Barbados wasn't bad either. Definitely take it if you're a geo major. Definitely take it if you're not and need an awesome science credit.",
    "Global tectonics.",
    "A great class, but definitely improved if you have prior experience with geology. The trip is great, but don't forget that you're still taking a class and need to pay attention!",
    "If you want to know more about Earth and how it works, definitely a good class. It's a lot of material, but it's a light workload- short reading responses every week,a final paper- and you get a nice overview of a lot of things. Obviously some of the material is more interesting, but the professors are great, the class is a good size, and it's just a lot of fun. Plus, the trip is great. Don't take if you're only interested in going to Barbados- it's probably not worth it. But it's a nice science credit and I think a must take for any G&G majors.",
    "Good class, interesting even without the field trip (although the field trip was wonderful). Mark and Dave tend to argue about facts, but in the most good-natured way possible.",
    "Good course. I would recommend it. However, if you have not taken a geology course before this one, I would caution you to wait a year, take an intro geology course, and then take this class. I'm a science major, but as someone who took this course with zero geology background, I found it very confusing at times. While I ended up doing decently in the class, I know that I could have gotten much more out of it if I had had prior geology experience.Professors Evans and Brandon are so great! They love teaching and are good at it, which is rare in the sciences at Yale.Also, the Barbados trip is an excellent way to spend your Spring Break.",
    "Take GG 212 if you have some geology background and are genuinely interested in the material, which can be fascinating if you are willing to put in some effort. The course isn't a lot of work but you won't get anything out of it if you aren't willing to do some work beyond the graded requirements."
