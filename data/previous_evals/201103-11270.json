   "comments": [
    "Question 9: I know this isn't a field trip class but more than one opportunity to do a site visit would have been nice. To find out later that it was considered class participation to go on this trip and some, myself included, already had committments for that Friday morning isn't fair.",
    "Regarding question 3, the readings and reading commentaries were not helpful to the learning experience. I submitted reading responses because I had to, not because I was trying to learn. This is a highly ineffective learning methodology. The case exercises were challenging and the final paper was helpful to our learning (assuming you pick an issue that interests you!).",
    "My ratings apply to Marian Chertow, not Steve Ramsay. Overall, I thought Marian was very clear and organized in her lecture style, and she seems extremely knowledgable.Steve Ramsay had lectures that were not particularly informative and focused on class discussions that did not add value.It seemed like he only had a superficial knowledge of the topics he discussed, and he would declare opinions without clear evidence or justification. Also, he was condescending to students. I think the class would be stronger if he were not lecturing, or only discussed topics that he actually knows something about.",
    "I liked this course - I felt as if it was really engaging in the beginning of the semester but towards the end of the semester, I felt as if the lectures became disorganized and the professors seemed overwhelmed with their own personal workload. The case studies were really helpful at solidifying course concepts but seemed out of date. It would have been really helpful if the case studies (and readings) were updated to reflect environmental issues given recent events and trends.",
    "N\/A",
    "Question 2. The conceptual content of the class seems very cursory and it seemed like a survey class. Many of the business case examples seemed a bit out of date. The course could have been much more in-depth and could have had more a skill-building focus.",
    "Question 7: lectures were often disappointing, leaving students unclear on what they should take away or how they can apply the material in their profession.",
    "The course material was just too outdated -- it was as if the instructor hadn't updated the material in years -- examples from the 80's, 90's (disposable cameras is good example). What's too bad is that they could have been really relevant because there is a lot happening in current events pertaining to the class topics. I really hoped for current events, not the outdated stuff we got.",
    "I enjoyed this course, but wish that the class was smaller and evenly split between SOM and FES students. In addition, the course could benefit from more in-depth case studies, perhaps after reviewing a battery of case studies in the first two-weeks of school.That said, the case studies were excellent, but could be improved by diving into more skills-oriented analysis, such as financial, accounting, and ecological impact statements. At times, some of the theory felt very superficial and distracting from the real-world applicability of the course.Also, perhaps the group project could be started earlier in the semester , which would allow for more connections to industry to be established. This was one of the best parts of the course, working directly with companies to learn about their environmental dynamics and problem-solving.",
    "T.As. were very dedicated, intelligent, competent, hardworking with an appreciable farsighted vision. I shall congratulate the instructor for having such T.As. I would like to quote an incidence in which a spark was created due to some difference of opinion in a group. Before the clarifications \/ counter clarification and shifting of blame game balloon could inflate, T.A. sent a quick and nicely worded mail and it perfectly settled the issue. It also reflects the vision and style of working of Professor with the team, which really is really appreciable.",
    "Question 10: I had high expectations that this course would be central to what I want to do as a corporate environmental professional, but much of it was a review of what I already knew and much of it was so high level that it was hard to take much tangible away in terms of skills and knowledge I know I will use in my professional career.",
    "The reading material and assignments were very interesting, but I thought the class lectures could have been a bit more thought-provoking.",
    "I thought the class was interesting and tackled a huge topic. I thought it was well-run, especially considering the large class size.",
    "Marian is a lovely person and very knowledgeable, but it was clear that she hadnt taught it for ages - so many of the slides were ancient.It was a very vague wishy washy subject.Would ve been better if there'd been no reading responses (total waste of time) and more assignments.A course that offered so much delivered so little.... real shame.",

    "Exposure to some of the concepts, terms, and methods for analyzing and comparing businesses and industries. I found that business side of the class more interesting than the environmental side. Sikorsky field trip was great.",
    "It was very comprehensive, covered a lot of topics.",
    "The best thing (and for some others probably the main criticism) is the survey nature of this course. This course would be an ideal starter survey, for example, to the industrial management track, with opportunities to specialize through future courses in sustainability, CSR, or other topics in the class.In the absence of resources (or enough material for a full class) to support the above mentioned, then I think this survey could benefit from some lab or other outside-class opportunities that dig into a topic introduced in class a bit more. More on this in next answer.",

   "question_text": "The things about this course most in need of improvement are:",
   "comments": [
    "Cover less contents with more focused points.",
    "There should be an overarching team to the course, i.e. CSR doesn't exist, CSR does exist but needs work, CSR etc etc. I'm not sure of what the vision should be but there should be a point that we keep coming back to. Instead of evaluating the course at the end of the semester we should have evaulated the various policies and practices that we learned about and debated which were relevant and useful. I learned a great deal about various concepts but I would have appreciated more context. Additionally, we focused too much on BP, a BP week would have sufficed instead of always coming back to it.I would also suggest a no laptop policy for this class. I wouldn't suggest it for other classes but this was supposed to be a discussion and I often saw many checking email. This class needed an application and to sit in class and essentially waste time is an insult to those who couldn't enroll in this course. It also harmed the discussion which Marian so strongly advocated for.",
    "Some readings were based on an old book (2000 I think), and the reading commentaries add no value to the learning experience.",
    "Steve Ramsay's lectures are in need of serious improvement.Also, I think the course could still be a broad, basic survey of topics but go further in depth.I also think more guidance on the final paper would be helpful, to help students apply concepts that are unfamiliar to them (FES students apply business concepts and to help SOM students apply enviro concepts)",
    "Case studies and readings needed to be updated. In addition, I think the TAs should try to pair students up in groups so that each group has at least one FES student and one SOM student. This would help with analysis, contribute to the learning process and ensure that everyone is being graded fairly.",
    "- the case studies assigned- integrate more environmental information and make it more relevant to the environmental management",
    "- The lectures were not very engaging. I often thought to myself \"well, so what?\". Again, I think that these issues need to be looked at in more depth and more weight need to be put on how one can actually measure if a EMS is working in a corporation or not. Also, how to implement greener supply chain or better environmental risk measures would be more engaging for students. I had the feeling many students zoned out during lectures and did not do the reading.",
    "This course is very broad and does not provide in-depth understanding of specific areas of focus. Visiting lectures were not particularly helpful.",
    "It's a huge subject to teach, and as a result, we only scratched the surface on a lot of issues I would have like to explored in more depth.One concept it would have interesting to cover in more depth might be the financing side of environmental initiatives -- how to identify and quantify some of benefits of corp sustainability that sometimes go unrecognized.",
    "Updated slides and teaching material.I also think the class was way too big to be structured as it was. It straddled that strange border of lecture and discussion which was innefective.",
    "These are merely suggestions for adding to the class:1.) More experience where, as (future) environmental professionals, we face push-back to our proposals, understand how to respond to that, etc. Even if the class is largely of the same mindset, more resistance of the kind that we'd face in a professional environmental would be nice. This could be spread throughout the course and discussions that are had, or it could hit through a dedicated case exercise or presentation exercise in which someone plays the role of a C-level who needs to be convinced.2.) Adding a lab component to the class if possible (I know it would be extra work), requiring students an option of which ones they pick, might add some more depth to the class in an interesting way. For example, for the FESers, the side session on financial calculations seemed useful if formalized. For SOMers, some enviro. basics equivalent could be useful. Other topic areas for labs could include: a metrics session, health and safety, or whatever else is feasible. The idea would be a requirement within a selection (pick 3 of 5 offerings, for example), like the cases and other work offered throughout the class.",
    "Some classes were not that interesting.",
    "More practical skills training within the environmental corporate context.",
    "More field visits may be beneficial",
    "The lectures and the overall structure of the course. I wasn't a fan of using Reinhardt and Porter throughout the course as a framework, since I felt it was somewhat limiting in terms of how to approach corporate environmental issues. I also thought that the course was really missing more tangible skill-based activities and components, things like NPV\/project finance, how environmental consultants actually do their work, how to actually evaluate a facility's environmental performance, how to use different environmental evaluation tools, etc. The course I think was too high level and tried to cater to too large an audience, especially given that most of the people in the course already have some kind of environmental management experience\/background. A smaller class that can dive more deeply into concepts and tools i think would be beneficial for the fewer number of students who are actually able to enroll. I also think that better integrating the SOM and FES students who are in the class would really help - instead of students creating work groups, having the professors facilitate that, or something to that effect.Finally, I think that it was awkward that certain classes were based on assignments that only part of the class did - i think it should be restructured so that there are either fewer write-ups due overall, and the write-ups that are assigned everyone has to do, or somehow change it in another way such that everyone is doing all of the assignments for every class.",
    "This class does not delve into any of the complexities, or innovative developments in corporate environmental managements and strategy. To start, it is remarkably outdated. A majority of the examples take place in the early to mid 2000s, even though sustainability\/environmental paradigms have been completely restructured since then. In addition, this class can only be seen as a very cursory survey class, that lacks any sort of depth or intellectual stimulation around its various topics. It seems as though Professor Chertow has very limited expertise in the field.",
    "The lectures",
    "Nothing",
    "I'd like more class debate, as folks' backgrounds seemed diverse and interesting, and it might have helped to enliven some of the cases and materials (which can feel dated very quickly, due to the rapidly changing landscape out there). It seemed like people were unusually shy in the class, though.",
    "Since the final projects were the best part of the class, I wish we had more time to work on them. I would suggest scaling back on the total number of reading responses and cases so the students have more time to work on the projects.",
    "FES and SOM students should be required to work together in small groups. The lectures should assume that people have done the reading and present contradictions\/alternative points of view rather than reviewing the reading. NO LAPTOPS!"

    "Our group had very deep conversations on the subject and we became good friends.",
    "The group work was beneficial because we gathered multiple perspectives, and I worked with students outside my school, so the SOM-FES interaction was in itself beneficial. On the whole however, students stuck with their own schools, in part because FES had more students enrolled, and in part because students had no incentive to work together. Perhaps encouraging cross-school participation would be help strengthen the course's objectives.",
