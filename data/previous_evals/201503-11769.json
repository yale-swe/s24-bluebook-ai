    "The problem sets are a lot easier than the questions on the midterms, so don't think that how well you do on your problem sets is indicative of how well you're going to do in the midterms. Be prepared to devote a lot of time to reading the textbook. Most of the more complicated concepts are better explained with the examples on the book than by Udry. I would only recommend this class if you're the type of student who learns really well in lecture; otherwise, staying focused for an hour and fifteen minutes will be quite a struggle.",
    "Econ 115 was a pretty good class, although at times was not particularly interesting.",
    "Recommend.",
    "Econ 115 is about what you would expect from an introductory economics class. Huge lectures, problem sets every week, etc. Absolutely worth taking if considering whether Econ is your thing, but definitely not for everyone. I very much enjoyed the focus on Developmental Economics, and I think that makes this class unique.",
    "I had an overall negative experience in this class, as did most of my friends in the class. I know the professor is a talented teacher because in the lecture he deemed the \"hardest\" explained everything carefully and thoroughly - and this \"hardest\" lecture was the only one that I followed. I am someone who has had no expose to economics and isn't that great at math, and considering this is \"not a math class,\" half of our midterm questions asked us to derive equations that were presented as \"here's the set up you can figure the math out on your own later.\" If you are talented at following complex concepts at a rapid pace, you will be fine. If not, be warned: Khan Academy doesn't have videos on the materials for the last weeks of lecture.",
    "ECON 115 is CRAZY! It seems crazy hard because you feel underprepared for midterms (sometimes you are), but the curve will save you.",
    "I wouldn't recommend Econ 115 unless you need it for a major requirement.",
    "Introduction to basic economic theory, specifically on the micro scale.",
    "Econ 115 is a giant lecture class that many students take out of obligation because they want foundational knowledge in Economics. It isn't particularly engaging, nor is it very easy, but it's a class where you get out what you put in. Most people walk away having learned very little because, due to the large class size, the curve is often generous, even for those who rarely attend or put forth a great deal of effort.",
    "difficult and be ready to reach out for addition help because it's nearly impossible to grasp everything fully if you haven't taken economics prior to this course. I would say only take this course if you've taken an economics class in high school, as I felt many elementary topics were brushed off as insignificant when in reality they were essential to the course but not everyone had had exposure to them",
    "I would summarize it as a large lecture overview of introductory microeconomics. I would recommend it to any student who is either interested in microeconomics or has no idea what economics is about, because the course isn't too intimidating.",
    "Taking this as a senior just looking for a general econ course, it was a pretty easy class that doesn't require much work and going to class helps but definitely not required. Seems like good background info which is what I was looking for, but not sure how it compares to intro macro on that note. Weekly psets are easy and helps you stay on top of material so exams aren't too difficult.",
    "It's a necessary evil, not much you can do. It's easier curve than the section, so if you want an easy class to get to more interesting Econ, take it, it's not bad.",
    "It is a basic introductory course. My only suggestion would be most people dive into the course, thinking they have to take it. But really don't take it if you do not enjoy math, formulas, theories and most importantly, graphs...",
    "Just work hard on psets, midterms and finals are heavily curved",
    "ECON 115 is an essential course for an econ major and a good step in learning economics. I would recommend it based on these facts.",
    "I would recommend it, the material is pretty basic, and gets more interesting as the semester goes on, and the workload is fairly minimal.",
    "I would recommend taking it freshman year",
    "I would strongly recommend this course because it is well-taught and the material is relevant to our economic life. Furthermore, taking this course opens doors not just to other economics classes but also to classes in other departments that require microeconomics as a prerequisite.",
    "Good basic micro course, well paced, would recommend",
    "It's not a hard QR or So credit if you need one. I found the teaching fine and the material pretty easy. The other folks who attend the class seem to be very prototypical future econ majors, so be wary of that if you don't enjoy those kinds of people.",
    "Introductory microeconomics may not be the most exciting class at Yale--by any stretch of the imagination--but I still would argue for its importance as a \"required course\" for anyone who wants to be an engaged, informed, financially-active citizen. In other words, every student at Yale.",
    "Makes itself unnecessarily difficult by skirting the basic calculus. Do yourself a favor and have your TA break it down with calculus, and you'll be set. Had Nina Bobkova as a TA. If she still TA's, GET HER. She is fantastic. Wouldn't have understand a thing without her!",
    "This class was good! It didn't have very much work, section wasn't required, and the tests were pretty straightforward. The curve was good as well. You won't need to do calculus, so it's probably a good QR choice, and the material is actually pretty interesting once you get to risk and game theory. Go ahead and take it! Don't be scared.",
    "A must-take class for anyone who has little knowledge about economics. Even though it is an intro class, I would not recommend the class to someone who is not serious about the subject, because you would quickly fall behind.",
    "A good introduction to economics at Yale. Take it!",
    "It's hella hard and not very well explained in theoretical terms",
    "Very easy workload with more than manageable exams, especially given a generous curve.",
    "Perfect if you want to continue with Econ, otherwise, very difficult and you will dread it if you don't enjoy economics.",
    "Not necessary unless its required for your major.",
    "Lecture is the choice if you care more about your grade than learning the material",
    "Meh. Not a favorite class, but you get through it. Udry's a pretty good lecturer and a really good guy in general. To actually do well, I think you've gotta do the 'full experience', that is, supplement all the lectures by actually going to section and doing personal work...there seems to be a lot of incongruence between lectures\/sections\/exams, which is frustrating, but good to keep in mind in advance.",
    "What is taught in lectures would not match your Psets, midterms or finals.",
    "Intro to Micro is an alright class with math heavy material (in the sense of equations but just basic algebra). I would recommend the class to math and science minds since one would need to understand equations well. I understand concepts and how things relate to the bigger picture and just found myself memorizing equations and steps to do the problems without really understanding the material. Problem Sets are pretty easy and take a maximum 3 hours to complete but the tests are pretty difficult.",
    "FIND A GOOD TA. LECTURES ARE HARD TO GET THROUGH. Take it only if you have to.",
    "There is no easy answer. You might hate it, you might love it, or you might be ambivalent. I think the majority falls into the latter category.",
    "ECON115 is a necessary prerequisite course for economics courses. You really get out of it what you put in. Don't feel like you have to take this course if you don't want to. I definitely recommend keeping up with the textbook reading each week.",
    "It is a solid intro class, but you have to have the discipline to pay attention and self-study if necessary. You get out what you put in.",
    "I would not recommend it as a course if it remains the same. With some changes to the teaching and examination approach, the course could be made better, and the material more accessible.",
    "To all you strong STEM students thinking about taking this course, you will find this class to be a walk in the park and a very manageable 5th course. The math and graphing in this course is the most difficult part for the majority of the class, and because it is difficult for most people the class isn't too heavy on magnitude of material to worry about.",
    "Great class if you can handle lectures with hundreds of people.",
    "Very dull course, but a solid introduction to econ. Expect annoying grading on the midterms, which are doable, and make sure to study hard for the final.",
    "A solid introduction to microeconomics. Prof Udry is a very good lecturer and can explain things very well. The psets were very reasonable and the tests were slightly harder. Sometimes, when they avoid using calculus, it makes the math in the course slightly harder to understand. However, there are some TAs that will generally use calculus which will help clear things up. In general, economics is something that is useful to know, even on the introductory level.",
    "If you are someone who is trying to figure out if you want to be an Econ major or not, definitely take this course. Although I struggled a lot, I learned a lot of practical topics that I will use in everyday life. However, if you do not have any Econ background, I recommend taking this course Credit\/D\/Fail because you will be able to learn the material without having to stress about the grades. With no Econ background, you will definitely struggle at the beginning, but with hard work, you will be able to do well in the end.",
    "I would recommend this course but I would make sure that students understand what they are getting into. The course is not easy and there is a lot of complicated material. It is very important to pay attention to the lectures. While the curve is very good the course still requires a lot of work and a lot of time spent on the problem sets. While difficult and often tedious, the material is useful and I think I will apply it to many other courses.",
    "ECON 115 is a requirement for a lot of majors, so you probably have to take it. I'd recommend that anyone taking this class should join study groups ASAP. Don't try to take this coursework solo - it's too hard\/confusing.",
    "Don't feel pressured to take it because \"everyone takes econ\". I know a lot of people that took it for that reason and hated it.",
    "Necessary to take to understand the basics.",
    "Udry was unbelievably dry and often hard to follow. I had better luck learning the material by printing out his slides and going over them myself. He's not all bad, however; the slides are incredibly well put together and the midterms, finals, and problem sets were very fair. The material is interesting if economics is your thing. If you don't know if it is, its worth a shot.",
    "a regular introductory lecture, attendence is checked through an online question system",
    "Introduction to major microeconomic concepts, including supply and demand, market failures, perfect competition and monopoly, and insurance. Clearly a necessary class to take if you're pursuing an Econ major, but I think it's also worthwhile to take if you haven't taken Econ in high school and want to learn about how to approach problems from a cost-benefit, economic perspective.",
    "I would recommend ECON 115 to any student who wants an introduction to microeconomic principles or any student who wants to take any further econ classes (it is a prerequisite). The problem sets are perfectly manageable if you pay attention in class.",
    "I personally enjoyed the class and the material quite a lot, though a plurality of other students didn't seem to like it very much. There's a lot more math than I think most of us experienced in high school microeconomics, and that could be unenjoyable for a lot of people. Overall, though, the workload is relatively light and the curve is *very* good, so I'd recommend it to anyone who's thinking of taking it.",
    "If you're a prospective econ major, you have to take this class. It provides a good foundation for intermediate Micro, and it covers many topics that high school AP Micro does not. If you were placed into intermediate and are afraid this class will be the same as high school, you will be surprised to see how much more there is to learn. However, this is an intro level course so the material is pretty straightforward, and the lectures are not very exciting.",
    "A good course to understand the basics of economics and a course everyone should take to inform them a bit more about the economy around us.",
    "Econ 115 is just a basic intro course. It won't knock your socks off, but it is a solid class.",
    "Good class overall. The experience in section really depends on your T.A. Prof Udry is a great lecturer, but it was not always easy to apply what you learnt in lecture to exercises, especially during exams. Necessary intro course.",
    "Intro Micro with Udry is a totally fine intro micro class. It's nothing special, but if you have to take it, I'd recommend Udry - he's a good teacher, and seems happy to be teaching the class. You just have to find a good TA - because Udry explains big concepts, but the TA's explain how to actually do the psets and exams. The exams definitely aren't easy - but there are practice problems, and the tests are really curved, so if you'll study, you'll be fine. So find a good TA, go to lecture with Udry, and you'll be totally fine.",
    "Econ 115 was a fine introductory economics course. The exams were slightly harder than expected but the workload was not too intense. the subject matter was not particularly engaging but it wasn't completely boring either and it was a fine necessary introduction to economics. I would recommend everyone take this course at some point, not because it was particularly amazing but because economics is a good foundational life skill to have.",
    "It is a fast paced introduction which you just have to take to continue on in your major. While it is not very interesting, the secondary economics classes will get better. I would recommend it to others who just want to get a knowledge of economics since it is the only class available for that.",
    "No I would not. It was a really tough course, especially if you had not taken an economics course before. The course was particularly unfair with Udry, so if there's another professor it might be better.",
    "I would recommend students to take the class only if they will end up needing it for a major.",
    "I would recommend ECON 115 if you're looking for a QR credit that won't eat up all of your time, but be prepared to be around a lot of economics people for a good portion of your week (lectures, section, and problem sets) -- whether this is a good thing or a bad thing will depend on the student. Professor Udry is funny, knowledgeable, and enthusiastic, and makes 115 as good as it can be, although I'm not sure that is saying much. While I was not very fond of this class throughout the semester, I was legitimately sad on the last day of lecture when a collective sigh of relief echoed through the Law School Auditorium.",
    "I would recommend the class because you kind of have to take it as an intro micro class but I would definitely tell the student to teach themselves everything and to be committed to spending time reviewing it all on your own.",
    "I would only recommend this course to students who are required to take it. If you can spare yourself the evil that is Econ115 then do not take this course.",
    "As the class stands today, I would not recommend this course to other students. I found myself confused, frustrated, and unhappy in both lecture and section, finding the latter almost always unhelpful. That being said, I think simple tweaks like ensuring better quality of sections and exam reviews that focus more on what the students need will greatly improve the course. The strength of the course in my opinion is the interesting subject matter, which speaks to its large size and interest among freshmen especially. I can attest that future students will lose interest in economics as a discipline if the standard of sections are not improved.",
    "If you're new to econ and you're curious about economics, I would actually say to skip this class, but if you're very sure you want to take introductory microeconomics, take this over lecture just for the nicer curve. The seminar will mostly be students with a strong econ background. This class is not great, but it will teach you some interesting concepts and may alter how you think about other, non-economic topics.",
    "Essential overview to important concepts in Microeconomics, will arm you with the tools to go into more depth. Each concept could have been more clearly presented and more real life applications of economics should have been introduced to highlight the significance and relevance of this field though.",
    "Econ 115 is what you make of it. If you plan on going in without any previous class, like I did, you really have to be prepared to put in the work. When Professor Udry says you can take the class based on the lectures\/without reading the textbook, he is probably speaking to the people who have already taken AP Micro\/Macro. Be prepared to be very committed to the class.",
    "A pretty standard, not incredibly difficult class. Stick with it, the curve is great and the final is easy. I'd take it again, but probably not until sophomore year because I don't plan on majoring in Econ. You don't need the textbook, I opened it maybe three times. Very very little work except for exam studying and weekly PSETs that take between an hour and two hours.",
    "ECON 115 is a solid introductory Microeconomics course. I would recommend this class to those who are even just slightly considering majoring in economics or just interested in learning more about the theories behind real world economics, however I would keep in mind that you shouldn't rule out the major by just this class as there are definitely more interesting and applicable higher econ classes after this one. There is a pretty nice curve to the two midterms and finals that will generally work in your favor.",
    "I would tell students not to take this class as it was largely a waste of time and stress.",
    "I would recommend this course to anybody who wants to take higher level econ courses and needs an intro to microeconomics. I would also recommend this to anybody who wants to have a basic understanding of the economic principles that govern the world.",
    "Its a good class to get the basics of economics. Its a bit dry in terms of the lectures but overall worth the time.",
    "I would recommend this course only if you are really passionate about microeconomics. The material is tough, and a lot of time will be spent on absorbing and practicing for the exams. Motivation to do well is crucial, and a lot of hard work and determination is needed. This course was a great introduction to microeconomics. However, I would recommend a bit of previous experience with microeconomics before taking this course.",
    "While I didn't really get all that I feel I could have gotten out of ECON 115 had I really prioritized it over my other classes, the course is a solid introduction to economics at Yale. I don't plan on being an economics major, but I still feel as if I gained something from taking the course, despite the difficulty I may have had in really keeping up. Do not treat it as a breeze-through class -- it will take regular attention and review if you're going to get the most out of it.",
    "Introduction to Microeconomics is a great class to take because it teaches economic basics that would benefit anyone for the rest of their lives. Sometimes, the material can get dry, and I think most people did not expect as math as there was. Calculus is technically not required but definitely helpful. The exams were overall fair. Udry can keep your attention during lecture if you focus, but it is definitely easy to doze off in class. Like any lecture class, it all depends on how much extra work you put into it outside of lectures. For most people with no economics experience, this course is challenging. The workload is very manageable. TA quality varies dramatically, so section is often a hit or miss, depending on the TA.",
    "yes but only for a major",
    "I did not enjoy the class at all. Udry was extremely boring and unorganized. Definitely get Ahsan as your TA he is amazing.",
    "Huge lecture class. A lot of self learning.",
    "In the course you learn about individuals and firms and why their actions in the marketplace are made using mathematical models and reasoning. I would recommend this course to students interested in economics or even curious about the subject. Try it out and you may surprise yourself like I did and enjoy it very much. If you don't like it then drop it and don't waste your time. You will likely be bored and tired at every lecture. This is time better spent learning something else.",
    "Econ 115 is a good introduction to microeconomics and provides a solid basis for future study. I would recommend it to another student because it helps students to learn the thought process involved in economics and is necessary for higher levels.",
    "Econ 115 was harder than anticipated, especially coming in with no background in economics whatsoever. The exams were particularly challenging and I did not find the professor engaging in lecture.",
    "Great fun, and gives you a bunch of interesting and practical tools to decode all forms of business, both low-stakes and high-stakes. Problem sets took around 3 hours every week, and Prof. Udry is an inspirational lecturer. Definitely take it.",
    "Great intro class",
    "A great influence on the decision for a major.",
    "I think that I would advise someone to take the smaller classroom econ section rather than 115 because I think that those individuals came out of the class with a better understanding of microeconomics, and I think that they will be able to master intermediate better.",
    "Basic intro econ. 2 midterms, and final, and weekly psets (no required section!) Udry is pretty good at explaining things, and leaves time to take questions in lecture. The psets were never too hard, each one took an hour or two, but the exams were super hard and tested extensions of the material that we never came close to learning. The curve is pretty good, so don't worry if you get a 70 on the midterm. Redoing the psets helps as studying, reading the textbook does not. You probably don't even need the textbook, just buy like \"micro econ for dummies\" and you'll be fine. There are probably easier QRs, but it wasn't bad (I took calculus in high school but don't really remember it).",
    "Pretty straightforward, especially if you have had any exposure to AP Micro or Macro.",
    "Definitely an important class to take to achieve basic economic literacy.",
    "ECON 115 was an okay course. Udry is a good professor, but his explanations are often convoluted and unnecessarily complicated. He needs to provide more examples on how to problem solve because he only provides students with vague formulas and no examples of implementation. The course isn't too much work, and the exams are pretty fair. The problem sets are fair as well and take about 1.5 hours a week. I would only recommend the class if you are interested in economics or want to major in econ. The class can be boring and repetitive at times.",
    "A general introduction to microeconomics, centered mostly around the concepts of supply and demand and how the relationship between the two changes in different types of markets",
    "Econ 115 is really what it sounds like: an intro to microeconomics, without calculus (this can get in the way sometimes, which was frustrating). It's not a bad class, not a good one; it really just kind of is. It's not too hard either, but do not get behind, or the exams will not be a fun time.",
    "A necessary evil - Udry's def the best instructor to get you through it, if only for his shirts. But seriously, he presents information well. Def the kind of class I found lecture to be wholly unnecessary because it requires self-study anyway to understand the concepts. Ahsan Barkatullah was THE BEST TF ever, broke down all the material effectively in class, emailed material notes, homework guidance (NOT answers but Psets are managable even without these), graded quickly, great humor, perfect in every way as a dude who went through a consulting\/IB sprint and is now in law school. Exams are tough AF, the curve is in your favor though.",
    "If you want to work at Goldman Sachs, you have to get an A in this course.",
    "Be sure to read the textbook, and learn the material yourself. That's the key to success in this class.",
    "Good intro class, a staple course at Yale,",
    "Take it if you want to be an econ major. Not a hard class.",
    "ECON 115 is a good class for those who want an overview of introductory microeconomics. It is a large lecture with little personal interaction during lectures. There is not much homework - but more self-studying. The material is not extremely difficult but also not easy. Lectures move at a quick pace. I would recommend this only for those who might go into economics or those who want to see what micro is all about.",
    "As a non-math\/Econ person, this class was difficult for me. I recommend taking notes from the textbook and utilizing yale's free tutors.",
    "An easy intro course, especially for those with previous experience with microeconomics, but certainly not the same class as AP Micro.",
    "Big lecture class that is very easy to do well in if you show up and put in a decent amount of effort.",
    "If you are interested in economics and are willing to put in the effort to learn the material on your own, this is a class that can teach you the basics of microeconomics.",
    "Take the class if you want to be an econ major, otherwise it is a decent class that is worth taking for exposure to economics.",
    "ABSOLUTELY get Ahsan as your TF - he genuinely cares about his students and will make supplementary review material and sessions available to you.",
    "Econ 115 is a good introductory course to economics. I would not recommend taking it without any calculus experience. I would also highly suggest attending section during the week to learn the material outside of the lecture class.",
    "Ambitious class that covers a lot of material. It might be difficult for people who are not naturally good at math\/science--I even saw my STEM friends struggling a bit with the material. There is a generous curve, though, so don't stress too much. Look at the book and keep up with the material! Also--know which TA's are actually doing their jobs correctly, and switch into their sections.",
    "It is a simple introductory course to economics that is kind of boring because of the lecture format but necessary.",
    "It's a pretty difficult course due to the nature of the subject. However, the grade in the end pretty much reflects your own effort. The professor and TFs are there to help but the onus is on yourself to reach out and want to do well. Overall, one should do fine if attentive and resourceful.",
    "Econ 115 is a great introduction to economics. You go over market structures and a lot of interesting topics such as insurance and present value.",
    "This class is not difficult if you just pay attention in lecture and section. The biggest challenge is definitely maintaining focus. It is definitely useful and has plenty of application. Worth taking, but have a group of friends to help you study."
