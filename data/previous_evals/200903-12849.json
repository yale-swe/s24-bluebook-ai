   "comments": [
    "most valuable aspect was the exposition to highly selected cultural stimuli and unique critical sensibility. Least valuable was the pressure due to public pinups on a weekly basis, and the difficulty in creating a seamless workflow throughout the semester. critiques were too often too destructive",
    "I think more group discussions on the conceptual issues of the studio and their potential could have been helpful \u0096 not just at the beginning of the studio but also as the studio progressed. I know that these discussions happened throughout the semester, but at a certain point, I think time set aside to discuss things would have been beneficial. Sometimes, discussions were avoided out of the hesitation that they could set back design progress in the studio \u0096 but I think we overlooked some important issues, specifically discussions about the larger process\/intentions\/possibilites of the studio \u0096 is it productive, is it working? Is it helping people understand the city or issues or history? I think a lot of the problematics of the task and the studio would have come out earlier.",
    "The two most valuable aspects of the studio were the final review, with excellent crits, and the trip to Venice, with the guide of Pier Vittorio Aureli. The exposure to these professors opened lots of excellent discussions.",
    "The weekly pin-ups with Peter, Michael, and the other teams to discuss the work was a very challenging but valuable aspect of the studio. However, I think that had there been a stronger continuity between the development of the projects from week to week, the pinups would've been more successful.As an advanced studio, the emphasis was on the independence of the partner teams to develop their ideas bolstered with the weekly criticism. However, more intimate sessions with Peter + Michael in a less formal setup than the pin-up at a few select points in the semester would have helped as a way to review working method, process, what is working, what isn't, etc.",
    "Weekly pin-ups were incredibly intense and valuable, but it would have been beneficial for us to have one-on-one time with Peter, perhaps in the form of an occasional desk crit."

   "comments": [
    "Personally, I think it was a mistake to boil down the rhetorical impact of Cornaro to the 3 sets of dichotomies. I think had more time been spent on a sort of symbolic analysis of Cornaro, coupled with symbolic drawings as provocations for the project, perhaps more of the results would have been successful.I don\u0092t think that the lack of a site or a program was necessarily the problem of the studio, but I think on top of all the other factors, it didn\u0092t help. It became quite clear at a certain point that the only acceptable sites were those with some form of pre-existing historical symbolism \u0096 ie that a symbolic program could not be created ex novo in a city, or with a meaning ex novo. This is hugely important, pedagogically, and should have been more clearly articulated and discussed from the outset. I think this is why all of the projects in the studio reverted to some known form of grammar or style, be it Russian Suprematism, Palladianism, or Eisenmanism.",
    "The main strength of the studioas a pedagogical tool was the quality and quantity of theoretical debate, which happened every week.The main weakness, the debility of Cornaro's project. Also, the lack of site and program distracted a lot of energy.",
    "The studio's pedagogy was relatively weak this year, but proved a very engaging studio nonetheless. As was discussed at the final review, the decision to not preface a site OR a program at the outset was a mistake. Speculating now in retrospect, to have been given a program of some sort- or arrived at one as a studio early, would have been a productive change. As students, we were aware of the reasons behind this open-ended approach, but it led to a lack of structure to our pursuits from week to week. The most detrimental effect of this relative lack of structure was the struggle for the teams to feel full confidence in their chosen approach from week to week. This is a critical problem, as it leads to an overall compromising of the discussion(s) being held both at the pinups, between partners, and between the students in the studio regarding one another's approach.",
    "As a pedagogical tool that is in line with Eisenman's own work, the studio was outstanding. Although it may not necessarily deal with certain contemporary issues that are at play in other studios, it was by far the most valuable and exciting studio I have ever taken."

   "question_text": "What were your expectations for this studio and how well were they met?",
   "comments": [
    "I had high expectations for this studio, and low expectations from myself taking this studio. In teh beginning, I did not have the theoretical background to support a project the way this studio required. ultimately, i think the studio proved better than I thought pedagogically, in terms of motivation and input and teaching methodology. I expected it to be a hard experience, and it actually was, but in a positive way.",
    "The studio successfully met all of my expectations, which were for it to be the hardest studio I\u0092ve taken here at Yale, to challenge me, to present a difficult architectural and intellectual task, and to be a great struggle.",
    "I expected to learn the critical approach to a project that Prof. Eisenman teaches. The expectations were met well.",
    "My expectations were to experience a challenging and intellectually rigorous exploration of Peter Eisenman's current discourse in the form of a design process\/proposition. I felt that the seminars we have taken under professor Eisenman would also be relevant to the progress of the studio, which they were. I would say that the studio proved overall a less rigorous design exercise than I expected, mostly to do with the chosen prompt for the project(s). I also expected more pointed criticism from week to week both good and bad, expressing a greater sensibility towards what types of results which might come out of a more successful approach. This was not present until very late in the semester. However, dedication of prof. Eisenman to the teams from week to week exceeded my expectations.On another note, the I expected the partnership requirement of the studio to be an extremely challenging, but also beneficial component. This proved to be true. Ultimately, perhaps due to the difficulty of the studio, I felt both the process and final product coming out of the dynamic between my partner and I was not as successful as I would have liked. That said, the strength of the group as a whole resulted in very high expectations on my part for the studio as a whole."

   "question_text": "Discuss the main strengths and weaknesses of your Studio Head and if there was one, the Assistant Teacher.",
   "comments": [
    "Peter Eisenman: extreme competence on theoretical, historical and academical terms. Great availability. Bizarre taching methodology, and excessive personal implications and psychological pressure for the students. But this is a feature of the studio, take it or leave it.Michael Wang: well prepared about studio subjects and related fields. devoted to the studio and largely available. Not really helpful in the pragamatics of the project.",
    "My greatest disappoint with the studio was Peter\u0092s seeming inability, or unwillingness, to effectively teach about the use of grammar in any concrete way. I have never taken a studio here at Yale where the critic was either able or interested in close reading a plan, to discuss the manipulations or choices of grammar and what it means for architecture\u0092s ability to talk about itself. It is one thing to have abstract discussions about grammar and rhetoric, or what not, but it is totally another thing to be able to help students in a more pragmatic use of architectural grammar and the implications of its meanings.Michael is obviously an incredibly intelligent guy, who was engaged in the material and in our projects. I think it would be better, however, to have someone with more design experience in the studio setting. It seemed that often he was unwilling to offer any concrete criticism that perhaps Peter would have disagreed with.",
    "The main strength of Prof. Eisenman is his mastery of his subject and his sharp critical view of the projects. However, he was sometimes not too receptive to student ideas.Michael Wang was a dedicated TA, but the studio might benefit if he has a stronger and more active position -specially during the monday desk-crits.",
    "Professor Eisenman's strengths and weaknesses hardly require elaboration. In this studio in particular, while he did make effort to express when he felt positive progress and\/or alarm, he did not alter any of the proceedings of the studio in an effort to re-focus. I think we would have all benefited from a session or two of more informal discussion, similiar to that after the final review, between the students and Peter. As for stengths, the discussion and discourse between the students and Peter, focused around criticism of process from week to week, was an profound learning experience for most involved, including myself.",
    "The Assistant Teacher was effective, but sometimes it felt as though he was disengaged with our work. Mostly, however, he was very receptive and helpful in furthering the strength of our projects."
