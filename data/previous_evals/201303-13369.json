   "comments": [
    "It is an overview of sociological theories - very useful for a foundational understanding although those who have not taken any sociology before may feel a bit lost at times. I would recommend this course because it was inclusive of both the classical work as well as modern theories. Assignments are appropriate and valuable.",
    "The course is a required course.",
    "I would certainly recommend this course to another student.",
    "I would recommend the class.",
    "Unfortunately, I would not recommend this course to a student who was not required to take it. With students at an intro and a higher level, the course seemed poorly designed for either of their needs, and was often a frustrating experience, without leaving me with the feeling that I really learned the material--though it is definitely important material to learn, andI understanding why sociological theory would be required. I think this is an issue for the sociology department to consider, not a reflection on the individual professor who taught this year.",
    "I would recommend this class.",
    "This is a course that helps to get an understanding of major theoretical debates and about the normative and practical value of social theory for sociology as a working discipline. It is meant to show that we always draw on theory if we try to understand a problem or phenomenon in the social world, which is a crucial insight that requires a lot of time and variation to be understood.I would recommend it because it is foundational for thinking about one's own topic and its theoretical implications, for understanding the work of others better, and for developing one's interests."

   "comments": [
    "Great contribution to my theoretical knowledge base! Will be extremely helpful for the theory portion of my dissertation.",
    "It deepened my knowledge of the discipline by introducing me to key theorists in the discipline.",
    "One of the benefits of taking this course is that it helps one discover where within the theoretical paradigm one's own thinking and research problems are situated. Being able to identify where a particular research problem fits within the larger discipline is important to critiquing articles as well as developing one's own research, especially in terms of identifying how a research question relates to the broader canon. This course is indispensable to that endeavor.",
    "Theory is not my specialty, though I have gotten involved with more meso-level theory and would like to be confident in utilizing theory if I so desire. However, I don't feel confident working most of the theory into work I would do in the future, based on what we got out of the class, and I had trouble seeing and making connections between my work and the canon.",
    "This course helped me to understand some of the major theoretical debates in American sociology (as different from European social theory).",
    "It is a must course and it establishes firm groundwork."
