   "comments": [
    "In this course, I learned a lot about diplomatic relations throughout history. I learned about what factors motivate countries in their foreign affairs, how alliances work, how domestic politics play into foreign relations, and how people study foreign affairs.",
    "This was an absolutely wonderful class; however, it was very intensive. You develop a true understanding of negotiations and the dynamics of international relations on the broader to the more myopic\/individual scale.",
    "I found the course extremely interesting. I gained valuable insight as to what international expectations motivate countries towards either war or peaceful diplomacy. The course helped me to acquire a greater understanding of what nation states hope to accomplish through diplomacy and why they decide to project certain images and signals to help forward their own security and self-interests."

   "comments": [
    "This course is pretty darn good as it is; however, the amount of reading tended to be overwhelming and I could not always get through all of it.",
    "Without a doubt, I found the greatest strength to be the instructor. Professor Robert Trager. The class structure flowed smoothly and the reading material was well thought out, informative, and interesting. I enjoyed the course immensely. The only recommendation I would give to improve the course learning experience would be to offer more clarity during the semester concerning what is expected in written assignments. Perhaps this could be achieved by commenting on the weekly responses in regards to what is to be expected in the written assignments. I personally found the freedom to comment on the weekly readings through different methods liberating, but thought the rubric was different for the paper assignment expectations. This in no way diminished my high opinion for the quality and satisfaction with the course, and is only a recommendation for future improvement."

   "comments": [
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. It is extremely interesting; you basically spend the year looking at different theories about aspects of diplomacy, and looking at how well they resolve certain empirical and theoretical 'puzzles'. There are a lot of readings, but it is worth it to do them because they are from a variety of sources, ages, and opinions (not to mention participation is 20% of your grade)",
    "Yes. This course was very interesting, and the readings take you through a broad array of diplomatic topics. However, if you haven't taken global affairs courses before, this shouldn't be your first.",
    "I would recommend this course to a student that is not afraid to participate in class discussions. This course requires a lot of interaction and debate as ideas and theories are picked apart in an effort to validate or crush its applicability.",
    "I highly recommend this course to other students. Professor Trager is an excellent instructor and the subject matter is fascinating. In the end, you will gain a much greater ability to understand the motivations of nation states and world leaders in regards to their decisions to use peaceful diplomacy, military conflict, and the various combinations of methods in between."
