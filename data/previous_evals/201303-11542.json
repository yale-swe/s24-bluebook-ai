    "I don't think Professor LaPalombara is planning on teaching the class again, but if he does, you should definitely take it. He has really great stories and knows a lot about global firms. This is probably one of the more practical and informative classes that you'll take at Yale, especially if you're planning on going into business after graduation.",
    "HIGHLY RECOMMEND. It's a mix of articles and case studies, focusing on challenges to international business today. You learn about politics, FDI, economics, etc.",
    "I would say that this class is a good introduction to foreign direct investment and international trade and multinational corporations.",
    "Take it if it's still offered. Then you will think all other seminars on the dynamics between politics and markets are...",
    "If Professor LaPalombara decides to teach this course again definitely take it! Very reasonable workload and relevant material.",
    "This class is well structured, practical and engaging. If you want to think critically about FDI in practice and what it has to contribute to global development economically, ethically and culturally, take this class.",
    "Easily one of the best courses I've taken at Yale. The professor offers such a wealth of knowledge from being incredibly distinguished and familiar with his academic field as well as from having very interesting and diverse life experiences. I looked forward to class every week, and while it was a seminar, I know that the students all wished he would spend more time speaking himself, because so much was learned. The readings and topics were very well chosen, spanning a broad spectrum of FDI-related issues (i.e. from poverty and development to managerial corruption to national legislation). The course packet included several HBS business cases and the like, and brought up very interesting case scenarios that allowed students to apply theory and conjectures brought up by the various authors in the course readings. There was one group project - students were split up into groups of 3-4 to present a week's case and readings - which was very effective. Overall, cannot recommend this class enough, though unfortunately, it appears to be the last time it will be taught.",
    "This class is an eye-opening course that will give you new appreciation for the complexity and difficulty of global business. After the first few weeks of Professor LaPalombara's lectures, the class is largely a student-presentation-and-discussion based seminar, which makes for an interesting class dynamic. I think the danger of this class is that you come out of it with less surety about the material that you'd like, but that's a result of the complexity of the material itself. If you're interested in international business and the growing interaction between business and government, then this class might be for you. Professor LaPalombara is fantastic, and I'm very glad I took it.",
    "Great class if you're interested in learning about multinational corporations and business.",
    "If would definitely recommend this course. If you're interested in developing countries and\/or multinational corporations this class is terrific - 1) Professor LaPalombara has been teaching it for years and has years of real-world experience, 2) he chooses a really great group of students, 3) the readings and case studies are really interesting. For the first few weeks, LaP lectures on the fundamentals about how multinationals and governments think about foreign investment decisions. The rest of the semester is then a series of case studies: a group of students use the background of a case to teach the rest of the class, then the class divides up into small discussion groups. The class is large enough that the discussion groups are better than a large discussion would be.Take this class. It's worth it! That being said, consider taking the class Credit D. The short responses are difficult and LaP is a tough grader.",
    "A broad scanning of the relationship between foreign firms and national governments, nothing to deep, but the readings are interesting, despite being quite repetitive at times."
