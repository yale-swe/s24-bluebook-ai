    "I would recommend it, Wan Tang is an amazing teacher.",
    "Languages at Yale move at an incredibly fast pace. Be prepared to cover one year of High School Spanish in less than one semester. If you have a background in Spanish you will do fine.",
    "Yes! Definitely would recommend SPAN110 to other students. However, if you have taken Spanish before, it might be too easy\/boring.",
    "If you've taken a little bit of Spanish before then I recommend it.",
    "I would recommend this course. I would recommend planning your selection for class period at a plausible time (it meets every day).",
    "I would definitely recommend Spanish because it's a useful language and you learn it very quickly at Yale. It's a lot of work and to be honest one of the more intensive languages here but it's definitely fun with a good professor.",
    "I would recommend this class to a student that has some previous experience in Spanish. It moves quickly so if you have no previous experience, be prepared to put a lot of time into it.",
    "Take this class. It's an excellent intro language course, though the pace is pretty much set in stone since it's such a large class. Spanish is so important to know in America, you might as well learn it now, at Yale.",
    "Spanish 110 03 was a good class, and I definitely learned a lot. It was a lot of work, but all languages are. This class would be hard if you haven't taken any Spanish at all, however Professor Tang is a good teacher, and will make sure you are prepared. Take this class if you like Spanish, but be prepared for a lot of work because this class isn't easy.",
    "It's fast and you learn a lot, but it's not overwhelming. I would definitely recommend it.",
    "Generally, the Spanish 1 course at Yale is pretty good, as you might expect. So I'll talk about the prof.Wan Tang is an excellent professor. Seriously, take the class with her. She is extremely organized, always knows what needs to be explained more, and is really friendly and funny. This personality stuff is really helpful in a Spanish 1 teacher, when you spend a very long time talking about the weather and your siblings and things that are not that cerebral. And this is a minor side note, but she is also SO STYLISH! But also she is just a very good teacher, in that I learned a lot.She is not a native speaker, so if you really want that you should choose someone else.",
    "I would recommend Spanish 110 to any student wishing to learn Spanish for the first time or a student who does not feel comfortable with the high school Spanish they have acquired."
