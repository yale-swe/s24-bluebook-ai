    "Great Econ senior seminar for going into detail about financial stability.",
    "Understanding the importance of financial stability in a broader economic policy context. Plenty of scope to develop your own interests through the presentation and research paper.",
    "This is the perfect course to teach you about the importance of financial stability, especially following the Financial Crisis. You get to learn from an expert in her field on what is currently done to regulate banks and how to mitigate future potential crises.",
    "great course. really take a way a lot about financial stability and the interconnected banking world",
    "I learned the basics of banking, banking capital, and macroprudential policy.",
    "This course was a comprehensive insight into the nature of banking crises (in different contexts), as well as the importance of macroprudential policy and other measures for financial stability. I learned a lot about the current state of global financial stability and how different crises illuminate the gaps in this infrastructure.",
    "One of the very few \"finance\"\/\"banking\" classes offered and it definitely provided a good overview of several relevant topics.",
    "Throughout this course, I learned greatly about ways in which financial stability can be achieved through macroprudential tools.",
    "Why and how banks fail"

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Lectures and slides were very helpful. Student presentations were a good way to incorporate student participation and break up the class time.",
    "The strengths are that it only involves one student presentation, a paper, and a final exam! In addition, you get to learn a lot of important macroprudential skills that would be useful for any career in finance or consulting. In addition, the course is fairly flexible and you can do your presentation on any topic you find interesting within the realms of financial stability or banking.",
    "Prof. Sigga is a great strength - her knowledge on the subject is immense and she is incredible at explaining and teaching complex ideas to her students",
    "no weaknesses. enjoed every seminar. made me want to attend a 9:25 am seminar on mondays.",
    "Full of information and I learned a lot. Very lecture driven which I didnt love for a seminar.",
    "This is a fantastic course--Sigga's teaching style is amazing and is effective in breaking down complex, technical details into something more digestible. The readings are interesting and the courseload is not too intense, but you still learn a lot from the course.",
    "Strengths: Sigga's \"leminar\" style keeps class engaging and interesting. Obviously, Sigga is knowledgeable and has so much knowledge and experience to share. Weaknesses: a bit harder to keep up in class without prior banking\/finance knowledge\/experience (quick review of the important vocabulary for each lecture beforehand could be useful)",
    "Class was absolutely excellent and the professor was always available for extra help!"
