    "Core courses, though a little hard.",

    "I will recommend it to other students, because it combined theory and application in separation process.",
    "Yes. It is extremely helpful for chemical engineering.",
    "Fast-paced overview of current and emerging separation processes. I would absolutely recommend to any student since it is a very approachable overview of the field without requiring any specialization or even a Chem Eng degree."
