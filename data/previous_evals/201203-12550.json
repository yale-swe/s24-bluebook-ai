    "I would definitely recommend MATH 112. It is not that much work or that difficult. Also Professor Zuckerman is fantastic.",
    "Math 112 was a good, manageable calculus course for someone who has taken calc before. I took Calculus in high school but didn't feel ready to take Calc 2 (Math 115). It seemed many other people in my class had previous experience with Calc as well. The class was still challenging for me, but I felt comfortable because I was familiar with most of the concept. I would recommend this course to someone who has taken Calc in HS but felt a little shaky and uncomfortable.",
    "Yes I would recommend it to another student. Although, I would warn them that it is a very systematic and not incredibly interesting course, unless you are a lover of calculus, which I am not.",
    "Definitely a challenging course but if you've already taken calculus you should be okay. If you haven't, maybe a different course might be the wiser decision.",
    "Good introduction calc course. Helpful if you don't remember much from high school calc.",
    "Basic introductory calculus. Yes because it is an introductory class.",
    "Yes fairly easy if you do the homework thoroughly",
    "Math 112 is basic calculus course, covering some precalculus and most of high school AB Calculus. However, it moves at a much faster pace and addresses applications of differentiation with more depth. I would recommend Math 112 to any student that needs a thorough review of calculus or a fundamental foundation for continued study of math. It might seem easy at times, but the course's comprehensive nature makes it occasionally demanding."
