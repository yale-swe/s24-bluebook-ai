    "Take it.",
    "Great change of pace...learned a ton and had a lot of fun drawing inside and outside during class",
    "I would say you don't need any experience already. As long as you try hard and improve, it is very rewarding. I would definitely recommend it to anyone. Especially to people with no experience as well.",
    "This class teaches you introductory drawing techniques through the exploration of different media (pencils, charcoal, ink) and subjects (figures, still-life, landscape). I would definitely recommend Basic Drawing to anyone interested in taking an art class, no matter how much background experience you have with it. Even if you do not plan on drawing in the future,the class teaches you to look at things in a new way, which I think is a helpful skill to have. It is also relaxing to just take a break form the rest of your work and draw for an afternoon.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone who is interested in drawing. You do not need to know how to draw because you are usually evaluated by your own efforts. If you are not an art major IO suggest you do it credit\/D and then switch over if you feel confident you will make a satisfying grade.",
    "Basic drawing is a great class, and I would definitely recommend it.",
    "You learn techniques for drawing accurately such as measuring angles and proportions, gesture drawings, and doing multiple short sketches. I would definitely recommend this class to anyone. You improve so much by the end using the techniques and using quality materials (we did charcoal and ink), and you learn a bit about how to critique art and art history. Each week you do one drawing, on Mondays the whole class hangs up their drawing and on Wednesdays you draw in class, usually still lifes. I enjoyed this combination a lot though sometimes I felt fatigued after 2 hours of class. Caution: the drawings take a lot of time and buying the materials can be expensive.",
    "Art 114 is a great introduction to drawing that progresses from negative space to exteriors, interiors, the human bodies, and also delves into self portraiture. I would definitely recommend this class, but not for someone who wants an easy fifth class - it is a full workload and the assignments are often time consuming.",
    "I would definitely recommend it. Even if you are just beginning to draw it is a fun but informative class. Also for those that have been drawing for a while, like me, it gives you a chance to hone your skills."
