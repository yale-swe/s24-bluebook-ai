    "Definitely! Take it if you can get in!",
    "The quality of this class depends a lot on the experiment you get. This first half we worked with plant biology and it was incredibly disorganized. We stayed late almost every day, but still got no conclusive results. That being said, the idea of working on a project from a Yale lab is fantastic and Prof Nelson is really dedicated to the class. Still so much better than other bio labs and you can finish the required credit of lab in just one semester.",
    "This lab is very variable based on the project. In the first session this semester, classes would last until 6 or later. In the second session, we often got out around 3 and class was cancelled a couple times. Homework is very manageable provided you have a friend in the class who really knows the relevant biology. The final project for the first session was rather time-consuming. Professor Nelson is great, very patient, and though the experiments generally failed it was still cool to be doing real science.",
    "Before I start ranting on how awful this class was, I want to note that the weaknesses of the course were contingent upon the particular research project for this year, which was long and tedious. The second half of this course, MCDB 343L, was a far better experience because that research project was much more realistic and not overambitious. However, I will document the misery that was MCDB 342L this year:Weaknesses: (1) SO TIME-CONSUMING -- spending five or six consecutive hours in lab twice a week was frustrating and exhausting for the students, the professor, and the TAs. When lab ended at 7:45 pm, I worried about missing dinner since dining halls closed at 8 -- NOT a good feeling. (2) The final paper was a disaster -- it's hard to write a \"manuscript suitable for scientific publication\" when your p-values are 0.9 and the error bars are larger than your columns. (3) There never seemed to be enough reagent or machines for us. I feel like the experiments were badly planned given the material constraints of the class. My bench sometimes waited for two or three hours just to START the experiment, given that we were last in line to use the machines. If we're going to be working with 12 samples per person, we need to have enough machines so that we don't waste hours in lab doing absolutely nothing.Strengths: (1) You get your own research project instead of doing the same procedure that has been done thousands of times in the past. This is really cool and what separates Nucleic Acids Lab from most other bio labs. (2) The class really bonds over the course of the semester, and I met some really great people through this lab.",
    "Despite the very long hours that it took for us to finish this particular experiment, I would still recommend this class to many students as it is an easy way to finish your biology lab requirements. This particular class had very long hours and I believe it was too much work for such a lab. However, I also believe this experience is more of an outlier and should not be taken as the norm experience of the class. Do expect to have long and frustrating days where equipment does work or several procedures need to be done before you are done, but I felt like it was rewarding experience in the end because I did learn many new techniques.",
    "It's good in that if you take this class and Nucleic Acids II, you get your pre-med and bio lab credits out of the way in one semester. Be warned, it's a tough semester though. You do a lot of complicated stuff, and it takes so much time out of your day. I did feel very accomplished at the end of the class- wrote a sample of a manuscript that you would send to a scientific journal. Unclear how harshly it will be graded. If they try out the experiments and maybe cut down the projects, you should take it. Also, if your lab bench is annoying, that can be stressful too.",
    "It depends on the project that you'll be doing. You might be in lab until 7 or you might be getting out at 3 everyday. It really depends. Actual one-on-one experience in a lab might be more useful but it's definitely useful for getting your feet wet in most of the basic protocols used in a lab setting.",
    "I would take this course! The projects are different every half-semester, and inthis particular one, we got a plant immunology project that was somewhat overwhelming because we ran two concurrent experiments, and lab tended to run long. However, don't let this deter you from taking the course, because it is still a wonderful class (much better the second half when we switched projects). Professor Nelson is amazing in that he has devoted his time at Yale to teaching undergrads in this course, and he'll teach you how everything works, from something as simple as a PCR purification kit to something more complex like a Western blot. There are a few psets that will reinforce the techniques we learned, and a research paper to end this first half of the semester. Definitely take the course if you can. Be sure to email a semester in advance in January if you want to take the course in the following fall semester.",
    "It was a great course -- learned A LOT about bio lab techniques, and was surprised\/delighted at how much easier they were even the second time around. Great experience for someone who hasn't worked in a bio lab in a while (or at all). Professor Nelson is wonderful! Finally, the amount of time it takes really depends on the lab you're paired with -- we got out at 7 during the first half some days, and usually by around 4 pm during the second-half.",
    "I would recommend this lab because it teaches you a lot about useful molecular biology lab techniques and the projects we do are really interesting. It is one of the few labs at Yale that actually have unique projects every semester. This is by far it's best selling point. Everything you do is somewhat novel. This does also mean that there is a lot of troubleshooting sometimes and things fail, but I think it's still worth it.",
    "This class is run pretty much like research for credit (with a few simple problem sets). The time you are required to spend in lab really depends on the project assigned for the semester, but either way there's lots of time during class to work on other hw\/relax with lab mates. Overall an enjoyable experience with not too much expected of you",
    "Could have been better.",
    "This is a great way to fulfill the bio lab requirement in one semester. However, the time commitment definitely depends on the project for that half semester. Our first project was way toomuch for us (we were there from 1:30 to 7 pm some weeks and the course meets twice a week!) but as a result and hopefully a lesson for all future sessions, the project for the next half semester was much more manageable and was enjoyable and totally manageable. You have to email Professor Nelson at least a year before to get a spot in the class though! Be warned. Otherwise not a huge commitment outside of lab, just don't let the notebook or report sneak up on you, it really got to some of us! Otherwise, good course, you learn a lot. Hopefully manageable for you!",
    "Good course, you learn great skills, but very poorly organized.",
    "I would recommend this class! It really taught me a lot about many basic experimental procedures. I find it helpful for my own research work in lab. Even though the first half was very time intensive (staying from 1:30pm to 7 or 8pm), it was not the intent of Professor Nelson. The second half was much better and we got out a lot earlier.",
    "NO. This is the worst class I've taken at Yale. The course was extremely disorganized. It often ended between 6-8pm even though the scheduled time was ending at 5pm. There was also minimal information provided on the background of the experiments and I felt like we were left in the dark about so much stuff because everyone just wanted to get out of class.",
    "Great bio lab option as the intro bio labs at Yale can allegedly be horrible experiences. Some sessions were quite long though in this first part of the course. Some times we were done at 7 or 8 pm, barely making it for dinner. Of course that was because of the nature of the experiments being done (ie western blots), which required more time than the ones of the second part (MCDB 343L). But overall, a very low stress lab and a great way to fulfill the full credit of bio lab required for premed and for a couple of majors. I would definitely take it again I I had to (over any other bio lab except perhaps fr Wolenski's lab taught in the spring). But it is a small class so it doesn't only depend on the student. Sign up definitely though by emailing Prof Nelson like a year in advance (immediately when January rings in).",
    "This was a really good course. Sometimes the labs take a long time, but overall the projects were good and I learned a lot. Also, its really nice getting a year's worth of lab done in one semester."
