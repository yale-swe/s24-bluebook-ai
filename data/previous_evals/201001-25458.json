   "comments": [
    "Yes. Take it if you are interested in the law. It is neat to think about the criminal justice system through the lens of politics.",
    "If you're interested in Criminal Law and dealing with \"where to draw the line\" in the criminal justice system, PLSC252 is a good survey course. The course covers a wide range of themes, from juvenile justice and philosophical stuff (e.g. Posner, Mill, Devlin to name a few)",
    "Yes - Prof. Huber is awesome. The course is a good overview of the criminal justice system, and will help you learn to structure normative political science arguments in papers. Take it writing intensive - the TAs are pretty helpful when it comes to editing and you get the benefit of the WR credit as well!",
    "I would recommend this class to students interested in the topic of crime and punishment in the American system. This is not an \"everyone should take this class\" course. The optional writing credit can be enjoyable because the paper topics are usually fun and easy to write about.",
    "Overview of the criminal justice system and all it's strengths, weakness, and interactions with society. The readings were wide-ranging and covered a lot of disciplines, and lecture was engaging with both current events, the reading, and implications of theories we considered.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS! lots of reading but Huber's good and the topics\/readings are very interested if you're interested in political movements and the law",
    "Yes, very much recommend this class.",
    "Take this course. I took WI and it was fine, but I feel like taking the exams would have been way easier. Either way, you'll learn a lot.",
    "This course is a study in the political influence on the criminal justice system. It focuses on thing like defendant's rights and due process, and very effectively conveys an understanding of the theory behind modern criminal law practice.",
    "A great class. Take it.",
    "This is a really great course and I would recommend it to anyone interested in the criminal justice system. Professor Huber is a good lecturer and lecture is a class you totally look forward to going to, which is something you can say about few classes. There is a ton of reading, which can be somewhat arduous, but if you commit to doing it, you'll actually understand what's going on which is a great advantage. The writing option is much better than the midterm and final.",
    "I cannot recommend this course enough. It is incredibly fascinating, and approaches topics in a rigorous way that combines the softer stuff (philosophy of law, sociology, Foucault) with the concrete policy (public defense attorneys, drug war, insanity defense).It focuses on arguments, and not just knowledge, so it really makes you think for yourself and develop your own opinions. For this reason, it was consistently enjoyable, and I loved most lectures.Don't listen to the comments that say that this is a lot of work. Really, compared to most seminars, the work load is nothing. The comments are most likely from freshmen who are used to taking easy poli sci lectures. As a sophomore, I felt the work load was totally manageable.",
    "Take this class. It is a lot of reading, and a lot of writing (if you decide to take it as a writing credit) but the material is so interesting and the professor does such a great job teaching it. You really learn a lot about our criminal justice system and it is definitely one of the better political science courses I have taken at Yale.",
    "This course covers the criminal justice in ways in which I never could have imagined. I feel like I learned so much in both breadth and depth - from philosophy of law to politics of law to special case studies within law. I loved the diversity of the readings - philosophy, articles, studies, Supreme Court cases, anthologies, etc. - and the diversity of the topics.",
    "Threat course on the theory behind the criminal justice system. A lot of work but nothing unbearable. Definitely recommended.",
    "This is an amazing class. You should take it, and you should actually go to lecture. Huber is a fantastic lecturer. This is easily among the best classes I've taken at Yale.",
    "Take this class. If you don't like writing you can take the midterm and the final. And if you don't like tests you write papers instead of the midterm. Either way, you will find this class interesting and be glad you educated yourself.",
    "This is a good class; it's a lot of reading but the workload isn't bad: two papers (or a midterm) and a final exam. The syllabus gives a good impression of the class, so if the syllabus looks interesting to you, take it. As a piece of advice if you do enroll: read Hay and Posner carefully when you get to that week. Huber loves these authors and they'll come up again and again and will figure importantly on the final exam.",
    "The course encourages you to rethink about your assumptions and knowledge of the criminal justice system. Overall, the course was good but my experience was totally ruined by my TA. Make sure that you don't get a law school student TA, or else you will end up feeling that you are the biggest loser who does not deserve to live in this world. My TA was extremely critical of everything that was said and written by everyone in my section, and the section was a complete waste of time (which is unfortunate because it is required).",
    "I would absolutely recommend the course, but not if all you're lookingfor is something fun and interesting. Rather, you should only take it on if you're prepared to make a significant commitment. Expect impressive academic rigor, ethically compelling topics, emphasis on constructing strong\/well-justified arguments, and a heavy workload.",
    "I thought this class would go into more detail\/be harder than it actually was. Overall it's a pretty easy survey course about the criminal justice system. Unless you need the writing credit, I would recommend taking the exams as it's very possible to get excellent grades on the tests without going to class or putting in much effort.Some of the readings were useless. Particularly the empirical studies we read as we were never asked to use statistics or really understand the findings in the reports we read. Other readings, that were more on the philosophy side of things (Hart, Foucault, etc.) were better and found there way to class discussion more often.",
    "Very interesting class with a good professor who's fun to listen to. The class is organized around questions regarding the US criminal justice system, such as the right to counsel for indigent defendants or the privatization of prisons. Sections for the class are not bad. This class is a very good writing credit - you only write two 8-10 page papers, and the paper topics are very interesting. The main con to this class is that it has way too much reading that you cannot escape because everyone has to take the final even if you're a writing intensive student.",
    "Take this class if you are interested in a fantastic combination between political science and political philosophy. I highly recommend it even though it is a bit of work.",
    "Really a wonderful PLSC class. The professor is amazing, material is very thought-provoking, and the TAs are usually quite good from the Law school. A manageable amountof writing for the WR credit (definitely do writing intensive) but the reading can be excessive at times.",
    "A pretty interesting class. Great for credit\/D if you just do mid-term and final, go to lecture and then don't read. I would recommend shopping it to see if you're interested, but if you like the topic then don't hesitate to take it.",
    "This is an okay course. I expected it to be better. The material is so interesting and it seemed like it would be an amazing course, but it never really got there- there was something missing. The class is definitely the type of class that posses question after question without giving any answers. Professor Huber is an okay lecturer. It is an easy course, not that much work if you take it non-writing intensive (which is definitely the way to go). I would take it if you are looking for an easy poli-sci class.",
    "Very interesting course. Not too much work but enough so you learn a lot. Really cool. Huber is great.",
    "This class is an interesting introduction to a couple topics in legal study. It does a good job of introducting them, but don't expect to learn too much on each one. The reading is also occasionally overwhelming, as with any class. However, it isn't too hard overall. The essay topics for writing intensive were good and the final was pretty easy. The WR credit option is probably a good idea, but the writing-intensive may not be. I masochistically chose writing intensive just because I like essay writing, but it's much harder. You have to write two 8-10 page papers AND submit two drafts of each. The WR non-intensive only have to do 1 draft of a 5-7 page paper. And the non-WR students just have to do a midterm and final. Given that the final was easy, the no-WR credit is probably the best option if you don't need the credit.",
    "Crime and Punishment is a great class. I would recommend it for any student who is interested in learning a little about the way that the criminal justice system works and a lot about the political issues that trouble it.",
    "Take it. It's not easy, but it's still great!",
    "What you get out of the class depends on what you put into it.",
    "You touch the surface of a bunch of areas of the criminal process, but you don't really delve deep enough to learn anything you didn't already know. And somehow, there's still a TON of reading. The professor also lets his fatherly bias get the better of him, which leads to a rather conservative atmosphere. Overall, I would not recommend this class.",
    "I liked the approach to the topic, but it was ultimately more work than I wanted to put in for a lecture course."
