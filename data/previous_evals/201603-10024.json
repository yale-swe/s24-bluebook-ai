    "Instructor: Alex Ozar \u00a0Alex always strived to explain confusing topics covered in class. He was usually a bit late, and if he wasn't going to be in section, he wouldn't tell us, Jamie would instead take his place. I also didn't feel well-prepared for quizzes as we didn't really discuss how to study or even what to study for the quizzes. Expectations for answers also varied between TA's. Grading was also very slow- i still have not received my last quiz or paper, which would have really helped for studying for the final.",
    "Instructor: James Johnstone Dunn \u00a0Strengths- encouraged participation Weaknesses- Unclear about what was expected for assignments, our sections should have been focused on talking about the reading questions",
    "Instructor: James Johnstone Dunn \u00a0Jamie was very helpful. He was incredibly kind and generous with his time. He promptly responded to e-mails, graded assignments quickly, and was always prepared for section. He did a good job leading the section - we did more than just review the material; we were able to process it and learn from one another, which was really nice.",
    "Instructor: James Johnstone Dunn \u00a0James is very pacient and polite, he has a great way to engage the class in the discussions, making the students feel comfortable and encouraged when they proposed an opinion. He was great explaining the topics relevant to class as well.",
    "Instructor: James Johnstone Dunn \u00a0Mr. Dunn was an outstanding TA. As mentioned in my previous message, I have a health condition and Mr. Dunn was always kind, supportive, and understanding. He also facilitated some excellent discussion groups and that I can say with great confidence that the entire class enjoyed. The other thing I appreciated was the expediency of his grading. He was always very organized and quickly and fairly gave our assignments back to us. I do not have any complaints with regard to our discussion groups and am also very thankful that he was my TA.",
    "Instructor: James Johnstone Dunn \u00a0Mr. Dunn is a great teaching fellow. He always came to our discussion group prepared with additional background knowledge that would help us put the readings in context with the overall theories of the philosophers. He was always encouraging and professional. There were a couple of areas that could be improved, but this is not to imply that he didn't do an excellent job. A couple of times the discussion got off track and we spent considerable time discussing philosophers that we hadn't read, particularly Karl Barth. It would have been helpful if we could have been advised in advance if there was some extra reading that we could have done in order to be prepared to participate in the discussion. There were some in the class who were well read in philosophy and they could participate, but there were others who were unfamiliar and therefore it was not possible for them to contribute to the discussion in a significant way. One thing that would have been helpful would be if people had to raise their hand in order to speak in discussion group. There were a few in the group for whom English isn't their first language and they were not always able to participate because they couldn't process and respond as quickly as the others. Also, sometime the conversation was dominated by a select few. Those who are more shy aren't as likely to jump in to the discussion. In spite of this, I think Mr. Dunn did try to make sure that everyone had a chance to participate at least on some level. Maybe he just assumed that the others weren't comfortable in participating. (This is a problem in all of my sections. There are always a few who dominate the conversation because they have more assertive personalities. This is not a reflection on Mr. Dunn, just a suggestion as a way to possibly avoid the same problem in the future.) Overall, Mr. Dunn did an excellent job. I enjoyed the discussion sessions. He was understanding and compassionate toward students and their needs. I believe he will make a great professor. I would love to have him as my Teaching Fellow again, or, eventually, as a professor."
