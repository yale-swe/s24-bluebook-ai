    "I think I would have prefered a research paper to a final exam. A paper would have allowed me to get more in depth with the material. Maybe make graduate students write a research paper and undergraduates take the final exam?The class was a little big. The room was too small for the class. This is not an undergraduate class and there were a lot of undergraduates. I think it's fine to have undergraduates if there is space for them, but the class was already big. I'm surprised that the university lets undergraduates take any graduate classes they want. But as a graduate student, I'm not allowed to take some of the undergraduate classes.I was not the biggest fan of the time of the class. I would have prefered it to be a morning or early afternoon class. 3:30 - 5:30 is the time of day when I am most tired and hungry. I got sick two times during class. But this is just how I am and others may function best at this time of day.",
