    "Provides an excellent background in the relevant material AND insight deep evaluations of it. This is a winning combination that few classes achieve.",
    "The syllabus makes this class look like a Directed Studies style survey course, but the depth Darwall puts into each of the texts really does a lot better. Especially if you put a bit of extra time into looking at the suggested secondary readings on some weeks, you'll realize that what he's doing in seminar is a really high-powered engagement with some of the key interpretive debates. The class is philosophically interesting -- the texts you read inspire some contemporary theories of ethics (and color) that are not the standard consequentialist\/Kantian theories you're used to. Darwall is a great seminar leader and also really approachable. He strikes a great balance between him explaining the text and then soliciting student opinions. I liked that he introduced some of his own opinions about the texts but was also honest when he had changed his mind or liked somebody else's paper on a text.",
    "History of philosophy can flounder in the gulf between interpretation and actual philosophy, and Phil 452 brought the two together nicely. We move through the authors on the syllabus fairly quickly, and the assignments are those of a typical Darwall seminar--response papers and a longer 15-20 page seminar paper on a topic of your choice. The seminar's structure rewards initiative and intellectual creativity, so take advantage of the opportunity!",
    "Tough course, but a great course. Lots of reading, some of them quite hard, and not worth getting very far behind on or you might not be able to catch back up. Darwall is a terrific seminar leader who does a great job moving between the philosophical and historical and setting the material in context. You cover a LOT of ground.",
    "Good class. A felt a lot of the time like it was too stuck in the technical. But I can't really talk because I missed a lot of the reading in the middle. I did feel at the end that some of the intense close reading on nitpicky philosophical points paid off, especially in reading Kant.",
    "A good chance to go super in-depth into some authors from Hobbes to Nietzsche. In this iteration, the seminar skewed heavily British. Be sure that the subquestions of this particular seminar are questions you're interested in before you take the leap - it's not a comprehensive look at many ethical theories as much as it is a look at some specific narrow questions (the idea of morality as legality, the is-ought problem, sympathy and approbation)."
