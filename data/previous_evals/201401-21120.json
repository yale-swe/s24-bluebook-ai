    "This course is a lot of reading but it is interesting reading. The subject covers issues that effect everyone, so everyone can relate someway to the material.",
    "I highly recommend this course especially if you are unexperienced in English courses but want to take a course that will teach you lessons for life.",
    "Yes, but beware it is somewhat English intensive rather than American Studies so you have to be prepared for that.",
    "A course with easy readings and banal discussions. Take it if you're interested in watching movies and barely reading scholarly articles.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. There are a lot of readings but they're all so amazing and interesting that you're very motivated to start reading them early in the week. The class is interesting both for the literature it teaches and the discussion of what those texts mean."
