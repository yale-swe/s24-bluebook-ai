   "comments": [
    "While the subject material is perhaps not the most engaging, Professor Grieger is hands down the best instructor I have had at Yale. He can turn dry subjects fun and entertaining.",
    "First half is boring. Second half is very interesting. Worth taking overall.",
    "I would recommend this to someone interested in the topic and data analysis. The second half is all about data analysis, which can be more confusing than calculus, but also helpful if that is what you are looking to do.",
    "This was a great class -- I reviewed a lot of useful information and was challenged while learning\/applying models of statistics. The professor is FANTASTIC and engaging!",
    "Reviews basic calc techniques and then moves on to analyzing data with Stata. Professor Grieger is the greatest. The midterm and psets were not difficult. I definitely recommend this class.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class, even to non-GA majors. It is extremely well taught.",
    "Absolutely",
    "would definitely recommend as an intro course to a lot of new topics",
    "Great class! Hidden gem of a QR. Review of calculus and then learning Stata. Although at the end of the semester some of the Psets take a few hours, they are mostly short. Really useful in thinking about how data and calculus works in the real world. Don't just take it if you are a Global Affairs student. Best, most useful way to get an easy QR. Lloyd is great! Makes math incredibly exciting and funny. Section is kind of unnecessary for most of the year if you have any background in calculus.",
    "AQA is a great course - its required for global affairs majors and really fills a niche that most would miss otherwise. Although it's not extremely difficult, by the end, you will have a strong foundation in the basic of calculus (and how they can really be used in research) as well as a good understanding of State and statistical analysis. The course is limited by the wide variety of math levels students enter with, so at times it can seem extremely basic, but overall I would recommend it to other students - whether in global affairs or not. Plus is a QR credit (and if you're looking for a basic QR class that will be the most useful to you in the future, next to intro micro, this is your best choice).",
    "It's basically half calculus and half stata, for students who don't actually care for the nitty gritty parts of math but would still like to know some things or want to put math to good use.",
    "Applied Quantitative Analysis is a review of AB and BC calculus that then moves into a course on using STATA and interpreting the results. I would recommend IS 201 to another student who wants to gain a greater general idea of how data is generated and analyzed. I believe that it is crucial, not just for people reading sociology papers, but also for anyone who relies on data in his or her life - as we all do! - to be able to critically think about how data has been gathered and interpreted. I would definitely recommend a student take the class with Lloyd, but I could imagine the course being kind of boring and frustrating with a dull professor.",
    "Great class for gaining a thorough understanding of calculus and stata, specifically in the context of the social sciences. Professor Grieger is an amazing professor who truly cares for his students. He is really organized with the material and really good at explaining math concepts to those who may not be good at math. Plus he really prepares you for the exams and provides you with a lot of resources. He's also very funny, so though math will never be interesting to me, class was very entertaining. I learned a lot about social science research.",
    "Yes.",
    "Great class. Anyone interested in the social sciences, not just global affairs, can get a lot out of it. Even if you're more interested in qualitative than quantitative methods, being able to understand quantitative analysis is super important, and this class helped me a lot. If you are interested in quantitative methods, learning stata seems useful, so that's a plus for this class. Professor Grieger is wonderful and hilarious and makes the class quite manageable and enjoyable.",
    "I highly recommend taking this class even as a prospective global affairs major so you have the information before taking the development class.",
    "HE IS AN AMAZING TEACHER.He's funny and so invested in us doing well. Literally a great guy. Makes learning easy.Math is not that hard and it's a great QR. Definitely recommend it.",
    "This is a great practical class for anyone who plans on working at think tanks or public policy organizations after graduation-- Stata is a useful skill to pick up in college, and the first half of the class provides a good background for understanding what the Stata output means. Lloyd is a big part of the reason that I'd recommend this course-- he explains everything super well and is a great person to talk to if you're confused about the material or want help for other things (job search, other classes).",
    "Global Affairs 121 01 gives you a great introduction to the quantitative aspect of global affairs and stats. I would definitely recommend this class to another student! It is one very approachable QR--you can fulfill this distributional requirement and learn a new skill\/program!",
    "A very useful course for introduction to college-level calculus and statistics. Even if you are unsure about pursuing quantitative analysis later on it is important to understand something about how the analysis is done, what the subjectivities are. You can't go wrong with Professor Grieger.",
    "GLBL 121 is the math you need to know if you are reading or maybe want to write a social science paper one day. If you are scared of math, don't worry. This is a straightforward and well-taught class. Even if calculus was once intimidating, now it isn't any more. You'll lean some multivariate derivation and then go on to doing regressions and data interpretation in STATA.Prof. Grieger is incredibly nice and great at explaining all the concepts. Everyone in the class left the semester loving him.Take this class. It is fantastic!",
    "This class is a very thorough introduction to statistic analysis. AND ALSO PROFESSOR GRIEGER IS ABSOLUTELY AMAZING-- by far one of the best teachers I've EVER had. That said, don't take this class if you have a strong math background; the first part is all basic calculus. If you don't have a good history of math, though, I'd definitely recommend this course; while it may not be rigorous statistics, it will teach you what you need to know to use statistics and evaluate their usage--which is exactly what a good class should do.",
    "Definitely recommended - great way to get valuable skills you'll actually use one day....well, maybe.",
    "This is a really easy course and you actually learn a good amount about regression analysis. Be warned though: you spend half the semester doing high school calclulus and only the second half on statistics. Also, you don't do much statistics besides regression analysis.",
    "This class teaches you statistics and the calculus background to understand statistics. You learn how to use STATA, a computer program for statistical analysis. It is really a phenomenal course if you are reading papers that have statistics in them or if you plan on running statistical models yourself in the future. Professor Grieger is, in addition, the best professor ever. The class is not too challenging, but you learn a ton, and a ton of useful things.",
    "GLBL 121 is a fantastic course for anyone not in the math or sciences field but who understands the value of having a solid background in calculus and statistics. Everything we learned was geared towards practical application. I highly recommend GLBL 121.",
    "Great course. Definitely take it if you are Global Affairs or want an easy and fun QR.",
    "This class was a really minimal workload and fairly interesting. Going to class was not always helpful because the class notes were so comprehensive and class could get repetitive. That said, the concepts are conveyed very clearly. The problem sets can be time consuming, but tend not to be too conceptually difficult. The calculus was a good, quick review, and the STATA was useful, but we did not cover it in as much depth as I had been hoping. If you want to become a really proficient programmer, this is not the class for you. If you want to learn the basics of interpreting and sort of using STATA, this class would be perfect.",
    "This is the best, easiest, most informative and practical math class you will ever take. I hate math and was dreading the course but Prof. Grieger is such an incredible teacher he makes even the dullest, most difficult concepts seem exciting and manageable. I would definitely recommend this course, particularly to students who don't consider themselves math people.",
    "yes, awesome QR and prof grieger is the man",
    "Global Affairs 121 was a diluted statistics\/econometrics course. It was well taught like a good high school class, but the material was simply too basic. I wish I had taken straight econometrics or statistics.",
    "I would summarize it as a very applied overview of calculus and statistics. If you're interested in learning how and why we use these tools in the social sciences, TAKE THIS CLASS! It's not so much about formulas or deriving proofs, but about learning how to use the tools you're being given. If you're really into the math behind everything, such as deriving standard deviations, etc, I would look for another class. If you want to understand how calculus and stats relate and how they can be used, there is no better course!",
    "If you have need of a calculus brush-up or a basic statistics class, then a definite must! Professor Grieger is a wonderful teacher - you will have no problem understanding the material with him. The homework sets become more difficult in the second part of the semester (since you have to use stata software), but worth it! The stata software is a good skill to have. Also, Professor Grieger is very approachable and always willing to explain any questions you may have.",
    "Great class. Take it as long as Lloyd Grieger is the professor. In fact, take ANYTHING that Prof. Grieger is teaching--you will learn it.",
    "excellent. take it. best teacher, best teaching method. You actually learn to interpret what can otherwise be considered very mechanical math. amazing if you want to conduct your own research at any point. the professor takes you by the hand and reviews everything so dont even worry if you haven't done math in 3-4 yrs... you'll be fine, he levels the playing field and gives you so much confidence in yourself.",
    "Yes, definitely. Grieger is a great, caring professor, and really great at explaining complicated math concepts. You'll finally understand (or just learn) all the calculus you didn't \"get\" previously, and you'll learn great skills at reading papers and analyzing data. A little basic sometimes, and the class moves a little slowly, but you won't be over your head, and it's not hard to do well.",
    "The class is divided in 2. The first part is like a review of calculus, not so hard; the second part you learn how to use the program Stata, it helps you to interpret data. The must important part of the 2nd part is not learning about how to use the program, instead of understanding the information you get after you use stata. I think that is the most difficult part of this class. I recommend to take this class before GLBL 225!!!",
    "Professor Grieger is the only person I know of on this earth who can make math seem interesting, fun, and easy to people like me who otherwise despise doing anything even remotely related to numbers. If you want to gain a good basic understanding of calculus and statistics and actually enjoy yourself while you do it, take this class!",
    "The course is very useful if you want to be able to interpret stats in the social sciences. It's also a great intro into calculus.",
    "Good class to review\/learn concepts behind math, stats, analysis, etc."
