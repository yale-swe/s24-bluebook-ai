   "comments": [
    "Take DS, and fight tooth and nail to claw your way into Zaremby's section. He was absolutely incredible.",
    "DS H&P is like every other DS course. You pretty much run through history and try to take as many pictures as you can before your rushed off to the next time and place. That being said, I think it was an extremely valuable course. It gave me a great basis of understanding that I will undoubtedly use to understand my future courses. I absolutely recommend this course because it's the only course that can introduce you to the broader concepts of political though while simultaneously giving you an understanding of the full breadth of western history.",
    "DS Hist\/Pol with Zaremby is really challenging. He is not afraid to give bad grades and harsh criticism. That being said, the class is a great opportunity to be inspired and pushed intellectually and was a great environment to learn. I always felt pushed. The readings were long and intense and we discussed them in minute detail. I loved the class but I would not recommend it to someone who does not want a truly rigorous experience.",
    "This is a fantastic course.",
    "H&P is the most material out of all three classes; I also found it the most difficult but also the class in which I made the most progress. Don't panic when you get your first essay back- you'll be amazed by how much better your writing is by the end!",
    "This is a great course and I would highly recommend Professor Zaremby to anyone taking it. He incites great discussions with his questions during section and during office hours provides excellent advice on writing well.",
    "An excellent professor. He makes you care about the text in a way that is remarkable, considering how dry some of the readings are. He starts off grading harshly, but eases up as the semester goes on, and helps you realize how much you improve over a semester.",
    "A basic overview of the historical writers and political theorists in Greek and Roman times. I would recommend this class for those interested in either history or political science because it lets you take a look at the roots of Western civilization.",
    "Directed Studies History and Politics with Justin Zaremby was a great class. We read primary sources from Ancient Greece, Ancient Rome, and finished with the Christians Augustine and Aquinas, with an interlude of the classical political theory of Plato and Aristotle. This is an ambitious reading list, and some weeks the volume expected is nearly impossible. However, don't stop trying! You will get so much out of reading these amazing authors. Professor Zaremby was a wonderful section leader; he's extremely knowledgeable (he did Directed Studies when he was here!) and approachable outside of class. Our section discussions were intensely analytical, and JZ can be a tough critic. However, this made my critical thinking skills and writing improve significantly over the course of the semester. Take this class!!!",
    "DRST 005 is a survey of the history of political thought from the 5th century BC to the 13th century CE. I would recommend this class for any student who is interested in political theory but who has read FEW IF ANY of the works on the DS syllabus. (Re-reading books in DS is disappointing at best and frustrating at worst because of (a) the speed and (b) the lack of depth inherent in a survey class.) The workload for this course, as for the other DS courses, is challenging but manageable; don't let it prevent you from taking the program.",
    "Absolutely! If you're already taking Directed Studies, be SURE that you get Professor Zaremby one of your semesters! The experience I've had with him this fall I feel certain will be a key part of not only my freshman year, but also my whole experience at Yale College. He teaches a new way to think and study history, and I hope that I never lose the insight of such a brilliant man! (Also, he's a movie star... who knew???)",
    "If you can get Professor Zaremby as yoursection leader, you will have probably one of the greatest experiences of your undergraduate studies, and you will acquire a profound understanding of the political foundations of the modern world and the ideologies that informed the founding of our country.",
    "There is a lot of reading, but the course is highly recommended. The reading itself is verychallenging and rewarding. The students with whom you will discuss the works are all extremely intelligent and will help to complement the views that you form. It's an overall amazing learning experience.",
    "Justin Zaremby is an excellent guide to the great works of history and political thought. The class is what you make of it. The readings can get a little much so you need to put in a decent bit of effort, and come to section prepared. Other than that, highly recommended."
