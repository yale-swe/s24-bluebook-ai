    "Question 8 and 10 It is Lecturer's first time teaching and I believe he will improve over time. He was able to communicate his thoughts clearly enough to my understanding.",
    "This topic matter is so important to FES students (myself included). Unfortunately, Larry did not deliver that information in a comprehensible manner. I think this is \"fixable\" however he needs to build entirely new lecture slides, he needs to practice, and frankly he needs engaged TAs. (The TAs in this class let him down by not helping him with his lectures). Text only slides do not work. A scrambled lesson plan does not work. A syllabus that has no progression does not work. I was sorry to see this class fail, I was pretty excited for it when I saw the readings and the content description at first. Larry, I think you can improve as a lecturer and would love to see it happen, however for now I would strongly recommend no one take this course until it is ready.",
    "Very slow class. Maybe add some material that arent on the slides. Reading the slides for 3 hours is not productive.",
    "I struggled to follow much of what was taught, because of the the lecture style.",
    "The course was a conglomeration of many courses and subject taught across FES and Yale. I'm having a hard time discerning what I already knew versus what I have taken away from the course. Not the case for everyone I'm sure. I would recommend this course be offered in the fall to first year students.",
    "I did not gain much from this course. I felt that the course title was very misleading. I expected to learn about specific ways to invest in environmental problems, as was discussed in the guest lecture on water by Brad Gentry. Instead, I felt like this course summarized almost every concept I was learning in depth in other energy courses in a disjointed and poorly organized way. For example, we were assigned to read the exact same project documents that we were read and analyzed in depth in Renewable Project Finance, and this course offered nothing new and brushed over these seemingly unrelated topics. Additionally, while using legal tools to privately invest is what the course was supposed to be about, we didn't cover specific legal concepts (other than very broad concepts like externalities, etc that most people are already very familiar with) nor did we cover finance concepts. I'm not entirely sure what the intent of the course's structure was or what we were supposed to take away from it, other than a very basic understanding of concepts most of us already knew.",
    "I answered very valuable to Question 12 because I think it has the potential to be very valuable, but it needs to be entirely re-formatted before it can provide value. The readings were way too much - the amount assigned was very discouraging. The powerpoints were way too text-heavy and the instructor merely read from the slides, which made it very hard to keep focus in class. One of the biggest disappointments of the class for me was the lack of variety in case studies and examples - they all focused on clean energy. Obviously investment in clean energy is very important, but a variety of examples would have been much more inclusive for other people's interests; after all, it is a class on legal concepts of private investment, not legal concepts of private investment in the energy sector. Also, energy projects are very confusing and for someone who is not in that field, I found the case studies very hard to follow because I did not know all of the language or logistics of a renewable project. Again, a couple of energy case studies would have been fine, but I would have really appreciated other examples of how legal concepts can affect private investment in other fields.",
    "Understanding that Professor Rodman was teaching for the first time, I still thought that I got very little out of this course. He tried to pack extremely dense and complex legal material into each three hour seminar, preferring to lecture for the whole time rather than to actively engage students, many of whom had experience in the field he was lecturing about. He would just read from his notes honestly. Some of the guest lectures were great, though - from the Connecticut Green Bank for example. Professor Rodman was always available to talk on the phone about projects but less so face-to-face. I would have preferred this course if it were 1) Much more engaging - for example, if it were half lecture half practicum, or more questions directed to students and MUCH less material and 2) taught by a different professor - ideally somebody with more contact with environmental groups and issues that weren't only the realm of the extremely rich. There was little focus on small scale environmental conservation or environmental development in developing countries - it was entirely US centric, pulling examples from large industries like wind and solar, rather than, for example, examining conservation frameworks in Latin America. Many of the students in the class were not from the United States, and so having a broader perspective would have been more relevant for them.",
    "The course material was not clearly organized so it felt like we were consistently learning the same lessons over and over rather than new aspects of the same concepts in a variety of applications. The instructor very clearly is passionate about the subject and I think once he gets more comfortable with these materials, the course will greatly benefit for his fluidity.",
    "Too much overlap from Daniel Gross' class.",
    "Question 8: Larry is spot on when it comes to teaching the legal material of the course, but when he tries to teach the economics or environmental components he definitely falls short. Recommend bringing in more guest lecturers to help fill these gaps. His choice of guest lecturers was excellent and I learned a lot.",
    "Question 8 Lawrence Rodman is an excellent teacher. He knowledge of the material is strong and his discussion was engaging. His teaching improved greatly over the length of the course. The most interesting parts of the lecture were those that diverged from the power point script and delved into Larry's personal legal and investment experiences.",
    "I felt like the entire class could have been cut down by half because there was, what felt like, a lot of repetition. There are only so many ways to say \"minimize risk\" that at a certain point it felt like beating a dead horse. I would have liked to have the material covered in the entire course to be covered in just the first half, cut out the repetition, and have the second half focused on actual examples, real-word strategies, and application. Dr. Gross's guest lecture on corporate structure and financing to drive investment is more along the lines of what I was anticipating the class to be.",
    "To be very honest, this course has WAY too much reading and if anyone says the opposite he or she either doesn't do the reading or is lying. It is simply impossible to fit that much reading into a week for a student who takes classes and works. One may say just do the key reading, then what's the point of having so many reading listed in the first place? The lecture room is WAY to big for such a small class. I sometimes wonder if most of the students were present at all. PLEASE cut down the content and increase class discussion. There is no way anyone can retain that much material. Though the subject is understandably broad, there have to be areas of focus. Right now, the slides are extremely long and wordy and very boring to read. I wonder what the TAs are doing besides grading papers(?). They should spend some time beautifying those slides and make them conducive to learning. To be fair, this is the first time Lawrence is teaching so there's much room for improvement. He is very helpful when he is free but he has very little time to help during class (because he is rushing through slides, #1 pitfall for beginning teachers) and after class (rushing to catch a train home). The way he lectures is really just reading the slides, which are typed out in sentences broken into different lines. That sort of presentation can't fly in any investment\/sales pitch. How can we learn private investment properly if the lecturer isn't setting a good example? Perhaps the Professional Communications Center at FES can help him to learn to present and deliver materials more effectively."

I think the papers were useful exercises as well, and I appreciate the idea of fostering our own creativity and using that in our papers.",

    "Delving in and writing the papers.",
    "Guest lecturers, and the fact that Larry seemed to genuinely care about our learning. The readings were a bit too basic in the early weeks but got better later on.",
    "The readings were very interesting. I see the financial world in a whole new way. The assignments were creative and useful. The papers assigned provided students an opportunity to apply newly gained knowledge to a personal interest. Larry made himself very accessible to the students for guidance on each assignment. His encouragement and enthusiasm were inspirational.",
    "The guest presentations by Professor Gross and Peter Davidson were the best aspects of the course. Both lectures were focused on concrete examples and practical application, especially Professor Gross'.",
    "The best aspect of this course was how responsive Larry was to students. He was extremely willing and available to meet with students outside of class to go over material or paper ideas. He genuinely wants the students to learn the material and enjoys discussing it one on one with the students.",
    "The final project",
    "The course content is really good combing both legal and financial tools in the environmental space. The class was well organized and the readings availed long before the classes. Relevant examples used Guest lectures",
    "Course material and course structure. Evaluation is focused on area-of-interest which is the best part.",
    "It covers many topics though I doubt I remember much (to be perfectly honest...). Lawrence is very helpful outside of class but less so in class."

    "Delivery of the lecture materials in class.",
    "See my answer to Q13.",
    "Presentation skills - lecturing in general. There is an entertainment factor and\/or a role to be played by the lecturer. Facilitating questions and incorporating student insight might be useful going forward. Also the space was too large for the type of course offered. The format required a more intimate classroom setting.",
    "Seems too broad-- some lectures could be more specific. Unsure of the narrative tying the different lectures together into a cohesive point for the course",
    "The lectures could be improved. The slides were all a wall of text that he would read from during the entire class which can make it difficult to keep paying attention. I did see that he did work to ask questions and make it a little bit more of a discussion at the end. Doing this more would likely improve lectures. There was also way too much reading. Although it was optional, seeing a huge wall of text did stop me from doing the readings as it just seemed like a drop in the bucket.",
    "As I said above, this course needs to be more focused and give more substantial content. I would've liked to learn about financial tools and more in-depth legal concepts rather than a very broad overview of these things.",
    "See answer to Question 13 above.",
    "1. Teaching style: his style was extremely dry and non-engaging. 2. Material: Please expand to not only delve into the US context and have more depth on conservation finance, which is why most of the people in this course decided to take it!",
    "Very bland",
    "The take home midterm and final were not helpful at all. The prompts were way too vague, the length too long, and the feedback was not helpful. Would have been great to have had smaller more concrete assignments and maybe a group project.",
    "The power points could be simplified and reduced. The room where the class was held should have been smaller for the class size.",
    "There was too much material to cover for each day. Many times I felt like Professor Rodman was rushed to cover the material in the allotted time and questions\/discussions by the students had to be cut short for the sake of time. The way the material is presented also needs work. The slides were mostly just bullet notes with no diagrams, figures, ect, just words, and Professor Rodman would just read off the slides.",
    "The lectures were quite long and after the first 1.5 hours it became hard to stay focused.",
    "Lectures were not very smooth. It was clear that it was the first time Larry had taught this course, but I expect it would run better next year now that he has some teaching experience.",
    "The delivery of the content Student engagement-it was quite low Clarity of concepts to be improved",
    "Course is too vast. Needs to be divided into 2 parts - Legal Framework & Investment. It has to be offered only for second years (Fall semester) so that most students would have already acquired basic financial, investment and environmental concepts and are ready to absorb the legal frameworks. Legal framework is focused on U.S. Since the scope of environmental investments and hence the course are not limited to USA, the legal frameworks of other countries (especially China, India and African nations) could also be discussed with equal rigor. I would like to see atleast 30% times allocated for discussion of legal frameworks in different countries. This could be done through participatory approaches or systematic case studies. I think this could become a star-course of FES if - Focus of the course is only legal tools 30-40% of the time is given for international legal frameworks (with constant comparison with that of US)",
    "Lawrence really needs to upgrade the slides to conform with our modern presentation standard and present the material as further away from reading the slides as possible. His TAs need to take a more proactive role in class (and perhaps he should let them...). There is a dire need for class discussion and a focus in the curriculum to engage further learning."

This is however slowly changing as private organizations\/individuals come into this space. This class gives an insight into the legal aspects involved when investing in environmental issues such as property rights. It also highlights the organizational structures through which this funds can be channeled such as limited companies, partnerships, corporations and the emerging forms such as B Corps. This knowledge is useful in understanding investments in the environment but more how to st up organizations that are able to attract other peoples money to protect the environment,for example in the renewable energy sector which is my area of interest.",
