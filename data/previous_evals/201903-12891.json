    "This class marks the first time I have thought about sociology historically and comparatives, or at least as far as I was aware. Incorporating temporality and contingency into sociological research is much more of a challenge than it may seem, and this class helped me navigate those waters.",
    "A great grasp of comparative historical methods as a methodological approach.",

   "comments": [
    "Most of the readings were great, and we tried our best to cover as many methodological topics as possible. I would have loved to see a bit more readings that incorporated questions of race, gender, and post colonialism in historical sociology, as these are not only pertinent to my research, but more generally to sociology's future.",
    "Nil",
    "A strength was that students drove much of the discussion. For the most part, this was helpful because student engagement was high. Sometimes, however, this led to the class going off on tangents. Another strength was the professor's ability to answer the various questions that were raised from these discussions."

    "Absolutely. This class was constructively challenging and the discussion was always lively. Studying, critiquing, and discussing methodology is a difficult, yet worthwhile endeavor.",
    "Yes! Professor Adams is incisive and helpful.",
    "Yes, it is very helpful.",
    "Yes, definitely. It was helpful not only for orienting students within the field, but the topics also applied more broadly to anyone interested in historical work. I would strongly recommend it to students from a variety of disciplines."
