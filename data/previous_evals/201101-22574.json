    "If you want to learn 20th century Anthro Theory in a very accessible way, then this course is excellent. I did not intend to take it, but was pleasantly surprised when shopping. Mostly for ANTH majors or students with a strong interest in anthropology.",
    "Excellent class. Only thing I'd change is having more Bourdieu and less on Gender. The strength is in the teacher, his lectures, careful selection of manageable readings, and regular writing assignments to get us to critically engage the texts. Excellent. Definitely take it, even if you're not an anthro major.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class to another student if it is offered again. More generally, what I have learned from this class as a history major and humanities enthusiast is that anthropology seminars are absolutely worthwhile, relevant, and accessible to non-majors. If you have a background like mine and are complaining about the narrowness of course offerings in philosophy, you should be looking at theory classes in this department and others."
