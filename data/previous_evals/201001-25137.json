   "comments": [
    "Yes, I recommend this class. As others have said in reviews, the methodology and language of this class might be a bit different from other political science courses, but the institutional paradigm makes for a very interesting semester. The theory portion drags on a bit, but once the class gets into case studies, it becomes more engaging and all the theory from before becomes quite useful. We also had a series of great guest speakers, although this can probably vary from year to year.Professor Fotos is friendly and engaging. He is also very helpful in paper writing; as a research methods prof, he is very good at working with you to shape a great paper and help you around obstacles. Combined with the breadth of subject material falling under the course purview, this makes an excellent seminar for a senior essay on American politics.",
    "I may recommend this class. This class is not about Congress, the Presidency, etc., as it may first seem. It is actually a discussion of political theory, terrorism, counterinsurgency, and disaster management. While the course material was interesting from a policy perspective, the reading was a little dense sometimes and the class too lecture-based. Additionally, the discussion revolved around personal opinionsand comprehension of the reading rather than reaching something a little deeper. Professor Fotos is helpful every step of the way in the paper-writing process and is informed on the subject, but, as there are no other assignments, it is unclear what he expects from the paper. I would shop this class.",
    "The Professor (Fotos) is incredibly nice and helpful. He is prepared for every class and knows a lot. However, the day-to-day is not very interesting and the class lacks a coherent focus. But I think if you look at the syllabus beforehand and feel really interested in the material, it should be perfect for you.",
    "Yes it is a good way to look at policy and politics.",
    "This class' title has nothing to do with what it's actually about. You study a lot of American government political theory, then look at case studies of the Afghanistan War and Hurricane Katrina. The second half is really interesting, the first half is fairly boring, but overall the class is pretty good. Lots of reading.",
    "This class's syllabus had great potential, but the seminar became boring and repetitive. Prof. Fotos is really nice, but wasn't able to focus the discussion.",
    "Yes--if you are interested in viewing politics\/organizations through the lens of political economy. The market approach we used doesn't agree with everyone."
