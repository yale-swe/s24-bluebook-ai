    "Yes. Definitely take PLSC 151. There is a lot of reading but it's all worth it. The discussions are lively and engaging. You will learn about about democracy and foreign policy in this class.",
    "It's very interesting material, and Professor Marinov is very nice and very knowledgeable, but he's extremely disorganized to the extent that it was disruptive to the course (not posting reading on classes so we had to go searching for it on our own - and some we couldn't find, assignments would be posted a week late, we often didn't know what readings we were supposed to do for the upcoming class, etc). Other than the crazy disorganization it's a good course if you're interested.",
    "it's a good class. you learn a lot. very useful foundational tool, esp if you're a poli sci major. i found it to be a good background crossover for a lot of the other classes i was taking."
