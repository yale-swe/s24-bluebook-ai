This course included a trip to the Beinecke library for a viewing of Rachel Carson's original papers, which gave specific insights and created connections to the readings and in-class discussions. Excellent professors, important material, and a terrifically crafted course that integrates cross-discipline topics in one package. I would recommend this course to others."

    "Best part of this class was combining two disciplines that usually don't seem to go together. It was helpful and insightful to learn from other students not in FES and have great discussions on the topics we learned in class.",
    "Good discussion rounds. Extraordinarily friendly professors. Open atmosphere.",
    "The discussion time! I really appreciated having all of the class time be about productive discussion. Having a couple of students come prepared each week with questions was useful too (although this could have been explained a little clearer to avoid lots of rambling and summary by students). I also thought there was pretty good balance between reading and videos\/lectures. I'm much more of a visual\/reading learner than an audio learner so have appropriate reading material is essential for me in an online course like this.",
    "I really liked the online discussions, they were so open and students reflected on the materials in a very personal way which made the discussions even more interesting."

    "Yes, they did. I was able to go as deep into the material as I wanted to because of the flipped format. The inclass and online discussions both provided forums for sharing viewpoints and freely exchanging ideas. The online portion was particularly important for this, allowing classmates to add to the discussion at their convenience."

    "In the 6 week course, the material is clearly structured and you can be as involved as you would like to be. Both professors are very open to questions and comments and do a great job of not just telling you information, but leading you to your own understanding."
