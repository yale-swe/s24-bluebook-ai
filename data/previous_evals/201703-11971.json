   "comments": [
    "I learned how to throughly read case law, a lot about the constitution, and how precedence is used in common law systems.",
    "This class, with its reading assignments, takes you through 200 years worth of Constitutional history. At the end of the class, reading news stories with a constitutional theme starts to make much more sense.",
    "This course was not the extraordinary thing that Yale legends make it out to be, but I did think that it was a great introductory course to constitutional law (or law in general) and it has gotten me excited about taking more law courses in the future. I think that I learned a lot about law terms and what the mean\/how they are used, the history of the US, and the legal system in general. The casebook that we read out of was titled Processes of Constitutional Decision-Making, and I'm not sure how much I learned about the process per se. A lot of law is just reading the cases, figuring out that the case says, writing a brief, and then applying it. This is mostly how we were tested on exams.",
    "I learned American constitutional interpretation: so many new and useful modalities of argument. I learned seminal cases in American constitutional history. I learned a different kind of close reading than what I was used to in literature.",
    "I want to go to law school now",
    "How to approach constitutional law, modalities, landmark cases, constitutional structure, the general set-up and functionality of the US government, political quesitons, US history...",
    "Great lectures! I did not do a single page of reading the entire year, and I still learned a ton about the history of the court and the way the judicial branch shapes politics. Highly recommend this class.",
    "The course is billed as a way of learning how to \"do\" constitutional law by applying the various \"modalities\" of constitutional interpretation history, text, legal doctrine, etc. It lives up to that promise, although the first half of the course is much more holistic in approach (i.e., encompassing all these different aspects of constitutional law) than the second (which focuses more squarely on landmark Supreme Court cases). I learned how to interpret the US Constitution in light of these various modalities, although I would have appreciated more of an opportunity to practice constitutional interpretation outside the relatively narrow context of the two exams and one (very short!) paper required in the class.",
    "So much about the constitution and it's framing\/ratification and how it affects us today",
    "Most importantly, you learn what constitutional decision making is all about. You also learn a lot of really interesting history and political science as well.",
    "This course offers a thorough introduction to the landmark constitutional cases that have shaped our nation's character. You will learn how to think about the law, interpret decisions, and think about the methods of legal argumentation.",
    "Such a great course taught by Professor Amar. He really cares about his students and truly loves Yale. I learned about how to be a closer reader, more critical thinker, and better citizen.",
    "Amar teaches you to think like a lawyer, historian, and political scientist all at once.",
    "I learned a lot about the constitution and thinking like a lawyer. This was a great introduction to what law school might be like. Challenging cases was also a developed skill.",
    "The course is very good introduction to how to think about law and analyze it. I think in general I have a much better understanding of what law school would be and I learned how of combine the modalities to make a compelling constitutional argument.",
    "I learned a lot about both legal reasoning and US history",
    "I got a comprehensive understanding of not just US law but also US politics and history. I also developed the skill of legal writing, which is very distinct from the kinds of writing I have done at Yale.",
    "Learned a lot of American history, learned what people actually mean when they say \"equal protection,\" learned how to read the constitution and how courts read it, etc.",
    "I actually learned a surprising amount of case law given that I never did the reading! You get a lot out of section.",
    "I learned about the Constitution, constitutional history, and the ways in which the past informs the present.",
    "Understanding of the constitutional history of some of the larger issues in discussion today, among which are race, sex, property and privacy.",
    "Since this was my first exposure to legal thought, I gained an entirely new framework for critically evaluating political issues, and learned to follow the development of constitutional interpretation across political eras.",
    "learned about con law",
    "What makes Con Law such a great course is that you not only read the Constitution and some of the most important cases in American history (including many that are not well known but super interesting nonetheless), but you also get to learn a lot about US history. Professor Amar and the TFs are extremely knowledgeable and lead class in a way that encourages you to think about individual cases while tracing the broader themes\/trends in constitutional interpretation throughout history.",
    "I gained a deep, rich, and memorable understanding of the United States Constitution. This was my first exposure to U.S. government and I am so grateful it was with this course. I learned about KEY cases in U.S. history and, honestly, think that I left the class as a more rounded thinker. I will definitely take this class with me long after Yale.",
    "Understanding of US Con Law, and methods of constitutional interpretation. Actually learned quite a bit this class",
    "Historical thinking, law analysis, critical reading",
    "I learned to think about the law in a totally new way, which thus changed the way I look at politics and current events in America. Amar teaches it in a very current way, applying what we learn to current questions of constitutional law (i.e. Trump's special counsel, Bob Mueller, was a frequent topic of conversation).",
    "I gained an overview of the most important themes and cases in constitutional law. I also learned how to read cases and approach evaluating the constitutionality of a law, ruling, decision, etc.",
    "Con Law is a beast. There is so much to learn, and the more you learn, the more you realize how intricate, interesting, and intimidating the material all is. You learn about gov't branches besides the Supreme Court, and read about cases that have present-day value. It's all information I'm glad to have. I took the class, in part, to see if law school would be something I'm interested. After taking Con Law I know there are parts of law school that I would both love and hate.",
    "This course teaches the invaluable skills of constitutional interpretation and constitutional legal history. It is both informative from an intellectual standpoint and practical for citizens who participate in our constitutional system.",
    "This course teaches students to understand current and historical concepts and events through the underpinnings of the Constitution.",
    "I have learned to use properly the modalities of Constitutional interpretation. I have taken this class to know whether law school was for me. I have really been encouraged to pursue this study. I have learned how to make Constitutional arguments and I have really enjoyed it.",
    "This course led me through the most important Supreme Court cases in our nation's history but also gave me the tools to analyze them as a constitutional lawyer. I learned how to look at a case and analyze its constitutionally through a historical, structural, doctrinal, ethical, prudential, and textual lens. I learned how to spot issues in legal cases, provide rationality with the tools given, apply that rationality to the case, and give a conclusion.",
    "I learned so much about the Constitution. Prof Amar really managed to simultaneously pack in a bunch of information as well as creative a cohesive narrative about the course.",
    "Learned so much about Constitutional history and analysis. Also just a lot our form of government as a whole (since that was all laid out in the Constitution). And it was very balanced and observed the perspective of both sides, which I think is essential somewhere like Yale; there are so few opportunities to engage with conservative politics, and guess what guys, if you're going to make it politically you're gonna have to understand and deal with it. So instead of saying it's problematic or whatever, try to understand the very essential points presented in tension with your own, and then if you still think you're right you'll be better off for knowing how better to engage with (preferably) and beat (if necessary) the other side. I'd say this is practically a must-take for anyone who wants to be informed about politics at all. Take it Cr\/D for the lectures if you don't want to put that much effort into the reading, but take it!",
    "I learned so much about American history, political science, and most importantly, Constitution from this course. It was extremely rewarding to have such a multi-dimensional course of my senior year.",
    "This class was a basic survey of constitutional law -- I now feel comfortable discussing iconic historical SCOTUS cases, reading Supreme Court cases, discussing modalities of constitutional decision making, and looking at legislation\/government decisions and answering \"Does this seem constitutional?\"",
    "I learned how to interpret the constitution and developed important skills such as close reading.",
    "I feel as though I learned not only about the Constitution of the United States and the judicial system, but also the overall American political system. My ability to analyze text and make connections has improved because of this course.",
    "I learned how to make a legal argument, and learned some of the key constitutional cases.",
    "How constitutional law works. Literally, how these decisions get made and how many factors go into the reasoning and even how often they get it wrong.",
    "This course introduced me to the various methods of constitutional interpretation and the strategies behind reading legal texts. It also presented a summary of the most influential court cases and constitutional issues, as well as provided an analysis of constitutional structure and significance.",
    "I learned how to read more critically and I obviously learned much more about the provisions of our constitution, specifically as applied to the distribution of power among the three branches since we spent the most time on that.",
    "Wow. What a course! Prior to taking this course I had only flirted with the idea of law school. Now, I know I have an interest in the law. The class challenged and enlightened me. I now have developed an eye for legal argumentation.",
    "You'll learn about landmark cases in US history.",
    "- Skills in constitutional interpretation. Writing memos, opinions and being able to look at cases through different lenses of constitutional interpretation",
    "Good for basic insight into Amar's take on Con Law",
    "History, ideology, structure of US constitution.",
    "Through this course, I was able to absorb a large body of Constitutional caselaw (much of which I had not seen in previous courses), gain a stronger literacy with the processes of legal argumentation, and hone my analytical skills in writing.",
    "I became more familiar with the basic jurisprudence of constitutional law specifically, separation of powers and equal protection doctrine. I also got a sense of the different \"modalities\" of constitutional law that Professor Amar emphasizes throughout the course that is, different ways of *doing* constitutional law, different ways of analyzing.",
    "Constitutional Law provides students with an overview of the Constitution, and its different interpretations and applications. I learned how to analyze case law, haw lawyers do constitutional law, and the role the constitutional plays in our judicial system.",
    "This course introduced me to the skills of reading court cases and using them to formulate well-rounded legal arguments. This course helped me to view a lot of current hot topics through the lens of constitutional law rather than partisanship or any other popular perspective.",
    "I learned that Law (the Constitution) is very complicated.",
    "I learned how a law school course would flow and how to analyze cases according to a law school mentality.",
    "I learned how to read a legal opinion, as well as how to interpret the Constitution and constitutional issues.",
    "Not actually sure. I guess I'm sure I want to head to law school now.",
    "I learned how to read large amounts quickly and pick out important information and how to analyze constitutional issues using my own knowledge and techniques introduced in the course.",
    "Great at teaching you the bare-bones of how to read and argue cases.",
    "I learned about the different processes of Constitutional interpretation, I gained familiarity with how to read and understand Supreme Court decisions, I learned United States history, and I learned how to understand Constitutional nuances.",
    "Familiarity with Amar's Text\/History\/Structure based approach to constitutional interpretation, understanding of important constitutional issues like equal protection and Congressional power, understanding of model constitutional debates over abortion, affirmative action, etc.",
    "This was an overview of the field of constitutional law. It will discuss a variety of issues, including federalism, separation of powers, and civil rights. Based on this course, I got an excellent understanding of these topics, and I am prepared to take more advanced courses.",
    "The full canon of constitutional law, and the methods of constitutional interpretation and argument. Read some of the most famous cases and looked through the transition and change of the constitutional doctrine on a variety of topics.",
    "I know a lot about American constitutional history and read a lot of interesting Supreme Court cases.",
    "I was introduced to the study of the law",
    "A gem of a Yale College class - the opportunity to dive this deeply into constitutional law with one of the world's leading scholars is such a gift.",
    "All about con law.",
    "In taking this course, you learn what to look for when reading court cases, and the legal terminology that accompanies such reading. Even more so, you learn American legal history and the evolution of how the Constitution has been interpreted, which I found extremely fascinating.",
    "This class was amazing! It completely changed my perspective on the American political and legal system. Professor Amar is a brilliant lecturer and if you do the readings, youll learn a lot about how the law works. Youll learn how to analyze cases and apply them to current politics. Everyone should take this class!",
    "This course provided great, in-depth insight into different modalities of constitutional interpretation and the evolution of judicial construction of different clauses and portions of the Constitution over time. From looking at pivotal cases defining, or attempting to define, the three branches of the federal government, to the application of different portions of the Constitution to discuss issues of property, gender, sexuality, and privacy, this class was a great survey course of constitutional interpretation over the ages--and how it is relevant today. We weren't just looking at the decisions that were made, but how these decisions were argued and the fallout for judicial precedent that they set.",
    "I learned about the constitution and how to read, interpret, and apply it to policy issues.",
    "This class takes you through the landmark cases in US constitutional law. You gain a working knowledge of how to read these cases both as opinions in themselves and as decisions in relation to each other, understanding how the US constitution has evolved, situated in political and cultural context.",
    "This course is a wonderful introduction to constitutional law. It debunks many commonly-held misconceptions about the constitution and shows how truly democratic the constitution really is. I now have a much deeper understanding of the constitution and how to apply it, and I learned how to develop a well-reasoned constitutional argument.",
    "I learned a lot about the basics of constitutional law, the history, and how it applies to current day matters. I also gained valuable insight about how to analyze and create different arguments in different modalities.",
    "Constitutional Law is so important to being an informed citizen. It is interesting and revealing about how our country works and was formed. The syllabus is very accurate. Amar has been teaching this forever.",
    "Constitutional Law helps you to frame citizens' rights and broader government questions in light of the constitution and past cases. The course pushes you to think like a lawyer by considering legal modalities to analyze situations and overall to think logically.",
    "I developed an ability to read and analyze supreme court decisions and gained a breadth of foundational knowledge of court precedent in key areas of constitutional decisionmaking. I gained insight into the historical context of the constitution itself and the decisions that have shaped our country, as well as insight into the role of court doctrine in the operation of our government."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The sections are the clear strengths. The TAs are amazing and I don't know a single person who attended section who did not thoroughly enjoy it. Every week saw rewarding discussion and an opportunity to have our questions answered. Even though it was a lot, I also found the cases interesting to read. The weakness was the lecture. Amar is a very charismatic lecturer, but that doesn't save his lectures from repetitiveness and disorganization. I found myself so confused by lecture that I often wouldn't come. Amar would often talk about the same thing over and over again for a half an hour so that many students would simply zone out.",
    "The class is very accommodating to the students: if you are a test taker, you have the in-class exam option; if you are an essay writer, you can take the 24-hour take-home exams, and both are open notes.",
    "The strengths of this course are that Professor Amar is accessible (both through office hours and lunches), and the TAs that are extremely knowledgeable, personable, and willing to offer advice. Law is law, and it is pretty straight forward. You are either learning how it operates or you aren't. What I found most interesting was when Amar would play devils advocate in class, or when we would discuss the morality of laws or court decisions with our TA. I also loved when Philip Bobbitt and Steven Calabresi came in for guest lectures- that was an experience you only get here at Yale.",
    "Strengths: You will learn so much, TAs are very helpful Weaknesses: A LOT of reading",
    "I think the course could be more organized. Other than that it was really great!",
    "Passionate, leading scholar in Constitutional Law, fascinating approach to Constitutional law that actually makes sense, provides a holistic understanding to the basics of the Constitution, American History, Political theory, etc. One of the best courses I have taken thus far at Yale. Weaknesses: a lot of reading",
    "Amazing lectures and tiered engagement system (minimum workload is a midterm, 5 page paper and final, no section)",
    "The course is taught well, although Professor Amar (like many male professors of a certain age) can get rather off-color at times. The reading load is heavy, but most of it is supplementary to the actual content of the course you don't have to do nearly as much as is suggested. The (optional) section is a lot of fun, but the TFs could perhaps do a better job of covering the material more comprehensively. In general, an excellent course of which it's quite true that \"you get out what you put in\" all the assigned reading, although you certainly don't need to read it all to succeed in class, is quite interesting to think about, and helps to put the lectures in a broader (philosophical, historical) perspective.",
    "Strengths: Teaches students how to make and assess arguments based on the Constitution, as opposed to just having the Constitution explained by the professor\/TFs; Professor Amar and the TFs are fantastic; allows students to get out of the course what they want to get out of it Weaknesses: Tough to say there really are any, given that it is what students make of it",
    "The biggest strength of this class is by far the sections. The lectures were often disorganized and off-topic. The sections provided structure and clarity to the material, and were where I learned the most in this class. Amar has many interesting theories about constitutional law and interpretation, but it was rarely tied to the actual material on the syllabus.",
    "Lots of readings!",
    "At times, it felt like we didn't cover anything of substance in lecture, focusing more on Amar's musings more than the actual case law. That being said, it's still a fantastic course, and the hype around it is certainly well-deserved.",
    "More assessment along the way would be helpful. I felt like Amar's lectures were interesting to my world view but most of my learning happened in section when there was an opportunity to put cases in conversation and tease them apart.",
    "The lectures were a bit hard to follow sometimes, but it was usually because professor Amar was so excited about what he was teaching that he jumped around a little. However my TF did an incredible job of filling in any holes and helping us through the parts we didn't fully cover in class.",
    "The material is interesting and relevant and the lectures offer interesting insights into the readings. It made me consider going to law school!",
    "Most of the readings felt really worth it. The 25 minute review at the beginning of each lecture felt like a waste of time very often.",
    "Amar sometimes rambles for a while, and it's not until section that you get into the nitty-gritty of the cases for the week. Also it'd be great if all the gender, sexuality, and privacy cases weren't crammed into the last week of class.",
    "I liked the formation of the lectures. The only weakness was the insane amount of reading!",
    "The course is a heavy reading course with optional weekly sessions to discuss and synthesize the material. The lectures are fascinating and engaging, and the reading is wonderful though daunting.",
    "My section was absolutely exceptional and crucial to my enjoyment of the course - it helped distill the narrative Professor Amar taught in class, helped me understand how to trace the evolving legal frameworks and importance of various constitutional clauses, and gave me a chance to think through cases more clearly. I loved lecture because I thought Professor Amar brought incredible enthusiasm for the material and did a great job of tying in historical context and current issues, but it often left my head spinning - I wish the lectures were more organized and less repetitive, and I wish I had more guidance from Professor Amar on which readings were most critical.",
    "Strengths: interesting subject matter, passionate professor, good organization\/structure of the material Weaknesses: too much reading, lecture sometimes is all over the place.",
    "Professor Amar's lectures and the discussion sessions were both excellent. Professor Amar brings so much passion, knowledge, and enthusiasm to every class that he manages to make his lectures not only interesting and informative, but really fun to listen to. Furthermore, the amount of care that Professor Amar has for his undergrad students, even though he does not interact with us 1-on-1 that often, and for Yale as a whole was abundantly obvious (and very heartwarming). My only criticism of lecture would be that it was sometimes a bit disorganized, which could at times make it difficult to take notes but didn't detract from the class overall. Con Law was also the first class where I enjoyed going to discussion section. My TF raised such interesting questions and always got me to think about things that I hadn't noticed when I first read a case. Section was really one of the best parts of the course. A general criticism is that the pace of the reading really picks up in the middle of the semester, and can become quite unmanageable. For any given section of the syllabus, the number of pages assigned between the case book and Professor Amar's books was probably close to (if not greater than) 200 pages. Not all of this was discussed in section or lecture, so I feel like the amount of reading could be pared down a bit.",
    "At times, lecture was a little rushed for such big topics like abortion and gay marriage. I wish that we had an extra semester almost. That being said, I did learn a lot in that time. Note-taking on a laptop is a must and super helpful for the exams.",
    "Great class, lots of readings, lecture could be better though. Maybe some slides or some background to help keep students engaged? Akhil is a very well read and intelligent person, his lectures are just terribly hard to follow.",
    "More engaging and coherent lectures.",
    "It's a great course, but very intense, with a lot of work. It isn't good or bad, just the reality, but I don't know that everyone understands this beforehand.",
    "Lectures are really spotty. Prof. Amar, frankly, doesn't seem prepared for his lectures, and if you haven't done the reading\/have good background knowledge of the cases, you will be super lost as he rambles. That's not to say he doesn't have moments of brilliance, when his insights will seem as profound as they actually are. Amar has a unique view of the Constitution, and has made a career from being a liberal Originalist, so taking his class is a special opportunity. The thing is, you could just read his (five!!!) books which he assigns and get the same examples, the same arguments, and even the same jokes, in well-organized paragraphs. Section makes or breaks the class. All that said, the richness of the material, and the nature of the courseCon Law at a near-law-school level for undergradsmakes it so I'd definitely take it again.",
    "The course is grounded in history and thoroughly covers the subject of constitutional law. More importantly though, it consistently proves its relevance to contemporary issues. The accessibility of such a brilliant scholar is something everyone should take advantage of.",
    "Prof. Amar is a dynamic powerhouse in front of not only congress, but also his classroom!",
    "A strength is that it is very engaging at point. However I did not feel the need to go to every lecture. I didn't fear that I would miss information because at times it seemed irrelevant to the midterm and final. A weakness is that Amor used a lot of constitutional jargon that went past me at points. Some language and vocabulary was difficult to explain and hard to grasp at many points.",
    "I felt the TAs were not committed to helping with my learning experience and with the challenges I had. I felt like my lack of understanding was interpreted by some of the TAs as laziness.",
    "Strengths: AKHIL REED AMAR. AMAZING TA'S. GENUINELY INTERESTING TOPICS. Seriously, the course was so, so engaging, and Professor Amar cannot be beat. He genuinely cares about what he's teaching and that you get the best possible understanding of the American constitutional tradition. Weaknesses: the super duper vague prompts for the short-response paper and long-paper. The lack of comments\/feed-back on either of the papers.",
    "While this course is very well taught, I processed most of the material in section. The section leaders themselves are great teachers and the discussions held in section really helped to solidify the cases. I would say the greatest harm would be to not read the cases.",
    "The course material was really engaging. Slightly clearer lecture structure would have been helpful.",
    "Amar is excellent, everyone knows that. He's elitist and a bit of a snob about some things, which I actually love in a professor when he actually knows what he's talking about, which Amar does. But do be prepared for that. I love how he interacts with both conservative and liberal views despite being more liberal himself (he does have some \"radically liberal\" views among constitutional scholars, but I'd say he's even shaded a little to the right by the standard of Yale profs. I wish that the latter half of the term had dealt more with the cases. The lectures started to become more abstract and talk more about other issues than just the cases. While that was interesting, I wish the cases had been covered better, and unfortunately I think people started to realize that what was being covered in lectures wasn't necessarily going to be on the exam and therefore stopped coming :( Also maybe this is a tad unfair, but I do think it's a bit tacky to make us buy several books authored by the professor of the course. I'm sure I never even opened at least two of them, and I did well in the course. They can be helpful, but I'd say don't buy TCT or LOTL right away--if you feel like you need more material then get them on Amazon later, but odds are you won't have the time or necessity of reading them. I do wish also that the exams were a touch shorter, just because I felt very rushed doing the 75min\/3.5 hour options and did not have room in my schedule to do the longer ones since I had other exams going on. Plus I don't think anyone should even have the option spend that long on that exam; no way your brain can function for that long, and if you aren't able to answer the questions in the time given then you probably just didn't learn what you needed to.",
    "The course is structured under themes and thus connects various dots nicely. I do think sometimes the professor lingered on one topic for too long that the readings could not match the lecture progress. I would suggest have a more reasonable reading pace in general so that students can have a better grasp of the course materials.",
    "A strength of this course is that Professor Amar really knows so much about constitutional law, and it seems like all of the TFs were really well chosen to lead compelling discussions sections. (Choosing to be in a discussion section was one of the best choices I made!) A weakness of this class was that we spend a really really really long time on the first cases of the semester, but by the end of the semester, we were assigned an unrealistic number of cases to read each week. I wonder if there is a way in future years to either rearrange the assignments so that the syllabus is not so back-loaded, or just to cover fewer cases near the end of the course so we can engage with the race-related and gender-related material on an equally deep level.",
    "The lectures were extremely interesting and therefore engaging, but at times i would say the syllabus was difficult to follow and it was tough to determine which readings were due when. The section I was a part of also failed to facilitate my learning.",
    "The material of this course is very interesting, if you want to learn that kind of thinking. The lectures, however, were very disorganized and hard to follow and did not feel like they explained or enhanced the material very well.",
    "I believe this class's syllabus could benefit from some critical editing. There was so much reading that even the TF's would advise us not to bother with the supplementary books (i.e. only the case-book is of any importance, don't waste your money on the others) or miniscule cases. It would help everyone if the Professor narrowed the reading down a little, thus providing more room to engage with the material. For example, the last two weeks of classes were extremely interested, but you understand how difficult it could be to learn all of discriminatory Constitutional case law in 4 lectures. Likewise, I and others thought that the final exam was poorly written, vague in language which can be a detrimental offense for a class and Constitution that is grounded by the nuances of language.",
    "I think this course is fine",
    "One of the greatest strengths of the course is the passion and brilliance of the TF cohort. Weaknesses include the lecture style and the books that are \"required\" for the course. None of the books, other than the casebook, were necessary for the course.",
    "Given the structure of the course, it is very easy to credit\/d the course and not be engaged with the material.",
    "The course was well designed in the sense that lectures were interesting, sections were incredibly helpful in understanding, clarifying, and digesting the material, and the exam\/paper requirements were reasonable. However, the biggest weakness was the courses organization. The syllabus broke readings up into very large chunks to be covered over a few weeks. This made it very easy to fall behind\/feel overwhelened and be unsure of what readings were going to be covered in each class.",
    "Lectures could be more structured and outlined by giving handouts. Great course that will help you develop interest in law school.",
    "It would serve the class if he tried to make his lectures more streamlined and dove right into the material, instead of reviewing (and blustering) for the first 20ish minutes of class.",
    "Strengths: Very fascinating caselaw and other material, the ability to scale the course to your preferences (a relaxed Credit-D course versus an intense yet rewarding graded course, in-class versus take-home exams), excellent TFs, and, interestingly, a midterm and final that were both manageable and enjoyable to take. Weaknesses: Prof. Amars lectures, while engaging, are often meandering and hard to follow if you are not sitting at the front of the lecture hall. And of course, based on the constraints of the course, I felt that there was a lot of interesting caselaw that we didnt get to cover in the But I dont these detract from the course significantly (especially if you have a good TF as I did).",
    "I think the sections are the strongest aspect of the course. The lectures at times can hit a high note and be excellent, but the problem, at least for my learning style, is that it felt like a lot repeated. The first 30 minutes would be a recap of the past week's lecture, which is some sense is great in reinforcing the material, but I would not be able to focus through this bit. I think it would be helpful if the lectures did less repetition to focus on the great material and Professor Amar's insights!!",
    "Many people are frustrated by this class because it is spent engaging with Professor Amar's interpretation of the Constitution. However, I actually think this is a strength of the class. The Constitution is designed to be interpreted, there's no such thing as a interpreted understanding. I think it's incredibly worthwhile to learn and understand how the Constitution can be interpreted, and how complex and developed these ideas can be. Students will only be able to form their own opinions and interpretations if they understand how this can be done, and how in-depth of an analysis it requires. I was very impressed with the lectures, and I think the class is fantastic. The only weakness is there is too much reading.",
    "The Teaching Fellows and sections are huge strengths of this course. Sections helped simplify and contextualize the dozens of cases that we learned, and the TFs help students prioritize which cases to more carefully read as well as give back very clear feedback. A weakness of the course is that Professor Amar fell behind at the beginning, and the lectures at the end of the semester felt incredibly rushed as a consequence.",
    "Too many readings to focus on",
    "It had an unreasonable amount of reading and did not focus on teaching each case well enough to have a great understanding of them. However it did allow me to learn about much more than just constitutional law and is one of the only opportunities that undergrad students have the chance to mirror law school.",
    "I found the material to be interesting once I actually did the reading, but the reading in general was too long and too dry for me to read it throughout the semester. Lecture was generally rambling and unfocused.",
    "I don't even know. This man really needs to add some structure to the course.",
    "Overall, I thought the structure of the course and the fact that the exams were take home were great strengths. I think it would be helpful, however, if the syllabus more clearly delineated which specific readings were due before each lecture, because I found that if I had not done the correct readings I was completely lost.",
    "The class needs more time discussing the cases and less of the professors interesting, but time consuming opinion.",
    "The strength is in the instruction. The weakness is that it is not offered every semester.",
    "Main strength is Amar. He's super dynamic and passionate, he knows and has an opinion about all things constitutional. He takes it beyond merely memorizing important cases to really digging deeply into the issues. Main weakness is organization. Lectures have a tendency to come unmoored from the syllabus. It's usually unclear what we are going to talk about before we come to class, which makes the incentive to do the reading even lower. Also too much reading is assigned (not all that much of it is important), so even if you want to, it's hard to know what to focus on.",
    "The professor was incredibly passionate about the material, and it showed. The lectures were excellent. I loved that he was willing to get lunch with the students after class, and I benefited from these discussions.",
    "This is a very well oiled class and works very well.",
    "Strength: the section is good in helping us know more about the course materials Weakness: chance to interact with Prof. Amar is a bit limited",
    "The strength of this course lies truly in the sections. It is here that you learn the real meat of constitutional law. In lecture, you primarily listen to Amars many theories of th court, jurisprudence, history, interpretation, etc.",
    "This course is amazing :)",
    "My TA was awesome. Professor Amar spends the first 30 minutes repeating everything he said in the previous lecture.",
    "This course provides an excellent introduction to the theories and methods of constitutional law, enabling students to become independent thinkers. I also appreciated learning about how all three branches are constitutional actors, rather than focusing on the Supreme Court. I wished the lectures for the course were a bit more clearly organized; I think this could be fixed just by posting some sort of handout with an outline for each lecture that students could use to structure their notes.",
    "Professor Amars teaching was very engaging, and the way he links current issues and events to the constitutional questions of the past is fascinating.",
    "Although Prof. Amar's lectures were very engaging, he often spent more time discussing current events than the material we had to read for the week. As such, in the 1 hr and 15 min lecture (which always felt a bit too long), only about 40 minutes were left to discuss material which would easily have taken up the entire lecture. As such, the material always felt rushed and was very hard to take notes on, as Prof. Amar would jump around from case to case and to his own experience, never really following a clear structure. As such, I found it was more helpful to take comprehensive reading notes and section notes, and mainly just listen in lecture while jotting down a few main points.",
    "Professor Amar is gem and the syllabus is great! Youll end this class way more knowledgeable about American government. All of the things we covered were fascinating, especially towards the end when we started talking about race and gender. One weakness is that theres so much material that it can feel rushed at times. Exams were also interesting and fair, but the grading is somewhat subjective so you can get screwed if you get a hard grader.",
    "I honestly loved this course immensely. Lectures were fun and engaging, and really brought life to the cases that we read in the casebook. Sections as well were extremely helpful in clarifying the evolution of constitutional doctrine (very confusing at times with the ways the Court reverses itself or changes course) and a great opportunity to ask questions, though Professor Amar was also receptive to questions during lecture. Overall, I thought the course really covered its ground in terms of support for the student and making sure that the student was engaged in the level of learning that they wanted. The syllabus was fantastic and I enjoyed learning every portion of it.",
    "Strengths: The syllabus is fantastic. The readings from Professor Amar's red book and his five authored books are fascinating and intellectually engaging. Professor Amar's lectures were at times disorganised, though, and were diluted versions of the thought and insights presented in his books.",
    "This course's two central strengths are its professor and its TFs. Professor Amar is a brilliant, charismatic man who delivers consistently engaging lectures. He explains things in a style that is both clear and passionate. The TFs, too, are wonderful; they are all experienced law students who are deeply committed to helping you succeed.",
    "This is a truly well crafted course in that any student will get out of it how much they want to put in. Lectures were engaging, section truly supplemented lecture and I looked forward to each class.",
    "Lectures were sometimes hard to follow and sometimes scattered especially without slides, but overall, the course was strong in the way that it touches on broad constitutional questions with cases and close readings of the law.",
    "I thought the course was great overall, in particular the ordering of the units and cases. I appreciated the foundation that was built early on that prepared me for the cases we covered later in the course. One improvement might be spending slightly less time on the first court cases (Marbury, McCulloch, and Powell) in order to leave a couple of extra class days at the end for topics that felt rushed (privacy and sex discrimination, in particular)."

   "comments": [
    "Yes! But only if you take the section and have some vague notion that you are interested in the american legal system.",
    "Yes, especially if you are considering law school and\/or don't know anything about constitutional decision-making (me). I learned to think in a completely different way by the end of this class, and I still have with me Amar's books which I plan to keep for a while.",
    "Yes! One of those must-take courses at Yale.",
    "YES. Take this at some point definitely. It will change the way you think about current events and their relationship with U.S. History.",
    "Amazing class, Amar clearly loves the Constitution, the TAs are absolutely fantastic, it is the sort of class that gives you insight to politics, America, and the world in a way you didn't know was possible",
    "A great 5th course if you don't want to do the reading. I learned a ton. Must take while at Yale.",
    "I would definitely recommend it especially if you're a US national, since a lot of this stuff is pretty basic civics knowledge that most of us should know and don't; but also if you're not, and want to learn more about how the American legal system is implemented and theorized in the various branches of government.",
    "Yes! Super interesting and engaging class - Amar is a great lecturer who is obviously extremely passionate. There are a LOT of assigned readings, but it isn't actually necessary to do every single one in order to get a lot out of this class. I took it Cr\/D and didn't do most of the readings and now I wish that I had taken it for a grade because if you go to section you learn a lot and end up doing well anyway. 100% recommended!",
    "Hell yes! You will learn not only what the Constitution actually says, but also how historical, political, and social factors have affected its interpretation over time, as well as how judges use the Constitution to make court decisions. You will get out of the course what you put in. Definitely recommend doing it credit\/d.",
    "I would recommend this course to other students, with some reservations. I did not find the lectures particularly helpful, and the amount of reading and material was daunting. The section helped immensely with both of these things and would not recommend taking this course without a section. I found the material in this course to be very interesting, and something that everyone should be moderately familiar with. However, I would not necessarily recommend the lecture component of this course. Additionally, I would highly recommend at least starting off this course as Credit\/D\/Fail, as there is a large amount of reading required.",
    "Yes",
    "Take it. You won't regret it.",
    "Perfect for a credit D. The exams are open-note, open-internet and based on the cases that are described in detail online\/on the many \"con law bibles\" that you can get from friends. Optional section. Optional essay that can only improve your grade.",
    "If you are interested in going to law school, interested in American history, like the play Hamilton, or enjoying mingling with the law school's best, take this class. If you are not interested in the American legal system and don't like to read, don't take this class.",
    "Yes! I think it is a topic everyone should have some understanding of and this class teaches it in an engaging and accessible way.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course, I feel I learned more about history and the US government than ever before.",
    "Fantastic. Life-changing. If you are or have ever been even slightly interested in government or decision-making or just society in general, do not leave this university without taking Amar's course. You dont have to be an aspiring law student. You dont have to know how government works. Professor Amar teaches so much more than law (and he teaches it, and law, very effectively); he teaches history, critical reading, and above all, how to see the forrest through the trees when considering modern issues in a constitutional context. Amar is astonishingly knowledgeable -- to learn from him is to learn from arguably the most talented, renowned, and passionate constitutional scholars of our time. This is not overstatement. Learning from him is one of the opportunities that truly makes Yale such a spectacular place to study.",
    "Yes if you're interested in the subject matter but it's a large lecture class so beware of that.",
    "Yes - You will be surprised by how much you learn. Seems like a class that's much easier to take when you're an upperclassman rather than a freshman or sophomore. The first 25 minutes of lecture is a review of the previous class, and the next 50 minutes is new material. Midterm and final are fine but take some studying. Reaction paper is pretty lax.",
    "Would recommend. Definitely enroll in a section, preferably with one of the head TAs, who really know their stuff. Section is where all the real learning happens. It's also a class where you can study hard (read all the cases front to back and the supplemental reading) or study smart (skim cases and case briefs after the lectures on them so you know what to look for).",
    "Yes! Constitutional law is a Yale bucket list course for a reason!",
    "I would recommend this course to any student at Yale because of the sheer relevance of the issues discussed, and the ability to argue some of the points from the authority of the Constitution is very useful.",
    "This is an outstanding course, but I think it's important to understand that the learning experience in ConLaw is fairly unconventional, and what you get out of the class will vary widely depending on your engagement. I learned the crux of the material in my section, which was for me an essential part of the class; the lectures were freewheeling and often hard to follow but still well worth attending - they provided valuable historical context and helped me connect the cases to current political issues. It's really tough to get all of the reading done, but working with your TF to figure out which cases are most essential, you can at least figure out how best to supplement class and section. Whether you're thinking about law school or you just care about politics, this course will provide you with a valuable new lens for thinking through political issues from a scholar who lives and breathes the material and a TF who will likely be a diligent teacher and incredible resource for you, so I'd recommend it.",
    "Yes absolutely everyone should take it but I would not recommend doing it credit\/D as I did. Gives you excuse to do none of the (fascinating) reading which translates to not knowing what is going on in the class a month in and being overwhelmed and tuned out in lecture. I got something out of this course but you'll definitely get so much more out of it if you prioritize it in your schedule and put in the effort (will be one of the most rewarding experiences probably although who knows I'm credit\/D'd it).",
    "This course is a Yale classic and an absolute must for anyone who's interested in constitutional law (duh), US politics, and American history. It really is one of the best classes I've taken at Yale.",
    "Absolutely. I was nervous to take this course because I had ZERO (serious) exposure to U.S. history or government. I am SO happy I took it. While I kept the class Credit\/D, I honestly think that this was the best choice because I was able to take my time absorbing big legal topics and ideas. I do want to note that you do not NEED to take this class to go to law school. Law schools do not care what classes you take as an undergraduate, provided that you do well in them. Take this class if you honestly want to learn about the Constitution.",
    "Definitely take it. Just make sure you do the casebook readings, that is more important than going to lecture. Lecture is just Akhil rambling about his own opinions which helps, but just read the book. Lots of reading, but the grades are pretty easy to work around as they are determined by 3 take home tests\/exams",
    "This is a great course. It's absolutely worth taking. As everyone else says: Do it credit\/D. There just isn't enough time to do all the reading. That way, you can go to lecture and learn from Amar without feeling the stress of the exams, because they aren't easy. Also, sign up for a section, because that's where SO much of the learning takes place.",
    "Have a strategy if you're going to take this. Everyone and their sister will be credit d-ing the class, so either do that and coast, or, from the beginning, know that you'll have to grind. Be ready for frustrating lectures, and engage with your TA in sectionthey're the people who actually grade your work and teach you the finer points of the Con Law you cover. It's a unique Yale class that I'm really happy I took.",
    "Take this class. Take it credit\/d if you're intimidated, but take it anyway. It's hard to imagine how people participate in our constitutional system without the knowledge and skills that this class teaches. If you want to go into law, you need to take this class. If you're not sure, you need take this class. If you know you don't want to go into law, you need to take this class.",
    "Of course! This is an excellent course to take through the Credit\/D\/Fail option.",
    "As others have said before, be wary of taking this Credit\/D. The temptation to do absolutely nothing, and your ability to pass nonetheless, will result in your learning very little.",
    "I would recommend it if they took it Credit\/D\/Fail, as I did.",
    "Professor Amar is one of the greatest teachers I have had. If I could recommend anyone to take a class in constitutional law, I would recommend taking it from him. I am glad that he allowed me the privilege of taking this class. He was a great instructor and highly engaged.",
    "YES. MY GOODNESS. TAKE THIS COURSE. This is gonna be cliche, but I think this class has changed the trajectory of my life. Professor Amar is so engaging, and honestly his lectures were near inspiring (watch out for his lecture on why he votes). It's definitely a lot of work with hundreds of pages of reading per week, but this is one of the only courses at Yale I feel I've gotten exactly as much as I've put in. The tests are super similar to law-school tests and the different options are great for those who don't feel like they're strong sit-down-test-takers. Definitely take this course.",
    "I would strongly recommend this course to another student. As Professor Amar so often says, the Constitution was meant to be carried around and read by the common citizen, his point there being that we should all know the Constitution and the words upon which our country is founded. This course made me realize why that is true and in addition to the cases we covered, I learned so much about U.S. history and how our nation has arrived at where we are today.",
    "I learned so much from the course.",
    "Completely yes! Essential knowledge presented from an excellent professor. I can safely say that this is a course you come to Yale to take. But please, TAKE A SECTION!!!!!! By the second half of the term he was barely talking about the cases at all in lecture, and going to section was essential for actually discussing what went on in the cases, which is what you need to know for the exams. Plus the TF's are AMAZING because they're the top students (they all have clerkships coming up, which is basically the best you can do) at the top law school in the country. Other than that, the more you put into the course, the more you might get out, but I actually didn't think it was necessary to do all of the reading, and I still was doing well on the exams. So don't necessarily let the workload hold you back. However you would be well advised to brush up on your American history before taking this since he frequently invokes it. The first couple weeks will let you know if it will be easy or hard for you. Either you have the intuition to succeed in this class or you don't, and it doesn't change. So if you're clicking with it three lectures in then you'll be golden.",
    "I would strongly recommend this course to all Yale undergrads, regardless of your major, nationality, or class year.",
    "Take this course to be an informed resident of the United States! Now more than ever, I think it's important for people to understand what they mean when they say \"that's unconstitutional.\" And taking this class actually gives you some authority behind that statement. I've been surprised by how little I actually understood about past Supreme Court cases (even ones that I had technically studied in high school!) and I think that taking this course is bound to help you no matter what field you actually end up going into. Whether writer, doctor, or scientist, we all should understand that foundational document of the country we live in (including its good and very bad parts). Professor Amar's lectures are sometimes hard to follow, but the excellent TFs help clarify anything you're confused about. Sign up for a section!",
    "Yes, understanding Constitutional Law is vital to understanding American history.",
    "Yes.",
    "If you would like to learn how to make a legal argument, take the course. That kind of thinking can be fun. However, Amar's lectures are very disorganized and hard to follow, and that was pretty frustrating. The TFs though are generally great, so definitely sign up for a section and go.",
    "This is one of the must-take courses at Yale!",
    "Professor Amar is an entertaining and engaging lecturer. This course serves as an excellent introduction to the various methods of constitutional interpretation and structure, as well as to the strategies behind reading and studying legal texts. It also presents a summary of the most influential court cases and the most pressing contemporary constitutional issues. I took this course credit-d (would recommend), and I feel much more informed as an American voter and citizen.",
    "This course was extremely interesting, but Credit\/D-ing it allowed me the flexibility to engage with the cases to the extent I was satisfied and no more. There is so much reading in this class that if I attempted to do it all, I would have significantly impaired my ability to balance the rest of my classes. Professor Amar's lectures are also sometimes hard to follow. He's jumpy and there's no accompanying slideshow so it can be difficult to pull out which parts are important. The cases are super interesting but unfortunately it was only when cramming for the exams that I realized that.",
    "A must take class that if super doable due to the 8hr midterm and 24hr final options. Lots of people do it credit D which makes it a pretty good fifth class but its totally doable to do it for a grade, just make sure to read the most important cases and take good notes in lecture. Also, definitley sign up for a section! The TAs are great and do a great job of preparing you for the exams if you know how to ask the right questions.",
    "This is the perfect Credit\/D\/Fail class. You learn a lot; the lecturer is great, and section is fun (do the optional section!)",
    "If you're interested definitely take credit\/d! Not hard to get the credit at all! Honestly with doing the bare minimum you can easily get a B+\/A-! Just put in the time for the midterm and final (both open book\/notes\/internet and both offer longer take home options!) Paper was not hard! Although if you really wanna get the most out of the class definitely sign up for a section! I didn't take one and it made it very easy to not do any work throughout the semester!",
    "I would definitely recommend this class.I think many people take it because they feel like its one of those classes that they just should take in college, and after taking it, I still feel like thats true. It provides a pretty broad overview and intro to law, tying it in to American history, teaching about landmark cases, and facilitating comprehension of current political and legal situations.",
    "I will speak to international students thinking about taking this course. The course is not a history one, but heavily relies on knowledge of U.S. History and professor Amar assumes this knowledge in lecture. I recommend reading a U.S. history survey book before taking this course just to make sure you know terminology and famous events. Howard Zin's People's History of the United States is a good one and you can find a lot of survey books in the library. If you decide to take the course, just know that you are at disadvantage from the beginning because other students will be working with material that they have learned previously. That being said, I highly recommend this course because it changed the way I look at the United States, the constitution and human rights in general. Your TA will also be the best resource for you to make the course the most rewarding.",
    "Yes! I would definitely recommend this course to another student!! Professor Amar is great, and the material is really interesting.",
    "I took this course as a senior in light of its reputation as a Yale Bucket List course, and it definitely did not disappoint. The material is fascinating, giving you a chance to hear both Prof. Amars novel theories on cases youre likely familiar with (e.g. McCulloch v. Maryland) as well as absorb new and unfamiliar case law (especially with respect to the Commerce Clause, commercial law, and the Equal Protection Clause). The intensity of the course is very much geared to your preferencesit can be either a relaxed Credit-D or an intense graded coursebut if you have the room in your schedule you will almost certainly get more out of the course as a graded since the material is really fascinating (I for one wish Id had the schedule space to take it for a grade). Its for this reason that this is one of the few courses in which Ive actually enjoyed taking the midterm and finaleven if you havent been keeping up with the material that much, its really enjoyable in a take-home setting to trace out the progression of the case law and figure out how to synthesize and analyze it all. One of the greatest strengths of this course by far are the TFs, who are all extremely accomplished and talented (past winners of fellowships in the UK; editors with YLS top journals; going on to prestigious clerkships upon graduation, etc.). Your experience in the course should definitely revolve around section and trying to find a TF who fits your style of instruction (and maybe political persuasion). While shes graduating this year, my TF (Christina) was one of the best Ive had in my time at Yale. Her section took on more of a lecture format, and she did a really great job of helping break down, summarize and clarify a lot of daunting and confusing caselaw; held extended office hours before our assessments; and gave really helpful feedback on our assignments. The few downsides the course does have (i.e. the fact that lectures can be rambling at times and difficult to gleam material from, as well as the omission of a great deal of interesting caselaw) dont detract from it very much at all. I came in with only a marginal interest in the prospect of law school but now am considering it much more seriously. Prof. Amar tries to make the case in lecture that an understanding of the U.S. Constitution is an integral component of a liberal education, and Im fairly inclined to agree after the course.",
    "Yes, I would recommend the course if you're interested in constitutional argumentation and US history, particularly pertaining to slavery and race. That said, don't just take this course as a pre-law course, and don't always take Professor Amar's word as gospel. Other faculty in the law school lament that undergrads view this course as a prerequisite for law school, something that helps their applications, though it is not. They also lament this phenomenon because Professor Amar's view of the Constitution\/constitutional argument is idiosyncratic and us impressionable young undergrads often take it as if it were the truth. In particular, Amar has an extremely \"geostrategic\" view of the constitution: he practically defended Korematzu (the Supreme Court ruling upholding Japanese internment) and also talked about 9\/11 for two lectures without any mention of the aftermath of the attacks and the erosion of civil liberties and other constitutional rights in their name. He also seems to lack circumspection about his own patriotism that verges on American exceptionalism. Despite these issues, Professor Amar is indeed brilliant (he knows it) and definitely worth learning from. The course begins with a really in-depth look at McCulloch v Maryland and then from there picks up steam to go through cases really fast by the end. The best bet is to attend section religiously as the TAs are EXCELLENT and section goes over the cases you need to know much more clearly than the lectures do. You can get As on the exams without doing the readings if you are very diligent about section attendance and study well. When you study, the facts of each case are much less important than the holding\/reasoning of the case and what that case signified in terms of changing jurisprudence. Even though the exams are open-book\/note\/internet, you really have to know your stuff to be able to do well. On the exams, they'll write a fact pattern that brings up issues the class in different cases. The class is quite manageablein addition to the take-home midterm and final there's a small 5-page essay responding to any material you want from the first half of the course. Good 5th class, and of course, a good credit-d.",
    "Yes! This was my favorite class I've taken at Yale. I would definitely recommend it, but only because I love the Constiution and generally agree with Professor Amar. If you know it will bother you that he provides his own analysis and interpretation, don't take the class. However, if you are at all interested in Law School, you should definitely take it, it will be worth it. It's a great course to learn the basics of legal reading and writing.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course! It was very interesting and challenging to disregard my partisan views and instead to view current hot topics through the lens of written law.",
    "Maybe on a Credt\/D basis. Otherwise, it can definitely become overwhelming with all of the excessive readings.",
    "Yes, it was amazing. It should be a class that many people take",
    "Yes I would, it is a very interesting course in the long run.",
    "I would recommend it to anyone who thinks they want to go to law school, as it should offer you some clarity on that front. However, I was mostly disappointed by the class relative to its reputation. Lecture was rambling, the reading was boring, and the other students were fairly annoying.",
    "Nah, not really. You don't really get much from it.",
    "Absolutely. It is challenging and there is a significant amount of reading, but the material is interesting and the class itself is rewarding.",
    "Yes, I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. Professor Amar is incredible, and I learned so much about our Constitution, about how opinions are written, and about the incredibly close textual scrutiny that is required to ultimately enact sweeping laws. If you take this course, I definitely recommend you take a section, as section helped break down some of Professor Amar's rather complex and fast paced lectures.",
    "If you want to go to law school take the class, if not I would not recommend, not really the bucket list class everyone claims it to be.",
    "THIS IS A CLASS YOU NEED TO TAKE BEFORE YOU GRADUATE. Even if you are not interested in constitutional law as a career, I feel it may be your duty as a citizen or engaged person to understand how United States constitutional law works. I would highly suggest taking this class Credit\/D, sitting in the front row, and taking notes by hand. You will learn a lot more if you do that than if you read all the cases. It is incredible.",
    "It's great if you're interesting in law or gov't or if you have some background knowledge of constitutional law. I think if this were the first class on constitutional law I had taken, I would have felt adrift. On the other hand, if you don't mind Amar's rambling and highly opinionated style, you do get a lot out of it.",
    "Excellent course! One of my favorite at Yale. Should definitely take it before you graduate.",
    "Take this class!!! Learn American constitution in this day and age and know for yourself whether something is constitutional.",
    "I would recommend this course to pre-law students and those who are interested in American constitutional law.",
    "Take this course, but take it with a section. Lectures are engaging and entertaining, but I dont think I would have learned or retained much of the material without section and without doing the reading.",
    "If you put study in this class you will learn a lot. If you care about it it won't be hard.",
    "A gem of a Yale College class - the opportunity to dive this deeply into constitutional law with one of the world's leading scholars is such a gift. Take this class, and take it with the section! It's where much of the learning really happens. The exams aren't actually that difficult provided you're familiar with the cases and can brief them on your own (which actually isn't that time consuming). I took CR\/D but in hindsight wish I took letter grade. I think ~60% of the class receives A\/A-, which is quite generous, and *not* what I expected going into the course, based on its reputation. Definitely a must-shop whenever it's offered next. This stuff is so interesting and so important to know, especially these days.",
    "Might as well!",
    "Yes, a good class for humanities or stem majors; a chil, interesting credit\/d or fifth class",
    "I would recommend this course if you are interested in reading court cases and legal texts, and have room in your semester for a hefty workload. It is definitely possible to succeed in this class, it is just very time-consuming to do so. Prof. Amar is a bit more coherent in the books he wrote that he assigns the class to read than in his lectures, but still a very engaging lecturer. I took the class Cr\/D\/F, which I would certainly recommend at least starting the class off as until you have a better feel for how it works. It is definitely a unique class to be able to take as an undergraduate, and I think a helpful glimpse into the life of a law student (especially since the Teaching Fellows are all YLS students) if one is considering law school.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course, but students should be prepared for the amount of work. I took it Credit\/D, and I found that very helpful as it was easy to fall behind on the readings. There is a lot of reading. Professor Amar really wants to get to know his undergrad students, and his lunches were always informative and fun.",
    "Everyone should take this class! I know a lot of people take it Credit D and dont bother with the readings, but you really should. They can be dense, but theyre so interesting and youll get a lot more out of this class if you do. The cases are worth reading and youll learn more than just Professor Amara perspective. It will also help you during exams!",
    "Without a doubt, I think this is one of those classes at Yale that you must take before you graduate--especially with Professor Amar. I wrote in my Yale application that I wanted to take a class with Professor Amar, and I am so glad that I have finally had the chance to do so. An understanding and respect for the Constitution, as well as the ability to formulate your own opinions on its interpretation, is such a useful skill to have in your toolbox and will serve you well no matter where you end up--the Constitution remains so relevant today and continues to affect our lives immensely. This course was like no other I have taken at Yale, from the structure of the exams to the style of teaching, and I enjoyed every last bit of it. Professor Amar is such an engaging lecturer and really explains the material in a colloquial manner, while the TFs are all incredible, highly qualified individuals; all together, they made this course extremely enjoyable.",
    "Definitely one of those must take courses.",
    "Yes! I loved constitutional law. As an international student, it gave me an entirely new arsenal of tools to understand the United States of America. Constitutional law is a wonderful blend of history, philosophy and politics. Also, learning to read the law is an empowering skill. This class has invigorated my interest in law as a whole and inspired by aspiration to pursue law.",
    "Typically, when answering the question \"Would you recommend this course to another student?\", I say I would recommend the class to any person passionate about this subject or simply seeking to learn a bit more about it. Constitutional law is different. I firmly believe everyone should take this course. It will transform your understanding of the United States constitution and will debunk many commonly-held misconceptions you might have. You will learn to critically analyze constitutional reasoning; this will protect you from being duped by phony, threadbare arguments. You will learn to develop your own well-reasoned constitutional arguments, too -- so for any student hoping to later attend law school, I especially recommend this course. But it is truly for everyone. This is also one of the rare courses in which the level of intellectual rigor is flexible; it becomes what you make of it. Section itself is optional. Both the midterm and final exams give you two choices: you may either take the exam in the standard amount of time (75 minutes for the midterm\/3.5 hours for the final) or you can take the extended time option (8 hours for the midterm\/24 hours for the final). In all cases, the exam is open-open, open-universe, meaning you are allowed to use the internet, the textbook, and all other available resources (except consulting another student). The longer option, of course, demands a much longer, more circumspect, well thought-out argument, but I find that it's worth it. You work comfortably and unstressed, and you have time to think things through and say everything you'd like to say. The final extended essay is also optional. So if you want the most intellectually rigorous experience possible, you can take the section, choose both longer options for the exams, and do the final extended paper. Or, if you were to want a much, much easier class (that is nonetheless enlightening), you can also opt out of section, do the shorter exams, and not do the final paper. Those two experiences are dramatically different, but that's the beauty of this class. It can be what you want it to be. Con Law is truly fantastic. I cannot recommend it enough.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to any student, regardless of major. I learned so much about the principles upon which this country was founded upon. It's a really interesting class. Prof. Amar is a great lecturer, despite the fact that he tends to ramble a lot. All of the TA's are stellar; they really know what they're doing and truly supplement lectures. I would highly recommend every student to take this class before they leave Yale! 10\/10, would recommend.",
    "This is an incredible course. If you enjoy law or constitutional history, then you will love this course. It is engaging and very relevant to our everyday lives. There is a high level of reading required but you will enjoy this course regardless.",
    "Yes. Take Con Law, you silly goose. If years of good reviews aren't enough to help you decide I don't know what I can add. The syllabus is accurate and comprehensive. Great for future lawyers\/poli-sci majors as well as everyone else. Take a section if you can, especially if you actually want to take the class a little more seriously or even if you hate lecture-settings. The TAs are kind and knowledgeable and will help you through the class Cr-D or not. Go to lunch with Amar (if he's still around, you never know, he is committed to teaching this though).",
    "Yes, I would recommend this cause to a student especially if they are interested in law school. However, aside from this, the course helps to build rhetoric that can help in most situations that could help someone become a better voter by knowing their rights and past precedences.",
    "Definitely a Yale must-take! Professor Amar is a thoughtful professor who cares deeply about teaching this material, and as someone living in the United States, it is such an important course to take. You learn about the historical importance of the constitution on the world stage and how constitutional decisions have shaped court doctrine and this country's governmental operations. I would 100% recommend this class to anyone, regardless of major (I am not a PoliSci major myself).",
    "I would recommend this class, but I learned more by just reading the cases than going to lecture."
