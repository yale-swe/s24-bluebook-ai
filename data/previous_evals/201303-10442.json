   "comments": [
    "Totally recommend! It wouldn't be offered again, though, so that's a moot point.",
    "amazing prof with confused subject, course way too easy and confused",
    "JD isn't planning to offer this exact course again, but basically he's amazing and if you have the opportunity to take a course with him, do it. Cultural studies is SO interesting and he possesses an amazing ability to take dense theory and the lightest of pop culture and bring them together in an understandable way.",
    "This is a great course if you're really interested in JFK and the Assassination. I think this is the only time it's offered, but if it's offered again, I'd recommend the course. Really interesting - and the readings give you lots of freedom - he asks you to choose 2 novels (any novels you want about the JFK assassination) and write about them in short 5 page double-spaced essays. A warning - if you're not into culture or film studies, maybe don't take it. I thought the course was going to be centered on the assassination, but most of it was really the culture surrounding the aftermath of the assassination, and analyzing art, film, literature, and the media. Overall fun class. My favorite that I took this semester.",
    "Doesn't matter won't be offered again",
    "Won't be taught again, but Professor Connor is unambiguously brilliant.",
    "Yes",
    "I would recommend this class to those who are okay working through confusion and who are intrigued by the myth surrounding the Kennedy assassination. Submerging oneself completely in such a specific subject was a great experience. While the lectures sometimes asked one to stretch one's mind in an impossible way, most of the time the class involved an appropriate amount of brain stretching and resulted in new and interesting thoughts on the part of the student.",
    "This was, top to bottom, one of the weirdest classes I've ever taken. The lectures were weird (alternately brilliant and befuddling in their free-association style). The range of students was weird (including a couple of bona fide assassination theorists). The reading was weird. The assignments were weird. Most of the class did not understand the terms of the class, and this made sections occasionally tough and\/or depressing to sit through; then again, those terms were always shifting. But it was also kind of an adventure, and I had a lot of fun, and I think it did have a lasting influence on the way that I think about writing, and cultural studies more generally. Since this class isn't going to be offered again, I guess I'm just entering an eval into the record: you should take a class (a more traditional one, or maybe a reincarnation of this one) with JD.",
    "Anyone would enjoy this class, and I hope they offer it again. I saw it on two axes. First, this class is a pretty in depth look at the JFK assassination, and you will come away knowing far more about one of the highest profile and most written about events in recent American history. Second, the course is a really nice overview of what it means to study culture in the contexts of film and the media, which I didn't think I had any interest in as a science major but really enjoyed. The weekly film screenings are things you actually want to go and watch, and I have a vastly improved understanding of what it means to analytically watch a movie, documentary or newscast after this. Four very easy assignments and a highly thought provoking final paper, definitely optional reading although doing the reading can help for the assignments. Great class.",
    "Because the class will not be offered next semester, I have no need to recommend it to another student.",
    "Great class! Loved it!",
    "Yes! Great class, really well organized"
