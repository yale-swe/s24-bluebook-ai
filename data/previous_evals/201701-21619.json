    "In depth history and political histories in many countries in Africa; some touches in economics in terms of macroeconomic policies and basis of their economy Bigger emphasis on aid programs could be good in the future",
    "In this class I was able to develop skills in comparative politics through the consideration of several individual African political narratives as well as overarching themes.",
    "In addition to giving me a broad overview of Africa and development in general, this class helped me learn how to compare case studies. I came in with no previous knowledge of the region and was impressed by the range and depth of information over the course of the semester.",
    "I did not know a lot about Africa or implementing democracy and this was a great class to learn more about both of those things."

    "I would love for the course to have more weeks devoted to general leaning about development trends and more instruction from the Professor, and less time spent on students' presentations.",
    "Deep political backgrounds of each countries Strong comparative lessons Weaknesses: Lighter touch on economics and would've liked more",
    "The way the course is organized, each student is assigned a country to focus on throughout the class. Because of this, you learn so much about \"your\" country! However, I felt the class was lacking an overarching narrative. The readings were interesting, but participating with original comments was difficult due to my general lack of knowledge of the region before taking the class.",
    "Great seminar! Very interesting discussions every class. Material is always engaging."

   "comments": [
    "If this is your first fore into the subject, I think the course does a nice job introducing the continent from a macro perspective. If you're looking for a micro-deep-dive into the complexities of Africa, you're limited to your one choice of country. There is not enough time for a deep dive into all countries - and the contribution of others is going to be limited as well. It's not an \"answers\" class - your likely to leave the course with more questions than answers, but maybe that's not a bad thing.",
    "Yes! Definitely take if you want a good overall of political and economic issues in Africa",
    "This would be a great way to do a senior thesis in political science. It is also highly rewarding for students interested in gaining insights into the Sub Saharan African political climate.",
    "Great course!"
