   "comments": [
    "I would recommend it to other students but I would caution them that the instructor will tell them there will be little work and everyone should therefore take the class for credit, but the truth is that there is a lot of work, and you should only take it for credit if you have time and energy to do the work.",
    "a course that teaches you how to conduct regressions with multiple variables. It was helpful and I would recommend it to other students, but probably to audit instead of taking for credit.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to other students.",
    "recommendation:easy and pleasant course to learn the practical side\/appilcation of statisticsnot very work-intensive!",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course. It covers statistics which are not normally covered in basic stats courses, but the information is very useful for psychology research.",
    "I would recommend this class! this was a first year for it, so it will be even better in the future. I'm jealous of next year's students.",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend this course. A basic understanding of regression is very important for handling many kinds of data, and this course will not only give you a strong foundation in this area but also prepare you for learning more sophisticated techniques if the need arises.",
    "Yes, I would highly recommend it for every psychology graduate student -- I have already found it extremely useful.",
    "I would recommend it to another student, but was also hoping for a little more from the class. I think sometimes the information wasn't clearly presented and so for example, on the midterm, don't feel like it was ever stated that Sobel's test is not useful and shouldn't be used anymore even though we spent a good deal talking about it. But in addition to this small example, just laying the slides and examples out a little more clearly and slowly and in a step-by-step fashion would have been helpful.",
    "I would recommend it to any student who has had some statistical training to begin with. Otherwise, they might feel a bit lost.",
    "I would recommend the class to psychology students because the information presented is necessary for psychological research.",
    "I would definitely recommend it. Every graduate student should take it.",
    "yes, but would want more problem sets",
    "Yes, I would recommend this class to other students.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to another student wanting to gaininsight into the statistical techniques commonly employed by fellow researchers in the field.",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend this course to another graduate student. This course will teach you how to unlock the potential of continuous variables, in particular how to probe interactions and test for mediation. It is difficult to imagine a graduate education in psychology being complete without this material. Moreover, the workload is manageable and designed entirely with benefit for graduate students in mind. The final assignment provides a great opportunity to explore your own data using these new analytical methods. The atmosphere in class is comfortable and nonjudgmental, and Prof. Napier is completely rad. If you are a PhD student in psychology, TAKE THIS COURSE."

   "comments": [
    "This course will help me to analyze data for my research, both as part of my dissertation, and later in life.",
    "a great help to start understanding data analysis with regression.gave me a lot of motivation to explore statistics!",
    "Now that I have a much better understanding of regression, I think this will both help me be a better consumer of other people's research, as well as a better researcher myself.",
    "I've already used many of these skills, and will continue to do so throughout my career.",
    "It improved my data analytical tools a great deal, and enabled me to better read other articles too. I expect that what I learned in this course will be used heavily in my own research (it already has).",
    "This course will be very valuable for my dissertation, research and my career. I need a background in stats and this provided a solid foundation.",
    "The statistical tests that we learned to do are directly applicable to my research.",
    "I will use what I learned in this class to design and analyze data in my future research.",
    "I have already used many of the skills and techniques taught in this class for my pre-dissertation and own research papers.",
    "This class was incredibly beneficial in increasing my understanding of statistical techniques that are central to the field."
