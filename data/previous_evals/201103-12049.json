   "comments": [
    "Fantastic and interesting. I would encourage anyone to take it because i believe it is the best science class i took at yale.",
    "Take it if you're interested in an upper level EEB course. Wendy's amazing and you learn lots of cool things.",
    "Plant-Insect Interactions was fun! Very chill, lots of discussions, and Wendy is very accessible. Like most intermediate EEB classes, there are problems when you have both senior EEB majors and I-have-no-idea-what-I-want-to-major-in freshmen, but I think we managed to figure it out. Lots of examples of awesome stuff in the plant-insect world (TONS of pictures) and no exams! Woot!",
    "I'd recommend this course to students who have a desire to learn about plants and insects on a deep level. The grant proposal was a lot of work but ultimately proved to be a great learning experience and was rewarding to finish.",
    "This is an eye-opening course in which to revel in the diversity of plants and insects and encounter the subtleties of even such basic terms as \"mutualism,\" \"antagonism,\" \"coevolution.\" Through stacks of primary research articles and a combination of lectures and discussions organized into three sections (pollination, herbivory, ant-plant interactions), one establishes a familiarity both with the trends (alongside stunning exceptions) in plant-insect interactions and with the ways in which to ask and answer questions in the field.Written critiques of primary research and the preparation of one's own grant proposal are arrows in one's quiver, essential tools in the scientist's toolbox. Professor Clement is generous and helpful along the way, yet expects and elicits solid, independent work.Absolutely take this if you love plants and insects--you will never see a honey bee or an ant the same way again. This is also a satisfying course if you are interested in discussing concepts in ecology and evolution.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. Workload was certainly not impossible and most readings were interesting. Just stay on top of them, as well as the deadlines for the proposal, it's not impossible"
