    "Instructor: Chelsea Elizabeth Judy \u00a0The strengths were her ability to clarify what was expected as students, as well as her adaptability to tailor sections to what the students wanted or needed. She was very concerned about tailoring the class, but I think her teaching might be improved if she was a bit more authoritative about what we were covering.",
    "Instructor: Chelsea Elizabeth Judy \u00a0She's kind, helpful, and available, but 1. there could be more coordination between her and the professor, and 2. (related to the 1st point) could be more organized.",
    "Instructor: Chelsea Elizabeth Judy \u00a0Chelsea was always available to help and informed of the material. However, I don't think it was necessary to have a weekly TA session for this course.",
    "Instructor: Chelsea Elizabeth Judy \u00a0The T.A. for this class was great at repeating whatever the professor said in responding to questions during discussion section. She had no new insights or thoughts and seemed to have a poor understanding of some of the material, especially the material related to international relations theories. The T.A. was not approachable or open to feedback (fyi - just because you say you are open once at the first discussion section, doesn't mean you actually are). I actually heard her criticizing another student in the course for making an entirely reasonable suggestion. She was not organized and refused to organize the enormous list of readings on the classesv2 server into folders which would have made it much more easy to navigate. During discussion section she did not provide any space for actual discussion. It ended up being a space for her to lecture at us again, repeating the main points Ben had already told us. A grand total of one of the session actually involved any form of meaningful discussion.",
    "Instructor: Chelsea Elizabeth Judy \u00a0She ran a good, interactive section and was always available more guidance and clarification. Very approachable.",
    "Instructor: Chelsea Elizabeth Judy \u00a0Strengths - have accessible and open to providing assistance and feedback - very engaged in the class Weaknesses - not as organized as would have been optimal (e.g. the readings and content provided on classesv2 were not very organized) - the discussions led by the TA did not provide enough content to make it worthwhile to attend the sessions",
    "Instructor: Chelsea Elizabeth Judy \u00a0Chelsea is Excellent. Understands the subject clearly, helpful, always available.",
    "Instructor: Chelsea Elizabeth Judy \u00a0Chelsea was great at explaining the concepts and reviewing material presented in lectures. However, in terms of being organized, there was lots of room for improvement. I don't know how much of this was the professor's disorganizedness and how much the TA's, but I think it's the TA's job to be 100% on top of the logistics (knowing the deadlines, clarifying expectations about assignments in advance, not short notice, creating lesson plans for sections, setting up the times and locations for sections at the beginning of the semester etc.)."

    "Professor Cashore was often not present in class. Although technological efforts were made (like Skype) I found this a bit disrespectful of my time. Also, this class had more assignments than any of my other classes combined. Between reading responses, discussion sections, papers, group projects, and readings (far too much), I spent a lot of time on what sometimes felt like busy work.",
    "Engaging course, but the allocation of class time could be more efficient (one does not need 2 entire classes dedicated towards explaining the assignment. I - and many other students - would rather that time be used for course material.",
    "Question 13: The instructor was disorganized and lectures ended up being him reading off powerpoint presentations. He also was extremely unclear about what was expected for various assignments. Many times he was obviously just making decisions on the spot when students asked him rather than having had a clear idea about the structure or purpose of the assignment in the first place. Question 15: I think this course has a lot of potential to be very valuable for students, however the current shortcomings of the course make it difficult to get anything meaningful out of it.",
    "Ben Cashore is clearly brilliant and his brain moves so fast that at times it is really hard to follow him.",
    "Course seemed a bit disorganized.",
    "Over 12 of the readings were authored or co-authored by the professor. He cited his own work heavily in lecture. We were even required to edit and give feedback on an upcoming publication written by the professor via a google doc -- we will not be given co-authorship or credit for helping him improve this publication. That seemed rather opportunistic and tacky. Additionally, while the readings written or co-authored by professor Cashore may have been pertinent to the class material, it seemed rather insular or an act of self aggrandizement to have us read so many of his own publications. I feel this was a disservice to the students to not be exposed to a more well rounded sample of the literature for the environmental or forest governance field."

    "The classesV2 site could use a bit of organization help, especially when it came to the readings. It was hard to find what I was supposed to be reading. I liked the UNFF simulation, but think they could have required a couple of comments to stimulate the discussions on the classesv2 forum.",
    "2nd half - barring the fact that not everyone is interested in forestry (though I completely understand the rationale of focusing on a particular sector), I feel like the key concepts are nearly as well-disseminated as those covered in the 1st half of the course.",
    "Sometimes lectures were a little scattered. They went off topic for awhile before returning to the point.",
    "All aspects need improvement. We were explicitly told at the beginning of the course that our time class-time would not be taken up simply going over the readings, and yet as the course went on, I stopped doing the readings because that's what we were going over during class. I would also appreciate (and I am sure other students would as well) if the professor would be more respectful of our time. The class ended at 2:20 technically yet Ben often kept on going past that time. He also had a \"special\" make-up class one evening that was supposed to make up for a class that wouldn't happen later in the semester and then changed his mind (or just flat-out lied?) and held class that day. Also, the readings were excessive. Many of them had little relevance or overlapped with one another. The reading list could be trimmed down extensively with no loss to material covered or content.",
    "The class structure felt a bit disorganized at times and was hard to follow how the structure of each lecture built on what we had learned before. We also spent a couple of classes just hearing about the instructions for the assignments. I thought this could have been covered in section. The negotiation was a great idea, but I think students needed more direction on where to go for background reading and preparation on the history and functioning of the UNFF, the IAF and the CPF, and the positions of their organizations in regards to negotiating a new agreement.",
    "I didn't like the debate activity. I really enjoyed writing the paper, but I wish we had started it earlier in the year. This would have spaced out the process better and allowed us to think about other issues areas (apart from trees) throughout the semester.",
    "Better organization",
    "I think there were too many guest speakers. The guest lectures were valuable but I felt that they interrupted the flow of the course. Although the guest speakers were interesting, I would be much more interested in having Prof. Cashore lecture and go deeper into the theories and case studies.",
    "- Greater organization towards the end of the semester - Finding a new activity other than the mock negotiations to reinforce content covered in the class",
    "None",
    "Not editing professors upcoming publications without a co-author credit. Not reading so many of the professor's publications to the detriment of a multitude of perspectives.",
    "Organization! It was extremely hard to plan my work for this class more than 1 week ahead, and it got progressively worse throughout the semester, because the syllabus kept changing, and assignments like the reading responses and the protocol comments suddenly popped up. I understand the professor's explanation that the policymaking world is messy, and so the class should somehow reflect that. However, the disorganizedness of the class demotivated me to do the reading - already within the first few weeks it was unclear which readings were for which week, the syllabus kept changing, and when I did do the readings, the lecture content was changed, so me having done the readings was not helpful until some future point where we would get around to that issue. Just to clarify: the course and Professor Cashore were absolutely amazing, and I learned a ton, but I would have learned much more if the course was better organized. Some suggestions: 1) if you know the syllabus is going to change, then clarify which parts of the syllabus are tentative and which are not. For example, have the first 5 weeks 100% settled and fleshed out, and then by week 3 specify exactly the readings and assignments for weeks 6-10 and so on. 2) I think the communication between TA and professor about assignment expectations could be improved. A lot of times it was evident that the coordination was happening during lecture, not beforehand. 3) Spend more time at the beginning of the semester to write out in detail the assignment expectations\/guidelines\/instructions. I understand that readings and the order of lectures can be shuffled around throughout the semester, but there is no reason why the assignments shouldn't be fleshed out way in advance."

    "Yes it was effective.",
    "The discussion sections could be organize in a first part in which the teaching fellow clarify\/answer questions of the topics, and next a discussion.",
    "The discussions were mostly a waste of time for me. At least the Monday's sections were not really discussions at all, but just Chelsea asking us questions, and most people staring at their laptops doing other stuff. Part of the reason why they weren't useful for me I think, was that there was no actual lesson plan, we just winged it, and I don't think it worked out well. I think the sections could have been used to introduce and clarify (not just review) the assignments, but it seemed that only the professor knew what the assignments were, and the TA knew as much as we did from attending lecture. So if there was more coordination between the TA and the professor on the assignments, we could have spent less time during lecture on the assignments (especially the paper and the negotiation simulation) and more on content. Some suggestions: 1) have sections be background information on certain thematic topics (what is the UN financing system of the GEF, how does the carbon market work, the Kyoto protocol, etc.) 2) maybe have sections mandatory for undergrads and optional for grads? Some of the undergrads (though by no means all) seemed to be lacking some background, that most grad students had, 3) make the section actually discussion based focused on the readings with students presenting on readings and then discussing them"

However not having a Policy\/Social science background, the course is not as \"profitable\" as could be; there is a big investment of time understanding the background. Between the first part of the course (worldviews, IR, etc) and the second and third, there is an important \"jump\" on the pace and use of governance\/policy concepts that made more difficult to students without these background to take full advantage of the discussions and topics reviewed in class. Working on how to solve that gap could be useful for students.",
    "Knowing the difference between process tracing and other forms of evaluation like CBA or other quantitative assessments is great, this will help me a lot with analyzing and some day shaping how project evaluations are done! Also the world views part of the theory section is super hepful in analyzing individuals and organizations, and being able to either adapt to or challenge their approach. Also, understanding the concept of a \"problem definition\" was amazing - I've explained it to lots of people since then, and it's really cool. I think this class was the one I referenced most to other people or during other classes this semester, because the concepts were so applicable. I've said \"well, you know in this class I'm taking right now with Cashore there are these four ways of thinking about this...\" to the where it almost became a running joke.
