   "comments": [
    "Good interesting survey course. You definitely learn a lot. The paper is a little daunting but the tests are generally manageable. I took this as a math major without the prereq and I was fine.Take it if you think you can survive the paper",
    "Very dry lectures, and the readings were exactly like the lectures. The best part of the course for me was the SimUText, where we got to interact with the subject material online.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. I went in scarred from MCDB 120, its rough curve, and the impersonal teaching styles of its professors (there were 3 professors teaching the class that semester!). But I came out an E&EB major. Take this if you think you might want to major in Ecology and want a biology major with tiny classes and personal attention. I can't think of a reason not to take this class.",
    "Yes, I would recommend it!",
    "The course hasn't changed in literally 10 years. Read a bunch of the reviews, and you'll get the picture.I personally found it very intuitive, not too intense, and very enjoyable. I did NOT, however, find it as life changing as other reviewers have. It is an introduction to ecology and evolutionary biology - if you have ever thought about what you learned in intro bio, you pretty much know most of what will be taught in the course.",
    "Great introduction to everything about evolution, ecology, and behavior. The paper was actually kind of fun to write since a lot of the stress was removed because of how the due dates were spread out throughout the semester. Lectures were pretty good and the exams weren't too bad. Overall, I would definitely recommend it to both science and non-science majors(though not completely non-sciency people).",
    "I would recommend it to any study going into E+EB or following the neuroscience track in psych. But otherwise, it's a little too writing heavy for a science course and way too science heavy for a writing course. If you love science though, and want to write a paper on a scientific topic, then this course is for you.",
    "The class is really reasonable. Though it is rough writing the paper throughout the semester, it's awesome to not have a final.",
    "I would recommend this class. But be warned your paper is worth 50 percent of your grade. I did not take AP Biology and found that I could understandthe material with no major issues. Stearns is a great lecturer, and you won't regret taking this class.",
    "I wouldn't recommend this course to another student, because I feel like it's a glorified vocabulary course.",
    "Good course, but a decent amount of work. Not good if you're just looking for a WR credit, as there are mandatory sections and two midterms (in addition to the 20 page paper)",
    "A great course to change the way you think. Not a great course for your gradebook.",
    "This was a good class for evolutionary biology. I would recommend it because it is a very informative general biology class to take.",
    "Not unless they need to take it. The course jumps around a lot and feels a little confused.",
    "This class may initially seem like little work is involved, in terms of the lecture and midterms, but I thought the twenty page paper went much more smoothly than the rest of the class. The class is very conceptual; you can't count of memorizing facts. So, if you take it, make sure you understand each new concept as the class progresses, because if you don't, studying for the midterms (2) is nearly impossible. The paper isn't awful if you make sure to spend time on the pre-writing exercises throughout the semester in section, it's basically done before it's due.",
    "Would only recommend if you need a science credit and you have a friend in the class. It's the kind of lecture you stop going to after a while unless someone else is making you go. I left with a vague understanding of life histories and evolutionary tradeoffs, but it would have benefited from a smaller scope-- there's so much material that none of it gets covered very thoroughly.",
    "Good course that requires a lot of reading, especially since there is only two midterms spaced heavily apart.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. The subject matter is really interesting, and Prof. Stearns is a great lecturer. I don't think I was ever bored. It's a lot of reading, but there are no problem sets or small assignments. Your entire grade is comprised of two midterms and a paper. The paper is not too bad because you work on it all semester. The hefty weight of each assignment can make them stressful, though.",
    "The past years' responses said that this class was a lot of people's favorite class at Yale. This evaluation left me confused the entire semester as to what they were talking about. The class was not bad, and the work wasn't overwhelming, but I found myself getting bored or drudging through the twenty page paper at the end. Don't go into it with too high of expectations and thing will go well.",
    "solid class that is great for science majors and non-majors who like to write.",
    "Learn about evolution, ecology, and behavior. Seems too simplistic and not very applicable for the most part.",
    "This is a great course for both the science and non science major alike. There is a good deal of work, but the paper is not so bad if you keep up with the work throughout the semester (which they force you to do). You also get to choose a topic that interests you. I would recommend this as a good \"non-gut\" Sc credit course. The topics are very interesting and timely. Stearns is a fantastic lecturer and is always willing to reach out to students.",
    "Definitely recommended. But also a class you need to devote time to if you want to get the most out of it. Very intro good class.",
    "I recommend this class only if you're seriously interested in the subject matter. I took it just to fulfill my Sc requirement and found out that this class was much harder than I thought it would be. The first half of the semester is mostly evolution, which I found to be way more difficult than the second half of the semester which is ecology& behavior. Also, don't be discouraged by the 15-20 page paper because you have deadlines for the paper throughout the semester so it's not like you're writing the whole thing in one night.",
    "Decent class, but I will not be continuing in EEB.",
    "Lots of lectures, two tests, one giant paper. Even if you've taken AP bio, this course is still worth it. If you're an EVST major like me, you probably have to take this class. I recommend taking it even if you could place out of it because of your AP score.",
    "it is probably not what you think it's about.there's a lot on concepts in evolution and ecology, but it also focuses on the mathematics and statistics behind it (Game Theory, etc).but the professor is really approachable and helpful. you learn a lot about nature and appreciate\/understand a lot of natural phenomena. made me realize how interesting nature is again.the big paper is definitely doable so long as you manage your time well.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class to anyone who wants a grounding in evolution, ecology and behavior. The writing aspect is not overwhelming, and if you choose a topic you love will probably even be fun. Steve Stearns is a great lecturer, but the class also follows the book, and so while you do need to study to do well on the two midterms (no final), the curve is very generous. I loved this class, looked forward to lecture, and enjoyed writing my paper.",
    "It was a great course!Stearns is an excellent lecturer, I loved going to lecture.It was usually clear what we were expected to know, and that made the class more enjoyable too",
    "I took E&EB to fulfill a science requirement because I thought the material would be interesting. I guess I would recommended it to another student because the material is interesting, but the format of balancing this massive paper and keeping up with lectures and the reading is difficult. Moreover, the course requires you to buy three textbooks (two books, one online). Don't buy the third one. It really doesn't help in preparation for the exam, and it ends up being more confusing than helpful because it covers more material than Stearns covered in lecture.",
    "This is an intro course, but it is a lot of work, with many different concepts. Keep up as much as you can, do not fall behind.",
    "Excellent introduction to the field. Not quite as good of an introduction to science writing as advertised. Yes, I would recommend it.",
    "A lot of material. It's 2 midterms and a paper - there's no final, which is nice.",
    "I would summarize it as a great introductory course and writing credit for those who don't want to write much. Really the only writing you do is the twenty page paper and the writing for this paper is very different from any English or History paper. Stephen Stearns is a great professor and the material is interesting and appropriately challenging.",
    "Terrible. Section is useless but required. Readings are irrelevant and unnecessary, so don't bother buying the books. Lectures are all recorded online and are the EXACT same except the 3 weeks when the professor doesn't even TEACH! Should NEVER be required for MCDB majors, or anyone else for that matter. 2 midterms and one 15-20 page paper that you have to do about 10 drafts for...",
    "It is a very interesting introduction to evolutionary biology, particularly for people with no biology background. It is not one of those science credit courses that isn't really scientific, but it does not require an intense scientific background to understand.",
    "Certainly. The course offers a comprehensive understanding of evolutionary biology and the ideas in ecology. Also you can learn about scientific writing in the course.",
    "EEB 122 is a great introductory class. I took it as a requirement, and I'm glad I had to take it because I would not have thought of doing so otherwise. Stephen Stearns is a great lecturer who really wants you to learn, and writing the course paper is satisfying and spaced out well enough that it does not seem too burdensome.",
    "I would not reccomend this or any science course unless you need them for your major",
    "Decent course. Usually pretty interesting lectures, but all over the place. Not a great class to take for a writing credit.",
    "A fantastic class for majors and non-majors alike. The subject is one of the most interesting I have taken during my time at Yale. Worth taking, without a doubt.",
    "Great intro course to the principles of evolution and ecology biology. MUST TAKE.",
    "It's a great way to get a writing credit as a science minded person. Even though I got a 5 on AP bio I still found this course very interesting. The first test on evolution was long,but if you properly prepare and are a good test taker you should be fine. Second test (and half of the course) was much easier which is nice given the paper you have to write. Make sure to start on the paper early and to write a full draft during your March break - you will be much happier come reading week.",
    "E&EB 122 was a decent introduction to the biological disciplines of evolution, ecology, and behavior. Many of the subjects were touched upon only very briefly, which was the downside--but that is the weakness of any broad introductory course. At times, there were lectures on very interesting topics, such as evolutionary game theory, or human evolution, that left something wanting (course there are whole courses devoted to those topics). Otherwise, you will gain an appreciation for the importance of Darwin's revolutionary discovery, and the refinements made to it in the subsequent eras of scientific thought and research, up until the present decade, because the field is still moving and in contention over important issues. The fact that the topics are still developing adds a sense of excitement to the class--which you can choose to exploit in your term paper. Speaking of the paper, it is actually not very stressful, since it is spread over the whole semester. In addition, you can choose to write on any subject, so choose wisely something that can hold your interest. It's not writing intensive as the WR credit would suggest. Professor Stearns was definitely an engaging lecturer, though there were also some dull lectures.",
    "it was a good introductory course, but pretty boring at times. the work load is not bad but because you dont have to do a lot, the first midterm is difficult. i would recommend it. you will also need it for some majors.",
    "This course is pretty good. The material is interesting, the lectures aren't too boring, and you feel like you really learned something at the end of it.AN IMPORTANT NOTE ABOUT DECIDING WHICH SECTION YOU TAKE: Professor Stearns is kind of intimidating and not the most gentle and welcoming person in the world, but he will teach the material better than other TAs and give you better and more thorough feedback on your paper, but at a cost. You will have to work harder and he will grade tougher. While some TAs will give you just a paragraph or two of comments on your paper, Professor Stearns will give you like 6 pages of comments. Also, if you meet with him, arrive early and NEVER be late.In short, if you take Professor Stearn's section (if he decides to teach a section again in the future), he will grade your paper more harshly, but your paper will be of better quality at the same time because your comments will be more thorough. (you will probably learn more too, but you will be working harder for the same grade)",
    "It is a good course to help you decide whether or not you would like to pursue ecology and evolutionary biology.",
    "The course that made me realize I didn't want to be a bio major. The subject matter is totally interesting, but Professor Stearns goes way too fast through the material in lecture. Going to lecture was often pointless during the Evolution unit, because even though I would read the chapter thoroughly before coming, the lecture would assume you had been tossing around these terms for years before coming, so a lot of it would fly over my head anyway. If you're going to take it, make sure that you meet with a TA early on to make sure that you're understanding things as you go, because there are no real formal assessments (ie. problem sets) until the midterms. I enjoyed the ecology and behavior units much more. The paper can be tricky, but I benefited from having a good TA. Just keep on track with the assignments, and you'll be set.",
    "This is a great biology class, probably one of the best intro bio classes in the department. It is a lot of reading, but Stearns is really passionate about the material which makes is very interesting.",
    "Great course. The grading curve is unfair though.",
    "If you're thinking of taking this class for the writing credit, then think twice before you commit to 2 exams and a long, dry paper.",
    "This was a very interesting course that can be challenging with the volume of information to learn, but the teaching staff make it quite doable and indeed enjoyable.",
    "Its an intro course very typical of science courses. All memorizing, but interesting topics.",
    "It's a hard class but the material is mostly interesting, so it's not a bad deal if you need the requirement.",
    "EEB 122 is a great class. i feel like i learned so much. professor stearns is a really engaging lecturer and he makes an effort to interact with his students. the material is so fascinating. for the ecology part of the class, we used a program called simutext, and professor stearns didn't lecture at all. this was the first year he used this program. i was shocked he stopped lecturing for a good 3-4 weeks, and hopefully this will change. that said, simutext did help a lot with understanding the concepts, even though it was a little dull at times. there are two midterms, which count for 25% each. i had to study really hard to do well on them, but it wasn't impossible. watch your time during the tests, they're really long. as far as the paper goes, you start so early and receive so much feedback that it isn't really as painful as it sounds. i also feel like my writing improved from this paper. it is taken into account this might be your first time reading and writing a science paper.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. The work was reasonable, it was interesting, and the curve was great for a science class.",
    "No, no, no! The workload is miserably unbearable. If you have to take it, make sure to get a good TA (because he\/she will determine your grade AND your overall class experience). And, know that the class will be a\/the focal point of your semester. Make sure to pick a really awesome paper topic. Don\u0092t waste your time with the readings. Study the reading summaries and the lectures\u0097they are all you need and the expected reading is quite significant otherwise.Summary: lecture 3x a week*, section 1x a week (aka: a LOT of class); 2 exams (first was quite difficult, but both were nicely curved), a 15-20 page final paper (with lots of intermediate deadlines, some of which are helpful and some of which hinder A LOT)*= for 3 weeks, we only had class once a week because we did online class (SimUText). This is a lot better structured than class, but is much simpler and includes a bunch of pointless busy work.I took this class because reviews were quite positive. And, Stearns is an interesting and dynamic lecturer. However, the balance of the paper and keeping up with class-work makes this class not worth your time. I felt that I could not do either (the paper or class material) justice because I had to balance the two. The paper is a time suck. I spent the bulk of the semester working on the paper because of all the intermediate deadlines (topic, thesis, outline etc.), so I was forced to cram the weekend before exams. I\u0092m not sure how I can communicate how much this class really decreased my happiness this semester. I found it impossible to do the necessary studying because I had to work on the paper (which is unrelated to the class), so I was not able to keep up with the lectures. The paper does not help with the class and the class hardly helps with the paper. Section was primarily dedicated to talking about the paper and the writing process; often, it was a waste of time. Perhaps I picked an overly obscure and painful paper topic, but I\u0092m under the impression that others in the class found the paper similarly time-consuming and frustrating (in that it made it impossible to keep up with the actual class). I would consider taking the class if there were no paper.",
    "If you have to take it then take it but its a pretty challenging course considering its not useful unless you're an eeb major.",
    "Decent class. Not too much work, good for science lecture. I ended up choosing a difficult topic for the final paper, but I kind of brought that upon myself. Whatever your topic is will determine how much work you have to do at the end.",
    "EEB 122 is a pretty interesting course about ecology and evolutionary behavior. The professor is clearly very knowledgeable and passionate about the subject. He also includes real life examples of animals that the concepts apply to, which helps you better understand what may seem like abstract concepts at first. It's also a great writing credit for science majors since you write a scientific research paper (instead of a regular humanities\/social science paper that some science people don't really like to write), and they basically walk you through all the steps. It might seem like a pain to have outlines, rough draft, etc. due, but it really helps guide you in the right direction and prevent you from trying to write 15-20 pages at the last minute.",
    "Though evolution and ecology is a fascinating subject itself, the way the material is presented in this class kills all enthusiasm for biology. 50% of your grade is based on a 20 page research paper that you receive little guidance in writing. The remaining 50% depends on how well you teach yourself the material in the textbook, because the lectures in class are dry, poorly explained, and almost unnecessary (all powerpoints slides can be downloaded online). One TA is especially intimidating and every week he humiliated the students for getting questions wrong during session. When I sought extra help to review new equations and graphs, the TA told me to look my question up online and seek other classmates for help. He was remarkably unhelpful, unenthusiastic about teaching, and very difficult to like. I've never felt so abandoned and so stressed with any other class at Yale.",
    "I would recommend the course for any student. The paper was time consuming, but probably the best part of the course, as it allows students to study a topic of their choice and learn about its evolutionary implications.",
    "Yes, if you're willing to put in a decent amount of time.",
    "A great survey of three giant areas of bio: evolution, ecology, and behavior. Prof. Stearns is engaging in and out of class, and a great teacher. Be prepared to cover a lot of ground, however--there's much more even than is covered in lecture.",
    "Not a bad science class. All the material is online, so you don't really need to go to class. The reserach paper is 50% of your grade and takes a substantial amount of time, but they help you go through it.",
    "It's a good intro course that serves as one of the better \"refresher\" courses. If you forgot basic genetics, take it. If you don't know much about mating systems, take it. There are 2 exams and one paper (25, 25, 50% respectfully), which is super."
