    "with a better teacher I would recommend it",
    "it's math, it's what you would expect. no tricks. take it if you really like it or if you have to.",
    "Math 112 is a great survey of the topics covered in AB Calculus, and consists of weekly p-sets, 2 exams and a final. The homework corresponded well with what was covered in class (sometimes an issue in other classes), the course moved at an appropriate pace, and the tests were an accurate reflection of the material we learned. I would definitely recommend itto another student.",
    "I would recommend it because I found it to be a good starting ground for a freshmen to began their college experience and get a taste of what math courses are like at Yale.",
    "MATH 112 is a fair course and not bad if you have to take it to fulfill some requirements. The tests are doable as long as you understand the concepts and study.",
    "It is a review of Calc AB. I recommend it only if you actually like math or need it to fulfill a requirement for your major.",
    "I would not recommend this course to another student unless he already has at least a little bit of prior knowledge in calculus.",
    "I would only recommend it if that student needed to fill a requirement. From what I experienced in 112 and from what my peers tell me of other math classes, it is safe to say that Yale has a bit of improving to do in its undergraduate mathematics department.",
    "Fulfills requirement. Very similar to ab calc. Recommended if you need math towards your major but movies very quickly",
    "I would summarize the course as a calculus class based on tests and conducted in lecture format. The grade was based on performance on tests rather than attendance in class or effort and participation. This can be a good or bad thing depending on the student and I would recommend this class to another student with that information in mind."
