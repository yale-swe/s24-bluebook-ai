   "comments": [
    "I would describe this course as a \"101\" level survey of China's history in world politics to the present day, with some high level policy and security analysis added to the pot. But despite the high-level analysis elements of the course, I would only recommend it to students with little or no exposure to the study of China, because the framework of the course is quite basic.",
    "Yes, it offers a great overview of China.",
    "Yes I would. Good for those wanting a background in China but not perhaps enough for a more in-depth study.",
    "Excellent course. The topics covered are appropriate for those who are focusing their study on China, as well as those who seek a basic understanding of China's changing role in various aspects of international politics.",
    "This course can help students understand China's politics and logic behind it.I would recommnd students choose this course.",
    "Don't take it. Just read the wikipedia entry for \"China\" and memorize it.",
    "This class was far too elementary to be listed as a graduate course. While I found the simulations interesting and worthwhile (due in large part to the fact that 4 of the students in the graduate discussion section were actual diplomats--participating with them in dialogue was fascinating), the lectures were very basic. I think I could probably have passed the final exam without taking the class."

   "comments": [
    "As I mentioned in previous questions, the exploration of policy and security issues from multiple perspectives and multiple levels of analysis was extremely unique and helpful in my understanding of China in world politics. This is an extremely valuable skill I will take with me into future academic study and in my career.",
    "It increased my knowledge for many China related topics that I hadn't focused on in other classes.",
    "Somewhat, but I have taken China classes to a much deeper degree than before so it was useful.",
    "Through the political analysis and documentaries viewing",
    "This course give me a broad insight on China's politics, particular territory disputes."
