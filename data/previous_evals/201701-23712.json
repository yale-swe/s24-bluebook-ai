    "It was very interesting learning about the mechanisms of sport from a sociological perspective and using that sort of theory.",
    "Learned a lot of new concepts related to sociology through a unique lense. Felt like I learned a lot throughout this course.",
    "I had never taken a sociology class before and gained a good understanding of a variety of sociological concepts.",
    "I gained insights and knowledge into basic sociology as well as how to understand sports as a sociological construct.",
    "An ability to look at sport through a new lens. Learned so much it was amazing",
    "I learned how to look at sports from a sociological perspective, and developed an understanding of sociological themes and concepts.",
    "Great intro socy class. Definitely gave me a good base for more advanced sociology classes. Really got me to look at sports and everyday situations in a new light.",
    "Learned lots of sociological concepts I hadn't been exposed to before and now look at sports through a different lens.",
    "I learned how to think like a sociologist - to look at the way society works and to understand the underlying interactions between people that make it possible.",
    "A great course that introduces many key tenets of sociology through the lens of sport. Taught me how to think about both sports and sociology in a new way.",
    "Having no background in the sociology of sport, this class opened my eyes to the subject. I learned how to use social phenomena in sport to help understand the outside world, and vice versa.",
    "This course taught fundamentals in sociological concepts and way of thinking using sports as the medium to convey these themes.",
    "I learned to think about sport in a different way and think about everyday interactions relevant to everything and everyone in a new way.",
    "This class was a good introduction to sociological concepts through the lens of sports.",
    "Great course. Learned how to look at sports in an intellectual manner. Will never look at sports the same again. So much more detailed in how I analyze sports now.",
    "As an intro sociology course, this course gave me the opportunity to learn a lot of sociological concepts through the lens of sports, something that was a unique and valuable experience as a Yale course, and as one of the first courses I took in sociology."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The course definitely makes the sociology major more attractive as it provides an interesting example of how we can relate these theories to something as prevalent as sports in our everyday lives. It wasn't limited to coverage of solely one sport so it provided something for everyone in the class. Sometimes lectures were a little dull and too heavily focused on sociological theory as opposed to discussing examples from professional athletics or from sporting events that had happened on a given night this year.",
    "The lectures could be a bit dry sometimes, but it was apparent that the Professor cared about his students understanding. Offered numerous resources to help in any way possible. More slides or images might make the class more engaging.",
    "Interesting topic, but sometimes lecture would not be as expected, meaning topic was not necessarily on sports",
    "I thought the professor tended to go on tangents and his lectures could obscure the main takeaways a bit, but thought the lectures and readings coincided well.",
    "I think the class presents as more of a mix of sociology and sport than it really is. I found a lot of the class to be like an introduction to sociology topics with maybe a bit of sports videos tacked into the discussion or added on the the end. Of course, some classes were more balanced than others but for the most part my impression was that this class was much more sociology than sport. That being said, I found myself really engaged with the content and still very much enjoyed the class. Some readings were too sociological for my taste but I think there was a good mix and a concerted effort to explain those topics in class. One pet peeve of mine was the lack of time on tests. For the midterm, there was a shortage of time and Professor Deland addressed this. However, for the final this happened again and I felt like I could have done much better on tests if the timing had been better divided.",
    "The material and teaching were both awesome. All around a great course.",
    "Very well ran, had some secrion mix ups in the beginning due to student availability",
    "The material was this classes greatest strength - I loved the reading, and I loved being able to study one of my passions from a sociological standpoint. Section was actually another strength - I loved our discussions. The assignments were all very manageable and I enjoyed them! The lectures were solid - they were a little slow and monotonous but overall interesting. The class was small so often the lectures opened up to discussion which made them worthwhile. Also, the lectures were not super important in terms of succeeding in the class - so if you need an occasional study hall they were good for that. The only thing I didn't like about the class were the reading quizzes. I feel like college students should be able to make their own decisions about whether or not do read. Also, I want to read to understand and enjoy, not to perform on a quiz.",
    "I thought this was a great class and I learned a lot throughout the semester, however I thought the quizzes were a little unfair... even when I did the readings I often would not do well compared to friends who did not do the reading but have a strong sociology background. I wish we would have had maybe a small assignment during the semester instead. I liked having the final paper where we could choose a topic and apply what we learned to a sport we are passionate about. I also sometimes had difficulty really taking everything in in lecture; I usually do best when I can see things and although videos were a great addition to lecture I had trouble listening to the prof just talk and take notes. It would have been nice if there was a powerpoint supplement too. I did like though that there were lecture recaps available.",
    "Incredible class",
    "I loved this course. Professor DeLand was awesome. At times lecture was a little dry - perhaps use powerpoints or slides more, or maybe more visuals at times.",
    "I was a big fan of this course. I thought it covered what it needed to cover very well. I don't know if it has to be an hour fifteen though.",
    "I thought the topics were covered and progressed in a great way. Each topic helped me understand the next more and more, especially in the second half of the class. Sometimes the lack of structure in lecture was hard to follow, but the section complemented lecture really well.",
    "The course covers some very interesting material. I thought the strongest parts of the course were when videos or articles were used to help practice and explain concepts. The applications of the ideas seemed most interesting.",
    "Strengths are that the course is really interesting and relevant for everyone. Weaknesses is that some people may have struggled with the more conversation style lecture, although I personally really liked it.",
    "I really liked this course. The only thing I did not like was that we had a few pop quizzes. DeLand was incredible, the course material was awesome, lecture was wonderful."

   "comments": [
    "As someone who took this class for credit, I found it relatively interesting but it would definitely have been far too heavy of a workload if I was taking it for a grade. If that were to change, I would recommend this class to another student.",
    "Yes! I deeply enjoyed the class material, lectures, and section discussions. The themes were both pertinent to everyday life and to an academic setting. This was one of the most memorable classes I have taken at Yale thus far.",
    "I would recommend taking this course to a fellow student because it was interesting but also not overwhelming.",
    "If you like sports you will enjoy the class",
    "Yes, especially a no. Sociology major looking to learn about the subject and who had an interest in sports.",
    "Yes, DeLand is the GOAT",
    "Yes! It's interesting and enjoyable, and not difficult. It served as a nice break from the stress of other classes, but at the same time felt worthwhile because I did learn a lot about sociological concepts. Take it if you love sports or sociology! One of my favorite classes.",
    "If they are interested in sociology OR sports and willing to put a little bit of work in, definitely. This class is one where if you consistently put in a little bit of work, you get rewarded. Although it would have been easy to cram for the exams and write the paper shortly before it was due, it was definitely easier when I was prepared in advance.",
    "Take it if ever offered again. My favorite class I've taken at yale.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. It was interesting, fun, and engaging.",
    "Absolutely absolutely take this course if you have any interests in sports at all. It's an awesome course with a great professor",
    "Great class. The topics are really, really interesting and surprisingly relavent to real life and not just sports. Prof. DeLand was awesome and so was Isabel (the TA). The midterm, final and final essay sound like a lot (plus the reading quizzes) but they don't feel like a lot of work at all.",
    "I would recommend this class if you are interested in the topics covered themselves and not just sports. Teaching sociology through sports does make the topics more tangible and easier to see. After taking the class, you recognize and think about both common occurrences and symbolic moments differently.",
    "Definitely recommend.",
    "This course is not the most exciting one in the world. If you think that you like sports so it should be okay even if you don't care about sociology, you might end up disappointed. It's interesting enough, but not one that I would highly recommend unless you enjoy sociology.",
    "Absolutely take this course. One of my favorites I have taken at Yale. DeLand is awesome, Isabel Jijon is a great TA, and the material is incredibly engaging. You will never look at sports the same.",
    "Sadly, this course was taught by a visiting professor, and so I don't think it will be taught again, but I did appreciate the unique perspective and insights that looking at sport as a microcosm of and deeply linked to society was very interesting and caused me to think a lot more critically about sports, something that I love very deeply."
