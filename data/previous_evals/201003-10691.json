   "comments": [
    "It is a difficult class to summarize because of the breadth and diversity of the material. \"Agrarian\" covers a great range of social phenomena; any student with an interest in rural societies will likely find a great deal of interest.However, I would recommend the class even to a student without such an interest at the outset. The reading is so well-chosen, and the discussions so rich, that any student interested in thinking about social organization and change will be highly engaged.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course without reservation. Thought-provoking and interdisciplinary readings, fantastic professors and students. A gem of a course.",
    "I would say that it was a demanding but very worthwhile class that changed the way I think about a lot of issues not just within my discipline but as a person.I would recommend it to another student.",
    "I would highly recommend this class for students of all levels and backgrounds. It served as an excellent introduction into the field of agrarian studies for myself, but it also appeared valuable for those with previous experience in the field to be exposed to new perspectives and to develop their individual research interests. The curriculum remained fresh and interesting throughout the course."

   "comments": [
    "I structured my final paper for this course as a chapter of my MA thesis, which the instructors fully supported and encouraged. I found the material on ideas of tradition, resistance and social change most relevant to my field of study.",
    "It made me view my discipline from a broader view. It contributed in important ways to my dissertation, especially in terms of methodology.",
    "I had no previous experience with courses in the agrarian studies department and found this to be extremely valuable for furthering my interest in rural development. The final paper was an opportunity for me to write my first research proposal for undergraduate research."
