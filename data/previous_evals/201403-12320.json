   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend this class, but possibly only looking back on it now. It's definitely a lot of work- a lot of readings each week, weekly responses, an 8-10 minute presentation, and a 20-30 page paper. The research paper is a lot of work, and definitely do not put it off until the last few weeks- it will make your life miserable and you'll end up disappointed in the end result (which for a paper that long is not a fun thing). Professor Hersh is very young and engaging, so class was absolutely never boring. Discussions were always lively and interesting, and the questions raised did really make me think about elections and politics. The professor is definitely not going to coddle you through the process, if your ideas or proposals aren't as good as they could be, he will tell you and then make you really think about how to improve. Even if it feels harsh sometimes, I'm definitely a better student and came out with a better result because of it. If you're willing to put in the amount of work this class requires, I would definitely recommend it.",
    "Don't be afraid of the research paper. Prof. Hersh is there to help you and you'll learn about all this cool empirical political science research that is out there.",
    "I would recommend this class, but only to a specific kind of student. It's a great class if you take it because you want to devote a ton of time to writing a political science research paper about an area you're really interested in; in that case, Professor Hersh is an excellent resource for papers, the class gives you plenty time to work on the assignment without pretty much any other work, and it'd be a really rewarding experience (week to week, the class is essentially no work -- just readings that we didn't discuss in too much detail in class, and a short weekly reading response). If you don't go into the class with a clear vision about a paper you're excited about writing, it can feel like you don't get a lot out of this class -- we ended up spending not too much time actually talking and getting into interesting ideas about each week's readings, and the entire class is really about writing the paper. If that's something you're psyched about, absolutely take this class. But if not, I would look for a different class that Prof. Hersh teaches.",
    "Overall the class is good and I would definitely recommend it if you have an interest in politics. The readings are pretty interesting and very manageable. Professor Hersh is very good at leading discussions and his passion for politics really shines through. The grading for the class comes down to two assignments: a presentation on a topic of your choice and the final paper. The final paper is worth 65% of your grade and you really have to be on top of it because there are no monthly deadlines on it. Hersh is pretty intimidating on the paper, he said that it has to be of publishable quality to get an A. Most of us were pretty scared of the paper and didn't know if it was just something he said to get us to work hard or whether he meant it. Regardless, the class is really good and I would definitely recommend, just know you will be uncertain about your grade until the very end.",
    "A very interesting and challenging class for people who have a background in politics and elections and want to explore further. You'll do some reasonable reading each week, submit a brief response to the discussion forum, have interesting discussions in class, and give an oral presentation about a current campaign or electoral issue, and you'll learn a lot about the process from it. The large research paper due at the end of the course is the big thing here. Professor Hersh expects a lot from it, and to do it well requires a lot of time and planning ahead. It is, of course, very doable, especially if you're interested, but don't take this course thinking you'll be able to blow off the paper.",
    "I would recommend it because of Professor Hersh and the interest selection of readings. However, you need to make sure you have a deep interest in elections because-- as the course title suggests-- that's what you'll be studying for an entire semester. Not for the student who wants to 'become more informed' on elections or politics.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student, but I have also heard that the lecture version that Professor Hersh taught was very good. If one does not have much background in political science or does not want to write a 20-30 page research paper, that course would be a very viable option.",
    "Yes, take the class if you're interested in national politics.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to a fellow student. Great course that keeps you engaged with current politics rather than just theory.",
    "This was a fantastic course and I would highly recommend it to anyone interested in US politics. Professor Hersh is a great professor, and he is very helpful in designing and completing the research paper. The research paper is a major part of the course, and can be fun but is also very demanding and will take most of the semester to complete.",
    "Absolutely fantastic class, and one of the best political science seminars I have taken at Yale. The course is a terrific overview of empirical political science literature on elections -- one of the most lively and interesting areas of political science. The course also includes a bit of election and campaign finance law (such as notable Supreme Court cases) which make for great discussion in class. The focus of the course is not only on reading and understanding scholarship, but on teaching students to *do* political science. The main assignment is an original research paper, which is fun and fascinating to write. Professor Hersh gives ample guidance for composing excellent political science papers, and he goes out of his way -- through time out of class, individual attention, thoughtful feedback, and helpful advice -- to make sure each student's paper is a success. Professor Hersh is young, energetic, and very smart. He keeps discussion lively and interesting, and he is especially good at explaining tricky ideas in a clear and cogent way. The reading was typical for a political science seminar, though sometimes just a bit on the heavy side. Ultimately, this course would be terrific both for political science majors and for people trying political science for the first time. If you are at all interested in elections, voting, campaign strategy, or campaign finance -- or if you could see yourself advising a political campaign or running for office -- take this class. It's a fantastic experience."
