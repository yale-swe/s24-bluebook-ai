   "comments": [
    "Russian is a difficult language. You have to be disciplined and put in AT LEAST TWO HOURS A DAY to be good at it. Prof Titus is great, although quality of the section varies by TFs. The book sucks, but if you're disciplined, you can learn Russian.",
    "This class is L2 Russian. It expands on the concepts learned in L1 and gives the student more command of the language. The workload is easily bearable (especially for a credit and a half). The teaching is excellent, and if you have any reason whatsoever to want to know Russian, I recommend this course whole-heartedly.",
    "Russian is hard, but if you're willing to do the work the course will get you to where you need to be. Lots of homework and every day (including reading period) sucks, but you really will progress quickly.",
    "Yes, but be prepared because Russian can be a challenging language, and may not come easily.",
    "I would recommend Russian 120 to another student. There's a homework assignment every night. It's not too time consuming, although I'd suggest doing all of the homework for the week during the weekend. It really helps, especially because we usually go over the exact material that's needed for the homework. By working ahead, you prepare yourself adequately for the day's lesson.",
    "This class will definitely be much easier for you if you are a speaker of some Slavic language. That said, doesn't seem too bad for those who weren't. Not too much work and you learn a fair bit.",
    "It is Russian. Fairly self descriptive. If you want to learn russian, take it.",
    "Solid course - be prepared to work hard this semester, you'll be learning a lot of Russian. The TA's in this course were the most wonderful and helpful people I've ever had and getting to know them and working with them was probably the best part of taking Russian.",
    "Yes, if you want to learn russian this is the class for it.",
    "Russian is a difficult, but rewarding language to learn. Titus is the best professor you could have: her patience and dedication is inspiring and encouraging."
