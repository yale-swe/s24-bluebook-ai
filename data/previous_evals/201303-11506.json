    "I would recommend Animal Behavior to anyone at all interested in animals. I don't think you need much of a biology background; it is all very interesting material and you learn to do research as you go. The grant proposal is especially useful for science majors as we have to learn how to fund our research in the future!",
    "Very good class if you're a science major in need of a writing credit. The material is interesting and fairly intuitive so you shouldn't struggle too much on the midterm. The paper is over before Thanksgiving which is a blessing come reading week, and you get a lot of help with it.",
    "Although I was reluctant to take this class at first, especially because I don't have an inherent interest in animals, and animal behavior, a seemingly narrow field, this class turned out to be my favorite. I looked forward to going to class in large part because Professor Alonzo was so great -- she made the lectures engaging (it was easy to pay attention for the full 85 minutes), and the material challenging enough to force us to think. The class was not about memorization, but about thinking like a scientist. It was also a wonderful way to get a WR credit -- especially for Science majors, much less of a struggle than an English \/ Humanities class. The research paper was interesting because you get to choose a topic that interests you -- so you get really into it. There's also a timeline for the research paper, so even though it is long, it doesn't feel too bad because the workload is spread out throughout the semester. Likewise, the reading is spread out too. A chapter of the textbook a week, with some supplementary reading. The class is not easy, but not impossible. A wonderful balance.",
    "Yes. Yes, yes and yes! I absolutely recommend this class, and anyone who is even remotely interested in animal behavior should take it. Professor Alonzo is amazing, and it will surprise you how fascinating some of the material can be. I'll admit, I only took animal behavior to fulfill a requirement for the neuroscience track within the psychology major, but it turned out to be so much more than that for me. I even considered switching to E&EB this semester, just because I wanted to take more classes like this.The general layout of the syllabus is as follows: You have biweekly lectures, which are interactive and well organized. You meet once a week for section, but there isn't any extra work assigned for this. The textbook reading is substantial, and some of the supplemental readings are dense, but as long as you understand the main concepts you never have to stress about the technical details. There are two exams -- a midterm and a final -- which are heavily based on applying what you've learned rather than regurgitating information. This scared me at first, the notion of having to design experiments on a test and synthesize information, but it's much better than having to memorize the hundreds of empirical examples you'll cover in class. The way lecture is structured, you end up synthesizing material and doing a lot of critical thinking anyways, so it's not that difficult to do it on the tests. You also write a 15 page research proposal for any topic in animal behavior, and the deadlines are laid out in a way that minimizes anxiety because you'll work on this alongside your teaching fellow throughout the semester. You have a lot of help and support from the teaching fellows and from Professor Alonzo, so you'll really get a lot out of this class. Take it!",
    "A really great class for anyone even remotely interested in the subject. You don't need to know much beforehand--I hadn't taken any of the prereqs and was just fine. You learn a lot of interesting and useful stuff, and Professor Alonzo is an incredible teacher. The tests require you to design experiments onyour feet and have a lot less straight recall than most, which I loved but which some might not. The course is about learning how to design experiments on animal behavior, not about cramming information into your head in detail that you'll never remember in a few years.",
    "A really great course if you are interested in the subject matter. A lot of it is self-evident, but you do learn some interesting science.",
    "Overview of topics in Animal Behavior like habitat selection, sexual selection, and sexual competition.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. Not only is the subject super interesting, but also it counts as a writing credit! This course basically looks at animal behavior from an econ perspective and will totally change the way you think about animals and experiments.",
    "Prof Alonzo is leaving so this probably won't be offered again but she was phenomenal and the class was very engaging and interesting. Don't be fooled by the title, though, it's most definitely not a gut or an easy A.",
    "This course is an overview of all of the basic theories of and ways to study animal behavior. No mathematical background or computer science is necessary, but you will see how these fields are applied to ethology. Dr. Alonzo is an engaging lecturer and the TF's love the subject. There's a final paper (hence the WR credit) that you'll receive lots of help with. This class isn't much work and is a lot of fun, so TAKE IT! Except it may be taught by someone else next year.",
    "Animal behavior is a class that teaches you the basic theories of understanding animal interactions and then makes you apply these theories in the second half of the semester. One midterm, a research proposal and a final so manageable workload.",
    "Good course. You will learn not just about specific examples of animal behaviour, but also all the underlying mechanisms as well as a surprisingly large and educational amount on what it's really like to design functional biological field studies. Professor Alonzo is great, workload is light and textbook is one of the best I've ever read. Recommended.",
    "You learn about animal behavior. It's not specific behaviors, necessarily; the class emphasizes trends, theories, and concepts, which is both a plus and a minus. If you want to learn more about the natural world and why animals act the way they do, then consider the class. If you're looking for weird trivia knowledge, this is not for you."
