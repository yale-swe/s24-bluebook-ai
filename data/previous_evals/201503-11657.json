   "comments": [
    "Did L1 and L2 Greek make you long for the sweet embrace of the grave? Fret not - GREK 131 is here to save you! An entertaining and varied survey of two of the most important prose stylists of the Classical Era, this class was an absolute delight. It was, thankfully, much less focused on the endless drilling of declensions and conjugations, and much more focused on untangling sentences, with a splash of cultural and historical colour. Highly recommended for those who are interested in a less grammar-focused and significantly more interesting and literary approach to Greek.",
    "Take it if you want to get better at Greek and read some of the most glorious prose ever written (Herodotus!). This is a solid class that will make you better at Greek and expose you to ancient historiography. Such a cool class!",
    "Greek 131 is a drastic shift from the cut and dry grammar of L1\/L2. However, what you need to know and learn is much more grey - It's a whole lot of vocab, reading, and sentences. It will fulfill the purpose of taking the language, but it is a drastic shift of how you need to learn and prepare. You will enjoy herodutus, don't be too intimidated by lysias early on - it is the harder of the two texts you will read.",
    "In this class you will really improve your skills of Greek. In the beginning we read Lysias, which is attic Greek, but then quickly move on to Herodotus's Histories, which we focused on for the rest of the semester. The ionic Greek seemed quite daunting in the beginning, but you get used to it very quickly and in the end I personally found it easier than Attic to translate.",
    "This class is really hard, and you need to come into it ready to translate Lysias from day one. There is no slow escalation of difficulty, but you just dive in and stomach a couple low scores in the first few weeks. The class is really challenging. Be prepared.",
    "Highly recommended.",
    "If you are interested in Ancient Greek, Greek 131 is an excellent choice. You read classical Greek authors in their own words, and the reading are supplemented with cultural sessions to enhance the experience."
