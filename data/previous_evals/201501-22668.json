    "Definitely take this class! Professor Santos is amazing and I enjoyed every minute of every lecture! The material is interesting and the workload is pretty light",
    "Obviously a SICK class. You should take it if it's ever offered again. Laurie Santos is a bo$$",
    "Yes! Fun and entertaining class",
    "Take with santos. Do study seriously for midterm and final. Psych tests are challenging to the soul.",
    "Cool class, Laurie Santos is GREAT and really funny. A little heavy on the sex and evolution part and not as much emphasis on human nature as I would have liked, but whatever",
    "Sexy psyc explains a lot of human follies in terms of the parts of evolution and biology that made us the way we are.",
    "Absolutely a great class no matter what major.",
    "Psyc 171 gives an overview of evolution and then applies evolutionary theory to study human nature. The course is very easy with interesting lectures, no homework, and simple tests and quizzes, but there is an irritating research project. At some points, the focus on studying how the evolution of sex impacts human behavior and society may blind the course from considering other explanations, such as evolutionary theory not having to do with sex or parts of human behavior that arise from culture independent of evolution.",
    "PSYC 171 is an incredibly hyped, popular, and overpopulated course. The course itself is good, though perhaps slightly overrated. Dr. Santos is a strong lecturer who is engaging and includes lots of videos and examples that keep lectures interesting. At times though, she also injects her own personal opinion into lectures and take shots at certain peoples (ex. against anti-evolutionists, religious peoples), which can seem slightly petty in the mission of educating her class. The course is graded fairly and the exams are manageable. Quizzes are not too difficult and problem sets help to prepare. Dr. Santos provides lecture notes that help to review the material. I recommend if you're at all interested in animals, since this basically boils down to a course about sexual selection as it manifests itself in other species and our own as well. Worth consideration if you have space in your schedule.",
    "The class is amazing! Definitely take it. If you're a psych major, you've probably heard most of the human psych components of the course, but this class goes more in-depth, and offers much information on the wider animal world. Professor Santos is a rockstar. Her lectures are clear, concise, funny, easy to follow, sensitive of their audience, and interesting! I love love love this class. It was so much fun to go to every TTh.",
    "Cool class. Hopefully it;s still around next year.",
    "Take this class!!! It's very rare that you get to take a class like this taught by such a well known and awesome professor like Santos. Work is a little hard but doable with a group of people to study with. TAKE THIS",
    "Great class, I would recommend it to every Yale student.",
    "Great course. Not too much work but really interesting and awesome lecture. You will learn a lot about human nature and animal behavior. Take it.",
    "I'd recommend it - just know it focuses heavily on animals",
    "Really large lecture w optional section. Somewhat harder than expected.",
    "TAKE IT!!!!!",
    "TAKE IT TAKE IT TAKE IT",
    "I would recommend this class, especially to non psych majors that wanted a fun class besides psych 110",
    "Great lectures. If you're interested in the material the class is a breeze but be wary of all of the hype!",
    "The exams can have some tricky questions on it, but overall the material is very interesting. The final paper seemed pointless and just a way to give us even more work for the sake of it. Professor Santos is an incredible lecturer and I am definitely glad I got the chance to take a class with her.",
    "I recommend this if you're looking for an easy, fun class.",
    "GREAT CLASS! TAKE IT! If they still offer it. I'm not a psyc major whatsoever. Very interesting and puts human behavior in evoluationary perspective.",
    "PSYC 171 is a fantastic class! None of the material is too hard or dense, so it's a nice class to take as a 5th credit or for fun. You'll learn a lot of fun stuff you can apply to your own life.",
    "if it's offered again, TAKE IT. don't think about it, just take it!",
    "I would definitely recommend PSYC 171 to people interested in basically any field of psych, evolutionary biology, or some combination of the two. As a psych\/neuro major who wants to study clinical psych, I came out of the class much more interested in evolutionary psych than I had been previously, because the material is just that interesting. It also just generally teaches you a lot about how we behave as humans, and what we can do to change that, which is awesome. (The animal lectures were less immediately relevant to human behavior, but still really cool.)",
    "I took it Credit\/D as I'm sure many people did. Good class to take stress-free, entirely for fun. You do learn a lot, so it's worth it.",
    "A evolutionary biology meets psychology course. Really interesting material, though a lot of overlap with intro psych.",
    "I would definitely recommend that you take Sexy Psych. Professor Santos is PHENOMENAL. Every lecture is like a theatrical production--polished, memorable, and captivating. Professor Santos' sense of humor, warmth, and passion were all icing on the cake. The material is very interesting. You'll learn about about human nature through the window of evolution and reproductive strategies. And the workload is very reasonable: the problem sets are straightforward, the tests are fair, and the research paper is enjoyable. All in all, definitely take the course. Professor Santos is the epitome of a Yale instructor.",
    "Psyc 171 is good and relatively straight forward in terms of material and assignments. Even if you don't have a lot of experience with the material, it will still be a fun class to take.",
    "Lots of sex, a decent amount of evolution, just a little bit of human nature. I enjoyed the balance.",
    "Every lecture is Ted Talk quality.",
    "This is a great class and you will get out of it what you put into it. The material is interesting (but not groundbreaking) and the professor is very engaging. Going to lectures is not a chore and will be very helpful for the exams. Good class overall.",
    "Super interesting, low workload, great credit\/d\/fail. Lectures are actually pretty fun, and the material was easy to learn.",
    "A great course that is super interesting, and one that everyone should take!",
    "I would recommend the class to students who are interested in evolution, human mating strategy, uniqueness of human nature, etc.",
    "Thought-provoking and enjoyable, but not the most scientifically rigorous. I recommend this course, but think critically about what you're being told, and don't subscribe to theories about human sexuality just because they seem intuitive.",
    "Take this class if you're looking for something fun and different to take with your friends, possibly as a fifth class or for a social science credit. Not sure I would actually recommend this to psychology majors since there's relatively little, well... psychology involved here, despite this being officially a psych course. The course is really more about evolutionary theory, sexual selection, mating strategies and cultural evolution, so really it's more of a light mix of evolutionary biology, sociology, anthropology and psychology. Workload is light, concepts are pretty easy, Laurie Santos is a great lecturer and lectures are often fun to attend. If any of the above sounds good to you, just go for it. Or at least shop it.",
    "PSYC 171 is an interesting, relatively easy course that would make a great 5th class or Cr\/D\/F option. I would highly recommend it if you want something fun that doesn't require a lot of time or input outside of going to the lectures (you don't really need to do any of the reading, although it's very interesting if you have the time to do it).",
    "One of the best classes I have taken at Yale. Laurie Santos is incredible, funny, and charismatic. This is a must take course while at Yale!",
    "Absolutely! The material was SO interesting ... I basically just learned a semester's worth of fun facts. I took it credit\/d\/fail, and it was totally stress free. Grading on the tests was surprisingly harsh, so I would avoid taking it for a grade if you can.",
    "I loved sexy psych, and it definitely did live up to be everything I expected it to be. I wish the class was a little less focused on animals (as I previously knew from reviews), but even knowing a bunch of bizarre animal facts can be really fun. It got repetitive at times, but I definitely feel like I came out of the class with a new knowledge base and way of thinking I wouldn't have gotten anywhere else out of life. Tests\/quizzes could be annoying, but if you study\/do psets you'll be fine. Professor Santos is awesome and passionate -- she seriously cares for both her students and the material, and you'll feel that.",
    "Yeah i would recommend the class to somebody else, but just know that it will make you feel like you're in high school again and you'll feel kinda like a child. Santos is a lot of fun, but part of the humor can in an attempt to seem approachable be a little patronizing. Super interesting stuff though -- animals are crazy.",
    "Yes! The most fun psych course I've taken thus far at Yale.",
    "It's a fairly easy class about how evolution and mating systems help explain human behavior. You learn about evolution for the first few weeks, and if you've taken any biology class since elementary school you won't get much out of that part of the class. But it gets more interesting later on, and in any case Laurie Santos is an amazing professor who can make class super engaging even if the material is pretty easy.",
    "Summary: an evolutionary overview of human nature, starting with evolution and moving to mating systems of the animal kingdom, then applying all that material to humanity (which is scientifically tough but very fascinating!) Recommendation: TAKE THIS COURSE. It's not offered often, but it's great! The lectures are hilarious, the material interesting, the workload light, the assessments forgiving (In addition to the midterm, final, and research paper, there are five quizzes, two dropped, with questions that come from homework problems--which you don't have to hand in formally.)",
    "Awesome class, take it!!!!!!",
    "This class was good. It was super interesting but it felt more like a biology class than anything else (tons of random memorizations and such). No section which was nice. I went to lecture everyday and Laurie often repeated herself which made life a little boring. The project was doable and the tests were fair.",
    "I would recommend taking this course. It wasn't hard at all and taught me a lot about a subject (evolution) that I think is pretty important to be literate in.",
    "Yes, and especially if you're interested in the topics. If not, I'd still considering taking it just for Professor Santos.",
    "YES",
    "I loved this class so, so much! Definitely one of the best classes I've ever taken at Yale, and I'm so glad I randomly shopped it during shopping week. 5 quizzes, and you can drop 2. The exams were both not bad at all and kind of fun to take. The final project\/paper at the end of the semester was also really fun. Take this class if you can!!",
    "bonobos.",
    "This class is overrated. I don't feel like I learned a lot and the lectures often dragged on. It's not that substantive, and the material felt repetitive and intuitive.",
    "Fun, light, and you'll learn a lot of interesting things!",
    "Very interesting class, I enjoyed it a lot.",
    "The course is definitely interesting. A little bit of basic bio, and a lot of information on how we became the sexual re producers that we are. LOVED looking at other species to reflect on our own nature. Also, Laurie Santos is soooooo nice and she really cares about you learning the material, even in a huge lecture.",
    "Yes I would definitely recommend it, I think it gave a lot of insight into human nature and was overall very interesting and engaging. Shame it may be going away for a while!",
    "If Prof. Santos teaches this again, take this course if you are interested in taking an engaging and fun course. If you take a psychology class at Yale, it should be this one.",
    "Not as easy as you think, but a great interesting course.",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend it ! Great class and excellent professor who teaches it.",
    "Definitely take the class. So interesting.",
    "Great class but more work than you would think. Fun lectures!",
    "Definitely recommend! Take this course not just if you like psych, because it is just an all around amazing course. Every student at Yale should take this course!",
    "I took it as a second semester senior. Fun class with a manageable workload. I was worried that overeager freshmen would make a hard curve, but the course was exactly the way I expected. It isn't a gut, but with lecture attendance and cramming before the midterm and final you should do well.",
    "I cool way to look at human nature",
    "DEFINITELY TAKE THIS CLASS. I'm not sure if Professor Santos is offering it again, but this class was super interesting, everything was fairly graded, and I learned so much about human nature and the evolutionary basis of biology. The class is definitely not too \"science-y\" for people like me who HATE science and math. (There is nothing quantitative whatsoever).",
    "Yes if you like psychology things or if you enjoy evolutionary biology. It was really fun.",
    "Definitely worth taking.",
    "Great class, definitely take it!!",
    "PSYC171 is an excellent class! Professor Laurie Santos is as awesome as everyone says. She is an awesome lecturer, and has such an interesting way of teaching students about evolutionary theory and mating behavior. You don't want to miss out on this class! The workload isn't too bad and the course material is all extremely interesting. I have no complaints.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to other students although Professor Santos mentioned potentially not ever teaching it again. I think it was one of the most enjoyable classes I've taken and was structured so well that it didn't even feel like it was a 600 person lecture.",
    "I would definitely recommend it to another student!",
    "This course is about evolution, NOT SEX. Do not be fooled by the title. If you want to learn about evolution, it's great. If you want to learn about sex, find a self-help book.",
    "Definitely a class you should shop. Make sure to keep up with course work though.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class. The lectures are fun and you learn really interesting topics that apply to everyday life. There is very little work, which makes this a great 5th class.",
    "It's a class you should take if you have even a slight interest in psychology.",
    "I took this class my senior spring. I'm an ECON major and I never took a PSYC class before, so I learned a lot on a new and engaging topic in a class that was hugely entertaining but not too much work.",
    "It's good if you're interested in animals and their behavior.",
    "You will learn theories and facts about nature, animals, us (humans) and evolution you will not believe existed. Great!",
    "Take this class for Laurie Santos.",
    "Sexy psych is a super fun intro-level course. Professor Santos created a wonderful class that is highly entertaining and extremely informative. I knew very little about evolutionary biology before this class, but I left feeling like I had a very solid background on it. Tests are pretty easy, and the quizzes basically guaruntee you an A. Great intro course for someone without much background in psychology.",
    "If this course is being offered, take it!",
    "MUST TAKE THIS CLASS AT YALE Be warned that you must go to class and do the work or else your grade will suffer",
    "Very good, low stress class with a great professor. Pretty basic though",
    "YES",
    "Tremendous class size, very general overview of some typical psych topics, nothing really too interesting discussed at length.",
    "Yooo, super dank memes and cool stuff. Not that hard and pretty interesting. Only problem is that it's p crowded, but w\/e lol.",
    "Take it!!",
    "Take the class if offered. Really cool way to look at human behavior. You will try to explain things in terms of evolution.",
    "PSYC 171 is a fun class that doesn't have a lot of work up front but then comes on heavy toward the end of the semester. I would not recommend as a fifth credit but is a fun class",
    "Take this class. It's so fun!",
    "Psych 171 is a very fascinating introduction to the mating systems of a variety of organisms in the animal kingdom. Moreover, this class also gives insight on the perplexing area of human nature including the necessity of religion, music, and sexual reproduction strategies.",
    "Definitely recommend",
    "Definitely",
    "Incredibly enjoyable and entertaining class, but still an awesome opportunity to learn an immense amount about human nature as well as our animal relatives.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. It was was very interesting.",
    "Definitely. It's not overly challenging, but you learn a lot of cool things. Not to tough course, but pretty interesting, and Laurie Santos finds way to make it relevant and entertaining.",
    "This course is awesome. Definitely intro level and sometimes moves a tiny bit slowly, but really shaped the way I think. It's also a really pleasant lecture to attend. The vibe of the lectures reminded me of intro psych with Marvin Chun--fun, digestible, and interesting.",
    "Great",
    "If you have the chance to take this class absolutely do it. It's amazing.",
    "PSYC 171 is a fantastic course! It genuinely covers the topics of \"sex,\" \"evolution,\" and \"human nature\" extensively in a fascinating, fun, and engaging way. Take it especially if you're interested in animal psychology and sexual behavior (b\/c over half the course is focused on animals before you even discuss humans!) Laurie is fantastic and an amazing lecturer. The workload is pretty light.",
    "Don't think twice; take this class.",
    "Great class",
    "I highly recommend PSYC 171 if it's offered ever again. However, while it was a very enjoyable and fun class, I am not sure I got much out of it. Only a third of the class (towards the end) focuses on human nature and psychology (if any), so if you are looking to learn more about Psychology, this might not be the class. This class focuses more on evolution than psychology.",
    "It's comparative psych.",
    "Yes! It is a great course",
    "very good class overall; a bit overhyped; good intro to psyc topics",
    "Coming into the class with absolutely no experience with psychology, I was a little apprehensive. However, I really enjoyed the class and it was taught really well. It definitely helped to have a background in biology; the first few lectures covered a lot of things that were also taught in the Bio 101-104 sequences. However, when we started getting into more of the psychology, it was a great introduction and I would definitely recommend it to any student.",
    "TAKE THIS. It's hilarious, fascinating, and very chill. If you need an SO, take it. Even if you don't, take it. You'll look forward to every lecture. Also, there's VERY little work.",
    "If this class is being offered, TAKE IT! It is such a fun time, Laurie Santos is amazing in every way, and a lot of what you learn in Sexy Psych is very interesting and highly amusing. It is definitely a gem, so if you have the chance, don't let it slip away. Definitely shop it at the very least.",
    "A fair amount of work, but take this class!! You'll learn so much about yourself and your own interactions!",
    "Psych 171 was an amazing and interesting look at human nature. It was a really interesting and unique perspective on human nature, and I felt as though I learned a lot, not just about human nature but about animal nature as well! I feel like I got a lot out of the class, more than I initially thought I would! I highly recommend it!",
    "Yes! Take it.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to any student interested in evolutionary psychology, whether you need it for your major or not. It'll teach you a lot while being fun at the same time, and the workload is always manageable.",
    "A decent class that you should definitely take if you are into psych. If you're just looking for a 5th class, and have a Credit\/D to use, this is a great one to use it on. Go over the lecture notes before exams and you'll be good. The paper at the end was super annoying, but the grading is more than fair. There are 5 very short quizzes that she gives you the potential questions for in advance, a midterm, a final during the last week of classes, and a final paper where you examine online personal ads and write about a certain correlation between two groups and their mate choices.",
    "Recommend!!!!! Professor is a great lecturer and the material itself is super fun and interesting. Grading is fair; top 3 of 5 quizzes taken and quiz questions are directly from problem sets. Solid exam curve too. All around great class",
    "Learn the science of being a human! Taught in a fun way that explores interesting parts in nature. I would definitely recommend it.",
    "Less good than people acted like it was. Something of a gut.",
    "A great course to have a correct view of evolution and human nature. It helps to understand oneself, human beings, and the society.",
    "Absolutely. Fantastic class, Laurie is the best. But you do need to study for the midterm",
    "Take it. Sexy psych is everything it's talked up to be, and Laurie Santos only teaches it once every few years, so if she happens to teach it while you're at Yale, jump on that opportunity. It's not really a gut though, so do actually go to lectures, do the practice psets, and study for the midterm\/final. The lectures are super entertaining so it's not hard to get yourself to go. She assigns several books at the beginning of the semester, but if you know you're not actually going to read them (like the large majority of the class), then don't waste money buying them.",
    "One of the best lecture classes I've ever taken at Yale! It's a decent amount of work, but it pays off.",
    "Pretty basic overview of a lot of things. Begins with natural selection and stuff, but then goes into more interesting things focusing on different types of mating behaviors in animals and ends on humans. Organization of the class is good and I'd recommend it as an easier, fun class. 2 exams and best 3 out of 5 quizzes.",
    "This is a class that every human being should take. I am constantly dropping sexy psych knowledge to my friends that I learned in class, and always recommend the course to people that I meet -- I heard that it won't be offered again, however, which is a tragedy.",
    "Definitely take it, really great course.",
    "A study of the evolution of humans, their mating systems, and their psyche. A great look at how we differ from closely species and how we do not. Considers our spot on the tree of life, the ways in which we are firmly and earnestly just another animal, and the ways in which we are not.",
    "Interesting class on the evolution of love and other aspects of human nature. No section, easy workload, and fun to go to.",
    "Do it.",
    "A fun class that occasionally gets repetitive, but I would definitely recommend it",
    "Take it!!!!!",
    "Absolutely awesome course, material is so interesting. I highly highly recommend, and the work load is very minimal.",
    "Psych 171 is a well-structured overview of many general psychology principles. Although the course seemed like it was designed to give a gestalt of the department, Laurie Santos is careful to offer outside resources for those interested in pursuing course material in more depth.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS. Show up to lecture. Laugh and be enlightened. Absolutely incredible.",
    "Completely recommend it! Great and fun course!",
    "PSYC 171 is a really great class that I highly recommend taking if you get the chance. The workload is reasonable and the material is very interesting. Professor Santos is fantastic, and the lectures are entertaining but also very informative. I would recommend staying on top of the material in this course because the midterm and final require a lot of studying, and I would also recommend getting started on the final paper in advance. Overall, great class and would highly recommend it to students of all backgrounds and interests.",
    "I'd definitely recommend this course!",
    "PSYC 171 was an enjoyable class that I generally looked forward to attending. Some of the early lectures on Darwin were a little boring, but the ones specifically on humans and human nature were very interesting and definitely shaped the way I now think about human reproductive and mating strategies. I would recommend this class to anyone at all interested in the topic because the workload is manageable and the topic is interesting.",
    "A must-take if it's offered! I learned so much from this course as a non-Psych major.",
    "YEA YEA YEA",
    "I would absolutely recommend taking this. I went into it worried because it was such a big group and I was really only taking it for the social science credit, but I ended up enjoying every lecture. Laurie Santos is incredible and makes class exciting by drawing in pop culture and using funny videos. I looked forward to going to this class.",
    "I recommend the class. She said she's never teaching it again, but it was a good class, though considered more on the gut side. I kind of treated each lecture as a TED talk and just got what I could. The videos were hilarious.",
    "Absolutely take it!! Sexy psych is fun and has a reasonable workload. You learn a lot of cool things.",
    "Fun. Not too much work. Awesome teacher. Take it.",
    "Definitely take it because you learn so much. You don't have to do the SB readings, and you also don't have to buy the books (just Wiki them). If you can take this course with a friend, do!",
    "Best class at Yale.",
    "Yes! It's not a lot of work and it teaches you things you should know.",
    "Probably one of the best classes I will ever take at Yale! Yes I would recommend this class, even if the student does not want to pursue psychology.",
    "This course is sexy. Take it. You won't regret it. It's sexy",
    "I would recommend PSYC 171 to another student because it was a very interesting and unique class. The connection between animal mating systems and human mating systems is something that was very cool to learn about. This class is easier for those who have already had some type of psychology background. Beware that there are not many grades in this class, so if you do bad on one or two assignments, you are already behind.",
    "PSYC 171 is a great class that anyone interested in psychology should take - regardless of their major. I would definitely recommend this to any Yale student looking for an interesting class with relevant course material.",
    "I would recommend PSYC 171 only as a fifth class.",
    "Sexy Psych=life",
    "This course is interesting, but graded challengingly. Santos is an engaging lecturer.",
    "Very interesting and diverse material. Not entirely about sex but definitely sexy!",
    "This class is a must take for all Yale students",
    "A very entertaining and interesting class. Definitely take, requires basically no work, and is a Yale classic.",
    "Definitely, the course isn't everything it's built up to be, but its still really engaging and informative.",
    "Must take",
    "Great course on debunking some common myths on evolution, learning about different mating systems and community dynamics in non-humans and the applications that these systems have on human nature. Really fun class.",
    "not particularly. the material was very average, much of it felt like an intro to bio 104 course. It would have been worse had it not been for Santos's great lecturing.",
    "This class is worth it if you don't have too strong of a background in evolutionary psychology or primate evolution\/ecology. If you do, the material can be pretty repetitive and basic, but otherwise the lectures are engaging and the material is overall pretty interesting.",
    "Take this class. It is an amazing experience and the material is so interesting. Regardless of your major, this is a great course to take.",
    "This is a very fun class, and I would recommend to people who think it sounds interesting and want a 5th class or a social science credit, but don't expect to feel terribly fulfilled by the material. The subject is so broad, and it's super interesting, but I walked away feeling more like I knew a lot of really cool facts than like I had taken a class. That being said, you should at least shop it if it's offered again, just to see the hype for itself. And Laurie Santos is wonderful...she really makes the class worthwhile.",
    "More of a class on biological evolution than on the psychology of sex, this class discusses reproduction through many aspects: physiological, evolutionary, cultural. It's an interesting class on sex and evolution. Professor Santos is very engaging",
    "its great as it is",
    "Yes it is extremely interesting",
    "Really fun, great class, especially one to take if you want to become aware of why humans act the way we do. Professor Santos is hilarious and the material is super interesting. Take it. It's a good 5th class--not too heavy of a workload.",
    "I would suggest it only if you know you can stay on top of yourself and not slack.",
    "Fun class, cool teacher, & cool topic. It's more abut animal sex than human sex until the end. The paper at the end seems random but it's doable.",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone interested in psychology looking for a fun 5th class. The class is huge (~600 students) but Prof. Santos organizes everything so well that the semester went very smoothly. Evolution, Sex and Human Nature are all fascinating materials and this class is a great introduction. I took this class Credit\/D\/Fail so I put in almost no work other than going to the lectures and showing up for the exams and writing the final paper. But even then I get the feeling that I was doing quite well in the class, but I guess I can never find out now. There is no mandatory homework other than a final paper with very specific instructions which makes it quite easy to write. The in-class midterm and the final test mostly lecture material, and of the 5 quizzes you get to drop two. Overall this class, even if taken with letter grade, has very little mandatory work and was a stress-free and fun 5th class for me.",
    "Its an easy class and the lectures can be fun, but I didn't learn much. The final project was annoying, the way we had to do it and the midterm and final required a lot of memorization.",
    "It's a really fun classkind of like watching planet earth.",
    "TAKE IT. Professor Santos is a star. The class is so low-stress and so incredibly engaging. Why wouldn't you take it? It will totally change the way you see the world, as a great class should. If it's offered again make sure to build your schedule around it. Or at least audit some lectures (if there's seating space). You won't regret it.",
    "FOR GOD, FOR COUNTRY, AND FOR LAURIE! You are making a terrible mistake if you don't take this class. Not challenging, but really interesting.",
    "The course title is a little misleading...most of the lectures talk about animal nature not human nature. Overall, the course was easy to follow. If you show up to class and pay attention, you will never be lost.",
    "Interesting class. She posts the powerpoints and lecture notes online so you can just sit and listen in lecture instead of rushing to take notes. Fun, easy fifth class. Five quizzes that you know the questions ahead of time, and you can drop two. An in class midterm and final, and then a 5 page final research paper. Relatively easy workload. I didn't do any of the readings and was totally fine. There were only 1-2 questions on the exams about the readings and they were multiple choice or short answer. If you're worried, read a summary of the books before the exams.",
    "Great 5th class if you are not a psyc major",
    "AWESOME AWESOME AWESOME.",
    "10\/10 would recommend",
    "Sexy Psych was a sorta-science class that really just teaches you cool things about mating strategies (and therefore, evolution) in the animal kingdom. I looked forward to the class every time, and the first quarter with tons of animal documentary snippets was pretty mind-blowing. I loved this class, and would absolutely recommend it to anyone free to take it.",
    "I was surprised by how much this course focused on evolutionary biology rather than psychology. If I'd known going into the semester that this would be the focus, I likely would not have taken it. But it was still an interesting class, and I looked at the subject material from an angle that I otherwise would not have picked up on.",
    "Definitely definitely take this class if you're lucky enough that Laurie decides to teach it again! You learn a lot of important and relevant evolutionary biology concepts, as well as a lot of interesting facts about human nature, and the problems with the less pleasant ones!",
    "Would definitely recommend! Very interesting class that changes how you view the world. Not super work intensive, which is a bonus.",
    "I recommend taking this class! It is not too hard and it gives important insights about the human mating system. Learning about all the different animal mating behaviours were extremely interesting. We looked at so many videos and documentaries during lectures. And they were all interesting. Even though the readings are recommended, you can do very well without doing the readings. The lectures are the most important parts (but all the slides and study guides are available on classesV2). There were about 600 people in the class. It shows how popular this class was. Personally, the last few lectures were not as fun, but overall, it's a great class to take.",
    "intro psych plus BBC world videos",
    "Definitely, great class.",
    "I would recommend it! The information taught is quite valuable, as you will find it permeates so many aspects of everyday life. However, if you have taken biology at Yale before, you will find it tends to water down the biological component (to accommodate the wide range of students taking the course).",
    "THIS IS NOT A GUT. Exams are difficult, and the final project is actually pretty stressful. Take it Credit\/D if you can.",
    "Class is actually fun to attend because of professor Santos. At times it drags on, but whatever. A super easy course if you attend lecture. I didnt even take notes, I just attended and did pretty well. Never did the reading. A great 5th class\/ CR\/D class if you need one of those. I took it for a grade and thats why I attended lecture, but if you are doing CR\/D that is completely unnecessary as all the slides are online and there are \"lecture notes\" online as well that are more like a brief outline of what happens each class.",
    "Awesome course in which you learn very important things about life",
    "Take this class. I loved it! You learn a lot and are entertained while doing so. Of my classes this past semester, this class had the lightest workload, but dont treat it as a gut if you are taking it for a letter grade because there is a lot of information. Professor Santos is amazing professor and person, so dont miss out on the opportunity to take a class with her.",
    "It's an easy low level psych class that you should consider taking if you want an easy low level class.",
    "Yes, take it before you graduate!",
    "I recommend because a very interesting class with almost no work, and Professor Santos is a strong lecturer.",
    "It should definitely at least be a class that is shopped if it fits the schedule. It's fun and interesting.",
    "An interesting class with an engaging lecturer. This class is a gem, not only because it comes around every 3 years, but also because it is rare to find a course that combines a fun, down-to-earth lecturer with rich material that is delivered in a fun and stimulating way. It is hard to find a weakness in this class.",
    "Professor Santos is engaging, but the class is somewhat basic at times, especially for people with background already. Best to take as a freshman. TAs for the class in general are extremely rude. They don't want to help you during office hours and are snarky.",
    "This is one of the best classes that one can ever take. It is a must take!",
    "Very interesting and builds off of everything you learn. Very applicable and fun",
    "Sexy Psych has been my favorite class at Yale! Professor Santos is an incredible lecturer and all the material was so interesting. The exams were fair, and the problem sets were actually really enjoyable. I would definitely recommend this course to anyone at Yale.",
    "Great class! Super interesting. I'm a Junior psych major, so the class was a little repetitive for me at times, but even so, I'd highly recommend!",
    "This course focuses a lot on mating strategies once it has given you the evolutionary background. It is very interesting but also gives you responsibility for a lot of content, so be ready for that. I would recommend this course for students wanting to know more about the biology behind attraction and strategies used by other species. It is a course heavy on science, but nothing too difficult. Attending lecture helps a lot even though Laurie gives you notes.",
    "Sexy Psych is great. Professor Santos is an amazing lecturer, and the material is very interesting. Even if you're not usually a psych person, I definitely recommend this class. It's not a lot of work, but it's a ton of fun and you still learn a lot.",
    "It's a good course, especially if you're trying to balance out a heavy workload. The lectures are interesting, engaging, and funny. There are five in-class quizzes (announced with the question posted online, so you can fully prepare), two exams (the midterm and final), and one final research paper. It's a chill class, and the content is pretty applicable to understanding human behavior. It's not exactly mind-blowing; a lot of the material is pretty intuitive, but Santos is still a joy to learn from.",
    "Sexy Psych is an incredible course that focuses on human nature. Topics that were covered range from the evolution and development of mating systems, the rise of culture, love and violence, and the things that make us distinctly human. This was easily the best course I have taken at Yale. So interesting with an INCREDIBLE professor.",
    "This was a great course on the behavioral, sexual, and cognitive differences and similarities between humans and other species of animals. I learned a lot and the material was interesting, however the course did get really repetitive and I thought that it was overrated. This would be a great course to audit now and then, but I wouldn't recommend taking it unless you absolutely have to. Or just take it as a 5th class.",
    "Laurie Santos is a God among fleas (we're the fleas) and if you don't take this incredibly interesting, entertaining, and wonderful course then you've wasted your tuition. So basically not taking this class means you've wasted 60 grand for the year. Try explaining that to your parents.",
    "eh",
    "yes",
    "I would recommend PSYC 171 purely as a fun class to explore a field you may not intend to major in.",
    "A broad overview of the topic of evolutionary biology leading into a more in-depth look at how it relates and informs human nature. At first there's a lot of kind of tedious groundwork that has to be laid (Darwin, Punnett Squares, etc.) but the latter part of the semester in which we focused on questions related to humans and their relationships was pretty interesting. Professor Santos is a very engaging professor who made each lecture fun and enjoyable to attend.",
    "Exactly what I needed to take. Fantastic course. So fascinating. Laurie Santos is probably the most skillful, charismatic, and funny lecturer I've had.",
    "TAKE. THIS. CLASS. Have you already signed up for it? Why not?! Sexy Psyc (as it's affectionately called) is a brilliant class which looks at some of the fundamental aspects of human nature from a scientifically rigorous perspective. Why do we have violence? What are the flaws that are inherent to human nature and how do we address them? Questions that would normally be reserved for the domain of philosophers are addressed with cold hard science and the darkest corners of human nature are illuminated with imperial inquiry. Have I convinced you yet? Take the class!"
