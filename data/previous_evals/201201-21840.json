    "Absolutely! If you are looking for a course that will change your worldview on some of the most fascinating questions that face us as humans, Shelly is the prof. to take it from.",
    "I would recommend it to people who love moral philosophy and want to consider how it plays out for animals. For people who love animals and want to think about them from a philosophical standpoint - this class might be tough for you... It's a super interesting subject - but definitely very challenging on the philosophy end. Make sure to put a lot of time into the class in order to really make it worth your while.",
    "Very interesting class and I encourage those who are fervently against animal rights to take this class. (not because you will be converted- you may not- but because you may have an interesting perspective to add)",
    "Animal Ethics provided a philosophical overview of the main issues in Animal Ethics. The class approached the issue of Animal Ethics from the position of existing ethical positions: utilitarianism, deontology, virtue ethics, Kantianism, etc. The reading was appropriate and challenging, covering a wide range of topics. The class emphasizes in-class discussion, and the grades are based on an early paper and final long paper. I would definitely recommend this class. It is philosophy heavy, but intellectually, as well as personally, engaging for anyone interested in this important contemporary topic."
