   "comments": [
    "I have never imagined anyone at Yale caring more about students than Anne Fadiman, especially given that she is also a really serious writer. If you get into this class and you do not take it, you are a gargantuan fool.",
    "Yes, absolutely. If you want to write or report or grow as a human, take this class.",
    "This is an exceptional class. You must take this class. Here are some reasons it is the best class you will ever take:1) Anne has specific, concrete lessons that teach you how to become a better writer. She teaches you how to write and how to revise in such an accessible way, and you can visibly see how much your work improves over the semester.2) Because of the way this class is structured, you will have a community of other writers in the classroom with you. You read each other's work and do peer critiques, and the whole atmosphere is extremely supportive and wonderful.3) You have hour-long conferences with Anne for every piece, where she sits with you and does line-edits of your work. She reads every comma and every adjective so closely, and you go over every sentence together.4) The reading is fun and fascinating and inspiring.I'm using all the grammar rules correctly when I say, LITERALLY take this class.",
    "If you are lucky enough to take the course, do it! Your writing will improve and you'll have lots of fun. Anne's syllabus is quite detailed, so I recommend that students looking for a summary of the course content just go download it on the Classesv2 syllabus browser -- everything is there.(Workload-wise: the actual amount of work is very reasonable. Do all the reading and maybe more -- it's actually possible, unlike in most Yale courses. What I found was that even though the workload was reasonable, I was happy to be taking the class in an otherwise light semester. You WILL want to impress Anne and your classmates and so you will want to spend as much time as possible making your pieces as good as possible. The more time you can spare, the better.)",
    "Take it if you get in. It will be the gem of your semester. If you are like me, you'll completely forget you are enrolled in any other courses.",
    "This was probably the best class I've ever taken. Anne is without question one of the most caring and dedicated teachers at Yale; she has a lot of wisdom to impart and, if you get into the class, she will probably show you a lot of talent and ingenuity that you didn't know you had. The class is a lot of work, but it's worth it. Apply if you have a passion for writing and want to become a better writer, no matter your specific interest (though this class may be most useful for students with a good deal of investigative reporting experience, and less experience interrogating their own prose--students who want to find ways to express themselves creatively even in writing that is not necessarily directly autobiographical). On your application, be bold but honest: be your real self, and remember that even the sections that are not the \"writing sample\" are themselves a writing sample. And of course, take it if you get in. (A final note: from what I can tell, this is a more widely useful class than Writing about Oneself, it has a more exciting and varied set of assignments, and fewer people apply.)",
    "This is a great class. For anyone with an interest in writing, it is probably the best class at Yale. You will become a better writer, editor, and person. The three hour classes, the conferences with Anne, and the semester will all go by way too fast. How much you learn will depend on how much time and effort you dedicate to the assignments, especially the final YP assignment. But you will learn a lot no matter what, and if you put in more time and effort than seems reasonable, you will learn more than you thought possible. You will learn from the visiting writers, from the non-visiting writers (via e-mail), from your classmates (Anne's peer revision and writing partner system is wonderful), and, most of all, from Anne, whose talents as a teacher, writer, and editor, combined with her kindness, insightfulness, and curiosity, add up to a kind of genius for teaching classes like this one.",
    "Absolutely. It will be the best class you will take at Yale. If you get in, take it! 1,000 times YES!",
    "Yes! Take this class- I didn't consider myself much of a writer before taking this course, so don't be intimidated if you're in that boat!",
    "DEFINITELY TAKE THIS COURSE. YOU WILL HAVE NO REGRETS."
