    "While the title of the course may not seem all that scintillating, the course is incredibly well designed, and Professor Clark does an admirable job of guiding students through a diverse array of readings. We read a lot of good literature and watched some good films as well; I would absolutely recommend this course if you are interested in approaching \"the city\" in a slightly interdisciplinary context that combines artistic representations in literature and film.",
    "Yes, absolutely, this class is A hidden gem. The readings and films were interesting, the work light and the professor very nice and engaging. For the life of me I cannot fathom why so few people were enrolled in this wonderful little class.",
    "This course had a pretty great reading list, and covered some very interesting topics, though the format of the class and the lectures\/discussions sometimes left a bit to be desired. I really enjoyed all the short stories and essays we read, and most of the novels\/novellas were good too, though a couple were too long to really have time to cover in depth. I enjoyed the film selection as well, though I think additional films would've helped (one per week wouldn't really be asking too much). The workload is nice - just two medium-length papers (on anything you want to write about), participation, and a presentation on one week's topic - very manageable. I could go either way as far as recommending the course - you wouldn't miss a whole lot just by tackling the readings\/films on your own time, but it's also great to have the incentive to read this stuff and think about it academically."
