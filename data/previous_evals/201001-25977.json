   "comments": [
    "I would recommend it for any student willing to put in a lot of time on homework-- even over spring break-- to get a good survey understanding of Western Lit.",
    "Yes, Directed Studies not only takes you through the greatest works in the Western canon, but equips you with the skills necessary to succeed in subsequent classes at Yale.",
    "If you like humanities and reading great books of literature, I would definitely recommend Directed Studies. The papers are easier to write second semester once you have gotten used to churning them out every week.",
    "Directed Studies Literature is a great course, especially second semester. I highly suggest that you do not drop DS because you\u0092ll miss the chance to read Paradise Lost, War and Peace, and Don Quixote. Madame Bovary is also a stellar novel. The reading list is excellent, and many of the professors are extremely competent section leaders. Mark Bauer is probably one of the best teachers of the bunch. He is not necessarily the most well-known scholar, but he is extremely clear in his explanations, always sure to give a thorough background and summary of work before you dive into the details. You will appreciate this when you get to War and Peace. Nevertheless, I would suggest trying to get into another section if you end up with Bauer, unless you are truly a stellar literature student. He is an EXTREMELY tough grader. He thinks that a B is a \u0093great grade,\u0094 and is not afraid to give the entire class medium to low grades the entire semester. Also, he picks favorites by the third week or so, and expresses intense dislike toward some students, which can be extremely frustrating. He seems to grade-lock as well, so try your hardest on your first essay. Going to office hours is important. Just a warning, though: I went each and every time, and it didn\u0092t really help (unless helping is this B essay is good!). He is hypercritical, and I think that he may be too into semantics at times. While he does seek perfection in essays, it seems that he demands the impossible of his students\u0097a standard so high that most DS-ers are left befuddled what is considered \u0093par\u0094 for him. Sections to consider instead would be: 1. Brian Reilly (great teacher, easy grader) 2. Howard Bloch (very brilliant section leader) and 3. Jane Levin (wonderful, kind, and smart woman).",
    "Take it, and hope you get Bauer. One of the best sections around.",
    "Excellent if you can keep up with the reading and have a section leader who is dynamic and demanding. If you can't pretty much keep up with the pace,think twice.",
    "The second semester of DS Lit is a whirlwind of some of the best books ever written. Almost everything we read is highly enjoyable, but LISTEN to what they tell you and get Don Quixote and War and Peace (almost) done over the breaks. You can read them all during school, but you will end up reading literally 200 long pages a day and probably not sleeping much. It's unfortunate that we could only spend two weeks on a book as enormous and impressive as DQ or W&P, but you can still get a lot out of the novels, especially through the papers. Get into Professor Bauer's section if you can - he is not an easy grader, but he is a fair one, and his in-class comments are always particularly insightful and interesting. He also has one student lead each class, which he preps you for with a one-on-one meeting. These interactions with such a brilliant professor can teach you as much as a section meeting does.",
    "The reading is extensive but rewarding. You will likely enjoy it in proportion to the amount of work you put in.",
    "I would recommed this to any student - they will come away with a very solid foundation which will inform and illuminate further studies in English and Literature. This is a survey course on modern lliterature.",
    "I would highly recommend Directed Studies. The books we read in this program are a more intense introduction to literature than you will find in other English classes, but it is well worth it. By the end of the second semester, your writing will have improved drastically and you will almost have mastered the art of the five page paper. Professor Bauer's class is a lot of work, but all of the discussions are very well-run and at heart he is a very nice guy. This is one of the best classes I have taken at Yale: I couldn't imagine anything better.",
    "DS Lit Spring Semester has probably the best Literature that you will ever read in your life. Don't sell yourself short and the reading won't even feel like work, just really awesome books.",
    "I was at the directed studies holiday part some six months ago and, having seen the completely unfamiliar name Bauer on my roster for the coming semester of directed studies, asked a friend if he knew anything about the man. \"Hardest teacher in directed studies,\" said the friend, \"in all the best ways.\"And he lived up to it. He expects more from you during class, more participation, more preparation, more joy in what you come to class to do, and it's great. He grades papers intensely, then sits down with you for hours to go over every little detail so you're next one is better, and the one after that better yet.Your writing will improve, your lit class will be enjoyable and you'll get to know a particularly friendly professor.Don't switch out, maybe switch in, and enjoy the semester."
