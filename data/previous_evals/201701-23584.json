Professor Vance was able to bring direct examples into his lectures and show why the lessons he was teaching were important for us as graduate students and professionals. He was very open to student feedback and made several small changes to classwork and class time based on this feedback.

Also it's key to keep practicing the tips they taught us, which I am also trying hard to b\/c it's easy to be lazy and just go with my usual communication style."
