    "Good science class or non STEM majors",
    "Interesting, easy class that you take because you want to fulfill a science credit and because for non-STEM people it's actually going to be useful and informative.",
    "It's not a difficult course. But don't underestimate the exams, you still have to do the work.",
    "I would highly recommend this course, particularly for an Sc requirement. I feel like I now know enough biology to have a knowledgeable discussion and know a lot of cool social implications of that biology. If you aren't going to be a STEM major, you should take this course just so you can have basic biology knowledge for life. Also, it's not tough and there's no homework outside studying for the exams and writing the final (5 page) paper.",
    "It's a gut, through and through. Some interesting discussion topics and ideas to think about here and there, but nothing that you could not learn by reading popular science publications. There are probably more interesting non-major science credits you could take out there.",
    "Very interesting course Not to technical so good for non-science majors",
    "I can say with confidence that the hardest part of the class is that the concepts are sometimes so simple that they become confusingly simple and easy. Definitely an easy course if you study for the tests -- as long as you study, there's hardly any work other than that. The tests are on the science part of the issues which is a little annoying because you talk about the issues (ethics of genetic testing, embryo selection, agricultural economics, etc) in your section but not the science, but none of the science is hard. The first module (Carlson) is by far the best but the others are bearable. Also a great social experience. The final paper is also super short -- and the assignments are just 3 midterms, a final paper, and participation. Love Issues Approach!!",
    "easiest science class at Yale by far--take it first semester if you're not a science major. no reason not to",
    "Yeah I would if you need to get a science credit.",
    "If your looking for an interesting science credit with little-no work this is the class for you!",
    "loved the class for the ideas, was really upset with the exams and that they were the only ways i was assessed in the class when i felt i really learned a lot and could show it. wouldn't recommend it as I expected it to be a fairy easy class, and it was easy to understand, but not to do well in, making it not worthwhile.",
    "Yes, it is an interesting and easy class for anyone looking for a science credit--I think the first part about infectious diseases is particularly well-taught and informative.",
    "Ok class to take for a science credit. Three tests that are NOT cumulative. No final during finals period. Some lecturers are better than others. (Three for the three topics)",
    "I would recommend the class as a good one to take to kill a science credit, but you likely will not learn much if you took a Bio class in high school.",
    "Take it if you need a science credit. The first two lecturers were great and the tests were reasonable. The third test was completely unfair. It was five open response questions that were basic like \"How does evolution work?\" The TFs had small points on their grading rubrics that we had not even been taught in class. Simply be wary of that third exam.",
    "not easy",
    "I would recommend this class as a decent science credit for non-science majors. There are probably better ones out there, and this isn't no work (you definitely need to study for the tests), but this isn't a bad course to take for your science credit.",
    "I would recommend it to another student in need of a science credit, but its pretty broad, so if they have a specific interest in another one of the science for nonmajors classes, I think they would probably fine that more interesting. The three tests weren't bad, but I even though I spent a fair amount of time studying, often the content on them was more nitpicky rather than reflecting a deep knowledge of the course material - no one ever knew what to study, because it never seemed to be what was on the test. Having three different professors can be kind of uneven - Carlson is great, Gendron is fine and Summers is frustrating. The final paper was pretty painless, since we could select any topic that interested us. I would also make sure you shop for a good TF. Overall, it wasn't a life-changing class, but not painful.",
    "Great class for non-science majors. You learn a lot, as long as you're willing to put in the work. The workload is minimal and section discussions are engaging and fun",
    "Basically what you expect for a gut science. The exams were easy, but I would find it hard to retain information because of how much of a gut I perceived it to be. Basically you can not go to a single lecture and do as well as someone who went to every single one, or vice versa.",
    "It has 0 workload, but there are three tests so you still have to study for that. But really, compared to other science classes, this one is definitely a gut.",
    "If you really need a science credit, this is not a bad class. I wouldn't take it for any other reason, just because it's not that great, but it's not a lot of work and its not too hard to do well if you put in minimal effort. It's very bureaucratic in a weird way though.",
    "It's a pretty dull course, but it's also a science credit. Make of that what you will.",
    "Absolutely. Great for non-science majors. Materal is SUPER fascinating too!",
    "TAKE IT!! Yes, it's not the most respected class at Yale. When I told people I was taking it, they often scoffed. BUT YOU WILL LEARN SO MUCH AND HAVE A WHOLE NEW APPROACH TO POLICY-MAKING, and it's not even that much work!! One of the best science classes out there for non-science majors.",
    "An Issues Approach to Biology is made up of three units, which this semester comprised of Infectious Diseases, Plants, and Evolution. There are three unit exams, and a 5-6 page term paper at the end about an issue of your choice. I recommend this class to any non-science major who wants to feel knowledgeable enough about the facets of science that touch our everyday lives to make informed decisions.",
    "Issues was a good science class for non-science majors. Very light workload (basically only studying for the exams), and the material wasn't difficult to understand. As long as you study for the exams, you should do fine.",
    "I thought this was going to be a great gut class but it was a bit harder than I expected it to be. I had to study pretty hard for the tests, but there wasn't much work in between the tests.",
    "Yes. Great SC credit. Little work, and extremely relevant topics.",
    "Interesting science class. There is essentially no work except reviewing assigned reading before section. But do keep in mind that the tests are not easy which doesn't make it a total gut. Extremely specific tests full of unimportant details, so make sure to study a lot.",
    "A good option for someone looking for a Science Credit.",
    "Issues Approach to Biology is a bit deceptive; it's not particularly easy, nor do the exams have much to do with the 'issues' presented in lectures and sections. The exams are tough if only because the expectations are rather unclear, especially during the third portion of the class. That being said, there's not much day-to-day work, and the 5 page paper is a breeze - plus, it allows you to finally blend the 'issues' with the biology. It's still a fine course, but not much more.",
    "A classic science credit, and with good reason. Interesting material in an unintimidating package. The exams will take preparation, but it's good stuff to have floating around in your head somewhere.",
    "A fun course, for non-scientists and scientists alike. It's interesting to see biology from another perspective.",
    "A painless science credit that you actually learn a lot in,",
    "A decent science gut. The workload is extremely minimal: three midterms and a 5 page final paper. If you are a smart person, these midterms will be easy for you as they only require memorizing the (limited) information on the slideshows. If you have not taken much science, this class is great. If you did AP Bio or something, Issues Approach may be insulting to your intelligence since so much of the class is rudimentary stuff you learned in 7th grade.",
    "MB&B 105 is an extremely interesting course on relevant topics in biology, which combines biological background with current events and issues. I would DEFINITELY recommend MB&B 105 to any student who is not a science major but looking for a way to learn biology and relate it to current events. It's an awesome course!",
    "Great science credit for non-majors. Work load is reasonable and the material is interesting.",
    "Take it if you must for a science credit that is pretty relaxed,",
    "A science class for nonscience majors.",
    "Easy 5th class, may not get the grade you want though",
    "A great class that exposes you to the social controversy behind scientific debates\/theories.",
    "A class I took for the science credit, you do what you gotta do. The three in class exams weren't hard (just study the slides) and the final paper gave me a lot of room to explore. Section participation, 3 exams, and a paper each made up 20% of the grade.",
    "I would take it for a science credit again.",
    "MCDB 105 is a great option for a science credit. The material is largely interesting and relevant to the humanities and social sciences, and the workload is manageable with three non-cumulative exams and a 5-page research paper at the end of the semester that can be written about anything you want. It was a comfortable and enjoyable way to earn a science credit that meant I did not have to worry about the class too much but also felt that I learned quite a bit from the class.",
    "I would tell a student that this class is perfect for someone if they are interested in biology as a subject, but don't necessarily want to pursue a science career. It was low stress, but entirely interesting, so I would definitely recommend it.",
    "A course that deals with biology in perhaps the least removed scientific sense. Certainly a course for non-science majors. But, that said, it is not the most interesting course. Perhaps that is a function of my not being a science major. But even as someone who has a slight interest in science, I wish I had pushed myself to take a harder course because I think I may have learned more interesting material for myself.",
    "Recommended for non-science major. I can learn as little or as much as you want from this class. Exams are manageable.",
    "This class is not only a good way to get a science credit out of he way but an amazing way to really understand the science behind many of the biggest, most controversial debates that go on in our country. It really helped me better understand many of The political debates leading up to the 2016 presidential election! All the professors are great and really engaging and we cover a wide range of subject matter from evolution to viruses to trees. It was an awsome class and I highly recommend it!",
    "I would say if you are good at memorizing information, take it. If not, you can try your absolute hardest and will do poorly.",
    "I really loved this class. It's not as gutty as some people think because you really need to attend lecture and pay attention to do well, there is obligatory section every week, and the tests are pretty hard. There is also a research paper due at the end. However, it's the kind of class where if you put in the time you can definitely do really well. Also, it is still probably the easiest science credit at Yale. It also has the benefit of not feeling like a waste of time. I actually feel like I learned a lot and I was never bored during lecture. The first two professors are great and the subject matter is really relevant. The only thing is that the last section on evolution has a much worse professor and is much more boring than the first two sections. Overall, if you need the science credit, definitely take this class. And if you don't, it might still be worth while if you want to get a backs understanding of some important scientific issues.",
    "I would describe it as a good survey course if you want don;t plan on taking many more sciences.",
    "It was a very good science class at Yale as it was not too difficult or scientific.",
    "An interesting and relatively simple science course for non-science majors with great professors.",
    "Yes",
    "Not unless you plan on going to every class and studying alot for the tests. Look elsewhere for a non-major science credit."
