    "Good class of measure-theoretic probability. Learned about conditioning, martingales, the CLT, dominated convergence, and sigma fields. You also learn Pollard's unique notation - takes a while to get used to, but I definitely see the appeal of his notation."

    "Go to office hours! DP's office hours are very informative, and will help clear up confusing problem sets - particularly ones that he marks with tons of green ink. Do read the textbook before going to class - lectures (particularly in the beginning of the semester) are much easier to follow if you generally know what he will cover. Weaknesses: Lectures can be a little disorganized, and getting used to notation is a non-trivial matter."

    "You know if you need to take this. If you're looking for something \"useful,\" stochastic processes might be a better class. (I took stochastic before I took advanced probability.) If you're looking for a good proof-based probability class, this is definitely the class to take, and Pollard is the guy to take it with. It's OK if you don't know measure theory, too! And if you're an undergrad, I do recommend you take this. Don't be intimated by the grad students - but do have some real analysis under your belt.",
    "This course is a good choice if you either have a significant math background (ideally at the level of measure theory) or a significant probability background. If you have neither then this course will likely be too challenging. Prof. Pollard is very approachable and, since he's been teaching this course for so many years, has put a lot of thought into how to structure the course. Some of his notational choices are unconventional, but he does a good job justifying his choices. You cover quite a few topics in the class, but if you want to understand them well, you would probably need to spend a good amount of time outside of class reviewing notes\/the book\/other sources (especially for conditional expectation and subsequent topics). Overall though I would recommend the class."
