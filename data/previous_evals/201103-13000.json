   "comments": [
    "I would recommend it if you were trying to fulfill a language requirement, or if you really, really like Spanish.",
    "It's an intermediate course in Spanish language focusing on grammar. I would recommend it if they are really interested in trying to get better at the language or if they need it for a language requirement. Otherwise, I don't think that it's a great class.",
    "It's MUCH more work than L1 and L2, so be prepared. Nothing overwhelming, just expect a test or in class composition usually once a week in addition to everyday homework.",
    "Sebastian was a really good professor. He makes the class fun, and also made sure we learned a lot. He's a native speaker, and it's good to hear the language spoken without an American accent. Definitely would recommend this class.",
    "A solid intermediate Spanish course just as titled.",
    "Although for me, the topics covered in this course were ones I had learned in high school, I truly became extremely comfortable with them in a way that has improved my Spanish-speaking ability. I liked how in class we sang songs and wrote down their lyrics because it was a very useful tool, even though hearing all the words was hard - since none of it was graded, there was no pressure and improving listening ability was therefore fun. It was also nice to know that I had learned the constructions, vocabulary, etc. used in the songs. In terms of the class in general, though, I was glad it was conducted by a Spanish-speaking professor (though it was a little hard to try to ask some questions because he did not understand much English) and I truly believe I learned and improved my language skills.",
    "The class is pretty much what you would expect from a Spanish 3 course. Compositions, more reading and Spanish literature than in level 2, a couple quizzes, a midterm, and a final. There is less vocab than in 120. Also, expect to be able to speak, think, and read more fluently in Spanish. This class is about fluency more so than in early Spanish classes.",
    "Muy bueno. Me gusta mucho el subjecto y a mi profesor.",
    "I would recommend this course for students trying to fulfill their distribution requirements. There is homework every night and the vocabulary quizzes are difficult. so this course does require a fair amount of studying.",
    "I would say that Spanish 130 is an excellent class for anyone who wants to improve their Spanish and review the basics on level 1 and level 2. However, if one struggles with language this class will be a struggle. Grading is very strict, especially with Spanish writing. Overall, the instructors are kind and they truly have a desire to expand the language and teach as many as they can."
