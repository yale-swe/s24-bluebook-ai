   "comments": [
    "I definitely would recommend it to another student. It is an awesome class that introduces you to Latin American and Spanish culture while giving you a solid grounding for fluency in Spanish language. I enjoyed it immensely.",
    "I can only speak for the course with Oscar Gonzalez. I would certainly suggest this course with him. He is a great professor with a lot of swagger and great stories. He also is very considerate of students and makes the course fun. He taught us salsa the last day of class!!!",
    "Spanish 140 is a study of the finer aspects of Spanish through Latin American culture and media. I would recommend it to another student, namely since the material is educational beyond simply learning Spanish.",
    "It focuses on spanish reading and comprehension. Less on grammar.",
    "Only take it if you have to. Too much work otherwise.",
    "I felt that Spanish L4 took up more time than I necessarily wanted to spend on it. I don't think I would recommend taking this course unless you have to for language requirement.",
    "Spanish 140 is a pretty straightforward grammer class that deals with a lot of grammatical review and grammatical distinctions between tenses in the language. Some of the outside sources are interesting (you watch a movie and read a short novel) but the rest is fairly dull. I would not recommend this course unless that fellow student is fairly proficient in spanish already and wishes to complete his\/her language credits.",
    "Very similar to II and III! Definitely feel like you're getting some conversational abilities though which is nice. OSCAR OSCAR OSCAR TAKE IT WITH OSCAR GONZALEZ. He was amazing and made the course for me.",
    "Spanish 140 will help you become more confident and proficient in reading and speaking spanish. And if you take spanish 140 you want to have oscar because he is a great teacher, laid-back, hilarious, and so much fun.",
    "Take it"
