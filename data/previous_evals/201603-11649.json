    "I have gained a more formal, systematic understanding of Chinese societal structures\/institutions that shape existing issues\/trends. Exactly what I hoped it would be.",
    "A strong understanding of economic and and political issues in China.",
    "This course taught me skills in: data analysis, critical thinking, and analytical writing.",
    "I learned a lot about some of the most pertinent issues in Modern China. I thought the Chinese section was a fantastic way to keep up my Chinese, and I got more experience using the language in an academic setting--which was fantastic. There was also some emphasis on sociological method and theory, which I thought was helpful. Quite a lot of reading on studies based in quantitative theory. A challenge but helpful to develop skills.",
    "Learned about inequality, including both classical theories and contemporary research, as well as specific to China. During the Chinese section, we learned Chinese language skills to express topics relating to the seminar subject."

   "comments": [
    "Good topics that fit well together and flowed logically. Dr. Davis posed useful discussion questions to get the group started, and Chinese sections were definitely an invaluable outlet to flesh out some of the thoughts and ideas that were brought up in seminar proper.",
    "Very engaging professor, interesting material!",
    "Professor Davis was very knowledgeable and approachable, the syllabus readings were eye-opening and interesting to read, the excel homework assignments taught me useful skills in applying and interpreting data.",
    "Really great course. I think the debate was a great aspect of the class and it helped me reflect and think about the material presented throughout the course of the semester. I would say only that there could have been more organization through the semester, as at times I felt a bit lost trying to digest such large amounts of material.",
    "Strengths: fantastic, thorough, well thought-out syllabus and course readings; valuable assignments that prompted higher level thinking and application of concepts learned in class Weaknesses: Discussion felt a little weak at times, and could have used more steering."

   "comments": [
    "Yes--if you are serious about China studies and contemporary Chinese society, this class is a must-take. There's no one better than Dr. Davis when it comes to the progression of developmental issues. You will benefit from her wealth of experience in China and the intellectual challenge she poses in discussion.",
    "Yes definitely",
    "I would recommend this course to another student. This class teaches one about inequality in modern day China from a sociological standpoint. While many courses on China at Yale focus on economics or history, this course has a unique viewpoint. The syllabus was very well crafted, and the readings were very interesting. Writing the final essay was a rewarding process.",
    "Fantastic class. Definitely the one to take if you're interested in sociology & China, or social issues in modern China generally. Professor Davis knows her stuff, and really pushes you in class to think critically about the readings and how some of these social mechanisms work in China. If you are interested in the field, it's definitely worth it to take a class with professor Davis. The material includes some dense and quantitative-heavy readings at times, which can be a challenge if you don't have a background in statistics. There is an incredible incredible option to take a Chinese section. Even if you have limited Chinese, do it! That was probably one of the best aspects of the course, and you learn how to talk about social issues using a Chinese vocabulary. It's actually quite useful in everyday conversation as well, as I found myself ending up in some conversations in Chinese about the topics we learned in class more than a few times. You also get an opportunity to use Chinese sources in your research, and is one of the few times at Yale that I've been able to look at issues from the perspective of Chinese academia as well--in my opinion, an important perspective to have if you are going to learn about China.",
    "Fantastic course if you're interested on inequality and\/or China. Great readings and interesting discussion, though sometimes lost steam and could have used a bit more direction. Professor Davis knows so much and provides a lot of food for thought. Many times, my classmates and I would leave class continuing to discuss some of the questions and ideas raised. Chinese discussion section is a huge plus to boost Chinese and your grade (attendance is not required; though attendance at a certain number will lift your grade by 1\/3 of a letter grade)."
