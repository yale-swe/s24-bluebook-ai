    "really interesting, though you do have to expect it to be a bit disorganized and dry at the beginning, but the theory is good background and the professors are great.",
    "This class was all about what you put into it. I made this a priority and do not regret it a bit. Having a chance to spend a full year learning about the intersection of law and economics and developing a fuller understanding of strategic behavior (and how to manage it with legal arrangements), getting to know two of the most brilliant professors I have ever met, and then putting all of my knowledge to the test as part of a team putting together a case study on a major, real-life contract was, quite simply, the most fulfilling intellectual experience of my academic career.For non-econ majors, the math can at times be intimidating, and this class will be a lot more valuable after studying game theory, but if you can keep up, you will love it (and if you are a bit behind to start, just put in the time to catch up\u0085 the professors\/TA\u0092s will all help you along the way).",
    "The professors are amazing, the material is incredibly interesting, and the students all consider it a privilege to participate, so the class is wonderful. The only downside is that it is very time-consuming, which can be looked at as a benefit: if you decide that you want to invest a lot into the class (especially the independent project), then you will get a lot out of it. Do not be intimidated by the workload, just make sure you \"grab the bull by the horns\" early on. Occasionally it was difficult to understand what exactly was desired from the students in terms of final output. Certainly, the flexibility was due to this being the first semester that Law and Economics of Contracts II was taught. The professors (and the projects) really are what make this class such a fantastic experience. We even had really interesting outside lecturers and guests who attended our final presentations. It would be nice to have more structured problem sets leading up to the midterm (maybe three or four, one per section of material)."
