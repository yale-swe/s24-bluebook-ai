    "Decent intro to the material listed in the course description. Course was a little all over the place but was mostly a breadth course, touching a bit on all the control\/systems subjects of EE.",
    "This is a good introductory course to communication theory - good to take even if you are a non-major!",
    "I got a general understanding of what electric engineering is about and systems such as wifi\/networks.",
    "Learnt about concepts including fourier transform, which are signals and systems. Also learnt about useful concepts like cryptography, networks, and information theory.",
    "Basics of systems, signals, communications, and information theory. Got practice with MATLAB.",
    "survey of interesting information theory mathematics and concepts",

   "comments": [
    "Whoa. There was a lot of stuff here (literally). The class took broad strokes over tons of areas of applications of signals, systems, communications, and EE. I thought it was great insofar that it introduced me to many applications of EE I hadn't before anticipated, but weak insofar that I didn't have time to really delve into the ones that seemed most interesting.",
    "Lecture was sometimes more confusing than helpful, and homework sets did not seem to really relate to what was focused on in lectures.",
    "Strengths: a syllabus that knows what it's doing. Wenjun is a professor who researches some of this and tries very hard for the students. Weaknesses: the prereq was MATH 115 and we were told not to worry and that we would be taught what we needed. We were not taught what we were needed (maybe at office hours? I had conflicting classes and regardless should have learned in class). Take linear algebra before taking this class! Probability\/statistics is doable. My sentiment from those who had taken MATH 120 is that MATH 120 was helpful to the class as well. Additionally pset, tests, and labs received scant comments on what one did wrong - only points off. For example on one lab I got the comment \"same mistake as in problem n\" and then no comments on problem n - looking online I wasn't sure what the mistake was.",
    "The only strength of this course was the material itself. We would be learning the introduction to ideas\/techniques that technology we use everyday depend on. It was incredibly interesting. But just as interesting as the material was, the professor was just as awful at teaching. She prefaced the class saying only Math 115 and 120 would be required, but would then have expectations that the class had knowledge in differential equations and linear algebra. Not only that, but the way she taught was incredibly awful. She whispered and spoke quickly, and would constantly fumble on what she was saying, and even use verbage\/lingo that we did not know, and in some cases, contradicted the notes given to us that were made by the professor who usually teaches the class. Not only that, but between the psets, the exams, and her lessons, there was almost ZERO correlation between the three, making us dependent on google and hints we could get from the TA to be successful in the class. Great class, terrible professor.",
    "A little all over the place. Organization was rough, but because this is obviously a breadth course, it's evident there is not a better way to cover all the different subject matter. Strengths include interesting subjects, informative textbook, and straightforward material. Weaknesses include the psets and labs - some questions on the pset are impossible without help from the TA, and while TA sessions are always going to be helpful in any class, it's a little discouraging if there's literally no way to understand what to do or how to start without help. Same with labs - tough but few in number.",
    "The course provides a strong foundation for many major concepts in Electrical Engineering. It could be improved by possibly making at least some of the labs more engaging (not just MATLAB!)",
    "The strengths are the interesting nature of the topics, but the weakness is Professor Hu's ability to communicate the material well to her students.",
    "Concepts taught are very useful and interesting, and the Professor for the class is great at teaching.",
    "great textbook and lecture slide resources - the actual lectures were lacking",
    "I think that the major weakness of this course was the poor explanation of the professor for some topics. The materials offered by her were excellent, but the lectures were not particularly exciting.",
    "The course material is inherently interesting. Lectures were difficult to understand and follow.",
    "The material is interesting but Wenjun isn't very good at teaching it."

   "comments": [
    "I took this course as a requirement for the Electrical Engineering major and I don't really see why anyone would take it who was not an engineering major, but overall the course was difficult and conceptually challenging at some points, but Wenjun was really helpful if you emailed her or asked her follow up questions after class. Just be prepared to google a lot of topics each week during the problem sets.",
    "If it's taught well, 202 could be an amazing course. It covers *so* many interesting topics that will certainly pique your interest in engineering (if it hasn't done so already), communications, and signals\/systems. However, this past semester was taught by a different professor who made the class vastly less interesting and engaging than it has the potential to be. Be prepared to have to teach yourself about a lot of complicated topics if you don't believe your professor would be able to teach them to you. The \"labs\" were just coding exercises in MATLAB, not actual laboratory sessions, so don't fret if you're anticipating a ton of work from them (they're not that long).",
    "EENG 202 has the potential to be a very interesting course. Unfortunately, if Professor Hu is teaching the course, I would not recommend taking it. Professor Hu is very knowledgeable on the subject matter, however her lectures are incredibly dry, and offer nothing that the lecture notes do not provide. With that said, the material that the course covers is very interesting, so if lecture is not important, then I would recommend this course.",
    "If you have any choice, DO NOT take this class.",
    "Don't take this class if not for a major. The material is technical and difficult, especially if you have only taken MATH 115 as was the prerequisite this year (consider taking MATH 120; definitely shop MATH 222). Wenjun tries very hard for the students but lectures were hard to track - asking questions helped but we would either have an intuitive sense and no idea of the math or vice versa. Office hours seemed helpful (I couldn't go so cannot vouch). Persist in asking Wenjun and the TA for clarification (give Wenjun feedback on what you need in order to learn well) and find some smart mathematically-advanced friends in the class.",
    "Only take this course if it is required for your major",
    "Absolutely...... if it was taught by someone else.",
    "For a class that required no prerequisites, there sure were a lot of classes that would have dramatically helped my understanding in this course. This course was a broad overview of many aspects of electrical engineering, and while I believe I learned a lot, I can't say how well I truly understand any of the course material. Also, it would really help if Wenjun Hu got a microphone because half the time, nobody behind the first row could hear her.",
    "If you're considering it, you're probably EE and you have to take it. If you don't have to take it, don't. Rough workload but tests are fairly straightforward and Wenjun graded fairly. Wenjun is not the greatest lecturer, however, so maybe try to take it when Sekhar is teaching it. Good luck!",
    "Yes! But take it with Sekhar.",
    "I would heavily recommend taking this course when professor Wenjun is not teaching. She's a great person to learn 1 to 1 from, but she's too quiet and retracts too much for lectures!",
    "Yes, would definitely recommend the course because the Professor is amazing, and the material covers a vast variety of topics in EE, ranging from information concepts to cryptography and machine learning to signals and systems. Also, the labs were helpful develop a better intuition and understanding of the concepts.",
    "Take this course if you are interested in learning more about how our current technologies communicate. The material is very interesting, and even if the professor is not the best, the material is so good that it will be okay.",
    "The course material is very interesting. Lectures were difficult to understand and follow. A lot of people just ended up studying the material from the textbook and lecture notes. Workload was what you'd expect from an electrical engineering course with weekly psets and four labs total.",
    "Take it with anyone but Wenjun"
