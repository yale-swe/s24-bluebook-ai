    "Great class. Worth taking even if you dont need the language requirement.",
    "just like level 2 just a little more speaking and different material obviously, same pace and workload",
    "Spanish 130 is generally a good course. There is class and homework everyday which is kind of a chore and a lot of busy work, but it definitely improves your Spanish. Take it with Diaz. He's great. He's very helpful and makes the class enjoyable.",
    "Yes",
    "L3 is a good course that reviews Spanish learned in L2, but with greater depth. There is a lot of emphasis placed on improving reading ability, but the flip side, for better or worse, is that there's less time spent speaking in groups and having discussions.",
    "L3 is a nice review of the material learned in L1 and L2. If you are looking to fulfill the language requirement, or if you want a good review of the Spanish language, I would recommend this course.",
    "Spanish 130 was one of my favorite classes this semester, and I would recommend it to another student, as long as that student wants to study Spanish.",
    "A must take (literally), but really fun. The homework is enjoyable.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student as a great L3 course.",
    "yes, it was interesting and fun and i learned a lot",
    "This course was a good way to improve my Spanish skills. It incorporated basic things such as grammar and vocabulary with cultural practices. This made the class more fun. I would definitely recommend this course to any interested student."
