   "comments": [
    "This course examined the few centuries of Christianity in all of its diversity. To summarize the knowledge gained would be impossible. I have come away with a filing cabinet full of in-depth reports on over 10 topics. As far as skills, I have learned how to research several sub-sections of this discipline in a short span of time, with the goal of teaching the subject to the seminar. This teaching component involved preparing annotated bibliographies and structuring class time for the most efficient and helpful approach to deep issues.",
    "I became a much better researcher because of this course - that was probably my biggest takeaway. I also learned so much about the time period, and the state of scholarship on various questions. As a result, I can do better scholarship and engage with current scholarly conversations in ways I couldn't have before this course."

   "question_id": "GS403",
   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The vast amount of information we cover in the course is a strength, as if the the way in which we engage with scholarship that has shaped the field and with scholarship that is current. The way in which the material is split amongst the students could perhaps use some tweaking, so that foreign language book reviews are dispersed more evenly. Also, deadlines should be enforced a bit more stringently. Something submitted a couple of hours late is quite different than something submitted a day late. Standards in research and writing should also be discussed more at length at the beginning and throughout the semester, as there seemed to be quite a dichotomy between some work produced.",
    "It's a great course if you have been adequately prepared to undergo the work involved. Proficiency in Greek and Latin (as well as 1 or 2 modern research languages) will greatly assist the student in this course. Thus, the course attracts a certain type of student, which benefits everyone involved. The weaknesses are few. One small area of concern is the structure of each meeting. That is, the major report would be addressed first, which naturally included natural responses from other members. The 'oral respondent' would be tasked to follow the major report. However, with the major presentations varying greatly, sometimes the oral respondent would have to come with 3-5 things to say in response, due to not wanting to come off derivative. I think the oral respondent should be tweaked, or potentially eliminated. I understand that it exists to facilitate discussion, but I don't think discussion is\/should be an issue.",
    "Strengths: we got through an extraordinary amount of material, I think it fostered a collaborative spirit among students in the department and the subfield, we learned a lot, Weaknesses: lack of feedback was difficult at times. Because the course is so collaborative, and we're depending on each other, it was frustrating when some reports seemingly weren't up to par or contained inaccurate or incomplete information."

   "comments": [
    "I would not recommend it to most students, but not because I think poorly of the course. Quite the opposite, in fact. The course is designed for PhD students, which naturally limits the available pool. However, as a master's student, I can speak from the opposite side of this issue. I feel grateful that the professor allowed me to take the course, but I am not sure that many other master's students would be able to keep up with the workload. Either way, this question might be somewhat irrelevant for this particular course.",
    "Yes! Even though it's required for all of us, I learned a lot and became a better researcher through the course. I'm also better able to engage with the field that I'm specializing it, which made it worth it."
