    "I would absolutely recommend this class to other students. I thought that it was structured in a very comprehensive and inclusive manner. We had the opportunity to study a variety of literary texts more extensively and critically than in ITAL 130 and we spent more time talking in class, which was great. Chris is a wonderful language instructor. He was always very generous with his time and gave very explanations, so I would definitely recommend taking a class with him.",
    "If you're just looking for another easy A, then no, but if you genuinely like italian, then yes.",
    "If you love the language and think you will benefit from the review, definitely take it. If you don't want to review I would honestly consider doing intensive L3\/L4.",
    "This course was great. Chris is a wonderful professor who obviously really cares and always made class fun. I feel like my language skills improved over the semester, and I enjoyed all of the things we watched and read.",
    "I would. Relaxed fun and engaging. You also learn a fair amount too."
