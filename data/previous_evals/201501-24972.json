    "yes definitely if you want to know anything about the gulf and its cities.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course, to pretty much anyone. It really opens you up to a way of thinking that the American media that treats the course topics closes off, and it will definitely broaden your horizons.",
    "I loved this class - for both its content and teaching (Professor Reisz is wonderful). It consisted of weekly readings and responses, and one final 15-page essay. The class is only tangentially architectural, because most sessions are spent discussing social issues; larger, theoretical frameworks; and the West's relationship to Gulf cities. Professor Reisz is incredibly knowledgeable, and a great resource for these sorts of issues.",
    "If you decide to take this class, keep in mind that it is not about city making in the Arabian Peninsula in the architectural sense, it is more about the social issues surrounding it.",
    "This was a wonderful class - if you are interested in the politics, culture, and\/or history of the Arabian Peninsula and the countries related to the Gulf, this is a wonderful course. Professor Reisz knows an incredible amount about the topics of the course and makes the discussions both informative and lively. The readings for the course are great and manageable - they led to a comprehensive understanding of the course and also gave a good survey of both American and Eastern sources."
