   "comments": [
    "It was one of my best choices at Yale to take this course. It was by far my favorite course, and I would recommend this course to anyone but especially to those who are interested in food or want to improve their writing skills. I honestly cannot think of anything that I didn't like about this course, and I sincerely hope that more people get the chance to take it.",
    "Wonderful class. It does involve a lot of writing, but it is very well spaced out. Definitely a manageable class. The readings are always relevant and interesting- having a past interest in food\/vegetarianism may help you to enjoy the class.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to any student who considers his or herself a \"foodie\". This class places food writing in a sphere of legitimacy, where it is subject to careful examination as opposed to just enjoyment or entertainment purposes. The readings, even if you may not agree with them, are usually engaging enough.",
    "I would say that Engl 114 27 is a course for students interested in learning about the ethics and politics behind vegetarianism, understanding cannibalism from a variety of perspectives, and reading food writing in ways that many may not imagine. I would definitely recommend the course to other students because Professor Seo Hee Im was great to work with and the readings themselves struck a balance between challenging and intellectually invigorating.",
    "Take English 114! It will help you to become a better writer and teach you how to structure arguments. It's an invaluable course that will be applicable to all future courses you take.",
    "In Engl 114 27 you write four essays, ranging in length from four to ten pages, that cover different topics or themes. You write close-reading essays, a research essay, and a personal essay and this allows you to improve all aspects of your writing and helps you to prepare for writing that will be assigned for future classes. I would recommend Engl 114 27 to other students who feel that they want to improve their writing skills before taking other college level writing courses."
