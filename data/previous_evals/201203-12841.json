   "comments": [
    "Very great way to learn Spanish. There is homework every night, but its not too bad. If you want to be a better speaker, writer, or reader, this class will definitely accomplish that goal.",
    "This course starts as a review of L2, then moves forward to cover a few more verb tenses.",
    "Definitely! You'll learn a lot and your Spanish will improve greatly. Definitely take it with Gansen. She is the best Spanish 130 teacher. She's super nice and doesn't hesitate to help you if you need it. However, beware of the large amount of work daily. You have to be ready to work and it takes up a longer time than you would expect.",
    "Spanish 130 will definitely help to solidify your grammar skills. It is also a fair class and good to take for your language requirement.",
    "I would definitely recommend it.",
    "if you like spanish, take it and if you don't, it's a lot of work and it meets every day so find a good teacher",
    "In Spanish L3, you start at the beginning and go over all the grammar you've learned along with new vocabulary and a bunch of short stories. There's homework every day but usually not much. The hardest parts are the oral exam, tests, and in-class compositions but they're not that bad. Professor Gansen was a great teacher and made class enjoyable! She was always really helpful and was also really understanding if you ever forgot an assignment or something. Overall, it's a fun class that will improve your Spanish and get your language requirement out of the way."
