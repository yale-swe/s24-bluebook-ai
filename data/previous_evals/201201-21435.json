   "comments": [
    "Although this class seemed like a really interesting one, it fell short of expectation. I wouldn't really recommend it unless you absolutely like everything on the syllabus.",
    "You get to write your final paper on anything you choose, and read about marketing and celebrities for class. Enough said.",
    "Interesting topic. Long reading list but most is interesting. Papers were hard but on interesting topics",
    "Interesting course. Readings got heavy\/dry.",
    "After taking the class, I'm still not sure if I would recommend it. It was enjoyable in some respects; the reading was interesting, and Professor Alexander was great. And if the course is smaller (this year it was around 30 students), then I'd definitely recommend it. But I would make sure to closely scrutinize the class during shopping period.",
    "A good survey of aesthetic theory and its application to social science. I would recommend it if only for the interesting reading material and freedom in choosing your last paper topic. Mostly just reading and discussion with 3 essays, 2 7 page and 1 10 page. Not terribly demanding but you get out what you put in.",
    "YES. it's a bit abstract, but you learn a lot about society and pop culture and general, so it can be pretty fun too. :) especially at the end, when you write your own paper (10 pages).",
    "This class would be easier for a student with a strong background in the humanities, and the readings seemed more geared towards the humanities side than the sociology side. It is writing intensive, which is something to keep in mind.",
    "If you're interested in how the things we have in society are given symbolic meaning based on their aesthetic surface, take this class! We looked at everything from art to architecture to motorcycle clubs and the Grand Canyon. Wide subject matter with a core theory. The reading is a little heavy, and class can be slow during the theory portion of the course, but I really enjoyed it."
