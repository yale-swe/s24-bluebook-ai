    "Utterly impeccable. Take it, and take it with Charles Hill - he understands every text on the syllabus, and makes the crucial connections between them.",
    "Really great course. Professor Hill is really intimidating, but is worth having. One thing that was frustrating was that he would have a student lead each class discussion for at least the first 45 minutes or so, which felt pretty pointless as he would often jump in at the end and explain that we were entirely off. I would have preferred he lead discussion from the start. He's a really fair grader, definitely not the hardest in DS.",
    "People will be scrambling to switch into this section. Don't bother. Professor Hill barely speaks--he lets the student starter flail about for the entire session.",
    "Take this class, and take it with Prof. Hill! You will come away with a deep and broad education, understanding mutual influence between the texts, the political cultures of their day, and that of our day. Do not be intimidated by Prof. Hill's big reputation - he has a passion for Directed Studies, and is always willing to help.",
    "Directed Studies is a powerful and challenging program. By the end your DS year, you wil be familiar with most or all of the quintessential theories of Western thought. For every aspiring leader, thinker, or writer, DS should be your beginning. However if you choose to do DS, I highly recommend that you focus upon it, and select only one extracurricular activity. DS should be enjoyed. With numerous extracurriculars, DS will become an incredibly stressful and less rewarding experience.",
    "YES. do DS. it will change the way you see politics, history, america... the workload is definitely worth it. It gives you a base from which to understand the world. I have come to the conclusion that one really cannot have a complete and mastered understanding of the world without studying the western cannon, and ds is the perfect way to do this, because of the amazing professors, the rigor and direction of the other students, and because the curriculum has been refined over the years, and so it really creates a great base."
