   "comments": [
    "A decent extension of 205. Gets you into some actual (basic) classical theory. Definitely worth taking, though it's probably a pre-req, so it doesn't matter. Not too much work. Jonathan showed a clear passion for music theory.",
    "I would recommend the class to a music major or someone considering the music major. Otherwise, it's not very useful or interesting. If you want to get some great basic theory and start arranging, take 205.",
    "Music 210 is a wonderful consequent to the antecedent of Music 205. I really feel like I learned a lot about music theory and composition in this class, and I got to compose a good amount of music by the end of it.",
    "If you need to take it for free lessons, you placed out of 205, or you're really excited about the Minuet and Trio final project, go ahead and take this. If you went through 205 and just want to learn more theory, don't wasteyour time on this class. It's much better spent on other courses in the music department.",
    "This is a great class to learn music theory, especially if you came from a musical background. That said, it's more work than I imagined. It's manageable, but the compositions were really difficult.",
    "Shop it with every TA. I lucked out with mine, but I've heard some stories about how dry and bad the class can be if you have a TA who is less helpful or thorough. Take this class if you want to really learn about how to compose in a distinct style, with good counterpoint and voice leading.",
    "I recommend this class to anyone who feels he would benefit from an extensive review of 205 (or who hasn't taken 205). This class and 205 are prerequisites for the major, so I suppose there is no way to avoid what is essentially 1.5 semesters of 205 and .5 of 210. That said, once we started in on new material, I learned a lot and enjoyed myself.",
    "I would recommend this class for another student on if they were well prepared.",
    "Music 210 is an awesome way to get a sense of the intellectual beauty and power of music theory. The course begins a bit slowly, with a review of counterpoint writing, but you soon jump into four-part voice writing, an exceedingly careful study of chord progressions, and large-scale compositions of your own (a piano theme-and-variations, and a string quartet). I highly recommend this course to anyone who wants to both see the more intellectual, scholarly side of music and begin to compose real music. Note that the course requires regular homework assignments (mostly small-scale part writing), which can sometimes require a good bit of time.",
    "I would definitely recommend it for those who think seriously about their music theory education.",
    "This class begins with basic counterpoint writing, and moves through to more complex four-part writing and piano writing. I strongly recommend this course to other students, though certainly not without an appropriate level of understanding of music theory before taking the course. I had a lot of fun in this class.",
    "I would absolutely recommend 210 to another student, especially if Jonathan is teaching it. While sometimes the daily assignments can seem redundant in the beginning of the course after taking 205, the material quickly leans into new directions with a greater focus on composition. Keep in mind that this is a style course. If you're hoping to compose an atonal string quartet for your final assignment, this is not the class for you. Overall, I found the class to be muscially stimulating and fulfilling, and wholly within my grasp even as a non-major.",
    "Awesome."
