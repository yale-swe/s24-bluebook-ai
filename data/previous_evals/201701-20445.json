   "comments": [
    "Using github, basic web-development, and so much more. Lots of practical CS skills which are hard to find at Yale and a great understanding of the realm of apps and entrepreneurship.",
    "You learn a lot in CPSC213. The first half of the semester focuses on coding, and you cover everything from git, to the command line, to SQL, to javascript, to jQuery. The second half focused more on entrepreneurship more broadly covering topics like how to pitch your idea and how to run a startup. I definitely learned a lot in this class, and feel more confident about pursuing my ideas and starting my own things in the future. Even if I'm not a software engineer or a entrepreneur in the strict sense in the future, this class has definitely helped me to learn about the technologies available to me and become more entrepreneurial.",
    "Javascript, SQL, and other technologies that are essential to web development. Start up methodology, current research in entrepreneurship, and the business -related topics.",
    "Very practical ways of building web apps and companies",
    "You learn a lot about software development and the tools you need as well as about the start up world in general.",
    "Basic MEAN stack development, and exposure to the terms and issues faced by entrepreneurs.",
    "I learned a great deal about the entrepreneurship aspects of starting a start-up. I also learned quite a bit about the front-end of coding being able to use JavaScript, CSS, and HTML.",
    "In this class, we learned the basics of developing a tech startup. The first half focused on developing fast and effective apps that can be iterated and changed quickly, and the second half taught the basic tenets of entrepreneurship, such as sales and pitching. We were also able to create our own startup and learn hands-on",
    "Became a better overall programmer as we learnt a lot about Javascript, agile development and team-working. It was also cool to learn about how to create a product centered on the user, and really develop something for people to use.",
    "I learned how to build cool stuff. And also how to be more entrepreneurial! Good skills to have, all around.",
    "I think that everyone at Yale regardless of their major should take this class. Why? Because it shows you how real world projects and startups work and forces you to face uncertainty and work with a team intimately.",
    "Great practical programming course, learned how to deploy fully functionable, scalable website, as well as info on entrepreneurship",
    "really useful coding skills and softer entrepreneurship skills",
    "I learned a lot about web applications and working with terminal. Very useful stuff.",
    "I learned much about the entrepreneurial side of software development.",
    "First time I've done protracted project work. I feel like I've gained some valuable, real-life knowledge from this class. Coordinating the creation of a website over a span of several months, while providing project updates, felt like a genuine simulation of what it's like to work in a start-up environment.",
    "I have learned a lot about the basic workings of a web application and entrepreneurial skills. This course has exposed me to the web developer's vocabulary and various resources available such as the different technology stacks and very importantly, github.",
    "So much about web development that it blows my mind. Kyle's discussion of sales and taking risks also changed my attitude towards business in general.",

   "question_id": "YC403",
   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The course is fast-paced, challenging, and a lot of work. You learn a lot but you have to put in a lot. Kyle is great and the class is well-organized but the pace and workload might be too much. The class could maybe benefit from being split up into a two semester series, so that ample time is allowed to develop the necessary coding skills.",
    "Overall I thought this was a great course, and I did learn a lot. However, I do have some recommendations for how it could be improved. First, I think the class tries to cover too many technical topics too quickly. While it is nice to have a view of everything that's available, I think it would have been better to go through it more slowly, and really learn the best practices in coding. I would recommend the class split into a yearlong class, with the first semester covering the tech side, and expanding to cover more things like APIs, React, Meteor... and the second semester focus on the entrepreneurial side. This would also give students a full year to work on their products and would give them more of a chance to be successful. Furthermore, I thought the class was too big. It was hard for just the 2 TFs and Kyle to give all the students and teams the attention I felt like they wanted to. Kyle's office hours were helpful, but I still think the class would have been better if it was smaller.",
    "Strengths: Interesting material, interesting professor, interesting assignments. Weaknesses: Flipped classroom does NOT work! If I wanted to learn about startups by reading online articles, I could have done that on my own. PLEASE LECTURE.",
    "Interesting concept, and I definitely got a lot out of it, but building a startup as a class assignment doesn't really work. The timeline is so compressed and hard to deviate from that you miss out on some of the interesting parts of starting a company.",
    "The first half of the class is really engaging and you learn a lot of new technical skills but the second half can get boring when you learn how to be a salesperson basically.",
    "The organization of the course doesn't really facilitate learning either entrepreneurship or web development, because it's a flipped classroom.",
    "The way this course is taught is extremely engaging and effective. I've learned much more than I usually do in other courses, and Kyle keeps all of the lectures and assignments interesting. One of the weaknesses may be the group component of the startup assignment, as it is hard to translate consequence of not working hard in a startup environment to a class assignment.",
    "strengths: reverse classroom, engaging lectures and useful assignments weaknesses: organization, weight on group project",
    "The course is good in that it covers a lot of topics. I found the pace a bit fast.",
    "I think the course itself was not what I expected. The second half was completely dedicated to the final project, which I did not realize had little to do with actual software development (at least for our group) compared with the amount of the business\/entrepreneurial related work we had to do. I think there was an unequal balance between the CS and the finance sections of the course. For the first half, the work we did was extremely simple and, in my opinion, did not prepare us for what the teacher expected for us to complete in the second half. Perhaps if the professor had added that last homework problem set (Social-to-do) to the first half, we would have been prepared. Also, the first exam material was for most of us out of range of our abilities and too difficult. What we had learned did comprise of different parts of the exam, but we never were taught how to combine them all, which I felt we could not have done on our own. The project was challenging yet rewarding.",
    "This course has been very helpful in making me familiar with GitHub and the various resources available to web application developers. This course was also a good introduction to pitching. However, some weaknesses that I felt were that I didn't really learn JavaScript and a lot of the readings we did weren't really applicable to the application we were building. The in class coding exercises were also really hard to follow. I would have loved to have more lectures focused on JavaScript and perhaps have the readings on Entrepreneurial law be more thoroughly discussed in class. I would have also loved to have the socia-todo homework be the main focus and discussed more in the first half of the semester as that would have helped a lot in building our own applications.",
    "The strengths of the course is the freedom. It is so well done I have little to gripe about. I wasn't a fan of the first exam since I got hit with some weird deprecation warning that took me out, and I could not fix it in 40 minutes (but then again I could have anticipated that had I been better prepared going in). It's really well done.",
    "Strength: team work, fun materials Weakness: the design of flipped classroom does not facilitate learning"

   "comments": [
    "This is a great course and I would highly recommend it if you are interested in web-development, apps, or entrepreneurship. Just keep in mind the workload.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. It's somewhat challenging, but you learn a lot, and have a great opportunity to build your own web product from scratch, which is super rewarding. It gives you great skills you can use in the real world.",
    "I would recommend this class to someone who wants to learn \"cool\" things about startups and how businesses succeed. I would not recommend this class to someone who is looking for a more rigorous or academic experience, as nearly all of the learning occurs on your own.",
    "Yes, as long as you're willing to work really hard to learn a lot of stuff on your own (Stack Overflow).",
    "If you are really interested in tech start ups this class is a must, otherwise it's not that useful but still a fun class to take.",
    "I think web development is an interesting skill to have, so yes.",
    "I would recommend this course but under the understanding that the first half of the course is developing your coding skills and the second half of the course is working on a team project to create a website\/app with skills we didn't truly develop in the first half of the course.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to anyone who wants to learn the basics of the startup\/hacking culture in a fun way. You might not be an expert coder or be able to start your own business immediately, but you'll definitely get a great intro. Maybe you'll even understand what they're talking about in Silicon Valley (TV Show) more. Also, Kyle is incredible and cares about his students deeply. Take it - it's fun.",
    "I loved the course because it was very hands-on and allowed us to work on something while we learned how to scale a business and acquire customers. It really forces you to go out there and take your idea out of the paper.",
    "Absolutely.",
    "great class! try to come in with some idea of an app, but you really get what you put into it",
    "I would recommend this class! It is great for learning how to build web apps and getting better at terminal.",
    "If the student was truly interested in creating a startup in the future, then yes, this class is meant for that. Don't expect this class to be that informative\/ CS-based.",
    "This class is a great excuse to work on software development during the semester. I thoroughly enjoyed the challenge of creating a web application from scratch, but I taught myself almost everything that I learned in this course. Don't expect to learn anything in the class itself.",
    "I would recommend this to anyone who perhaps has at least a little bit of previous web developing experience. If not, they should definitely make a team for their project with someone else who has experience or it'll be almost impossible to complete the application.",
    "Incredible opportunity to learn how to build amazing things.",
    "Kyle is great, this class is great, but don't go in expecting an easy A, tests were ridiculously hard (average was around a 50% each time), and there are a lot of small assignments. Great class to Credit\/D.",
    "If you are not a student with good computer science background or entrepreneurship and business skills, DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS. This is definitely not an intro class and not a fun class to take. The two exams are hard if you don't have computer science skills or business skills before this class because you can not possibly do well on the test just by the knowledge you learnt in this class. Base on my observation most students in this class have background learning econ and computer science, so if you already know much about the field, you can take this class. The teamworking component is fun nevertheless."
