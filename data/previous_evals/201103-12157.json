   "comments": [
    "This class covers a lot of topics about elections in the US. There's pretty much 1 reading per week, which at times seemed a little insufficient, but it was good that the reading load was manageable enough that everyone did it and could take part in the discussion. Solid class discussions with very, very knowledgeable professors. Professor Hersh was great, not only in leading discussions, but also providing tons of help outside of class for the final paper. He knows a lot about empirical research methods and explains\/provides many useful suggestions. Professor Mayhew is one of those people who seemsto know everything. He provided a lot of great insights during class and seems very dedicated to both research and teaching.",
    "Yes I would recommend it to fellow student. Prof. Mayhew is a legend in his field -- it's great to hear him talk. The readings are interesting and good for thinking about your own paper. Writing the final paper was a challenge if you want to do statistical analysis but the professors are very supportive.",
    "Great class, really interesting discussions, and not too much work throughout the semester with the exception of the final paper, but that's totally manageable. I also ended up learning STATA, which is a really cool skill.",
    "I'd recommend it - it's interesting, relatively dynamic, and not too much work.",
    "US National Elections is a class about what you expect it to be. I would absolutely recommend it to any student interested in staple issues in the American government subfield of political science. The readings are doable, class discussions are interesting, and writing the essay is a good experience.",
    "What a great course. Mayhew is a legend and Hersh brings a lot of youthful energy and an amazing amount of expertise to the seminar as well.Week to week reading load is not too heavy, allowing you to concentrate on putting together a great final paper. The final paper is the real cornerstone of this class, and both professors are incredibly helpful in guiding you through the process.",
    "This was a very good class. I enjoyed writing my senior thesis in it, and the team-teaching structure worked well. Prof. Mayhew is extremely well-known in the political science field and brings a wealth of experience to the seminar, while Prof. Hersh is very intelligent and engaging. If you want to gain a better understanding of many aspects of U.S. elections, this is a worthwhile class. My critique is that it can lack direction at times, but it doesn't detract significantly from the quality of the class.",
    "Good course - interesting survey of topics related to US national elections. Even if you are knowledgeable about the topic, you will learn something because Mayhew and Hersh are both really smart and very good academics (even if you learn nothing about elections, which might happen if you don't do the reading, you will definitely learn how to write a better political science\/social sciences paper). Mayhew and Hersh are both very kind and class is almost always lively and interesting. Mayhew is one of the preeminent scholars in political science, it's worth it to take the class just to take a class with him...he is a walking encyclopedia of political science\/politics. Weekly postings to the classes server about the readings, and a 20-30 page paper at the end of the course. The paper is a pain, but that's what you get in political science seminars like this. They make it slightly easier by making submit a proposal, so you won't be starting from scratch a few nightsbefore it's due.",
    "I would recommend this class to a fellow student. You learn about all components of U.S. national elections in a very engaging way.",
    "If you really want to write a paper about U.S. Elections, this is where you should be.",
    "Take it for a good class on US politics and elections."
