    "Definitely--especially for conductors, instrumentalists and theorists who really want to know how music is structured on a macro level!",
    "An extraordinary class if you're of the right frame of mind. Hepokoski goes step-by-step through his method of analyzing Sonata Forms. There's a lot of terminology to learn, and parts of the course can feel like a series of dry analytical exercises. And you have to be willing to buy into his theories, which at times can feel quite artificial and constructed. But if you really learn his theories, you will never listen to or read a sonata quite the same way again. I would call this a must for anyone who cares deeply about understanding the music of Mozart, Haydn, and early Beethoven, but I would not suggest this class for any but the most serious music readers."
