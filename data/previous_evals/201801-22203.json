    "The course has been a rigorous examination of the history of sexuality from the perspective of intellectual and cultural history. The multi-disciplinary approach the course took (from French, WGSS, and History) made it very challenging but also rewarding: I got to think about the topic in many different ways.",
    "How to read a book how to really read it. At the end of each seminar we ended in a place very different from the text. We were questioned about the author's biases and oversights, what the text doesn't say. It's made me rethink the way I read."

    "Sometimes it was clear that people were coming from different backgrounds with the subject matter. I thought that this made for a really interesting discussion, and that this was ultimately worked through."
