    "Absolutely amazing course, I come from an international setting and these are by far the best language instructors I have ever had. If you want to learn Japanese at an incredible pace in an engaging and stimulating setting, take this course. This has been my most rewarding experience at Yale so far. Even if you are not thinking of pursuing East Asian Studies, JAPN 110 gives you the opportunity to experience the best of Yale's faculty and your weekly improvements make the impressive amount of work completely worth it. The classes are structured so that you study the grammar at home and participate in in-class drills and conversation during class time. You will need to put in a lot of work but the instructors are always available if you are falling behind and genuinely want you to succeed. The lesson tests were graded very fairly. Take this class if you have a genuine interest in the language and culture and you will not regret it.",
    "highly recommended.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student. I think this class is very effective and interesting.",
    "Yes! It's a lot of work and you have to really stay on top of things (as in make sure you go to every single class if possible, participate, and do your homework every night) but it's really worth it and very enjoyable.",
    "Again, if you want to learn Japanese and be able to speak and read basic Japanese, this is the best (and only) option. The class is organized very, very well, and there is a clear curriculum and schedule that we never fall behind on. The teachers are funny and interesting, and being able to interact with your classmates is really fun - some of the best friends I've made here are from my Japanese class!",
    "A tough langauge to learn, but the teachers help you every step of the way.",
    "This is a great introductory course to the Japanese language. The sheer amount of knowledge that this course teaches you is incredible for about three months of language learning. It definitely is a lot of work, but doing the work will often ensure that your grade is not bad, regardless how you go on the tests. This I believe is extremely useful because it reflects a focus more on the constant and driven work that you put into learning the language than what you can remember in a 50 minute grammar test. The pace is extremely manageable if you are willing to commit. The rotations of the professors ensures a refreshing change in teaching styles.",
    "This is one of the best classes I have ever taken. Entertaining, interesting, rigorous, and all around amazing.",
    "A very work-intense course, but you learn a lot of Japanese in a very short amount of time.",
    "Excellent course! If you are interested in Japanese, take it! Be prepared for the work though (although I'm sure that's true of any intro language class).",
    "I would definitely recommend the course. You learn so much in so little time, and you have such a fun time while you're at it. Be warned, this class has a heavy workload. If you want to do you're homework well and try to understand the material, you can easily spend 2 hours a night on Japanese work. The class is very interactive, so you will get called on recently and have to act out a scene sometimes, but the teachers are extremely friendly and fun. Everyday you will: read grammar notes, memorizes numerous vocabulary words, memorize conversations to recite in class, translate sentences, sing songs, make skits, and have constant quizzes and tests. It can get quite tedious, but it's quite rewarding."
