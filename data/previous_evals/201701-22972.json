    "This class taught me why it is important to study psychopathology from a developmental perspective. The readings offered a good introduction to developmental psychopathology, especially anxiety disorders and ADHD.",
    "I learned a good deal about developmentally-focused neuroscience. I learned better presentation skills.",
    "Was introduced to and developed breadth and depth in exposure to developmental psychopathology. Developed skills in how to synthesize information, present to a group, and lead group discussions effectively.",
    "This course offered an in-depth look at the neural systems implicated in anxiety disorders and ADD\/ADHD using a developmental perspective. While developmental neuroscience is an extremely important area of research, most neuroscience classes at Yale focus on research derived from adult neuroscience research. This class allowed us to learn more about both normative neuro-developmental trajectories and alterations from those trajectories and their implications in the development of psychopathology. Considering a developmental approach helps me develop a more holistic approach to considering mental illness.",
    "I developed a deeper understanding of taking a holistic approach to studying developmental psychopathology, specifically anxiety and ADHD. I learned about fear and anxiety and potential translations of preclinical studies to interventions and treatments that account for the stage of development and the role of the brain, genes, and the environment in behavior and psychopathology.",
    "This course provided valuable feedback on presentation style and gave some introduction to the neural aspect of developmental psychopathology.",
    "I learned about biological changes over time and how we can consider when and why changes result in phenotypes.",
    "I have a much better understanding of neural circuitry (particularly circuits implicated in anxiety and ADHD) as a result of this course. I also have a better understanding about how the developmental timing of maturation of these circuits could influence when we start to see symptoms emerge and the onset of different types of psychopathology.",

   "comments": [
    "BJ is such a source of knowledge and it is an honor to learn from her. I wish she had shared more of her personal work experience with us, as these stories are particularly interesting. Maybe she could spend 15-20 min at the end of each class reviewing the topic and providing more insights from her own work (which is what she did towards the end of the course).",
    "Strengths: --the course materials are well chosen --the course is engaging Weaknesses: I wish that you had spent more time personally lecturing. You have such a nice conceptualization of a difficult and rich topic--developmental neuroscience. You understand it to a level that even graduate students do not. I would have loved to have heard more directly from you during the course. The workload is very very high compared to other courses. It impinges on the ability of first years to do research\/clinical work etc. in an effective manner.",
    "The atmosphere of the class was not very conducive towards learning. Expectations on presenting and the content of participation was so high that students were focused on getting through the class rather than understanding the material. Feedback and comments given to students by professor during presentation was sometimes too critical and created tension in the class that made individuals less likely and comfortable to participate. In addition, too much emphasis was put on providing the \"right\" answers to questions (even open ended discussion questions) and to receive positive affirmation from the professor that it detracted from the class's ability to have open discussions, explore ideas, and participate in an open and supportive environment. Presentations offered a great opportunity to master a subtopic in the field and synthesize information.",
    "I think that the class size and\/or the classroom layout impeded the discussion-style class that Prof. Casey envisioned. Another, but related, obstacle to having actual discussions seemed to be the varying levels of neuroscience background knowledge among members of the class; it would probably be helpful in future offerings of this course to include a primer or required background readings to get everybody on the same page. I think it was an incredible privilege to be in a class with BJ Casey, and I think I would have benefited more if she had taught the class directly. Maybe a better format would have been for her to lecture for half of each class on the actual topic, and for the second half of each class to be student led. I think it placed a lot of pressure on us students to have to learn entire topics of material and impart that information, especially when it was clear (in the middle of student presentations) that Prof. Casey had specific ideas about HOW that information should be taught. And\/or if it's important to have students present for the entire class session, I think that presenting groups should simply meet with Prof. Casey prior to the actual presentation date to decide on a specific game plan and to get their slides approved.",
    "Strengths: The course challenged us to think critically about the material we covered by fostering class discussions and assigning class presentations. The class offered alternate viewpoints (e.g. is ADHD a deficit in brain function, delay, or characterized by both) and arguments for and against both points of view, which helped students form their own opinions about the material. This course also devoted a substantial amount of time and discussion to treatment avenues based on translational work, which is often missing from neuroscience courses. Weaknesses: I was a bit disappointed that the bulk of our instruction and discussion was student-driven via the presentations and not led by the professor. Dr. Casey is a leader in developmental neuroscience, and I feel that we missed an opportunity to benefit from her research and insight because the students basically taught the class. While it is evident that Dr. Casey deeply cared about the success of her students and challenging us to think critically, I feel that her tendency to \"call out\" students actually made the class more anxious because we feared looking ill-informed in front of her. When giving presentations, Dr. Casey could be a bit aggressive in her questioning, and would interrupt presenters or ask extremely difficult questions to the presenters who didn't have a neuroscience background (for example, one student cited a research paper and Dr. Casey asked, \"Is that the paper by XXX that couldn't be replicated?\" even though this student was a political science student. Again, it was completely clear that Dr. Casey is trying to prepare us for harsh criticism in our own research careers, but her tone and her pointed questions just put the entire class on edge for fear of getting called out and grilled by her, especially for those who do not have a neuroscience background. One other minor weakness is that most of the course readings were Dr. Casey's own papers. While she has had a long and very impressive career, I felt less inclined to actually criticize the papers in the course for fear of offending her. Because of this, I feel that I engaged less with the course material because I was afraid to point out methodological\/theoretical issues or questions I had about the readings because the author was teaching the course.",
    "Strengths: The research perspective taken in this course is very innovative and inspirational: taking a translational approach to developmental neuroscience that incorporates biological, genetic, and environmental factors in the study of psychopathology. The students in this class were very prepared and had a lot to contribute to discussions on these topics. The instructor was very knowledgeable about these topics. Areas for improvement: Overall, this course felt entirely self-taught rather than collaborative or instructional. No clear guidelines were given for in-class presentations, not even how long the presentations needed to be. It would be helpful in the future to have more lectures geared towards getting students on the same page at the beginning of the course (i.e., giving more background lectures that are taught by the instructor) especially given that not all students in the class are familiar with neuroscience or genetics, and some students were not even in this department. Furthermore, increasing the number of lectures given by the instructor would be helpful and more conducive to learning. Expectations were extremely high but the in-class atmosphere was not conducive to promoting a positive learning environment, and instead often promoted motivation through fear and anxiety. Participation was a significant portion of our grade, however, students did not always feel comfortable or safe participating, since it would often turn into an interrogation where they were expected to be experts on the topic or question they raised (both when presenting and when participating). As for the course content, the instructor was an author on the great majority of the readings which meant that she was very knowledgeable about these topics, but also made students feel uncomfortable offering criticism of the methodology or interpretations in the papers. More variation in authors and perspectives would greatly improve this course.",
    "The main strength of the course was that it gave us the opportunity to practice teaching material in a classroom setting. We also learned some broad themes about dev. psychopathology. The instructor clearly cared very much about our learning. However, there was a strong sense of discomfort among students in the classroom due to the professor's way of responding to ideas that didn't align with her perspective. This made it difficult to learn effectively and made me cautious to contribute to class discussions. I wish the instructor had actually taught the course rather than having us present. It felt like students were not prepared to teach topics outside of their areas. The expectations for course assignments were also very unclear.",
    "I enjoyed going through two of the most common developmental disorders thoroughly, but I do worry I missed dedicating time to other highly relevant developmental disorders. Perhaps we could have had a few classes each on anxiety and ADHD, and single classes dedicated to other common disorders. This is would be a hybrid of the current class structure and how we do Advanced Psychopathology in the department. The class was interesting, and Dr. Casey is engaging and passionate. She clearly knows the research well and is excited to share it with students and get them thinking critically. At times, however, Dr. Casey's critiques seemed to reflect personal biases or minor concerns, creating an atmosphere that left even the most knowledgeable students feeling anxious and helpless. Students lead class discussions with Dr. Casey acting as a back seat driver. I might have preferred to have Dr. Casey lead the bulk of discussions with student presenters instead providing brief presentations about outside literature. I could have learned more had I not had one and a half hours of my peers nervously presenting information with Dr. Casey interrogating them throughout.",
    "It is clear that BJ is passionate about this topic and very knowledgable about the field. It is also clear that she cares about student development and learning and wants to support us. However, these motivations were obscured because the classroom environment felt hostile. BJ's desire to hold us accountable for the readings by calling on us in class randomly to answer questions made many students feel so anxious that it was hard to focus on the material being presented. BJ said that there were no wrong answers to questions, but in actuality it sometimes felt like students were shamed if they did not answer in the way that was expected. BJ's joking announcement at the beginning of the semester that she'd ring a gong anytime it was apparent that someone didn't do the reading or understand the material certainly did not help. The fact that the methods and concepts (e.g., rodent studies, neural circuitry) were new to much of the class, and that many of the papers were from BJ's lab, only exacerbated the situation. The result was that many students spent hours and hours to prepare for class and were very stressed, which took time and energy away from our research as well as from actually absorbing the material. I appreciate BJ's desire to encourage us to learn. However, decreasing the intensity would actually support this goal. Devoting more classes at the beginning of the semester to really learning this material (and having them taught by BJ) would help. Not calling on students directly, but waiting for us to speak up, would also help. In this way, participation could still be emphasized without making students feel incredibly stressed out. Phrasing questions as \"what do you think about X\", rather than quizz-style questions that feel like they are designed to catch us in a wrong answer or very specific questions about studies that were briefly referenced but not covered in the required readings, would support this goal as well. Making changes such as these to de-toxify the classroom environment would go a long way to improving this course. I appreciated BJ's desire to help us improve our presentation skills. Unfortunately, the methods used to support this goal backfired due to their intensity. Learning a topic well enough to lecture on it for an hour and a half was quite challenging, especially without any guidance or support from the professor. It was challenging to know how to set up the presentation or what level of detail to go into because there were no guidelines about what should be covered or how much time we should spend on each topic. BJ often interrupted us with quizzing or literature questions that, again, promoted stress more than learning. She also publicly critiqued the first few presentations, which was more humiliating than productive (especially because much of the advice, such as building out figures, could have been given in advance). She also seemed to treat certain students quite differently than others, which was frustrating and confusing. This aspect of the course could be improved by reducing the number and time length of lectures given by students, which would enable BJ to be sure that we learn the content she deems critical while also incorporating student presentations. Explicitly stating suggestions and criteria for presentations would be quite helpful. Giving feedback in private, and giving suggestions to the upcoming presenting group via email perhaps, would also make the environment less hostile. Again, making changes like these would really help improve the student experience of the course, and make BJ's motivations come across more clearly and positively.",
    "Strengths -The course definitely encouraged critical thinking and constant engagement in class -Material and top research in the field was extensively reviewed Possible Weaknesses -Heavy neuroscience focus in a class where students had widely varying backgrounds\/knowledge of neuroscience -Criticism during presentations and during class sometimes seemed too harsh, particularly for the groups going in the beginning; limiting the most critical feedback to a private conversation might help in this regard"

    "I would recommend the class to students who are not afraid to speak up in class and who can cope with tough (but fair) feedback.",
    "I would recommend it.",
    "I would not recommend the course in its current form. There was a lot of information presented in this course, but I have not retained as much as I should have because 1) I was too afraid to participate in class and actually learn anything most of the time, and 2) in many classes it seemed that we were being quizzed on less-important details of Prof. Casey's papers, rather than the critical big ideas.",
    "I am unsure whether or not I would recommend this course to another student. On the one hand, the course material is very interesting and often overlooked in other neuroscience classes. On the other hand, we didn't get to benefit much from Dr. Casey's years of teaching and research because the students did the bulk of the teaching. Also, the anxiety that this course brought to the students makes me wary of recommending this course.",
    "I believe that many of the issues raised in the present evaluation are aspects that can be addressed. Therefore, yes, I would recommend this course to the incoming first-year students. I think this course has significant potential to be an incredible learning opportunity for many students both within and outside of the psychology department. I will, however, warn future students about the issues raised here and offer to be a resource for them in adjusting to this environment.",
    "I would not recommend this course to another student because I think that the current organization of the course and the professor's style of critiquing students publicly can cause some people a lot of anxiety (this might be effective for some but not everyone). My complaint is not that the course was rigorous but that the specific way the professor gave feedback could feel like a personal attack rather than a growth process.",
    "I would recommend this course, in some ways. Dr. Casey is an expert in the field and is incredibly passionate. I might be more likely to recommend the course if the format centered more on professor instruction with a discussion among peers rather than a series of presentations that had to fit a presentation model that we did not see much of before jumping into it ourselves.",
    "The material covered in this class is really valuable and helpful. However, the way in which it is communicated currently outweighs the positive benefits of the course. In it's current form, I would not recommend the course to other students. If the classroom environment can be improved to be less hostile and more supportive, I definitely would recommend the course. I believe that these changes are possible, and am hopeful that the next iteration of the course will be a much more positive experience for students."
