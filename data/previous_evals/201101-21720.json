   "comments": [
    "Yes, I would if you have any interest in international politics.",
    "Take it - it is easy to overestimate how much you know about the UN.",
    "Krasno lectures more than she facilitates conversation, but her stories can be pretty entertaining. That said, the class as a whole was pretty boring. Workload is light. There are heavy reading assignments, but few (if any) completed them. Midterm and short final essay (12-15p). Midterm questions were handed out in advance, but I still managed to bomb the exam. With a bit of prep it would probably be a breeze. Pretty gutty class- mostly hats with a few very serious (even too serious) kids. Standard PLSC, pretty easy for EPE. Main thing I took from the class is how little the UN does for such a big body, so I didn't regret accomplishing very little myself.",
    "Definitely take this class as long as you can get in. Do the reading because you'll need it for the midterm, but after the test you don't really need to do any of it. Prof. Krasno talks for most of the class so you don't have to participate if you don't want to, but it's a plus if you do. Also the trip to the UN is sweet.",
    "This course provides tremendous insight into the inner-workings of the UN - what exactly this organization is supposed to accomplish, and how effective it is in meeting its objectives. You read a lot of case studies that illustrate the successes and failures of UN missions in many different regions since the organization's inception. Considering how much criticism the UN gets for \"not accomplishing anything\", I feel that this is a very important course for any Yale student to take in order to recognize the reality of what this organization tries to and actually does accomplish. You'll realize it does a lot more than it gets credit for.",
    "Great class if you need a PLSC seminar, and also if you are looking to write your senior thesis.",
    "Very easy course. Mostly jocks in the class, so makes it easier. The reading is basically only mandatory up until the midterm, and after that, nobody does it because the paper is written on a self-selected topic. It's also run more like a lecture, so the people don't participate. The simulation is very fun though, and the material is great. If you put in the effort, you learn a lot about the world and the UN--very enjoyable.",
    "Sort of a lecture-in-seminar style, which is fine because Prof. Krasno has so much experience in the area. Make sure to step up to the class material, because she may let you get by without doing enough work\/reading all along.",
    "This is kind of a gut seminar with a lot of athletes in it, but if you are truly interested in the United Nations and take it for the right reasons, you can get a lot out of the class.."
