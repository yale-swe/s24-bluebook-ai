   "comments": [
    "I would summarize this course as \"comedy hour where you also learn Many Interesting Things about medieval writing.\" I would absolutely recommend this course to another student, and I think everyone who has gotten the chance to take it has beenlucky indeed.",
    "Literary and mystical texts in English from late 13th and early 14th centuries, regarded through perspectives of theology and religious controversies. Prior knowledge of Middle English not required, but helpful. Course attracted several Medieval Studies PhD students, which made the discourse a bit difficult at first, but overall manageable throughout.The exchanges between the two professors was always lively and enlightening. Their strengths complimented one another usefully.",
    "Yes, take it.",
    "Yes but I would warn him or her about the the fact that the course assume knowledge which the student will need to supply ( see above).",
    "Both an excellent overview of trends in medieval theology and some excellent perspective outside of strict disciplinary boundaries.",
    "This class covers some of the key literary and theological works of England from 1360-1410. You cover some of the great mystical writings of the time, including Julian of Norwich and The Cloud, and you also get a good doss of Chaucer and the Pearl Poet. These works are discussed as both theological and literary texts, and since there are both Divinity and English students in the room, the discussions are often lively. Professors Minnis and Turner are great--they both love the material, are wonderful teachers, and work to create a comfortable but highly engaged classroom atmosphere. I took this course primarily to learn more about the mystics of this time period. I did not have very much of a background in medieval studies and the learning curve was steep at times, but I learned so much and Professors Minnis and Turner were always available to help. I highly recommend this class.",
    "English 539 is an opportunity to see how interdisciplinary work and see ology and literature might proceed."

   "comments": [
    "This course, while not in my own field, has nonetheless been valuable as I suss out the parameters of various scholarly discussions in my broader field. At the moment, I don't anticipate it playing directly into my dissertation and research, but I wouldn't be surprised if it did.",
    "I may address some of these texts in my dissertation.",
    "Yes but could have been better organized to be truly helpful.",
    "It was useful both for the specific subject matter covered and for suggesting connections between material otherwise considered independently.",
    "I came into this course with a great interest in the writings of this time period but without having studied them beyond survey courses in college. I have learned so much from this course and am so thankful that I decided to take it. My grasp of medieval theology has grown immensely and I have already found the knowledge I gained in this course to be of help to me in other courses.",
    "This course opened up new avenues of research in my chosen field. It showed me how as an English student I might use theology in my research."
