    "This course was a survey course in industrial ecology. We covered a lot of ground in a short period of time. The field trip (I went to Hawaii) was a critical component to putting the theoretical information to use. The combination of a group project, with some software assignments, on top of regular class readings, and a class debate, keeps you on your toes but is very rewarding.",
    "The debates were really helpful in strengthening presentation skills and learning of the topic material in-depth!",
    "I participated in this class with the expectation that I could use the analytical frameworks discussed throughout the course to other topics. After going through the class I am still unclear about what industrial ecology is and how it can be practically applied to anything I will do outside of FES.",
    "Tom and Marian are great people who have deep knowledge on the subject, but somehow this knowledge is not well-translated in class at all. Lectures are a bit painful to sit through - many were not appropriate for a sophisticated audience already exposed to environmental issues. Their lecture styles are both fairly slow, and just don't explain the engaging topics in an engaging, thorough, or insightful way. The LCA lecture, for example, really left me disappointed - LCA is a fascinating field, but if I didn't already have some exposure to it, I wouldn't have realized that. I was confused as to why the lecture ended with a discussion of LEED, which doesn't really have anything to do with LCA, instead of using the limited time to more carefully discuss the complex subject of LCA. The course ends up being a general sustainability romp instead of focusing on the core of what I now think of as the fairly slippery field of industrial ecology - slippery in that it can be interpreted as practically anything.",
    "answers to questions about lab work refer to homework assignments exploring three different software packages. while these tools could be really powerful and illuminating, we received inadequate introductions and instruction in class, and I poured a significant amount of time into problem sets that were either oversimplified or too complicated. essentially, getting bogged down in the minute tasks of populating a model could detract from a deeper understanding of the underlying concepts, and the rewards did not match the time invested.",
    "Jenn Baka was a very good TA. Snirath Sabapathy, on the other hand, was poor- offering little support to students. Generally, the lectures were not in-depth enough to be interesting. Professors seemed difficult to contact and discuss the class work. I think the class could benefit substantially from placing more emphasis on the projects from the onset of the semester. The modelling assignments were useful and I would recommend keeping them for the future assignments. However, I think it would behoove the professors to actually learn the software themselves - instead on relying on the TAs to learn these programs. The class on Simapro was particularly deficient.",
    "Extensive feedback for 11-13 was provided in class to the professors and TAs.",
    "This class is actually very useful for social ecology students, which I did not expect!"

    "The group project. I learned so much about how to interview people along with putting heaps of data together into a comprehensive picture that someone can understand easily.",
    "The best part of the course was the spring break projects. I felt as if I was truly able to exercise and use the skills learned in industrial ecology by applying this gained tool set to real world issues.",
    "I feel the group projects were quite useful and interesting. My project helped me learn how to gather information from a variety of people and sources.",
    "An overview of the IE issues, introduction to some softwares.",
    "Though I have mixed feelings about the term-long project, I do think it was the most valuable part of the class. My particular study was only loosely defined and allowed for a lot of creative thinking, which was great for me, but which allowed me to avoid getting too technical with my analysis. Essentially, the openness of the project let me take it in the direction I wanted to, but also let me play to my strengths rather than encouraging me to experiment more thoroughly with new analytical tools.I also enjoyed a lot of the lectures--particularly those that explored case studies and introduced interesting things going on in cities around the world.",
    "The project was the best part of the class. It would be beneficial however if the projects were assigned earlier than January 24th. This limited the amount of time that students could work on the projects as time is always lost at the beginning from waiting on information or establishing contact with the client\/ key contact person.",

   "comments": [
    "Figuring out how best to work in the software into the course. We had four software homework assignments that really didn't give us a good understanding of the complexities behind the software. I know the professors are working on another way to present this information and I think the next iteration will be more useful at the end of the day: either focusing on fewer software applications or figuring out another way to delve more deeply into each.",
    "I felt as if the software exercises were a bit disconnected from the course materials and rushed. It would be helpful to spend the entire semester concentrating on one software package and learning it in-depth.",
    "An improved definition of industrial ecology",
    "Please re-think the lectures. Give students a reason to do the readings. Treat us like grad students, not undergrads - most of us already have public speaking and project management experience, we don't need to get that from the debates and the final project. We already have ideas and knowledge about sustainability issues. I would have rather spent time gaining from Tom and Marian's expertise and long history than getting an overview of things I was already aware of.Please focus on IE - not sustainability issues in general (a task for other classes) with IE window dressing.Much, much, muchbetter assignments for the software are needed. Please do spend 10 minutes on this software in class and expect students to get much of anything out of the assignment. Please also give us more than a week to complete it, write the assignments more carefully, and be more available to answer questions about the software and the assignments themselves.The final projects need to be much better designed and organized. Do not create a project assignment so loose that students spend all their time on logistics, figuring out what the professors want, managing each other, and shaping the final product to fit nebulous goals instead of practicing industrial ecology. A lot of students will say they liked the final project, they had a good time, etc, but I seriously question how much anyone learned about IE\/became better system thinkers vs enjoying a trip and not having to try very hard.",
    "Need to rethink the problem sets. Add an optional fourth credit and offer an introduction to each software package in a three-hour seminar on a Friday, or with a weekly 1.5 hour workshop that allows students to methodically develop skills. Alternatively, focus on a single modeling tool and draw students into a deeper understanding of the software through four assignments that help them advance.",
    "Expectations of clients and reaching staff need to be better aligned. We faced significant trouble trying to define our project in a way which would prove useful to both.",
    "more section time when working on the software, no need to spend time on calculations in class as in the input output lecture.",
    "The modeling exercises should be improved! Maybe focus more on one of the software and compare it to the others or go deeper in each of them.",
    "The simulation homeworks. some of them were poorly planned.",
    "I feel like Marian and Tom spent a lot of time justifying the existence of Industrial Ecology as a field. While this makes complete sense for an introductory course for students new to the topic, at the times it felt a bit excessive to the point where I got the distinct sense that this was borne out of all the defense they must have to do within the academic community. All of the students taking the class already support the concept of Industrial Ecology (and that's why we're taking the class) -- no need to defend yourselves to us."

In fact, I had the opportunity to express (or hear others express) everything that I'm writing here.",

Allows urban dwellers to think about urban ecosystem in a realistic and inclusive way. A little bit outside of my focus area, but I was eager to get a survey introduction. For that reason, I wish that there had been fewer readings that the professors had highlighted as seminal and that had been referenced more explicitly during class time.",

I'm trying to be realistic -- we can focus on forestry all we want, but I feel that learning about materials and industry is working within the framework of the real world we live in, instead of fantasy-land tropical forests we obsess over."

While this was a bit disappointing, it also gave me the distinct feeling that my FES education was all linked together and culminating in a unique way. For example, a lot of the concepts we talked about in Dave Skelly's Landscape Ecology foundation class were present in IE, as were a lot of social ecology concepts from Dove's foundation class. Kind of cool to see them emerge in a field with different practical applications."

Because of this, we received some very interesting information that we are including in our report.",

    "Tough. My colleague was not invested in the project and I felt deflated by this. Could get excited about my own ideas but felt that I was really fueling the effort.",
    "The disadvantages were that often some group members are not as dedicated or willing to put in the work required to create a graduate level project. It has been my experience that non-English speaking international students have in some cases neither the language level or intellectual aptitude to perform at the level that one would expect at Yale - which has often lead to US students needing to compensate for the deficiencies in the report (rewriting sections, needing to push the conceptual development of those sections). Not that this pertains solely to this class- but as it happened to arise in this course, it would behoove the institution to more rigorously vet the international students they admit into the program.",
