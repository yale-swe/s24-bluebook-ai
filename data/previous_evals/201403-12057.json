    "Take if if you can commit about 10hrs to lab work every week.",
    "Chill course credit, though of course your experience will be dependent on your project and lab. The course itself just requires a few paragraphs during the semester describing your project, and a lab meeting presentation or paper at the end. It's good to get credit for research work you're doing already.",
    "Take it.",
    "You should start doing research before second semester senior year to get a better understanding of your research.",
    "I enjoy the work I do in the lab, so this was a good option for me. You can spend so much time there though, so make sure you want that commitment. Great opportunity to get credit for something you already do if you're currently working in a lab."
