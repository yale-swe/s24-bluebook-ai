    "Overall not bad. Found it interesting but not incredibly stimulating. I would recommend it to those more interesting in theory than empirical research because there's a lot of things covered that are just speculation and in some respects can be somewhat subjective.",
    "Take this course if you're at all interested in the life sciences. It's amazing and will broaden your worldview on how science is conducted and how our theories came to be.",
    "A really good class! Readings are well-chosen and the class covers a lot of area in evolutionary theory. Recommended!"
