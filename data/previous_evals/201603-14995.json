   "comments": [
    "I learned a lot about relatively hyperbolic groups and constructions related to the curve complex. More importantly I developed my ability to read and understand research papers.",
    "I gained knowledge about several different directions in current research. The course served as a good introduction to the literature on these topics.",
    "I found my knowledge of the covered topics greatly increased, as would be expected. Additionally, though, I found that some of the ways of thinking conveyed in the course made their way into my mathematical toolbox: in particular, I really think I got a handle on the argumentative structure of \"we want it to look like this, but it doesn't quite, so let's tweak the definition ever so slightly and see what happens\" coming from the projection distance in trees of metric spaces, our definition of relative hyperbolicity, and in our cartoon for hierarchies. Especially with how the material was presented, it was clear how ideas from regular hyperbolicity could be ported to the relatively hyperbolic case and how such research is often done. I think that this course gave me a really good insight into some of the motivations behind the recent developments it presented, motivations I would not have gotten otherwise."

   "comments": [
    "The strengths were that Minsky is a good lecturer and that he clearly had a plan for the course that was well executed. That said I wish he would have told us what he wanted to get to at the start of the semester.",
    "The class was well-organized and always interesting. I think the instructor spent just the right amount of time on background for the course, although I think the right student for the course would need to have some prior experience with geometric group theory.",
    "I think that the course was a little fast, and if one didn't review notes and look through the papers for details one would be pretty confused, if not lost. This was my experience for the middle section of the course. That said, when I took the time to review what we had covered and make sure that everything made sense to me, I found that the material from class would always cover enough of the argument for me to reconstruct the details later (with the help of the paper). Overall, I think that the papers should either be required reading or the class could have been slightly slowed down."

   "comments": [
    "Yes. Minsky is a good lecturer and if you're at all interested in geometry the course will be interesting. It's a good introduction to active areas of research in geometry.",
    "Yes. This course covers a broad and very active field within geometric group theory. Anyone with an interest in geometry would benefit from knowing something about this field.",
    "Absolutely. It's a fascinating topic which is right at the edge of current research, yet it was presented from pretty rudimentary beginnings. Even if you aren't interested in doing research in this field, I think it was a really pretty picture of how recent developments all tie into and inform each other."
