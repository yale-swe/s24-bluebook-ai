   "comments": [
    "Good survey class classic History lecture. Professor Semmel is amazing and very approachable. Amazing fifth class.",
    "Solid History lecture. The paper's a little boring but otherwise a tolerable class.",
    "The history of the British Empire is a vital history to learn. This class helped explain to me a lot about the world as it has come to be in the last few centuries. Certainly for history majors I would recommend it. For others with an interest in history, I would say take this class Credit\/D\/Fail.",
    "Yeah its a good course take it",
    "Very interesting history course with an engaging professor and a relatively low workload. Primary-source readings should generally be done (especially after the midterm, given that the final has passage IDs), but tend to be interesting. Secondary-source ones can be dry and a couple felt unnecessary, but overall reading load is definitely not bad compared to other history classes.",
    "I would recommend.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student, especially if that student is interested in British history and empires in general. In addition, the British Empire expanded so far across the world that its history is inextricably linked to the histories of many other regions. Thus, this course offers a survey of a good portion of world history during Britain's imperial period.",
    "A great survey of the British Empire, mostly focusing on the social impact of Empire on Britain and Her colonies",
    "Please take this class !!! It is so interesting and the professor is incredible.",
    "I would summarize the class as an illuminating, brilliant class that I would highly recommend to any other student, whether or not he or she is interested in history. The history of the British Empire, particularly the British Empire in its later years, is so fundamentally essential to both Western and world history that someone living in the 21st century cannot understand our modern world without knowledge of the British Empire.",
    "It is a fascinating course taught by an excellent professor. I would absolutely recommend this course to a student interested in British history."
