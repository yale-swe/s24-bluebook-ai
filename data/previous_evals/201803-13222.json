    "Using frameworks to think about various weights when making an ethical decision; variety of ways in which bias informs decision-making; the importance of simulation in learning; how to balance personal weights with those of others.",
    "This course provided frameworks to consider and approach ethical decisions when there are no easy answers. This course provided me with concrete methods for how to identify ethical dilemmas, think through problems, and act. I have been able to apply this learning outside of the classroom."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Streghts: High level of participation from students, opportunity to work as a group and create a simulation to apply class concepts. Weaknesses: Main concepts could have been summarized in digital or paper handouts and diagrams to faciliate visualization. Classroom size was challenging for a big group.",
    "The discussions making up the bulk of the course we're excellent - both in elucidating the relevant parts of the framework, but also in developing a deeper understanding of the specific issues at hand and in learning about ourselves. The reading material, even if we didn't make it to everything in the class itself, was always informative, and pushed us to think about the ethical decisions others have faced. The material was well paced to develop the framework gradually over the semester. The one improvement I would suggest is to somehow incorporate a visual for the framework as a function of time (as we discussed in our final class); it can be helpful to organize all of the parts of the decision. Keeping in mind that some students may not want that visual, it might be worth thinking about how to present the visual piece-by-piece as subsections are taught, without making it \"the framework.\" My initial thought would be just at the end of each section (e.g. Promises, the Sources of Obligations, then Weights, then Cures) to just visually depict them relative in time to each other as they're taught, and gradually develop the complete timeline of the framework.",
    "I think the simulations are quite excellent -- and the opportunity to work on one as part of the class is a useful experience. As others in the class have mentioned, it would have been helpful to go over the framework concept at the outset, but I recognize that others may not necessarily feel the same way.",
    "The quality of discussions was consistently high throughout the semester. Simulations were not only engaging, but also informative and thought-provoking. Eric put together an excellent group of students for this class, and it definitely showed in so many different ways. Overall, very good course.",
    "written notes or something about the topics covered in class would have been helpful."

   "comments": [
    "Take this course if you can function without too much structure and can syntesize your own notes and learning. Much of the work and learning is done individually while students reflect on their experiences.",
    "Oh yes, especially for those who will likely hold some leadership role in the future. They will learn skills to navigate difficult decisions in leadership, and they will learn more about their leadership style.",
    "Absolutely! Useful for anyone going into any leadership position in the future, which would be all of us.",
    "Absolutely. Take it if you are able to get in!",
    "Yes, I would highly recommend this course to all students. The topic is applicable across disciplines, as ethical decisions will occur in every leadership role that Yale graduates will face no matter their course of study."
