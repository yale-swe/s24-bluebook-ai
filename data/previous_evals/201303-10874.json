   "comments": [
    "Absolutely recommend. Take if you possibly can.",
    "Interesting, teachers are so kind, must take if you can get in",
    "Absolutely! Guest lectures were really interesting and the placement in the preschool\/childcare programs were always the best part of my week (even though it was at 8:30 am).",
    "Really good class, pretty easy, definitely worth it for the practicum part.",
    "Pretty low workload, but the practicum (observing a daycare class for two to three hours each week) is certainly time-demanding. Other than that, seven journal responses and a final paper. A good class, though you have to be motivated if you want to learn. It's easy to slack off and not pay attention during seminar classes, which are largely lecture-based.",
    "This course is absolutely wonderful! A variety of lecturers from different ends of child development come speak every week, and the lectures themselves are fascinating and engaging. The practicum-- spending 2.5 to 3 hours at a daycare center every week and journaling about it- is a really enjoyable part of the course. I recommend not putting journals off, because having 3 quick pages to write every week is a lot different than having 12 pages to write in one night.",
    "I would recommend it if you want an intro class about child development that includes observation. However, it is very general. If you want something more specific to education or policy or a certain skill children learn, I would recommend a more focused course. This course gives you a little bit of everything instead of honing in on one aspect of early childhood\/ learning.",
    "If you can get in and enjoy interacting with children, take this class! Writing the journals well takes some thought, but they were short (4 pages double-spaced) to be able to complete the afternoon of your observation. But on the whole very achievable to do well, very rewarding, and something different from the usual drudgery of coursework.",
    "This is a wonderful class that I would highly suggest. It's very competitive to get into because of the demand, but if you have he opportunity take it. I'm a science major with little psych experience, but I had an amazing time and I loved being able to work in a preschool classroom for a semester. Amazing class!",
    "I recommend this class strongly, provided you have a real interest in children\u00e2\u0080\u0099s development. The class itself was more like a lecture class, with a lecture, often by a guest from the New Haven community, for the first half of the class, followed by small group sections afterwards. These lectures could be hit or miss, but some of them were really excellent. However, the centerpiece of the class was really the weekly observations in New Haven childcare centers. Being able to apply the material in a real world setting really deepened my understanding of child development, and almost all of the writing for the class centered on these observations. If this sounds interesting to you, I highly recommend the class.",
    "It's a great class! The observations are fun and educational.",
    "I would recommend this course to students who are enthusiastic about children and child development. Taking this course will help you understand children while having fun. The professors were unbelievable and understanding. I haven't been cared about by a group of professors more then I was in this course",
    "One of the classes you'll always remember at Yale. Very chill, perfect for seniors. The instructors really care about the students, and we had some interesting guest speakers as well.Very chill, lenient grading. Class meets once a week for 2 hours, and you observe a preschool or daycare for 2.5 hours each week on a set day that you choose. 3-5 page journal entries about your observations for 7 of the visits, relating your readings (I just skimmed the readings when I need to write something) to your observations. One 12-15 ds paper at the end on any topic. All quite lenient because the instructors understand this is a life-lessons type of class... even if you think your'e good with kids, you'll learn things here because you likely haven't interacted so regularly with 3 year olds in a very long time.."
