   "comments": [
    "Take it if you're a continental person looking for an analytical class to take to fulfill your philosophy major requirement! It won't kill you and it's fun.",
    "It's a great course. You tackle many of the great articles of analytic philosophy, and Professor Szabo is engaging and very helpful in clarifying what would otherwise be very dense material.",
    "Great professor, interesting material. A little bit harder than other classes but worth it !",
    "Take it, especially with Szabo. Deceptive amount of work.",
    "If you are interested in the material covered, the class is dynamic and interesting. The only work is the readings, 4 very short and not too difficult writing assignments, and a final term paper. Zoltan is a great lecturer.Note: This is not a seminar. It's more of a lecture where you are free to interrupt and ask questions.",
    "Philosophy of Language is a very interesting introduction to a relatively nuanced and technical subject. The readings can be very specific, but each is generally a manageable length and very interesting. The workload is also very reasonable. Professor Szabo is wonderfully clear and very interesting. An excellent philosophy course.",
    "A survey of contemporary philosophy of language. Tons of material, not a lot of deep exploration. I would recommend it to someone interested in analytic philosophy."
