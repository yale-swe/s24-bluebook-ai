   "comments": [
    "if you're interested in political science, economics, or just experimental research take this class. gives you hands on experience in doing research and writing up results while remaining a very manageable work load (i only read a smattering of the articles that i was not assigned to \"present\" which entailed simply being very familiar with the content of the article). then again, if you're not really interested in this type of research then the class can get pretty dry. having taken econometrics or stats recently helps put things in context better but as long as you took them at some point you'll do fine",
    "This is a great course. There is a lot of material to cover, but you only have to read 1-2 articles per week (the class splits them up), and Gerber is wonderful. You should take this class if you're planning to pursue Political Science at Yale. It is one of the best courses I've taken in the department so far.",
    "I ultimately liked the class but would only recommend it if you like political science (or at least interested in conducting social science experiments) or if you really like statistics. If neither of these things appeals to you than you probably won't enjoy this class. If you're thinking about graduate school in Political Science though, I would definitely take the class.",
    "Randomized experimentation in political science may not be interesting for everyone but if you're into learning about the challenges of poli sci methodology and the rewards of rigorous approaches, and if you're the kind of person who would be excited by doing a substantial experimental project (probably survey experiment) of your own, taking this class should be a no-brainer. It quickly becomes clear why Professor Gerber is so prominent in the field because he's obviously brilliant, and wise in the ways of doing empirical political science well. This course isn't perfect, and possibly should be a lecture rather than a seminar, but if this is the kind of thing you're interested in it will be helpful and worthwhile. The overall workload is reasonable.",
    "Interesting class - the seminars mostly consist of Professor Gerber tearing apart various journal articles for flaws in their statistical methods, so you learn a lot of \"what not to do.\" Then, you get some funding to conduct your own political science experiment, which was pretty cool. Be warned, though, there are almost no assignments in the class except for the final paper, so you have to work hard on your experiment since it's almost your entire class grade. Professor Gerber is very helpful, and I feel like this is a good class to take if you're interested in more quantitative areas of political science.",
    "This class is good for the student who has already taken statistics and is interested in how their skills can be applied to political science. As a methodology course I found it lacking and considered it more as an introduction to the advanced application of stats in polisci. However, it was enlightening window into the statistical side of polisci and its language for those unaware."
