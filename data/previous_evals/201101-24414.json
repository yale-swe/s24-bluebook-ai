    "It is learning how to use R and code in R, particularly for paleontological data. I recommend it to students who are not very familiar with R, since the course starts from the absolute basics, or students who have a research project they want to use R for, or students who might in the future want to use R for specific projects. The course plan was fluid, so there were opportunities to ask for certain topics to be covered.",
    "You go over the basics of R with focus on how you would use it for paleostatistics. I would recommend it.",
    "The course gives the fundamentals of programming in R, assuming zero prior knowledge (of programming in any language). There is also a fair bit of introduction to basic statistical tests. The last few lectures were on more applied topics in phylogeny. I would definitely recommend this course to any paleontologist who wants to learn basic programming skills."

   "comments": [
    "This course didn't do much to increase my knowledge of the profession, since it was mostly learning how to use a tool for analyzing data. It contributed a lot to m dissertation research though, because I may need to use R for parts of it, and it can be very hard to learn ow to use a program like that without some help getting started.",
    "I still really know how to use R but I will know where to look to find out how to use it and I know what I can do with it.",
    "As stated above, I use R in my research already. This course absolutely deepened my knowledge of R, and provided a valuable introduction to a few key methods that I am hoping to utilize in my thesis work."
