   "comments": [
    "Definitely take it - especially if you're interested in bioethics (even slightly). It's a 9am lecture with no aids (powerpoints, etc.), but it's the most interesting course I've taken at Yale. Grading is fair and appropriate as well. Professor Latham is a very organized, captivating lecturer who really knows his subject and exactly what he wants you to know about it.",
    "this is a fantastic class. Love Latham. If you have no background in law or bioethics it'lll be a really great course for you. Such interesting information, great lecturer and not too challenging",
    "recommended if you're interested in the intersection of bioethics and law. Not too easy and not too difficult",
    "Excellent and extremely interesting. Very early in the morning but there is no need to attend every lecture.",
    "Take it. Beware the grading is only final\/midterm\/one paper and largely depends on how your TF grades.",
    "I would recommend the course, its interesting and offers a good introduction to medical law.",
    "i think it is a great, interesting course that will keep you on the egde of your seat",
    "DEFINITELY take this class! Even if you don't think you'll go into bioethics as a field, the material is really relevant and interesting. You'll learn a lot about the legal system and the healthcare system in this country. The reading is pretty dense but it is a good introduction to legal textbooks and case law. The workload is not hard if you just keep up with it. I would take this class again if I could! Highly recommend it.",
    "YES!!! Take this class! The material is thought-provoking and relevant to everyone.",
    "Take it!",
    "Take it, i learned so much about our healthcare system. I loved the focus on the legal principles.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to everyone. It's not very hard, incredibly interesting, and has a great professor. TAKE IT!",
    "This is the best class I have taken at Yale. If you have any interest in bioethics (or even just an interest in medicine) you should definitely take it.",
    "It's a great class to take that simply requires reading to do well. The lectures are worth going to if you can get there in the morning. Definitely an engaging class even for non-premeds",
    "good class",
    "This was an excellent class. The work load wasn't too much, but definitely a lot of reading. Also, Professor Latham was one of the best lecturers I've had at Yale!",
    "Yes. A great class and good workload.",
    "Yes! Take it! So great and sections are enjoyable",
    "A pretty easy class that everyone should take. It addresses extremely pertinent subjects and rounds out the education of any political science major. Latham is a good lecturer.",
    "Interesting lectures and material, not a lot of work.",
    "Yes, definitely take it. The material is so interesting and relevant. Latham is an awesome lecturer, definitely worth getting up for at 9am.",
    "Bioethics and the Law is an introduction to the controversial political topics of the day and their applications to the legal field. Be aware that not all topics will have legal precedents (mainly because these issues haven't made it to the courts yet) and that there will be a fair amount of material in the book- especially lesser known cases that are not covered in class.In general though, bioethics is a wonderful class, not too many requirements, the lectures are amazing to go to (even at 9 am), and Professor Latham is a great lecturer. I highly recommend this class.",
    "I would certainly recommend this course to a fellow student. It is very interesting and is made up of a lot of the debatable topics of today.",
    "yes the material is really interesting; you go over informed consent, organ donors, abortion, stem cell research, and us healthcare among other topics. midterm, paper, and a final.",
    "Yes I found it very interesting and really enjoyed it.",
    "Bioethics and Law is about cases and laws that you use to determine the US (and other countries' by comparison)'s opinion regarding certain topics, such as Organ transplantation, right to procreate, right to deny life sustaining treatment, informed consent, abortion, etc. Many thought provoking debates, and law knowledge about issues pertaining to bioethics.",
    "Professor Latham's lectures really do make this class something special. The material itself is very interesting, and if you are premed like me, it's a great supplementary class to look into. Sometimes the legal readings can be dense and slow going, but I personally enjoyed them -- so just make sure you will have enoughtime to do them, otherwise your grade may suffer.",
    "Wonderful--a must take!",
    "Yes, good course. Very interesting and not an overwhelming amount of work. Professor Latham is excellent.",
    "Professor Latham is wonderful. The syllabus is engaging and flows wonderfully from topic to topic. David Smith teaches the philosophy approach to bioethics whereas Latham teachers the legal side. Both courses are said to be wonderful (I have not yet taken one with Smith, although I hope to) and I do not think it matters the order in which you take them.",
    "Great lecturers, fun and interesting sections, interesting readings. It's a must-take.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS. Yes, it's 9am. No, that's not too early. Latham's a really good lecturer; engaging and amusing. The topics cover a broad range and are all relevant issues. Definitely a class worth taking.",
    "I would recommend it. Professor Latham is a great lecturer and never gets dull. All of his lectures are easy to follow and there's never any confusion about his topics and the cases he discusses. One of the best lectures at Yale, definitely. And the workload is manageable!",
    "Very interesting class, if you're into the topic. Professor Latham is a fantastic lecturer - he can keep you awake at 9am. The casebook looks intimidating, but is actually a pretty easy read, and the cases are pretty entertaining. The topics are all very relevant to recent events, and covering them from a law aspect gave them a fresh point of view, especially some of the more hackneyed topics. Loved this class, definitely recommend it!",
    "ABSOLUTELY - GREAT COURSE!!!",
    "Yes I would recommend Bioethics. It's a fun class and a good poli-sci credit.",
    "This is a great class! It discusses important ethical questions from a legal perspective, and is going to give you a solid background on important and relevant issues such as abortion, physician-assisted suicide, artificial reproduction techniques etc. The material is interesting, and the prof. is really great! A lot of reading, but it's pretty worthy. One of the best classes I've taken so far!",
    "If you are interested in bioethical issues and want to approach them from the practical stance of the law rather than more obscure slants like religion, then this is a great class. I personally really liked that it was grounded in the law rather than hypothetical questions of right and wrong, and since I plan to go into biomedical sciences, i felt that this was a good background to have. Professor Latham is great, and the course is very interesting.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS!",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class. Every student needs to be aware of the issues discussed inthese lectures and Professor Latham is great. The workload is manageable, you have two tests and an essay. I thoroughly enjoyed attending lecture and I think every student at Yale should take this class.",
    "Absolutely take this class, especially if you know you are interested in bioethics! The class is nicely organized. The lectures are fantastic, and the readings are not excessive and supplement the material nicely. The work is reasonable. Overall it's a great way to learn about what the law actually says about complex issues such as health care distribution, organ donation, abortion, stem cell research, right to die, etc, and regardless of yourmoral views, knowing what the law says is important, so definitely take it!",
    "Really interesting and relevant material. Yes, I would reccommend it. Only downfall is that it was at 9am.",
    "This is a great class. 2 lectures a week, optional section (although it's good for you to get to know your T.A....), a midterm, a paper, and a final, not at all an intimidating course-load. Lots of really useful, relevant, real-world information, whether you're interested in medicine, law, or neither. Prof. Latham is great, lecture is never dull and always well-organized, but make sure you can get up for the 9am lecture.",
    "I would definitely recommend it. Even if you know nothing about the subject.",
    "SUCH a good class!!!! Really interesting, covers a variety of topics in bioethics. I'm a science major and found all of the material relevant to what I want to do for the rest of my life. The law part of it allowed me to think in ways that I don't usually think and definitely opened by eyes to a field that is becoming more and more prevalent in the world. Not much work at all, textbook is not that difficult to read and reading is definitely manageable. Latham is a great lecturer, definitely worth the 9 am.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. If you're pre-med, pre-law, interested in a career in medical research, or even remotely interested in the subject, this class will be very enjoyable. The lectures are always great, and the workload is very manageable.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. The material is recent and examples of issues talked about in class can be seen in medicine now. Also, Professor Latham is a terrific lecturer.",
    "Definitely. It's one of those rare courses where you learn just the right amount of great, interesting information, and don't have that much work (reading truly is optional, and the exams are relatively easy to study for). DO IT.",
    "It's been said here before -- Professor Latham indeed is an engaging lecturer, even at 9 in the morning. Abundantly interesting material that'll somehow bear relevance to every conversation you have in the days following lectures.",
    "great, interesting course.",
    "DEFINITELY TAKE THIS COURSE! It's one of those Yale courses that you just have to take. Professor Latham is a PHENOMENAL lecturer and the subject material is super interesting and relevant.",
    "Bioethics and Law is a great introduction to bioethics that will teach you the major themes without stressing you out. You will learn a lot! Prof Latham is wonderful.",
    "Take this class if you want an intro poly-sci class. It's a lot of reading but you will really enjoy it.",
    "I would 100% recommend this class to anyone interested in law or health. Stephen Latham is amazing, one time he walked to our 9am class from Hamden, in a blizzard. The lectures are interesting and easy to follow and the reading is relevant, helpful and totally manageable. It's not a ton of work but I definitely got a lot out of the class! Take it take it take it!",
    "interesting material and Professor Latham is a great lecturer.",
    "I would recommend it.",
    "I would definitely recommend it and I would say that it is a very doable class and that it should be taken at some point.",
    "A great, legally substantive, look at medical ethics.",
    "This is a wonderful introduction to all aspects of bioethics in the United States. It discusses, at a relatively good pace, everything from abortion to tobacco laws. I would recommend this course to anyone, even with no prior interest in bioethics. This is a course that led me to become really interested in bioethics.",
    "If you are interested in the subject matter you'll enjoy this class (or at least you won't hate it). Don't do the full readings - just read the cases and extract the important info from them.",
    "Its great! A lot more law heavy than ethics."
