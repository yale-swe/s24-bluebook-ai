   "comments": [
    "If you are interested in dense political theory, then yes.",
    "Take this course is you can do 100 pages of reading a week; it's worth it.",
    "This class is awesome. If you are at all interested in continental philosophy, you will love the chance to get ot know kapustin. Some of your classmates may be slightly pretentious, but it will be worth it. There is not much work (midterm paper and final paper) besides keeping up with the reading but you will really enjoy doing the reading!! It's really stimulating",
    "An excellent survey of the literature surrounding the theory political violence. It *is* theoretical, mind you (we never got to the planned case study), but some of it is quite interesting.Boris Kapustin is one of the best teachers at Yale - take anything and everything he has to offer.",
    "Very good course. Prof. Kapustin is insightful and engaging, and he is deeply committed to teaching students. The readings are mostly from social theory and political philosophy, and Kapustin is clearly knowledgeable about the subject matter. Definitely worth taking if you'd like to study philosophical and social theoretical approaches to violence.",
    "Take it if you are prepared to discuss dense philosophy.",
    "Take this course if you can - it's the best political theory seminar in the polysci department.",
    "Take it even if you don't know much about philosophy... kapustin is amazing",
    "Somewhat difficult readings but the overall topics discussed are really interesting and definitely worth talking about. I highly recommend this class.",
    "Yes, I would with the caveat that you have to be prepared to be discussing things in the abstract, despite the gritty reality which is implied by a course on violence. The workload is pretty light actually, only a really easy midterm paper. The final paper is tough, though, and I haven't checked my grade yet for it. Email me at samuel.miles@yale.edu for a follow-up on that.",
    "Great class - you will learn something even if you do nothing. Prof Kapustin is amazing and will make the material come to life.",
    "Professor Kapustin is one of those professors that change the way you see the world. Take this class (even though I preferred his Moral Choices in Politics - if you can get into one of his seminars, don't hesitate just DO IT)."
