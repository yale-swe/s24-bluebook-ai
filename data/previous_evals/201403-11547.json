    "The class is valuable for understanding both the mechanisms of the trading system and the wider debates around its efficacy and legitimacy.",
    "Q1. Many readings were published in late '90s\/early '00s which did always best inform the subject we were discussing in the course. Outdated documents from these periods are a great way to understand the frame of mind policy -makers were in when making important policy decisions. Considering the quite significant reading load for the course, it may be most valuable to pare down some of the older readings and replace them with updated material. Q2. memo-style assignments were excellent and a great way to reinforce important lecture concepts. Also am in favor of the 2 memo requirement. Suggestion: increase number of memos to 3 and count for 30% to reduce the weight of final exam. This would encourage students to complete memos earlier in the semester, therefore read more material and contribute more to lecture discussions. Q8-10. Dan Esty was superb at facilitating class discussion in a non-intimidating manner, which put the class at ease. Elena was a great TA, was responsive to email and very engaged with students.",
    "The professor's professional experiences brought a great practical aspect to instruction.",
    "Question 10: After taking undergraduate and graduate courses at Yale for 6 years, I believe Professor Esty is one of the best professors at Yale. Conversations are interesting, engaging, and lucid. This was a subject material I had no background in, but feel much more aware and comfortable with it. Even if trade is not your focus (it wasn't mine), I highly recommend this class, because you'll get the best explanation possible for a subject that greatly influences the world we live in."

   "comments": [
    "More policy memo topic, more guest speakers",
    "Sometimes clarity came at the expense of not exploring the complexity. Also, the course and\/or instructors use the GATT as the starting point, but it would have enriched the class to do a brief (abridged) history of trade to contextualize the trading system in the history of trade. Otherwise, the class discussions often leaned heavily toward simple economistic models, which some students presumed as a sort of 'natural law'.",
    "Some of the materials were very extensive and the detail and scope of the readings did not always match with the pace of the class which was quick with a broad amount of topics to cover.",
    "I would like to see more focus on the legal aspects of international trade. It felt like the course was more focused on issues of international political economy than law. Also, some of the readings could be updated. In the human rights section I think it would be good to look into the work of John Ruggie as the UN Special Representative on Business and Human Rights.",

    "I study the link between trade and land use in land intensive commodity chains (timber, agriculture, mineral extraction). It was very helpful to have a sort of technical course on trade law that also pushed students to think about future reforms or solutions to the system.",
