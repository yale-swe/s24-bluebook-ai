   "comments": [
    "If you keep up with the material, get an extra outside textbook, and make sure to understand the notes, you'll do great. Make sure to visit office hours for pset help and answers. The curve can be stressful, but that means you study the material more.",
    "Good introduction to Microeconomics.",
    "A note about Tolga first. He is WONDERFUL. He is absolutely hilarious. He knows how to teach and how to teach well. He makes clear what is expected of you, what the course's objectives are, how he is going to spend the day's lecture, and so on. His jokes make what would normally be an incredibly boring class come to life. More so than anything, he understands the student, understands that some of the material is not fun, and understands that he has the ability to make things work out for you. He is incredibly helpful in office hours when solving the problem sets, his review sessions are helpful, and he is helpful outside of that as well. Should you take this class? Perhaps. For the midterm, there essentially was no curve. A 76\/80 and above (95%+) was an A, a 72\/80 to 75\/80 (90%-95%) was an A-. One question can be worth an entire letter grade. Tolga makes it clear in the first class how things are graded and how final grades are determined. Nonetheless, this class is difficult. I took AP Economics in high school and still had to spend hours each week rereading the book and doing the problems after each chapter. What you learned in high school will be taken to a more mathematical level (more algebra, more calculus). The scope of the course is very similar to that of a high school course, only a bit broader and absolutely more in-depth. This course is difficult but you will learn so much from such a kind and funny guy. Economics may not be for you, and if you are sure of this, then don't take this class. You won't have much fun. If you are on the fence, give it a try at leastshop it, witness the greatness of Tolga, peruse the textbook, and decide for yourself if it's something worthwhile to pursue.",
    "Econ 110 is a very good class that will teach you the fundamentals of microeconomics. Beware, however: the curve is extremely harsh. Hard work and putting in the extra effort, by reading the textbook before class of attending the professor's weekly office hours, will not guarantee a good grade. If you are serious about econ, and good enough at quantative subject, I would recommend this course nonetheless.",
    "Econ 110 is by no means more supportive of Freshman, but due to positional externalities (something you'll learn about in the course) and the fact that many of these Freshman who want to become econ majors econ 110 becomes much harder than the lecture (go over more material, the curve is harder). It also seemed like the seminar had fewer resources than the lecture, as they were going over past tests and all we had were our completed problem sets to review. Microeconomics as a subject can also be frustrating at times, and if you don't really like the material and keep up on the readings you will end up frustrated and confused. If you're looking for good life lessons and stories take this course with Tolga, you'll learn a lot more than just economics, but you'll need to do significant learning out of the class in order to understand the lectures.",
    "If you get in, please take it. It's so much better than the lecture (though it is a bit more challenging). Don't believe the hype about getting a worse grade - if you put in the work you will be fine. And Tolga is amazing.",
    "I would recommend this course to any students that want a good introductory to economics. I have never taken the course before, so my exposure to this area for the first time was a very good experience. It really allowed me to see if I wanted to pursue this area further.",
    "This course is great if you take it with Tolga. He is an entertaining professor who conveys the material well, and is clearly very passionate about teaching. However, be warned - the exams are fairly difficult (especially the final) and account for an enormous percentage of your grade (40% each for the midterm and final). It's necessary to do all the reading and to study beyond what is taught in class\/the problem sets to do well.",
    "A very rapid introduction of microeconomics. If you have never taken microeconomics in high school it might not be that easy.",
    "Take this class if you can, but expect the tests to be much more difficult than the problem sets. Review as well as you can before each test.",
    "It is very difficult. But if you really care about economics you should take it, because you are frankly going to learn more. It moves very fast, and most of the learning is you teaching yourself outside of class. But if you are good at economics and put in a large amount of time, you will learn an impressive and useful amount of information. The curve is also not as helpful as other curves, so prepare for that. This will likely be your hardest course of your semester if you take.",
    "I would recommend it - it's impossible to go through the course without learning something fascinating and important."
