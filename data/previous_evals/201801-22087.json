Some books were too long and could have been replaced with others, but still very instructional. One large issue is the heavy variance in the quality of the course based on the instructor, as not all classes are equal.",

    "No. The discussion was largely lead by the teacher and often hard to follow, but also well planned",
    "Yes. The class is great."
