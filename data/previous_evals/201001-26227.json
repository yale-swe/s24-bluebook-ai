   "comments": [
    "I found that this course was mostly memorizing material, rather than applying the concepts. While I appreciate that knowing the language of risk assessment is important, I do not believe that vocabulary tests are the most appropriate way to test this knowledge. I was surprised that we did not cover as much material as I thought we would - it seemed like much of the class was spent reviewing what was learned in the previous lectures. I also felt like there was little discussion or class involvement.",
    "The instructor did a good job of explaining, at a high level, risk assessment. If there is any opportunity for more of an interactive format, it would be helpful in learning the concepts. Having lecture for the first half of the class and more a discussion after the first hour would allow students to talk about the material they read for the week.",
    "I thought this would be an introductory\/survey course. The lectures however seemed more in-depth than I had expected\/hoped for. They were certainly more detailed than we needed. If they more closely followed the NAS readings (and left out some of the 'nitty-gritty' details), we probably would have been able to follow the lectures better and maybe participated more.Classes were in very 'strict' lecture format which surprised me since we were told day #1 that this would be more of a seminar. I assumed this meant it would be more interactive. Even the second half of the course was not very interactive. The whole course was basically the prof talking.The course should have focused on basic issues that are faced in risk assessment, current issues in risk assessments (how come we didn't talk about the debates going on with plastics?), and the BASICS of exposure modeling.I think the MTBE debate was a good exercise overall and got us all to discuss the issues with each other. This course needs to be made more interactive.",
    "I would have preferred a quantitative methods course to learn the actual risk modeling. While I now know a lot of pertinent risk assessment definitions, it will be worthless to my career. If you are going to teach risk analysis, teach risk analysis. Give us a concrete skill set to use professionally, not an analytical frame of reference. It is the least you could do with our tuition.",
    "yuck. vocab class and not enjoyable at all.",
    "This course was helpful in providing a foundation for the qualitative understanding of risk assessment. It might be helpful to discuss more quantitative topics and apply this quantitative skills.",
    "I enjoyed it very much. I think that the real-world applicability of the skills learned was very important. I think that during the last month of the class we should have had similar assignments to the MTBE Risk Assessment, perhaps not as long and potentially with just one or two groups presenting and then students in the audience asking questions. The more practice, the better. The readings were appropriate.",
    "Notes are great, process of going through the actual risk assessments was very helpful. However the beginning was a little tough (although, I am not sure we could do the end without the beginning....)"

    "Instructor: Jonathan Borak \u00a0I had trouble with the lecturing style - I feel that in every other class at EPH, my professors have worked to make lectures inclusive of students, whether through questions or discussions. In this class, lectures were purely lectures, and were often repetitive.I also disliked Jonathan's swearing in his lectures - I found it unprofessional and disrespectful.",
    "Instructor: Jonathan Borak \u00a0Too verbose. Spoke way too much. Although participation was \"encouraged,\" it really wasn't incorporated into Dr Borak's lectures and therefore the classes were more of just lectures at us rather than discussions with us.",
    "Instructor: Jonathan Borak \u00a0Jonathan is still one of the better lecturers. Overuse of powerpoint, is my only complaint and that applies to all instructors.",
    "Instructor: Jonathan Borak \u00a0Long winded. super bright guy and really passionate about what he does.",
    "Instructor: Jonathan Borak \u00a0The instructor was an excellent, charismatic lecturer and did a good job of enlivening the subject material.",
    "Instructor: Jonathan Borak \u00a0I think that Prof Borak did a great job. I think that it is a tough task to instruct on how real-world skills are gained in the classroom, but that he did as good a job as could be expected. I enjoyed his very realistic portrayal on how these things worked and feel that I walked away with real skills."

   "comments": [
    "No, I would not recommend this course to another student. I don't feel that I learned much from it, besides memorized definitions that will probably be forgotten since they weren't applied.",
    "The course is great if you are interested in understanding risk assessments.",
    "I would not recommend it. Too detailed for what could have been an interesting \"introduction\" to risk assessment. Lectures were hard to follow. Only when studying for the final and reviewing the powerpoint slides did I feel like I could start to understand the lecture material.",
    "do not take this unless you really like risk assessment. you have no idea how you are doing in the class. if you are not interested in the topic it is soo boring. bring coffee!",
    "This course is useful in obtaining a foundational understanding of the process of risk assessment. I would recommend it to develop the vocabulary and background knowledge needed to read risk assessments.",
    "Yes, I would recommend it to another student. It is a course which requires students to realize that there is not always a right answer and presents some skills which will be useful in the real-world.",
    "By the end of the course everything comes together, so if you can get through the first half , the second half is worth it!"
