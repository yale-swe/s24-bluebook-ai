   "comments": [
    "This course is a fantastic overview of the effects of stigma on health. Getting to pick a stigma to work with throughout the semester fun, interesting, informative, and valuable. Highly recommend the class.",
    "The course material is incredibly engaging, and I love being able to look at all the concepts through the lens of the stigma of greatest interest to me. However, it is A LOT of work, and having homework due each Monday rather than the Wednesday of class makes it very difficult to manage, and I was very stressed during the semester trying to meet these deadlines. Additionally, the multiple in-class presentations were meaningless given the time constraints. I felt that it wasn't fair to force us to prepare 4 or 5 minute presentations on such complex topics (that often we had a great deal of personal interest or investment in) and dilute them to a few slides. I either would have wanted a large time slot to really teach my classmates about my stigma of interest, or just not presented at all.",
    "strengths: lots of great studies, dr. pachankis very knowledgable, choose own stigma to study rather than assigned one, some of the weekly assignments help to prepare for final paper weakness: weekly assignments, ta's approach to grading homework, debates improvement: tone it back with all the different things to a few instead of all (or just eliminate the debate because it felt random): weekly assignments, 1 debate involvement, 1 leading discussion, 3-4 readings a week and a final paper",
    "This was an excellent course - one of the best I've taken.",
    "Strengths: The material was very interesting, the course was well organized, the readings were interesting and always relevant, there were a variety of assignments to explore the class material from essays, to presentations and debates, we had the chance to pick and follow one subtopic we were most interested in Weaknesses: Load was heavier than I expected especially the weekly papers which were 1-2 pages single-spaced that required completing and referring to the reading.",
    "Stigma and Health was an interesting course, and a very comprehensive introduction to the complex topic of stigma. I found the course to be a good mix of theory and implementation efforts. I did feel that the course was a lot of work--the weekly assignments required quite a bit of time and thought, though I did find them helpful in engaging with the week's material. One change I would make would be in the final paper. I think that using the rigid, 10-section structure was a bit constraining, and I think that the entire paper could have been about a proposed intervention that was then explored through the lens of the topics and theories explored in class. I would have liked more flexibility so that the paper would be an application of course themes rather than an explication of the literature with a proposal closer to the end.",
    "This was a great course and we learned almost everything there is to learn about stigma. I also loved how we got to focus our whole semester on one stigma that was of interest to us. This really tied everything together and helped solidify the concepts we learned in class. It also helped with writing the final paper (since many of the short essays written during the course could be utilized in the final paper). Overall the class was set up really well and the assignments were meaningful, professor and TF were so knowledgable and helpful, and class was very engaging. My only major critique is that this class required SO MUCH WORK. The amount of work and assignments and debates and new articles discussions, etc. we had to do for this class was a little overboard compared to other YSPH classes. I'm not saying they weren't meaningful and good assignments, there were just like 5 too many.",
    "This course was a lot of work, but I'm really glad I took it, as it ignited some new areas of interest for me. I sometimes found the assignments cumbersome, as the readings were pretty time-consuming and writing a good essay took a lot of thought, but I realized that my investment in the individual assignments really paid off both in lecture and when preparing for the final paper. I liked that this class had a more theoretical approach than some of my other classes, but it did feel intimidating at times, as it often took awhile to process the information and readings presented. It was also sometimes intimidating to speak up in class, both because the material was sometimes challenging to grapple with, and because some students seemed to dominate the conversation. The best part of this class was that we got to pick a stigmatized identity to follow and research throughout the course. I was so excited to pick an identity that I was genuinely interested in, and I really enjoyed writing the final paper, to see all of my thinking and research come together. My one complaint is that it sometimes took several weeks for assignments to be returned to us, which was frustrating as I like having feedback before submitting additional assignments so that I can avoid making the same mistakes in multiple assignments. I didn't love the debates, because they were an exceptional amount of work in addition to all of the work we had to do, but I can concede that they were a useful exercise. I really enjoyed the weekly discussions of stigma in the news, as it was a very important exercise for grounding stigma concepts in real-world events.",
    "The course is really good at giving students a in depth understanding of stigma and its various effects. It is difficult initially to understand what is wanted in the weekly responses, by the end of the term it is a lot more intuitive.",
    "This is a really good, comprehensive overview of stigma. It could benefit from more interactive activities to break up the lectures.",
    "The course was amazing in exposing us to the framework of stigma and its effects on health, as well as the varying intersections with other forms of public health. We were able to cover a comprehensive understanding of both stigma and the ecological model, as well as other aspects of social and behavioral sciences that affect health overall. The class was fundamental to both my career directions as well as foundational to my understanding of public health overall.",
    "Stigma and Health was a worthwhile course, but the workload was so intense that the professor and the teaching assistant had trouble keeping up with the material presented in class. Several adjustments had to be made to the syllabus throughout. The memoir portion of the class was the weakest element and it took away from the study of stigma instead of adding to it, particularly because we did not include the memoir in our final projects. Less information should be included in the course to improve the quality.",
    "Interesting topic; wish there was more discussion",
    "The course was great. I loved that we were able to apply the class to a topic of interest, but I wish we had more time to choose a topic. I felt like mine was too broad, and that felt like an issue for me throughout the semester. I also felt like the presentations were a little repetitive.",
    "Strengths: - I feel that I gained a very strong background in stigma and health theory thanks to this course. - Stigma is a highly relevant topic to many health issues. The theoretical foundation provided a unique framework for understanding and assessing these issues in ways that I hadn't considered before. - Weekly assignments allow you to apply main ideas from weekly readings to a stigma that you choose to research throughout the semester. It is thanks to these assignments that I was able to delve deep into the topic. Weaknesses: - Weekly assignments require you to draw from all readings from that week. Sometimes, not all readings applied to the stigma of my choice. Applying those readings to my stigma, while necessary for the assignment, felt too forced at times. Perhaps one suggestion for the weekly assignments would be to give students more flexibility with regard to which ones they choose to use for reflections. - A good portion of the research papers we read were based on the LBTQ stigma or mental health stigma. Would have liked to have seen more literature on other stigmas if they are available."

   "comments": [
    "Instructor: John Pachankis \u00a0Great lecturer, great feedback.",
    "Instructor: John Pachankis \u00a0John is a wonderful, deliberate, knowledgeable, and thoughtful lecturer. I enjoyed hearing his perspectives and learning from him throughout the semester.",
    "Instructor: John Pachankis \u00a0strength: very approachable, very knowledgable weakness: can get a little dry at times",
    "Instructor: John Pachankis \u00a0Prof Pachankis really made the lectures engaging. He also was very supportive of questions and helpful in making comments on my assignments. I was nervous taking the class as an undergrad, but Prof Pachankis made me feel totally welcome and confident in the course.",
    "Instructor: John Pachankis \u00a0Dr. Pachankis was an excellent instructor. He was clearly passionate both about the content of the course and about teaching. Dr. Pachankis was always incredibly prepared for lectures (far more prepared than most professors). He communicated material effectively and encouraged student participation. He put *a lot* of thought into all of the assignments and into provided individualized feedback on each one. I appreciated how much work he put into the course syllabus, which included detailed rubrics for every assignment, laid out learning goals and expectations, and provided links to outside resources for help with writing. I also loved how the syllabus included this message: \"For those of you who rarely contribute verbally to class discussions: Challenge yourself to step outside your comfort zone. If you need to discuss with me any issue related to your ability to participate, please come see me and we can discuss this.\"",
    "Instructor: John Pachankis \u00a0Professor Pachankis was a engaging lecturer and his work was really interesting. He was always willing to meet one-on-one and provide feedback or answer questions. His class lectures sometimes felt a bit separate from the readings though",
    "Instructor: John Pachankis \u00a0I thought Dr. Pachankis was a fantastic instructor--he presented complex material in a thoughtful and engaging way. He made sure that our understanding of stigma was grounded in cross-disciplinary literature and he brought much of his own experience working in the field to the course. I appreciated his insights and felt like he facilitated meaningful and productive discussions of course topics.",
    "Instructor: John Pachankis \u00a0Such a great professor. Really cares about his students and is always willing to answer questions after class or over email (very responsive). Very good a facilitating meaningful and engaging discussion with class.",
    "Instructor: John Pachankis \u00a0I really enjoyed Prof. Pachankis' lecture style and feedback on my homework assignments. He did an excellent job of breaking down tough concepts throughout the class and laid out very compelling arguments for the importance of considering stigma is all public health work. I think his research is especially fascinating and important, and I sometimes wished he would spend a bit more time talking about the projects that he was working on and relating them to class concepts. I think in a theoretical class like this, it's very important to ground the theory in a lot of observational and experimental research, and he did a very thorough job of linking theory with observed phenomena.",
    "Instructor: John Pachankis \u00a0Dr. Pachankis is very knowledgeable about the subject, he can be a bit strict with deadlines and punctuation, which isn't bad rather different from many other professors.",
    "Instructor: John Pachankis \u00a0John is clearly brilliant and takes time to lecture and answer questions thoroughly and thoughtfully. His passion for the topic shows in every lecture.",
    "Instructor: John Pachankis \u00a0Professor Pachankis was an amazing professor and seemed to care deeply about the subject matter. He was flexible around our choices for the stigma to be studied and pushed us to learn more and invest in the subject matter. He made the class more rigorous than other courses at YSPH and subsequently we were able to learn much more. I greatly enjoyed his teaching style and believe he was an amazing professor. He was strict about due dates, probably necessarily, and held us to a high standard which helped us to develop professionally as well.",
    "Instructor: John Pachankis \u00a0Professor Pachankis is definitely passionate about the study of stigma, but there were too many moving parts in his course.",
    "Instructor: John Pachankis \u00a0Dr. Pachankis is extremely knowledgeable about the topic.",
    "Instructor: John Pachankis \u00a0Dr. Pachankis is very knowledgeable and was always open to hearing what students had to say."

   "comments": [
    "Take this course if you are interested in how social circumstances influence health on the population and individual level. Requires writing and public speaking.",
    "lots of weekly work with a professor who is very passionate about his work i would not recommend this class unless this is your passion and you want to go into research because the amount of weekly work is excessive between the 3-4 readings\/week, weekly class assignments, a debate and leading a discussion is excessive when this is not your passion or you have no interest in research",
    "This is everything you could know about stigma. You are going to understand stigma so well. I would recommend this to anyone (including undergrads) who studies health disparities or social injustice in general because this course will give you a solid theoretical background to approach those problems.",
    "This is a great course! I'd highly recommend it.",
    "CDE 581 is a very interesting class to explore stigma and disadvantage very comprehensively from structural to individual levels. It covers a lot of material but never feels overwhelming. All the topics and lectures were very fascinating. I highly recommend.",
    "I would recommend this course to someone who has a particular population of interest in their studies of public health so that they can better understand how stigma may influence this population's health. I do think that coming into the course with a focus\/area of interest is important since a bulk of the work revolves around the chosen identity or characteristic. I found the course to be a bit more theoretical that health-based, but I think it unearthed useful insights regarding health that would be important to understand for anyone working with or planning to work with vulnerable populations.",
    "Great course! It's really nice to focus on your topic of choice and really get to know the literature and how stigma affects that population over the course of the semester. This class is just so much work, so be careful not to overload your semester with work.",
    "If you're prepared to work hard, I highly recommend this class. The material is engaging, and you have ample opportunities to relate the concepts to topics that interest you.",
    "I would recommend it if you truly would like a good understanding of stigma, you have to be willing to put in the work at least 5 hours a week in my opinion.",
    "This is a theory-based, lecture-heavy course on stigma. You have the ability to focus extra attention on any stigmatized identity of interest (granted you can successfully argue it meets the definition of stigma). I recommend it!",
    "Stigma and health was a course designed to push students to understand underlying aspects of healthcare which aren't conceived of or referenced as often as they should be. It highlights aspects of our work which can be bettered and allows us to reach for ways of improvement of both patient and community health, looking to multiple levels of the healthcare system to work against stigma and achieve better health outcomes. The course was invaluable and will help to inform every form of public health work.",
    "You will enjoy learning about the population health impact of stigma, but you will be overwhelmed. Do not spend a great deal of time on the required memoir as it will not inform much of your education in the course.",
    "This course focuses on an important public health topic and you get to explore a stigma of your interest. It is very reading and writing heavy.",
    "Stigma is such an important and pertinent topic to public health, and Dr. Pachankis does a good job of ensuring that students have a strong foundation to facilitate future research and dialogue on the topic. I highly recommend taking this course. There is a lot of work involved in comparison to the other courses I took this semester, but you will get a lot out of it."
