    "Great Class!",
    "A good introduction into the subject. A lot of the derivations were very helpful to understand where the formulas originated from. I would of liked to spend a little less of the class discussing papers and a little more covering the fundamentals of martingales.",
    "Strengths: Prof. Ma's ability to dynamically answer questions; the lectures were always really clear and well-prepared; Prof. Ma lectured on both \"classical\" survival techniques but also incorporated \"hot topics\" and recent work in the field; all major theory was explained well, class was a lot of fun!Weaknesses: I didn't love the textbook. Lectures were great, but textbook was difficult to read\/study.",

I appreciated his commitment to dynamic learning -- when the class was particularly interested\/confused by something, we slowed down and enjoyed\/figured out the material.Prof. Ma has taught me so much. He is my favorite professor at Yale. He is a wonderful teacher and works very hard to teach well.",
