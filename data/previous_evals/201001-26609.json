    "Very organized and coherent. I would have preferred more lectures from Carter as he is so good at it.",
    "The three short writing assignments helped Carter to understand my writing style and architectural perspective.",
    "The course was dedicated to the study of biographies of the most prominent modern architects, as well as the research on the factors that led to rise or decline of their careers.The course challenged the student to formulate their own criteria for evaluating the architectural product, based on analysis of the works of notable critics.The syllabus was structured around intensive reading assignments, discussions, and writing.Short paper writing assignments were given in the beginning of the course in order to gear up the students for the extensive final paper.In all, the way the class was set up proved very effective to me. I could witness progress of my critical writing from the first short paper to the final research.",
    "The gradual progression of the course from the early response papers to the final paper was very beneficial. The sequence of the writing assignments was essential to overcoming writer\u0092s block - the first three assignments asked us to establish a set of criteria for evaluating architecture, which we later deployed in developing our longer writing assignment, and often referred to within our in-class discussions.",
    "The readings were interesting and relevant to the discussion of architectural quality, evaluation, etc. The three straightforward assignments (\"What Makes a Good Building,\" \"A Building I Like,\" and \"A Building I Dislike\"), as well as the final essay, helped me both to create my own criteria in judging architectural quality, and to refine my writing technique. I was able to complete the essays on time and to a high standard, as they were not overly demanding and were spaced evenly through the term. Bravo."

   "comments": [
    "I expected to become a more adequate writer, to expand my knowledge and opinion of the standards we should hold architecture to. I believe these expectations were met.",
    "As expected, this course helped build my confidence in my writing abilities.",
    "I envisioned this course as an opportunity to improve my writing skills and try to come up with my own, well formulated criteria for evaluating the design work.The body of critical reading we went through, as well as the discussions and writings we have done significantly improved quality of my writing and helped me set up standards for the professional criticism.",
    "I expected more instruction in regards to structured writing and research techniques.",
    "I had thought that this course would focus on the careers of a limited set of architects, focusing on their backgrounds, career trajectories, and the influence of criticism on their professional careers. Instead, this course dealt broadly with a far larger number of contemporary and twentieth-century architects. We spoke of trends more than burrowing into the particulars, and let the discussion accommodate information and questions that students brought to the table. This was a broader scope than I had originally anticipated.",
    "I took the course in order to improve my writing skills, and I now feel much more confident putting pen to paper."

   "comments": [
    "This course was very valuable to me as I believe we come to graduate school to expand our skill base in all areas involving architecture.",
    "This course is so important. Architecture isn\u0092t all about design and theory, Carter has helped me to understand how to represent myself and my ideas.",
    "I\u0092d long been wondering what makes an architect successful. And one thing that confused me was that I knew a lot of very talented architects who were never to become famous.This course indeed revealed some \u0093secret\u0094 rules of successful career and provided a very exciting knowledge of how architects progressed to become iconic figures.",
    "I found the course valuable in developing the ability to critically evaluate architecture through short texts.",
    "I feel that this course helped me become a better writer through the series of early writing assignments. Their quick succession and their reasonable scope and length allowed us to focus our energy on thinking through the prompts to present well-formulated arguments. The set of values that we established in those responses for discussing architecture will be very helpful moving forward with my education. Also, the final research paper made me aware of a trend in architecture that I had hitherto been unaware of.",
    "I think this is a very valuable course. It's important for architecture students to be straightforward regarding their \"design intent,\" and writing is the most effective way of forming a clear plan of action."

   "comments": [
    "Carter presents in such a clear and inspiring way. He sets up the course so that you never feel overwhelmed you spend the time warming up with three short papers and then working on your master paper in phases. This is a much better approach and I believe you take much more away from it as a student than courses such as the theory course where a large paper is dumped on the students at the end. The process is important and Carter embraces that.",
    "Carter is an amazing teacher and wonderful lecturer.",
    "I greatly enjoyed working with Professor Wiseman.There are two things that were especially helpful to me: the way Mr. Wiseman led the discussions, a very insightful and, sometimes, provocative manner. And also, the ideas I was suggested to develop in my final paper, really rendered it a valuable and a meaningful piece.",
    "Carter Wiseman was wonderful. His criticism of our writing throughout the semester was constructive and tremendously beneficial. Reading other students\u0092 papers and discussing the writing in class was extremely helpful as well.We had one TA, Lauren, who organized the readings and helped with the administrative duties at the onset of the semester. Although there were not enough students for Lauren to continue to act at a TA for the course, she made the first couple of weeks of the semester less stressful for Professor Wiseman and for us students.",
    "Carter is a great teacher. Very friendly, very knowledgeable, and genuinely interested in students' intellectual and personal development. He also has very realistic expectations about how much work we can produce in a seminar course."
