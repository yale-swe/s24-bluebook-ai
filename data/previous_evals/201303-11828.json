   "comments": [
    "You learn various relief and intaglio processes. It's a lot of technical content over the course of the semester that may not leave much room for aesthetic development.",
    "I would summarize the course as a good introduction to printmaking and would definitely recommend it to another student. You don't learn any one method particularly in depth, but you get to explore a variety of techniques, which is great.",
    "I would highly recommend! Most of the work can be done in class--I probably only had to come in once or twice for each of our projects. (Can't remember how many of them there were...4 or 5?) I knew nothing about printmaking before this class, but now I'm in love with it! There's a big learning curve. After your first 2 projects or so, you'll feel pretty comfortable making prints.",
    "TAKE THIS COURSE, even if you are not majoring in art. It will change the way you approach other mediums and creative\/critical processes. However, keep in mind that like other studio classes it is a big time commitment; it was often difficult to complete all projects within the designated class period time.",
    "Great class. Can be used to further already established interests in other work or other mediums. There are general outlines for projects, but you could basically do whatever you wanted."
