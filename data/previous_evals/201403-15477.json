Course was an introduction to some major trends in intellectual thought from mid-century... Super helpful for people who study 20th century American literature and culture to become familiar with Friedman, Goffman, Rawls, Lynch, etc"

    "it exposed me to a variety of frameworks relating to the emergence of postmodernism in different fields, art history, linguistics, media, and sociology.",
    "I definitely have a better sense of what postmodern intellectual history might look like, a new sense of what a more exciting historicism might look like... I enjoy JD's sensibility \/ approach to texts very much... the melding of history, theory, sociology, intellectual history, and really good readings of films, novels, works of art, all with the same sort of critical distance and sense of curiosity and fun... definitely an attractive model to try to imitate"
