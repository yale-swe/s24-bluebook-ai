    "I would, it helps you learn to write and argue a certain way, and I think this will be helpful in the future.",
    "Fantastic course for anyone interested in economics, government, or even morality (or the intersection of any of the above-listed areas). Professor Donahue is a great guy and class time flies by. Easily the best seminar that I've taken at Yale. It's not too much work, and no busy work at all. In other words, there are no assignments that you feel like you're not learning anything from.",
    "An absolutely essential course for students interested in comparisons of capitalism with rival economic systems. The course consisted of masterfully selected readings that draw on great thinkers and modern scholars. We covered well-known economic and political writers as diverse as Mill, Marx, Friedman, and Hayek, as well as modern writers Przeworski, Lindblom, Satz, and Dahl. Though illuminating on their own, these writings were profitably expounded upon in class discussions which Professor Donahue guided with an expert understanding of the texts and their implications for capitalism. Students contributed much to these discussions, as we were encouraged to offer our personal applications of these texts to contemporary analyses of capitalism and economic systems in general. The course offered a lens consisting of philosophical, economic, and political theories that are essential in considering the strengths and weaknesses of capitalism. I strongly recommend this course to anyone with even a cursory interest in the intersection of capitalism, ethics, and politics.",
    "Take it",
    "I would not recommend this course. Donahue is not a very exciting professor, and makes one of the most dynamic debates in modern political theory seem fairly analytical and boring. Find a better EP&E class.",
    "It was a good class. The readings were interesting and thought provoking. In class we often only talked about one of the readings though or even just the first part of one of the readings because we would get caught up in it. We could spend an hour and a half on 5-10 pages and then have almost no time for anything else. I think Professor Donahue should work on that for subsequent years.",
    "I would recommend the course. The reading is informative, relevant, and interesting and the discussions are great.",
    "Yes--it provides a forum to learn more and voice opinions on the operation of markets.",
    "I thought it was a wonderful class that truly pushed me to think deeper about alternatives to existing model of capitalism.",
    "This course MUST be mandatory for any student, provided Thomas Donahue teaches it. Indeed, it might not be the same class at all if the teacher changes. If not than this should definitely be mandatory."
