   "comments": [
    "It's a great class, the logical extension of French L1. If you take it take it with Skorupa because lets face it, she's the best. Trust me, you'll have fun, and without even realizing it you'll realize you can actually form coherent sentences in French. You also might have to study a little, it can get a little tricky at times, but never bad.",
    "I would recommend it to people who know what they are getting into: a whole lot of work, if they are doing it right. Many hours of homework per week, which is fairly rigorously checked. But my french skills have come a long way.",
    "It's a lot of work and you should dedicate yourself to learning French -- it will make the course much easier. Skorupa is one of the best -- she really makes learning French fun. She cares for her students and even bakes for the class. Wonderful course",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. Be prepared though, it is a lot of work.",
    "I don't know why anyone would take L2 French if they don't have to for a requirement, so if you have to take it just do it, you'll be glad you did. It's not that bad.",
    "I would recommend French 121 to a fellow student because you learn a lot that will help along the way to learning the language. It is a very grammar based class and can be challenging at times but I feel that I learned a lot that I will carry with me to L3 French.",
    "A lot of work, but it is worthwhile work. FIA is quite fun and a great way to learn.",
    "I would recommend this course for students who had some knowledge in French, but do not feel too confident to take a Level 2 or Level 3 course. It covers the basics, as well as the material from Level 2. The course is really fast paced, so be prepared to be studying every night to be current with the material. Overall a great course, especially with Candace Skorupa.",
    "Solid intermediate French class with emphasis on listening to conversational French through the French in Action series.",
    "French 121 is a good intro-level French class for someone who has very little experience with French. It is a lot of work and it meets every morning but if you are willing to work at it you will gain skills in French extremely quickly. The class is taught entirely in French, and this immersion makes students quickly become comfortable understanding the language. I would highly recommend this class to students who are committed to working to improve at French.",
    "Yes! The class is fun and interactive, but my French still drastically improved."
