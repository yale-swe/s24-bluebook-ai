    "Each class was a student led discussion on papers we read before class. No new materials were learned and the instructors did not lecture. Hard to learn new things when you read the papers before class then just talked about them all class period every week.",
    "This course was extremely valuable in gaining a holistic understanding of a system. It took a little while to get into a good flow, probably because the students had such diverse interests. However, it was a rare and very practical opportunity to learn each other's areas of interest because it led to a more complete understanding of the environment we were looking at; one where the physical, biosphysical, and social are inextricably linked like any other. The fieldwork and background readings were very useful."

    "The field trip was amazing. redeeming part of the class.",

    "Contextualizing material through field trip and continuing to work with topics post-trip ; group connections it facilitated",
    "The trip was very insightful and the readings were interesting. I particularly enjoyed the discussions.",
    "The course was a very thorough exploration of small island land development and the impacts of this. The field trip ensured that we had a very thorough appreciation for and understanding of the impacts of development on the Roatan community. I learnt a significant amount during this course, but not exactly what I had expected to learn.",
    "The field trip!",
    "Very responsive professors, a tight network of peers that developed among the class with the potential to collaborate in the future, and an eye-opening and well-rounded, respectful field trip",
    "The field trip is rather enlightening. The instructors each have their own interests and specialities, but are open to student who have different interests from theirs."

   "comments": [
    "Dont just do lit reviews every week. we are there to learn not just talk about 2 papers we read before class.",
    "Class discussion focused very closely on specific papers we read each week. Some of those papers were fascinating and provided very useful information, while others were less engaging or seemed less fundamental, especially when presented by fellow classmates. Perhaps a few minutes of lecture by the instructors to put the class topic in context would benefit some weeks' discussions. Overall, though, the readings built off each other well.",
    "Group meetings night before on trip detailing plan for next day; perhaps heighten mix of material covered by professors and material covered by students",
    "The class felt almost entirely like a student run discussion, it would be nice to have had more instruction from Gabe and Mary Beth, since their lectures were fantastic and insightful. Maybe it would be better to have them lead more of the discussions or lecture more often.",
    "I would have preferred a little more lecturing from instructors and a little less student led discussion. The student discussions were very interesting and very helpful but weighted a little heavily towards student presentations instead of instructor presentations.",
    "Information from several visits during the field trip was repetitive. A lot of the materials RMP and BICA presented had already been covered in class. Instead, there could have been more open discussion and Q&A, just like the night when the Polo Water engineer (sorry I forgot his name) came. In the future the field trip could have featured more stakeholders, such as local school teachers\/students, fishers, and local residents of other industries (e.g. construction workers).",
    "Because this was the first year that the class took place on Roatan, there are a lot of directions it can go. If we can figure out a way to build on past research, and to work with local people from different fields (both scientific and social science) to make the student projects relevant and useful to local people, it would be fantastic."

   "comments": [
    "Good ties between material covered and field work over trip",
    "In-class reading discussions could be better facilitated and structured. Oftentimes the discussion would be dominated by a handful of people who are more interested or had more experience in the topic. Very often would the discussion digress from the core information of the readings into superficial or peripheral topics and irrelevant anecdotal accounts. In the future this could be improved by asking the presenter to first give a short, 15-20 min summary of the papers, and then go around the room inviting each student ask one question about the papers for others to answer\/discuss, before going to open and general discussions on the topic of the day."
