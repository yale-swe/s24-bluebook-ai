    "sure I will",
    "Cell Bio 602 is a basic cell bio course that essentially covers the same material as a basic undergrad cell bio class, except that is shoves more information down your throat in the form of specific details than you can possibly remember or understand. I would not recommend the class to another student because you essentially come away from the class with the same knowledge as from an undergrad course with the additional confusion from irrelevant details.",
    "I would definitely not take it as an undergrad. Overall, the class was medium and the exam questions were not always relevant to material covered in class.",
    "Overall I found Cell bio 602 a very excellent course definitely worth taking if you have never had any cell bio classes and are doing anything related to the biological\/biomedical sciences. The classes may seem tough at first but you will find yourself easing into it as the semester progresses and at the end of the course you come away feeling empowered with knowledge of how the cell works!!!!",
    "Ultimately, although I enjoyed many of the lectures, I don't agree with the general premise of this course --- to get all students up to a basic level of knowledge on cell biology. A lot of the information went in one ear and out the other. I think a more valuable strategy would be to have short courses (apx. a month) on a specific topic - i.e. for Madri - the ECM; in which all class sessions would present literature on one topic. While this would be more detailed, the details would be relevant because in a month a student could become critically engaged with the topic. A class that I would prefer would be:-literature based-more focused on methods; as this is an area that I feel that me and my classmates are interested in improving our knowledge-based on analysis of findings, results, future directions in field",
    "This course provides an introduction to a wide range of topics in the fields of molecular and cellular biology. While lectures provide a brief glimpse into the expertise of each faculty member, the opportunity for developing deeper understanding comes in the form of suggested readings in each topic. I would highly recommend this subject to any student in the biological sciences, whether they intend to pursue a career studying molecular and cellular processes or not, because the topics discussed in the course are of vital importance in maintaining life as we know it.",
    "Summary: excellent course for people interested in cell biology, or wanting a foundation in important molecular concepts.Yes I would recommend it if they are interested in cell biology.",
    "I will recommend this course to students who are interesting in molecular and cellular biology simply because this is the course that can give one basic knowledge of MCB.",
    "Good lecture course and summary.",
    "I would recommend Cell Bio 602 to another student. I would tell them to take notes during the lectures and begin the exams as soon as they are assigned because they are very time consuming."

   "question_text": "How did this course deepen your knowledge of your discipline\/profession? To what extent did this course contribute to your dissertation\/research?",
   "comments": [
    "This course did not deepen my knowledge of the discipline, as I took away from the class generally what I already had learned from my undergrad cell bio class. Similarly, this course did not contribute to my research either.",
    "It gave me a general overview of cell biology.",
    "My background is in organism and population biology. Prior to taking this course, I was becoming very interested in studying biological phenomena at cellular and sub-cellular levels, in order to gain a more comprehensive understanding of what drives the processes I had studied. This course really opened my eyes to the breadth of the sub-cellular field, and confirmed my desire to pursue a doctoral degree in molecular and cellular biology.",
    "Not particularly relevant but some parts will be useful",
    "I don't think I learned that much more in this class that what I had already learned before.",
    "This course help me gain a better idea of molecular mechanism in cell events. Though I am not working on MCB, this course definitely help me develop a good ability of thinking and generating new ideas. Fabulous course!",
    "It helped me know what research is out there in the department.",
    "Since I already have a background in this Cell Bio, I found this class to be a very good way to enrich my previous knowledge in my discipline."
