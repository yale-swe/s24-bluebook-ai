    "I've never taken an art history course before so this class was very enlightening regarding the movements and the techniques that are evident in pieces of art, especially works that I have seen in museums before. I definitely gained some skill in visual analysis and understanding of how art is engrained into history as a timeline of culture and the people's responses to it.",
    "This class does a good job of teaching you how to visual analyze art. Focuses on the formal techniques rather than simple facts",
    "I learned about the major artistic trends and movements in the early 20th century, read important texts and learned about people's interpretations of some seminal works in history.",
    "The course was about 20th century art.",
    "I developed my visual analysis skills and ability to memorize formal analysis of artworks. Additionally, I learned a lot more than I previously knew about how the politics of the time influence a given piece of art.",
    "looking at different kinds of art in relation to arts from different movements and time periods. Critical thinking and analysis, drawing comparisons between works.",
    "This class really made me think about the relationship between art and the world in a way I hadn't done before. I learned how to look at paintings closely, and especially how to look at artworks in comparison to each other. Lots of interesting info on European social movements in the early 20th century, too.",
    "I learned a tremendous amount about the artworks covered in this course. I also learned how to read and interpret art history scholarship which can be very dense.",
    "My expertise on 20th C. modern art feels much stronger- the course was in depth with its studies. My analysis of conceptual art is also much stronger, especially with the solid historical contextualization the course offered.",
    "This was the first art history course I had taken at Yale, and I learned so much. The course really does a great job of expanding student's art history literacy and introducing students to artworks in the canon of early 20th century art.",
    "I learned a ton about various movements in modern art, and I also learned how to write about art and analyze different kinds of art critically.",
    "I was introduced to an array of artists and art movements. I also learned how to analyze and examine art pieces from the early twentieth century.",
    "I feel more able to discuss fine art; I feel that I could confidently walk into an art gallery and have some sense of what to look for\/at in works.",
    "This was an amazing survey class of early 20th century art",
    "I came in totally illiterate in understanding art, and I can now genuinely say that I can walk into a museum and have some semblance of appreciation of art! I also have a very survey-level understanding of the progression of artists in the late 19th\/early 20th century and how different artistic movements developed. I am very happy with the introduction to art history that I gained from this class.",
    "Despite the title of the class being early 20th century art, it also includes a lot of late 19th century art (manet, monet, gaugin, degas) and focuses only on western\/European art.",
    "I knew a bit of the material from modernism and modernity but most of it was totally new! I had a ton of fun.",
    "I learned so much in this course. I learned about art of the early 20th century, as well as about just general history of that time. I also learned how to read academic papers a lot more thoroughly, as well as how to discuss things more intellectually. This course really had me push my boundaries in thought, more so than I've experienced thus far.",
    "I gained a very comprehensive knowledge of the early 20th century art across Europe and the Americas and how they all fit in with respect to one another and the sociocultural implications.",
    "How to formally analyze an artwork, modern art concepts.",
    "It is a great detailed course about early 20th century art",
    "I expanded my knowledge of pieces and artists from the early twentieth century, and also feel a lot stronger in my ability to analyze and draw meaning from pieces of art in new ways.",
    "This course provided an engaging overview of the major artists of the title period. I have a new appreciation for modern art that I expect to carry with me long after leaving Yale.",
    "General knowledge of European art movements in the early twentieth century and common themes across different artists. Skills: Learned how to look and talk about art",
    "!A: fantastic CREDIT\/D. The students: You got your washed up seniors, SORORITY girls (think theta phly with pi phi), and male econ majors on one hand, and then your diligent sophomore history of art majors who are heavily invested on the other hand. Interesting mix. THE WORKLOAD: as a credit\/d you just cram the decades, titles, and artists of the slide list the day before for the midterm and final. You have that and then a paper which is not that bad. THE CONTENT: fascinating and APPROACHABLE. this was my first HSAR class and I'm glad I took THIS over the survey courses which are *NOT AS GOOD!*. THE PROFESSOR: zeidler is really interesting. his interpretations and lecturing style is phenomenal. I also like his lisp and the way he pronounces r's as w's. FINAL THOUGHTS: really interesting and you can learn a lot if you go to lecture and take diligent notes. DON'T DO THE READING you don't need to as a credit\/d.",
    "On the first day, Zeidler leaps into an intriguing comparison between a self-portrait by Albrecht Durer and a self-portrait by Pablo Picasso. He observes poignant details, delineates differences in stylistic elements, and orchestrates illuminating moments when the two paintings come into conversation. Undergirding this whole exercise, however, Zeidler begins to introduce the course's central question: How did the world of art transition into modernity during the early twentieth-century? Of course, through the semester, the answer becomes increasingly more complex, and even the question more nuanced. But at every turn Zeidler works to navigate the ruptures with tradition, tangents of anti-modernism, and revolutionary acts conducted by the course heroes (Manet, Monet, Gauguin, Rodin, Matisse, Brancusi, Picasso, Picasso, Duchamp, the Futurist, the Russian Avant Garde, and the Surrealists). Yes, I mentioned Picasso twice. In all, HSAR 323 provides a well-executed diagnosis of a crucial period of art history.",
    "A more thoughtful way of looking at art with an eye to history and social change."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The lectures are fantastic, I wouldn't change a thing. If there's anything that could be improved it's the length of the lectures--they're too short!",
    "Good class with engaging lectures, sometimes the analysis can be far-fetched, but overall good",
    "The lectures are super interesting and engaging at the start of the semester. As the semester progresses, it gets harder but no less interesting. And sections are perfect.",
    "Professor Zeidler is a great professor and did a good job with his lectures. The readings were inaccessible.",
    "Could be improved by holding selected number of sections in the art gallery to observe works in person. Could cover a wider range of artists.",
    "Strengths Tests - Straightforward and not too bad. You can probably tell which artworks will be tested on which parts of the test based on how much time Zeidler spends on them. Lectures - Always interesting, always informative, always includes a moment when Zeidler says something in a funny way Weaknesses Readings - These were incorporated into the lectures well, but I never knew how deeply we needed to read them. Some readings are RIDICULOUSLY dense, which is why often no one in our section read them. Lectures - Timelines for each movement can get messy at the end of it all. Would have loved some clarification on how each relates to each other.",
    "This course did an incredible job of providing information on individual paintings and how they related to earlier works. However, we did not talk very much about the relation between artistic movements.",
    "I think the course title is somewhat misleading because much of the class is actually from the late 19th century and because the title implies that it is a survey course. It seemed like the class was half survey half an exploration of specific themes through this time period. Although I learned a lot from the class, I think it would be improved as an experience if it were one or the other. A real survey would not have omitted Cezanne and Van Gogh and would have spent less time on the Futurists, to take one example among others, who's work many would agree is inferior.",
    "The lectures are highly engaging, I wish the time had been earlier in the day.",
    "I felt that the readings and section discussions were a great way to expand on Zeidler's lectures and introduce different perspectives on the artworks. Overall, I thought the course offers a great diversity of artworks and shows lesser-known art by famous artists. The artworks were woven together thematically and temporally in very interesting ways. A downside of the class was that the assignments were poorly timed - the only essay assignment was due just two weeks before the final exam, and the only assignment we had in the first two months of the semester was a midterm exam.",
    "I think the course is AMAZING for the first half of the semester, and gets a little slower during the second half. I wish we had spent less time on constructivism and Russian art and had been able to explore Duchamp more and include artists like Mondrian.",
    "Please take this course. Zeidler is a genius - he offers amazing insight in everyone of his lectures.",
    "I wish there was more interactive coursework to keep me more engaged. Readings alone were not that helpful in teaching me about early twentieth century art, and shorter reading responses or quizzes might have been beneficial.",
    "Sebastian is amazing. It is as though he has written a beautiful epic novel in his head and simply recites it each class.",
    "Great course, fair assessments, readings are unnecessarily long in my opinion as it seemed Professor Zeidler explained most of the main points of the pieces and the ideas could have been expressed more concisely",
    "It is equally interesting to students with no HSAR background and those with more experience, and it's well-organized and interesting. The primary weakness is the near-total lack of female or POC artists.",
    "I think it was great for gaining broad art history knowlege",
    "The course often focuses on the professors specific theories, which can at times be half baked and fail to give a convincing argument for the value of the artwork. The class became quite monotonous by the second semester. Section was particularly focused and enlightening, exploring a wider variety of interpretations and views in a more thorough manner. Ariel was a fantastic TA",
    "In the lectures, it was a very good survey-level introduction, and I never felt like my lack of background in art history was a weakness. In section, I sometimes felt that lack a little more strongly, because section wasn't very guided\/felt reliant upon prior knowledge of at least the basics of art history.",
    "I loved this course. Professor Zeidler is an incredible lecturer. I never checked the time during these lectures--I didn't feel the impulse to. Each lecture was a religious experience almost. Professor Zeidler presents even the most abstract paintings and concepts in a really engaging and digestible way. A weakness, if there is one, would be that sometimes it was hard to figure out which readings would be directly used in a lecture or seminar. That said, I would do all the readings anyway and could see them appearing in more than one lecture, so not much of a weakness if you keep up with the work.",
    "The course lectures started great, but toward the end I felt a little confused as we switched quickly between movements and artists. I also wish the last lecture had more along the lines of, \"why do we study this? What kind of progression did we see this semester? What makes art 'modern'?\" etc.",
    "Strengths: lectures were extremely fascinating and never boring Weaknesses: sometimes I wished that the history had been covered more thoroughly--i.e. the historical context for artworks and the overall connection between different art movements",
    "The professor is very strong and can offer new interpretations of pieces I never would have considered or been exposed to.",
    "The lectures are incredibly engaging- 50 minutes will pass quickly each class. The section is structured almost entirely by the TA and could be improved with greater standardization of expectations across sections.",
    "The lectures were always interesting and I feel like I learned a lot, however I wish we had stuck to the syllabus more and gotten to learn more. The last third of the class seemed more scattered (we would skip around readings or spend a ton of time on somethings and barely any on others) and I wish it had mirrored the pace of the first two-thirds. The reading were also very dense and I wish we had spent more time reviewing concrete content before jumping to discussion. I also think that a final paper and exam is a lot of work for finals.",
    "!A: fantastic CREDIT\/D.

   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this course to anyone! Perhaps I would've had a slightly easier time having taken an art history survey course, but this was my first art history class and it was definitely manageable. The class is pretty simple: readings, midterm, final, paper. Prof. Zeidler is an amazing lecturer (if a little soft-spoken; sit towards the front!) and the way we move through art works was great. I just wanted to be able to understand art a little more and this definitely gave me that and more.",
    "Good class with engaging lectures, sometimes the analysis can be far-fetched, but overall good",
    "I would recommend it to students with a definite interest in art history, who has some knowledge of the political and cultural history of the 20th century.",
    "No I did not like the material and the readings.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student. The work fluctuates: it's fairly relaxed for most of the semester with only readings, but the midterm and the final require quite a bit of preparation. That being said, the material is fascinating, and Professor Zeidler is perhaps the most engaging lecturer I've had at Yale (and I'm a senior): his palpable love of the art makes the 50 minutes fly by.",
    "Yes,",
    "A fascinating look at European history through the lens of art. You'll learn to read paintings closely and if you're not an art history major (I am not) you'll learn that a painting\/sculpture\/building isn't just a thing in and of itself but also is built in a particular historical and social context. Mostly, you'll learn about the contexts that the artworks were made in and how the artists responded or incorporated the feeling of the times into their art. Major themes: community, representation of the body, technology, speed, labor. It's got kind of a Marxist bent to it and Zeidler is absolutely HILARIOUS.",
    "I would highly recommend this course. The subject matter is fascinating, and each lecture is dramatic, captivating and well organized. The readings are very dense, but manageable if you're willing to put the time in.",
    "As my first art history class, it definitely helped me think about art in a lot of ways. The reading is often really interesting. However, there are some caveats. The first third of the class is actually late 19th century art. Some of the art of the second half of the class is simply not very good, and this is not just my opinion, but an opinion shared by many students. If you are looking for a survey class, this isn't fully satisfying. Many of the big artists are covered, but Professor Zeidler goes out of his way to connect themes within the artists, leading to some questionable choices for discussion. If you just want a thought provoking art history class, however, take it!",
    "Zeidler is an incredible teacher, and the material is woven together to create a highly interesting thematic connection.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. I had no art history background, and the course is definitely challenging, but I was very glad I took it.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to anyone who wants to learn more about art and just generally feel super cultured and awesome about yourself. Zeidler is hilarious, and you'll learn about art that you'll actually see at museums and stuff. The course definitely requires effort, but it's worth it and not too tough. They say the class is for people with a background in art history, but a ton of my friends who took it had never taken an HSAR class before and still loved it! Also I didn't do this but apparently it makes a great cred\/D.",
    "This is an incredible class-- Prof. Zeidler is such a great lecturer, he will open your eyes to an entirely new and interesting interpretation of each piece of art you'll see in this class. The subject matter is some of the most fascinating pieces of art in history, and it really covers the major turning points in art history. Strongly recommend to majors and non-majors alike!!",
    "This is a good art history course to credit\/d\/fail. The material is interesting and makes you want to study enough to get higher than a D on examinations.",
    "One gets a good survey of the major art historical movements since the 1860s to 1945. I took this course having never taken an Art History course before and found it challenging. However, Professor Zeidler is a great lecturer, and made lectures quite enjoyable.",
    "Yes! Take this course. Zeidler will blow your mind with his insights on paintings. Maybe you won't agree with all of his interpretations, but you definitely will be somewhat convinced by his arguments. Lectures are a pleasure.",
    "Yes. Without a doubt. Take this course. Sebastian Zeidler is a legend. His epic story-telling will take you to places you could only dream of (or see in modern art).",
    "Absolutely! Take this course if you want to be able to intelligently discuss modern art or if you just want to understand what art history is. You definitely do not have to be an art history major; Zeidler puts everything in intuitive terms. I took it credit\/D, but honestly if you go to lecture, participate genuinely in section (even if just to say that you don't understand something!), and pay attention, you will be able to do well (I ended with an A without doing most of the readings).",
    "Yes -- this is a wonderful perusal of an interesting art historical period, its workload is manageable, and Professor Zeidler is brilliant.",
    "Yes",
    "No, it's not consistently engaging and feels like a narrow cut of the professor's own interests. I don't feel like I have a better grasp of methods to evaluate and assess art. I wish we had spent more time and exploring why certain paintings were prized and not theories of metaphorical representation.",
    "I would highly recommend this course if you are seeking an intellectually stimulating, eye-opening introduction to modern art. The workload is reasonable, the readings are challenging but engaging, and the artworks are fascinating. I can't speak for how useful the course is to people with more of a background in art history, but for a total beginner like myself, it was truly one of the greatest learning experiences I've had at Yale. I now feel like I am at least basically competent in evaluating a piece of artwork.",
    "Yes this was an amazing course. Zielder is funny and very articulate!",
    "Yes, take it! Prof. Zeidler is brilliant and just listening to him speak made me feel like a more intelligent thinker too. I know a bit about art history but it is definitely still outside my comfort zone. I took it cr\/d because you're expected to be on top of the material during section but I ended up kind of regretting that decision-- I really liked what I was learning and was engaged with it and so took the work seriously. The readings could sometimes be theory heavy but always pretty short and definitely manageable (especially if you are doing a cr\/d style skim!). It got a little hectic and confusing in the second half of the semester with all the crossover between artistic and political movements. But overall, such a great class! I'm very glad I took it.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. I loved the lectures, enjoyed the readings when I put enough thought into the words I was reading, and enjoyed discussion section each week. I feel like I can now walk into the 20th century art section of an art museum and intellectually discuss the art on the walls, whether or not those were the direct pieces we learned about. This course pushed my academic and intellectual boundaries, but also increased my cultural awareness.",
    "Great class to take CR\/D and learn about art if you've never taken an art class at Yale (and want to learn about fairly modern art)!",
    "Yes",
    "I would recommend it but take it with a grain of salt if you aren't particularly fascinated by in-depth visual analyses.",
    "Yes! This course covers an extremely important time period in the history of art and makes you appreciate art that you might not appreciate otherwise. Lectures are amazing. Papers are interesting to write.",
    "Yes if you are really into art history",
    "Yes I would. It is enlightening in its understandings of modern art and listening to the professor discuss pieces is incredibly engaging.",
    "Yes. Zeidler's lectures are engaging, insightful, and accessible to those taking their first art history course.",
    "I would recommend, I'm glad I took the course.",
    "!A: fantastic CREDIT\/D. The students: You got your washed up seniors, SORORITY girls (think theta phly with pi phi), and male econ majors on one hand, and then your diligent sophomore history of art majors who are heavily invested on the other hand. Interesting mix. THE WORKLOAD: as a credit\/d you just cram the decades, titles, and artists of the slide list the day before for the midterm and final.

FINAL THOUGHTS: really interesting and you can learn a lot if you go to lecture and take diligent notes. DON'T DO THE READING you don't need to as a credit\/d.",
    "Absolutely, I would recommend this class. Zeilder delivers engaging and concise lectures that always provide insightful details and analysis without every losing sight of the bigger questions and themes. After every class, one leaves with the feeling of having set out on a fifty-minute intellectual foray, discovered a new way to think about a particular painting or artist, and made progress in understanding the contours early twentieth century art. I do need to offer two pieces of fair warning. The first is that at first blush the workload might seem very light (regular, but straightforward readings, two short lectures a week, and a section). In truth, the amount of work never substantially escalates, but the course does require a final essay and some of the later readings are a bit more involved if one wants to understand all the intricacies. (Do study for the mid-term, as it is a quarter of the final grade.) The second is, while it might be appealing to leap into a fascinating period of art history without preparation, this might not be the best starter course in the field. I would recommend that anyone interested has taken at least some art history course before, ideally a survey course.",
    "Yes, this was my first art history course EVER and provided an incredibly informative background in early 20th century art. If you want to feel well informed on many of the contemporary hard hitting artists, this is a MUST TAKE.",
    "Yes great course"
