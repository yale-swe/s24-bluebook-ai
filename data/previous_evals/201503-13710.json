    "Professor Saikkonen is not for everybody. She's very quiet and shy, and thus if you're the type of student that needs a ton of structure within your seminars, this may not be it for you. However, if you're more in the mood for a chill, small seminar, it's a great option. Readings were not too bad, the material was super interesting, and the intimate nature of the class was great. Beware, there is a lot of writing though (2 5-pagers and a final paper of 15 pages). Overall, a good class if you're interested in the subject material.",
    "LOVED this class. i don't know why more people didn't shop this, it was really great. 2 short papers and 1 final paper so the work isn't too bad, and the readings are very interesting and class discussion was great. really great class i would definitely recommend.",
    "A great introduction to Russia and the Soviet bloc after the fall of the Soviet Union. The course begins with historical background on the Soviet Union and moves towards present day politics. If you're interested in the region or time period, take this course! The assignments are flexible (you can choose when to submit your two papers) and Professor Saikkonen is a joy.",
    "Political Science 350 Russia & Postcommunist Politics was an extremely informative course and very relevant to the many changes in international politics today. I strongly recommend this course to anyone looking to pursue a career in foreign policy.",
    "I definitely recommend this class."
