   "comments": [
    "I recommend this class if you are interested in political science theory, but I do not feel I learned anything here.",
    "Good introduction to international security and international relations theory.",
    "International Security is an excellent class for getting to know the theory and history behind many of the world's conflicts and wars. The material is engaging and the discussions alone are worth taking the course. I would highly recommend this course to any student.",
    "International security is a very basic overview of the history of different security measures\/issues.",
    "A great course to get a theoretical overview of how security is viewed between nations. Not a current events course!",
    "not too many assignments but they tend to be graded harshly; only take it if you want a purely theoretical class; tests are pure memorization (which can screw you over)",
    "I would recommend the course to any student looking for a broad overview in the IR field at Yale. It may be boring for students who have taken other courses in the field, but the course load is manageable and Professor Kocher is a very interesting and knowledgable lecturer.",
    "Everywhere it says that International Security is an introductory course. Beware because so many people around you probably have a lot of relevant knowledge from other courses, which disadvantaged me from a participatory and paper-writing standpoint. The competition is fairly nerve-wracking when I expected this to be the introductory course that it promised. With that being said, the material isn't hard to understand. Kocher is straight-laced and his lectures and PowerPoint slides are generally easy to interpret. Nevertheless, I recommend this course strongly for anyone with IR theory experience and say take something else first if you haven't yet, unless you're ready to compete. For example, it is fairly frustrating that this semester, a 96 was only good enough for an A- on the midterm. Yes, it is objectively easy if you go to class, read, understand, and study, but you shouldn't have to be virtually perfect to get an A. (If that's just me, then oh well.) -- The midterm was 20% of the grade. Papers are short, but hard to do what you need in only 5 pages. Get help! I didn't, and got a B and B+, respectively. Both papers had two prompt choices. One reflected class material better than the other in both instances. The policy of a guaranteed week-long extension (at the expense of not getting feedback. Because paper 2 is so late in the semester, you shouldn't care.) -- Each paper was 15%. Apparently what constituted your section participation grade varied by TF. But I had Izabela and you had to do a PowerPoint and make discussion questions for one week of lecture. That PowerPoint and discussion \"leading\" was half of the 20% for participation. The other is attendance and talking. At first, she tallied, but then she stopped. However, section went on until everyone said at least one thing. At least she made sure everyone talked. The final (30%) was just like the midterm (but an extra choose 2 of 4 \"essay choices\" that can be answered in a couple paragraphs at absolute most). The other part is a short answer, almost all of which are objective facts that can be answered in as little as one word, or as much as a couple sentences.",
    "This was a fair and quality course. I wasn't interested in the material, though (something I really should have given more thought during shopping week), which made it really difficult to study for the class. Lectures were interesting in theory but also dry, hard to remember concepts sometimes because of this. Professor Kocher is a really wonderful guy and a great professor. I disagree with him on the nature of his exams, though, which he designs with the intention of being fair and making it a \"walk in the park\" for anyone who's come to class and done the readings. I did both and studied hard for the midterm, but still ended up getting so-so marks because of the all-or-nothing grading system. A single question could be worth ten points, and it's full credit or no credit at all. This was very frustrating since I felt like I had a good grasp on the material, and was demoralized after receiving the grade. Partial credit would make this class more fair. Otherwise, I'd just advise students to be careful in choosing this class; make sure you're really interested in the material on the syllabus!",
    "If you plan on pursuing any type of career in security, international relations, foreign policy, or politics, definitely take this course. I took this course to give me a more solid overview of topics before I pursue much more topic specific courses related to foreign affairs. This course will provide you with a very solid base for success in future academic endeavors in international relations.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. If you attend lectures and keep up with the readings, it is a relatively stress-free class. However, definitely prepare for the finals as the ease of some of the exams makes their curves very difficult.",
    "The class is a somewhat interesting introduction to some IR theories. If you aren't interested in theory, the class isn't for you most likely. Expectations for assignments are made very clear so it is easy to be successful in the class.",
    "I would not recommend this to a student who wasn't truly interested in international security. Professor Kocher explains at the beginning of the semester that class attendance is not mandatory nor does he require you to pay attention in class. Its your choice, but I would recommend going to class and paying attention if you want to do well on his midterm and final. Note: he does not post his lecture slides online. Professor can be pretty monotonous and hard to follow. At times, I found myself only copying the text from his slides and not actually paying attention to the content. Overall, the class does a good job of informing of how the different world powers function and what underlying factors contribute to their behaviors.",
    "Strange.",
    "Go to class and you will do well.",
    "Okay",
    "There are more inspiring courses at Yale college. It has potential, but falls sadly short.",
    "It is a class that introduces all of the major theories looking at international security. I have already recommended it.",
    "Good class with not too much work beyond a midterm and final. Definately recommend it.",
    "I would highly recommend it to students who want a solid introduction in this field.",
    "This course provided a great introduction to the field of international security. The lectures were well organized and the readings were always interesting. Professor Kocher is a great lecturer. The workload was very manageable with two papers, a midterm, and a final. Take this class if you want a more interesting introduction to international relations than Intro IR or if you are interested in war, peace, or the international system."
