    "Lessons. Take them if you are serious about music.",
    "I learned so much from my grad student teacher. The most important thing she taught me was how to listen and identify imperfections in my own playing. I felt inspired to practice each day and to work on my technique.",
    "I improved my grasp of trombone playing in terms of fundamentals and practical applications. I received weekly feedback and advice on constructing individual practice techniques with the goal of becoming an overall better instrumentalist and musician.",
    "This course has enabled me to deepen my relationship with the instrument, to learn new repertoire and to gain a better understanding of various styles."

    "The lessons are good if you have a good teacher. I had a good teacher, so it was strong.",
    "The policy changes every year, so it was a hassle to figure out which class I should take. Once that's figured out, it was smooth sailing from there.",
    "This course's flexible scheduling was very useful. However, it could benefit from some standardized structure so that both students and instructors know what to expect.",
    "There were no weaknesses to the course. It is the utmost privilege to be able to learn one on one with great academics and professors."
