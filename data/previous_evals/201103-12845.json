    "If you're looking at evaluations for \"The Bront\u00ebs and Their Afterlives,\" I assume you already know what you're in for, and this syllabus is pretty much exactly what you're expecting. While you don't read the entire Bront\u00eb canon (you skip the boring stuff, like \"Shirley\" and \"The Professor\"), you definitely get a sense of all three sisters. A book or so a week isn't overwhelming by any means, and most classroom discussions are engaging and fun. BUT this is a senior English seminar, and a rigorous one at that. The 20-25 page essay at the end of the semester is the most work I've done for a seminar in my Yale career, and Linda Peterson (although kind in person and in class) will take a very critical eye to every paper and every draft you turn in. This is a rewarding and enjoyable class, but be prepared to work hard on the final paper if you want to do well.",
    "Great class! The reading list is awesome. You get to read and discuss Jane Eyre and Wuthering Heights and other novels and watch film adaptations.",
    "Yes.",
    "english majors only: if you love the brontes, take it. definitely do it if youre a senior. if you're a junior and want to go for a practice run, you can try to get in.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class to anyone interested in Victorian literature, particularly by female authors. The class obviously focuses on the Bronte sisters but you read a lot more than just Jane Eyre and Wuthering Heights, so it doesn't feel repetitive and there's a lot of material that I probably would never have otherwise read (and ended up loving). Professor Peterson is an IDEAL seminar instructor -- she guides a productive discussion but never takes it over, and class time is really productive and enjoyable.",
    "This is a fun course for fulfilling the senior English major requirements if you like the Brontes.",
    "This course is exactly as described: you read a whole lot of Bronte. I was not too enthusiastic at first, and really just took it because it was the best option of senior seminars offered that semester, but I ended up enjoying it quite a bit. Class discussions were interesting and well-facilitated. Obviously it's a bit of work - a novel a week, plus a long draft process for the final essay - and you end up with a weirdly esoteric reading list (I don't think anyone else in the world has read any Anne Bronte, much less ALL Anne Bronte). Stay on top of your essay, because it will crush your soul if you put it off for too long.",
    "this is a really good class to fulfill the senior english major requirement. if you like the brontes then you'll love this class. the readings are great and it's really not a lot of work, especially if you've read some of the books before. professor peterson is really nice and easygoing and is really helpful with the senior essay",
    "This is a great introduction to the Brontes, and an excellent preparation for the senior essay. I would recommend this class to any English major. Professor Peterson is an engaging and highly approachable teacher.",
    "I would recommend English 431 for other students. It is probably best for students with an interest in Victorian literature, though I would encourage others to consider the course as well. You can choose to focus your final paper on a topic of your choosing so there is a lot of room to direct your work towards your interests. Plus, Professor Peterson will probably have you loving the Brontes by the end of the semester."
