    "This was a strange and wonderful class. Dean Storr has some fantastic stories and insights about the art world from the perspective of an artist, curator, and educator. He does an excellent job of leading a free-flowing discussion and making students think.",
    "This class would be very helpful if it helped the students with their senior theses, but it did not. I would certainly not recommend this class to another student. Unfortunately, it was required. This class has potential but not the way it was taught this semester.",
    "Well, if you're taking this then you're probably required to so it doesn't really matter if I recommend it, but it's an interesting class and you'll think a lot about important topics! Don't expect any advice on your senior project, though.",
    "Well it's required! We listened to Rob talk about lots of different things that mostly didn't seem very applicable. Spent almost zero time talking about our theses. Had readings on different art philosophy\/theory\/things that took time away from working on thesis."
