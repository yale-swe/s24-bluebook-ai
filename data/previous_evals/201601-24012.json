    "This class is your typical lecture-seminar. The class is great for anyone who is interested in public health and wants to know more about how public health research is done, how policy is crafted and how interventions are designed. However, we spent very little time in the course talking about race or class. These topics were brought up, of course, but mainly as a frame for the lectures on public health theory and methods. The readings did not really seem to add much to the course and were not particularly engaging. However, I did enjoy the assignments. There weren't too many and I felt like they were weighted appropriately, and increased in difficulty. The assignments also forced me to think critically about public health issues that I am interested in, particularly the final grant proposal. Isabel is also a great professor. She is very approachable and cares about each of her students. Meeting with her was incredibly helpful, and she will meet with you for as long as you need, like 1.5-2 hours. Overall, I liked the work I did outside of class for this course, but the seminar meetings were not especially engaging and did not address the topics I thought they would.",
    "This class was a great overview of important elements of public health research and relevant current issues. It was very well organized, with topics really building upon each other. It helps students gain not just knowledge but also practical skills that can be applied such as writing OpEds or grant proposals.",
    "This was a fantastic course that examined the origins of health disparities in the United States and Central America. It presented material often untouched by other departments, and allowed students to critically engage with the colonial violence of the United States that has enabled the perpetuation of health disparities in specific communities in the United States: communities defined by race, ethnicity, sex\/gender, class, and living location. The course material was interesting and accessible, and the workload was very manageable.",
    "Interesting topics, relaxed approach, amazing professor.",
    "A class on health disparities in America. Not particularly rigorous - and fun to hang out with everyone. Especially great to get to know Isabel.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course.",
    "This is an overview of racial and ethnic biases in public health and in community based approaches to research.",
    "Yes I would recommend if you are really into public health, especially research within public health."
