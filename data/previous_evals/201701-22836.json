    "the arabic language",
    "I continued my development in the Arabic language expanding my vocabulary, grammar, and different word structures.",
    "I learned basic Arabic grammar, some vocab and some conversation skills.",
    "I learned an incredible amount in terms of grammar, some of which was supposed to be covered in L1 but was not sufficiently covered, and it enabled me to look at Arabic much more comprehensively and have a better understanding of the language.",
    "I learned a lot about Arabic grammar and also improved my conversational skills",
    "My arabic grammer improved vastly in this course and I understood a lot of fundamental things that I did not know before",
    "My writing especially developed more than I expected, and I had a much easier time composing full sentences in thought and writing by the end of the term. Speaking fluency didn't come as quickly for meI think that if the culture of the class had been such that we were expected to ask most questions and respond in Arabic whenever possible, it might have developed more. My listening skills also improved somewhat."

    "Great course!",

    "GREAT course. Elbousty is full of energy, he really cares about the students, and wants everyone to genuinely understand the material. Leaves no one behind in class.",
    "The class is energetic and fast paced. There is some disconnect between work outside of class and work in class.",
    "Strengths: the teacher Weaknesses: sometimes lessons were infrequent, and the Ta sections werent that helpful",
    "I loved that Professor Elbousty really emphasized the grammar; I'd been in Arabic classes before that tried to teach through games and casual speaking, but this worked much better for me. I think I would have engaged more with the material if the homework were more written assignments and fewer online exercises, which I found really tedious and unhelpful. I liked that he allowed us to ask clarifying questions in English and explained important concepts such that we could understand, but it would have been nice if the amount of Arabic used in class were scaled up over the course of the semester. I'm not certain I'm prepared for an all-Arabic environment next term."
