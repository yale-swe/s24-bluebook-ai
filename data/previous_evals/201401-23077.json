   "comments": [
    "Various researchers and clinicians came in to present on their specific research topic, all related to neurological diseases. I would recommend it to people with a understanding of neuroscience before starting the course.",
    "It's a course with a different expert lecturer every class covering various neurological diseases. The content ranges from cellular\/molecular to clinical. There is a diversity of students that take the class. The workload is not too bad.",
    "This is a really fantastic course. The lectures are all given by leading researchers in the field. The one thing I really appreciated is that the lectures are very accessible. They don't assume much knowledge and really cover a vast array of both research and clinical issues in the field. The professors are also very open to answering questions and meeting after class, which is a really wonderful experience and very educational.The final paper was extremely difficult but nonetheless very rewarding. It does require you to spend a significant amount of time reading reviews, perspectives and historical reviews on the field to really immerse yourself and write a thoughtful, appropriate proposal.The quiz questions can be a bit arbitrary at times and often require naming molecules\/genes\/regurgitation of random facts rather than demonstrating conceptual understanding.",
    "I would summarize to say its a great course to learn about all sorts of neurological disease and how they are believed to manifest, and current research and opinions on how these diseases work and how we can cure them. I would definitely recommend.",
    "It is a good course to take for a broad introduction to neurodegeneration. Will definitely learn a lot if you pay attention in lectures. Quizzes are frustrating for reasons stated above. I would take the course because grades are less important than learning, anyway.",
    "I thought this course was so interesting and useful! The content was fantastic -- excellent speakers, good breadth of knowledge, and very exciting work to hear about. It's probably not a good course for either someone with no background in neuroscience, or a substantial background in molecular and cellular neuroscience. However, if one is looking for a survey course of the molecular and cellular work that pertains to neurological disorders, and does not have much of a background in that work particularly, this is a perfect course.",
    "Yes, good overview of the current topics in neuroscience.",
    "It is a great introduction to a variety of neurological diseases, taught by some of the leaders of the field. I would definitely recommend it to another student, especially one who is looking to obtain some background or context in neurological research.",
    "Some of the lectures were very interesting, some were less interesting"

   "comments": [
    "The course gave me a broader understanding of a field I would not have normally investigated.I appreciated the variety.",
    "This course aided me immensely in understanding neuro-specifc hypothesis formulation and experimental methodology.",
    "I learned so much about molecular and cellular neuroscience! I thought the presentation pushed me to learn about an aspect of my field I was not particularly familiar with, which was extremely useful. I feel like I have a good background in other neurological disorders (besides the one I study) and learned so much about methodologies with which I had previously no familiarity. I think the knowledge from this course will aid my global understanding of my own field, as well as help me see where my field fits into neurological research more generally.",
    "Definitely deepened my knowledge of the field. Didn't contribute much to my research.",
    "This course certainly deepened my knowledge of the discipline. It as well contributed to my research in that it helped to provide some context for the systems I am\/will be studying."
