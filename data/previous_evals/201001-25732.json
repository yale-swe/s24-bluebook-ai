    "I took this class to fulfill requirements for a bio major and premed. If at all possible, avoid this class. It is very poorly taught (mostly TAs) and the difficulty level of the tests is unreasonable considering the level of material covered in class. If you have to take it for a requirement, prepare to do a lot of work on your own."
