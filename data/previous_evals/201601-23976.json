   "comments": [
    "Asian diasporas is one of the most multifaceted, painful, beautiful, and eye-opening topics to study in the context of undergraduate education; you're here in an uber-academic institution to think deconstructively and critically about everything, this course lets you do just that. Important to everyone who considers themselves an immigrant or has felt like a systematically produced outsider.",
    "I am a senior in my spring semester, and this was the most engaging class I've had at Yale. You get to explore issues that are never mentioned in the media or public settings regarding the Asian diaspora. Professor Tran is caring, patient, and graceful between making space and taking space in class. Loved it.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to other students. I learned so much about the process of negotiation that Asian diasporas must continually undertake in order to survive as complex, multifaceted cultural groups. I loved the readings for this course, too, and especially how we studied Asian fusion cuisine as a cross-cultural, diasporic site! A nice blend of academic texts and also pop-culture\/creative writing genres.",
    "ER&M 324 is a fantastic, thought-provoking course that makes you think about how we perceive migrants and ethnic cultures. It's fun and it gives you space at the end to explore a topic of interest to you.",
    "The readings and discussions provide a survey overview of Asian diasporas and the relevant themes. I'd definitely recommend it, but be advised that you probably won't end the semester with any knowledge that's too specific.",
    "I loved this class. The readings were great varied, interesting, and not too academic. The films, all watched in class, were well-selected and incredibly moving. Professor Tran is a really energetic and inspiring teacher, and she encouraged us to always think critically about the materials that we were presented with, and showed us how everything in the world can be analysed and troubled. I learned so much from every lesson, and I love that many of us in the class were encouraged to tie the concepts that we were learning about to our own experiences as diasporic subjects. I enjoyed the discussions greatly, and Professor Tran always asked and answered really interesting questions. 9.25am 2-hour seminars can be rough, but this class was worth it every time.",
    "Good class for anyone thinking, \"Isn't it a little weird that we call people Asian Americans?\" Take it! Professor Tran is the bomb.",
    "Asian Diasporas after 1800 is a reading- and discussion-heavy seminar course that seeks to probe, question, dispel, and deconstruct our conceptions and understanding of Asian migrations across the world. It's a story about entire peoples who fell between the cracks of nationhood and immigration, and it's thoroughly eye-opening for anyone who takes the course -- regardless whether they are of Asian descent. I would definitely recommend ER&M 324 to other students, especially if they're interested in studies of race and migration. However, it's also a course accessible to total beginners in the subject, and many people participated in the class to learn more about themselves.",
    "DEFINITELY TAKE THIS COURSE. I mean no one knows about Asian diasporas, and this is an incredibly pertinent topic for understanding the world we live in today. The chance to take a class with Professor Tran is also something you should take advantage of during your time at Yale.",
    "A great class on really really interesting subject matter. I would definitely recommend it, especially if it continues to improve and take on more shape over time.",
    "If you want to take a class with not a lot of work but one that delves into Asian American culture and identity, you should definitely take this class! There were a lot of interesting readings about food, poetry and personal stories. My final project was done on the history of ramen and it was so much fun and interesting to do. You will come out of the class with a completely different view towards ethnic food.",
    "Take this class. It made me want to take more of prof. Tran's classes in the future, but was foremost a transformative semester of self-discovery and self-questioning. Get to know your classmates. Go to office hours and really participate - you get what you put in, because the workload is not unbearable!",
    "Definitely take it! I would argue that everyone should take this class, and I think everyone got a lot out of it, even though 95% of the class was Asian American. Not even just because it is an Asian American studies class that changed the way I interact with the world (and is also timely, given the push for an ethnic studies requirement), but because the reading as something for everyone in it. For the beginner, there is the usage of analogies and experience, but for the advanced senior, there are a lot of references to post-colonial studies theory. This class is not just some niche class that is specifically for the \"colored\" students, but instead posits very important questions about troubling borders and globalization that each Yale student needs to interact with."
