    "a familiarity of the scholarship on early modern english social history",
    "I really gained a knowledge of the entire range of topics and conversations happening within the field of Early Modern Britain. The wide range of topics and specialties of the students really encouraged interesting and often unexpected discussions.",
    "An excellent overview of the major literature surrounding the social history of early modern England.",
    "Great overview of the literature, with plenty of room for tailoring readings to ones needs.",
    "The course increased my familiarity with early modern social history, which I had used before as context to intellectual and ecclesiastical history but not in and of itself. It also allowed me time to read some of the classics in the genre which I thoroughly enjoyed.",
    "This course pushed me to read a lot more and a lot more widely. Professor Wrightson really stressed the importance of writing a \"book review\" type essay, which encouraged students to engage with secondary sources (which often get short changed compared to primary sources in my previous projects). Overall the type of writing and reading in the course has pushed me beyond my comfort zone and I benefited a lot from it."

   "comments": [
    "Keith Wrightson is a giant in his field and models what it means to think like a historian. His intellectual imagination, as reflected in his teaching, is remarkable, and the care and attention he accords to the class (he meets students individually to go over each paper) reflects his ethos as a scholar.",
    "A little more structure in discussions could help to propel the conversation forward; it often felt like we lingered around points without making any new observations before someone would change the topic completely.",
    "There was a bit of confusion with the syllabus in terms of what topics were covered when, which made gathering books difficult at times. However, this was cleared up relatively quickly. Overall a strong course in terms of structure and execution."

His intellectual imagination, as reflected in his teaching, is remarkable, and the care and attention he accords to the class (he meets students individually to go over each paper) reflects his ethos as a scholar.",
    "Yes. This was such a great way to solidify my foundation in my field.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to another student interested in this area of history.",
    "Would recommend this course without reservation.",
    "I would, the course if sufficiently broad enough to allow everyone to follow their own research interests while gaining an understanding of the historiographical development of all the different subfields.",
    "I would absolutely recommend it especially if Professor Wrightson chooses to offer it again. The early modern period is so rich and interesting and Prof. Wrightson really is the best person for the period."
