   "comments": [
    "I would summarize it as a review of remote sensing techniques that are currently being used in archaeology all over the world. I would definitely recommend it to any archaeology student.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student in archaeology. The information it provided is widely relevant and readily applicable for any region or time period as a valuable methodology\/toolkit to employ in research. Plus, it provided a solid base of knowledge with which to understand the research of the many scholars that employ geophysical techniques or satellite imagery.",
    "Take this course!! It is a great overview of techniques used in archaeological prospection and gives you the ability to pursue your own research project.",
    "Yes, I would recommend it to other students, because remote sensing is very important in archaeological research and the course could provided needed knowledge of remote sensing.",
    "\"Integrating Remote Sensing for Archaeology,\" introduces the use and application of geophysical remote sensing methods for the examination of archaeological sites. A number of discrete methods, from the interpretation of satellite remote sensing imagery, to the collection of geophysical survey data are discussed, however, the primary focus of this class is on the collection, processing, and interpretation of magnetometry and gpr survey data. In class exercises and labs provide hands on experience collecting and processing magnetometry and gpr survey and locating this data in a GIS database. I would recommend the class to undergraduate archaeological studies majors, graduate students in the archaeological studies masters program, and doctoral students in anthropology with a focus in archaeology.\"Integrating Remote Sensing for Archaeology,\" provides invaluable hands on experience collecting and processing geophysical survey data and teaches essential skills such as setting up a total station and establishing a survey datum. Completing \"Integrating Remote Sensing for Archaeology,\" has better prepared me to plan, collect, interpret, and present geophysical survey data."

   "comments": [
    "This course helped me pinpoint the exact technique that I will use at my field site in the future. This will help push my research in new ways that I had not thought of before.",
    "This course provided a great base of information on a variety of cutting edge techniques in archaeology. This understanding will enable me to make better decisions about the methodologies I employ in my own research, and whether it would be productive to attempt geophysical or satellite prospection.",
    "Very useful in my research.",
    "Very helpful to my research.",
    "\"Integrating Remote Sensing for Archaeology, increased my ability to collect, record, and interpret geophysical survey data. The class provided me with essential archaeological skills necessary to contribute and participate in archaeological field work. In addition to essential skills, I learned best practices for the processing and presentation of geophysical survey data. This knowledge directly informed and enhanced my masters thesis on gpr survey."
