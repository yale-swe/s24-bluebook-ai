   "comments": [
    "I felt enormously enriched by this class. The writing was therapeutic and I truly feel like I've gotten better at it by taking this class in a way that no other class has influenced me. I would recommend this to anyone -- lovers of non-fiction, STEM students looking for a good WR, etc. The writing schedule was a bit fast-paced, but the good thing is, the rough drafts were ungraded, so the pressure was off a bit.",
    "Great class with interesting readings. You will learn a lot about the style of writing in the modern essay.",
    "Yes! As I said, I think the value of 120 is in presenting non-fiction essays the way they're meant to be presentedin a space that is designed to hold discussion afterward.",
    "ENGL 120 is a great introduction to the \"modern essay\" and personal writing, and a good exposure to lots of amazing contemporary writers. I would definitely recommend it for students who are interested in pursuing English\/writing as well as for students who are more STEM-minded and are looking for a solid and enjoyable intro English course!",
    "ENGL 120 is a survey course on creative nonfiction writing. You will read and write many different types of nonfiction pieces. None of the papers are exceptionally long, but they are all demanding nonetheless. I would absolutely recommend this course to anyone who wants to improve their ability to write or analyze written arguments.",
    "This is a really important course and a lot of fun. The readings are great, but the course is definitely a lot of work with some sort of writing assignment due every Friday. Most important suggestion I can give is to go to office hours as much as possible!",
    "Take this class!!! It's very hard, and you definitely won't get the elusive A, but I can personally guarantee that your writing will improve across all disciplines. I wasn't sure about the course in the beginning, and almost dropped it, but I'm so glad I stayed. The essays you're assigned to read are actually a lot of fun and reading them never felt like work. Writing about yourself can feel weird, but it's so important to know how to do. This feels like one of those must-take Yale classes.",
    "Great class for someone with a relatively strong writing background. Don't take this class to learn how to write. Take it to get stronger in your writing.",
    "Take this class! I was definitely intimidated by what I heard about ENGL 120, but this was hands down one of the best classes I've ever taken. For me, this class was as life-changing as everyone says it is, and I can't imagine a better introduction to English at Yale. Dr. Stuart was an incredible professor -- a wonderful leader of class discussions and so, so patient and helpful during office hours. The reading selections were enjoyable, and our analyses really helped me develop and hone my writing skills. However, I did find the class to be incredibly time-consuming. I think it depends on how efficient you are as a writer. For me, the essays were exhausting and frustrating, but ultimately so worth it in the end; I think I've produced some of my best writing in this class. If you're willing to put in the work, you'll get so much out of this class.",
    "I'm glad I took this class--it was challenging and interesting and the readings were (mostly) very cool. Workload was medium, but it's hard to do well--I found it hard to figure out exactly what Professor Stuart wanted, so difficult to improve essay grades. Overall, great course, I learned a ton about writing, and would recommend to most everyone."
