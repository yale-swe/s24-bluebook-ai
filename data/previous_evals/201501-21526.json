    "This was one of the best courses I have ever taken at Yale. As a senior very interested in discussions about race, it was natural that I would love the readings. But I left the class feeling equipped with new tools and terminology to continue this work in whatever spaces I enter in the future! The discussions were dynamic, but at times it was obvious that others didn't do the readings. When Prof. Feimster recognized that, she would opt to lecture a bit more than listen. That hampered some discussion, I think, but I understood every time she did it. I LOVE PROFESSOR FEIMSTER. She is so dedicated to her students, and makes herself as available as possible for our intellectual pursuits. I believe she got a meal with EVERY STUDENT in BOTH of her seminars this semester, which is a feat that MUST NOT go unrecognized. She's fantastic. As I stated above, Prof. Feimster tends to lecture a bit during the seminar. HOWEVER, every word that she says is so excellent and quote-worthy, so I don't think it's inherently bad! But if she pushed us to answer tough questions, and waited to see who would call other students out for off-base comments instead of correcting them with a nudge of her own before calling on the next of many hands raised, I think it would've been more of a workshop of ideas. I also think we would have ended on time more often if that were the case.",
    "Yes.",
    "One of the best classes at Yale. Take it you can! Very interesting.",
    "TAKE THIS COURSE. Just do it. Professor Feimster is one of the best professors you will ever have and this course is life-changing in terms of shaping your politics and everyday behavior. It opened my eyes in so many ways. The class work is manageable and you really enjoy it because she reminds you how important and necessary the work is. Take it!!!",
    "Every student, every person, needs to take this course with Crystal Feimster. The class is fun, challenging, and extremely relevant. Professor Feimster is an incredible teacher to take a seminar with. Be warned though, you had better make sure you do the reading and take some time to process it before you get to class. Come ready to learn, debate, and be challenged. This class is more interesting when people are vulnerable and bring their own personal perspectives to the issues at hand. That said, it is worth it. Every bit.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student who is interested in the history of the United States, who is grappling with issues of race and who is interested in taking a life changing class. Taking it for Professor Femister alone would be worthwhile, but the topic itself is incredibly relevant and important to begin to understand.",
    "Take this course if you want your experiences with race to be validated in an academic setting and if you want to decolonize your mind. Only class in my 4 yrs at Yale that I wanted more readings for and more discussion time.",
    "YES.",
    "AFAM 251\/Critical Race Theory is a terrific course. Whether you are an AFAM major or not, this course will offer you both an introduction to the legal field known as Critical Race Theory, and way of looking at the world and thinking about stories that goes well beyond the bounds of CRT. You will consider the permanence of racism in this country and will be asked to think about ways to reimagine racein your own life as well as in the abstract. This is a class on Critical Race Theory, but it is certainly not always theoretical. Professor Feimster has designed the course in such a way that it challenges students to draw together the academic discourse of CRT with their own personal experience. This class will force you to ask difficult questions about race in America and about yourself. In the process, it will ask you to stretch your imagination of what race can or should look like in our world. Professor Feimster is an absolutely incredible person and professorit is worth taking the course just to take a class with her and experience her inspiring leadership!",
    "Critical Race Theory is a course which examines the pervasiveness of racism in society and the law. Through different texts and exercises, students engage in challenging yet rewarding conversations about racism, race, white privilege, and intersectionality.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone who is willing to push their own thinking about race in the United States, and is willing to have an open mind and open heart in engaging with the material. This course requires students to question their own assumptions about how social identities are legitimated, and provokes new thought on how we engage with the topic of race in our society. The readings are diverse in perspective and content, yet still open-ended to make room for students' own take on a given topic and contribute their own conceptualizations of how race operates on different levels -- both systemically and experientially. It provides students with tools and concepts that will allow them to examine race across varying contexts and disciplines in new and important ways.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. This was hands down my favorite class I have ever taken at Yale. Its major strengths are Professor Feimster's supportive, intelligent, unparalleled teaching style. She leads discussions very well and makes you want to do the reading. She makes sure everyone talks in class, so there's no real way to slide by, but you really don't want to! Another strength are the amazing texts we read, not only the foundational Critical Race theory works, but also texts (including a Podcast) that makes you think beyond CRT and into the realm of storytelling, plus everyday news and clips that are interesting, relevant, and sometimes entertaining. Another strength are the interesting assignments, very different from a \"normal\" seminar writing assignments. We got an Ipad (!!!!) to use apps to create multimedia projects that explored CRT through storytelling. It felt super relevant and new, really great for our generation."
