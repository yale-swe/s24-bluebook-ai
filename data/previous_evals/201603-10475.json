   "comments": [
    "Strengths: My TA was awesome Weaknesses: I didn't know how to write for lab and therefore struggled with the first post-lab before finding resources posted by the instructor",
    "The grading of the post lab assignments seemed rather random at times. I think there should be a standardized rubric used, and perhaps a scale for how many points are taken off for mistakes. I often lost a ton of points for very minor mistakes, or lost points for things that were explicitly said in the lab manual but my TA did not agree with.",
    "The only way that I could think of improving the course is maybe making the instructions in the lab manual more clear.",
    "The course teaches us how to use lab equipment and do procedures. It wasn't imperative to understand the reactions before doing the lab so if there was a way to make sure that we really understood each reaction before doing the lab then that would be better so that we don't have to learn it all before the exam. I think the exam is not representative of the work that we do at all in this course because it's test based and the entire year we do lab work so it makes no sense that it's a test for the final that's worth 30% of our grade. Also, the grading was incredibly harsh for no reason. My TA would take off for such small and dumb things like grammar or forgetting an \"and\". This was not conducive to my learning of organic chemistry techniques. Also, the EP's and PL assignments were unfair because they required us to teach ourselves and read material ourselves but then we're penalized if we get something wrong because we",
    "This course has an amazing facility, TA, and Professor, however I found that the grading was not consistent between sections which was frustrating. I enjoyed the experiments and liked how we got to work on our own.",
    "This was a time consuming and difficult lab class, but it was well done. It has a very clear course packet, creating structure, and it is very clear what is required of you in order to do well. I highly recommend this course as a complement to the Chem 220 class.",
    "This course was quite manageable in terms of workload. As long as you come to class prepared the experiments are a breeze and actually quite enjoyable. There are really only 3 lab reports.",
    "Strengths: Doing experimental plans before lab helped me understand what we were actually doing (as I did not in Gen Chem lab), having a lighter workload Weaknesses: No one was really sure how the grading was going to work, as the level of harshness in grading varied from TA to TA.",
    "The main weakness was the lack of clarification for the EP's and PLA\/B\/C. I would get points taken off for things that were in the example in the course packet or things that I didn't know needed to be included.",
    "The course was strong in that it was extremely well-organized Professor DiMeglio was really fantastic in this regard, and she never failed to spell out exactly what was required of us and how our reports and procedures should be done. There were no real weaknesses in this course. The only thing that I thought varied in the course among students was how the TAs graded the reports and taught the pre-lab lectures. I had a great TA (Jonathan Tyson) who was extraordinarily helpful, so I got a lot out of the lab experience and felt that I really understood what was going on.",
    "I think the course is excellent as-is; I have no improvements to suggest.",
    "The structure of the course is very clear, which made it easy to follow along and know what to expect in upcoming weeks. A potential way the course could have been improved was that much of the course logistics relied on a course packet; I think breaking up the information may be more helpful for both studying and reference purposes.",
    "The weekly course expectations are very clear and Dr. DiMeglio is extremely helpful and accessible by email. However, the grading is extremely variable depending on which TF you have.",
    "The experiments were all easy to follow and straight forward.",
    "Strengths of the course were definitely the amount of freedom we had to conduct the experiment",
    "The course lets students see the big picture and learn a great deal.",
    "It really didn't mirror the CHEM 174 curriculum at all, which was a bit disappointing, and I felt that there was quite a bit of busy work involved. The strengths were that we definitely had sufficient opportunity to practice and get a good handle of the few techniques that we had learned, but at the end of the semester it felt like we had learned very few techniques to begin with. Dr. DiMeglio did a truly phenomenal job (probably better than ANYONE can) with the curriculum at hand, but it seemed like the curriculum that the course was based on was flawed in many large ways. Furthermore, grading always seemed very petty and superficial; TAs definitely seemed to search for opportunities to deduct points at times, which led to unnecessary point deductions for things such as formatting, etc.",
    "Course packet was good. Experiments were good. Assignments were good. Professor was great. TA was great. WHAT WAS THAT FINAL? We do written reports, physically conduct experiments, and answer long answer questions all semester, then finish with a multiple choice final when I haven't seen a multiple choice question all semester? Not cool fam. Why wasn't it a practical? :( Overall tho, so much better than the living hell that was Gen chem lab. God rest the souls of those poor freshmen this year. Bless orgo lab for the simple fact that it isn't gen chem lab.",
    "Strength of the course was the time period, I enjoyed not having it pan 4 hours. Weakness is that there are no chairs in the lab. Many of our experiments had 30 or more minutes in-between actions and it would have been nice to sit. Additionally, it would have been helpful for my TA to give more in depth instructions of the days events, I was often lost or confused on what was really happening.",
    "Lots of work, should be more than 0.5 credits.",
    "Beautiful new labs, really fun experiments, overall really enjoyed it.",
    "This is an enjoyable class that really allows you to become familiar with chemistry laboratory methods and doesn't cause a lot of stress while doing it. While it falls short at connecting the lab to the Organic Chemistry course itself, its a solid and rewarding course.",
    "They do a great job building off of the skills you learn each week, yet still change the labs significantly",
    "Strengths - Experiments are manageable - Course packet and resources are very clear and detailed - Instructor, lab staff and TAs are very approachable and friendly Weaknesses \/ Suggestions - I don't think it's very rigorous, which means it's chill but also doesn't really impart a lot of skills - Maybe have more partner work involved? Lets you learn from each other and also encourages interaction",
    "MUCH BETTER THAN GEN CHEM LAB",
    "This course does a great job with introductory techniques!",
    "This course is great in introducing many vital techniques in chemistry, such as reflux, separation techniques, etc.",
    "Sometimes it was hard to follow what exactly was due and when and required for each homework as it varied from week to week.",
    "Strengths: -it was a lot of fun! -lots of hands on things! Weaknesses: -inconsistent TAs -prelab was sometimes not helpful",
    "I mean, this is a standard lab. It's really good for a lab course, I think. The TAs and instructor are wonderful and helpful, and the emphasis on learning rather than results of your experiment is really great.",
    "I found that orgo lab was actually much, much better than gen chem lab because I actually felt myself learning about proper lab techniques and set-ups. Since the experimentation is always on an individual basis, it forces you to really figure out what exactly is going on in each lab procedure. Watching the videos and reading through the lab book before the day of were very helpful. In terms of weaknesses of the course, the post lab reports were graded rather strictly, which was often challenging because there wasn't much outside instruction when it came to those reports.",
    "It wasn't too intense which is nice for a lab, and all of the professors and TAs were eager to be helpful and answer questions.",
    "The experiments are shorter than gen chem lab experiments and there is less work since there are no weekly lab reports. The final exam is a multiple choice test and I think I would have preferred a practical exam like the ones in gen chem lab.",
    "Strengths: clear instructions for lab work, thorough in introduction to organic chem lab work Weaknesses: inconsistencies in TA grading styles and harshness, too many materials to cross-reference for simple lab reports, incredibly nitpicky when it comes to formatting (and not to chemistry-relevant materials)",
    "It has very detailed guidelines in helping us understand the procedures, but I wish there had been more discussion on the reasoning behind the procedures.",
    "It is a good course!",
    "I would have appreciated a practice exam. The final exam was not at all what I imagined or prepared for.",
    "This course was extremely well done. There was a lot of work involved and sometimes sources of information had to be gathered from too many sources. Still, everything was accessible online and instructions were clear.",
    "You definitely learn a lot about organic chemistry, compound synthesis and purification. It is really great at this and although the labs can be monotonous you really understand the techniques. Maybe the lab would be more meaningful it was more attached to the organic chemistry lecture concepts and there was more of a conversation about the theory behind it all.",
    "The course instructors are wonderful and the labs are great; however, I feel as if we were occasionally ahead of the organic chemistry classes in terms of lecture material. Other than this, I think the course was excellent.",
    "This class was much better than my general chemistry lab. It was not too long, the lab reports were rare, and I genuinely enjoyed the laboratory experiments we did. As far as labs go, I cannot think of any negative aspects of this.",
    "This was a really good course overall. It was fun, well explained, and there was a good mix of assignment types. My only complaint was that the final exam was a short test with multiple choice questions which was weighted very highly, so even if you did well the rest of the semester, doing only okay on the test could really affect your grade.",
    "Strengths - Assignments are clear and engaging. - The experiments build up well. - The professor is very engaged and hands-on. Weaknesses - The grading of assignments feels harsh without much focus on how to improve. - It seems silly for the final exam to be written, multiple-choice if nothing else in the course has followed that format.",
    "The strengths of this class are that the workload it not to heavy and grades are not dependent on your final yields. The labs are usually quite interesting as well. The greatest weakness of this class is the at-time arbitrary grading of the large lab reports. It's difficult to understand what exactly is expected of you and the labs are a big chunk of your grade.",
    "Strength: focus on individual work in lab really helped to give me a greater sense of competence and confidence during the lab. Weakness: maybe more focus on concepts behind each lab and guidance on how to prepare for lab final.",
    "The course was helpful for learning techniques, but the grading was extremely harsh.",
    "Strengths include EPs to help students understand what they will do before coming into the lab. The packet provides awesome information for understanding the labs. Weaknesses include the grading rubrics on the post lab assignments. In my opinion, the grading (harsh on formatting and details that the questions often didn't clearly ask for) did not accurately reflect students' understandings of the actual labs.",
    "The strengths of this course include the format of the EPs, which are done before each lab and force you to understand and review the material, and the reports, which are cumulative over several labs and cement your understanding. The lab procedures were great and covered a variety of reactions and concepts, which was very helpful in gaining an overview of what orgo has to offer. This course is much more relaxed than gen chem lab, which I also found to be an asset. The only improvement could be more consistent lab times; I found it could be difficult to be in lab for a little more than an hour one week then 4 the next; perhaps some experiements could be done in tandem, or in pieces, to make things more consistent? overall great though.",
    "Strengths: very well organized and you just sort of do your own thing. You aren't expected to be perfect and are allowed to learn rather than worry about screwing things up. Grading is fair and normalized to TF, which is helpful. PL assignments were somewhat difficult but did help me understand the material more. Labs seemed to help Weaknesses: It's a lab class. Hard to make fun. Very little interaction with the instructor I guess is an issue but not really. Lab classes are sort of independent experiences.",
    "Standard lab class, learned some techniques in organic synthesis, workload wasn't unreasonable. Post-lab assignments were harshly graded, but I think the curve compensated fairly.",
    "The class does a good job teaching you the fundamentals skills you need to know but some of the assignments are unnecessarily meticulous and cause you to lose points for reasons unrelated to Organic Chemistry.",
    "Great instructors, fantastic lab, well made course book- strengths",
    "The grading ranged very drastically from TA to TA, some TAs grading the lab reports in the time it takes to complete a lab and giving basically every student a 100 to TAs that take points off for the formatting in the Pre Labs. This is a big problem that really makes the experience you have in lab dependent upon which TA you get.",
    "The strength of this class was the clear course packet and instruction. The weakness of this class was the lack of weekly preparation for the final lab exam and the unclear information about the exam content. It was very hard to study from a list of short answer questions for a multiple choice test.",
    "This course covered several different techniques. Lab was also divided into small sections so that the TA could help individual students whenever issues arose.",
    "The course is very well organized as the progression of the labs is very helpful to develop ever more complex techniques. Something I really liked was that everything you learn you will use it and reinforce it later in the course. One thing that could be improved is the theoretical preparation for the labs. Most of the time the contents we were supposed to know from orgo lecture were not yet covered so most people would not be confident about what was going on. Still, great class.",
    "The course was well-organized, and DiMeglio is great! Workload is reasonable. Nothing much to complain about.",
    "Strengths: no weekly lab reports, EPs before each lab helped me get familiar with and prepare for lab, very organized, interesting labs that tied connected with each other Weaknesses: lab report and EP grading varied depending on TA",
    "CHEM 222L was a vast improvement over the general chemistry lab, which was a lot of work but little gain. Prof. DiMeglio and my TF did a great job making the course as low-stress and fun as possible. That said, I think I ended up having trouble with the final exam because I don't think I personally saw the connection between what we did in lab and what we were covering in organic chemistry lecture (CHEM 220) as clearly as I should have. I think if that connection were emphasized or explained more deeply, I would have gotten more out of the class.",
    "Some labs were too long, and the workload was at times too much for a half-credit. However, the course was very well taught and the lab facilities were top-notch.",
    "Very interesting and fun course; a high level of involvement is required to do well.",
    "As labs go, this is a good one. My only wish was that grading was more clear. I also don't understand the pedagogical value of a multiple-choice final for a lab course.",
    "I felt the workload was appropriate. I liked the prelab reports and felt they helped engage us. I liked the fact that we did not have a lab report every week, but instead were able to synthesize the information from multiple weeks in our reports. I liked the way our TA gave us the information we needed before lab and that we had time to ask any questions we had. I wish we had been a bit more prepared for the final. It was based on reaction mechanisms, and I felt it was fair, but I wish that the information had been assessed more regularly throughout the course.",
    "Strengths - very useful lab packet with examples on how to write Experimental Protocols, Lab Notes, etc",
    "Since a lot of lab work was tedious and repetitive, the course could have benefitted from more streamlined labs that look less than 4 hours to complete.",
    "The beginning of the course requires a bit of a learning curve, but a few weeks in the lab becomes truly enjoyable.",
    "It is a good course that teaches you exactly what you would expect to learn in the class.",
    "I thought the course was very well organized and all of the experiments were useful in teaching various lab techniques.",
    "One strength of this course was how it focused less on yield and more on processes. It allowed me to be less stressed during lab so that I could focus more on the process and actually learn a bit more. One weakness of this course was how similar a lot of the experiments were. While it was great to get to practice the techniques multiple times, I wish we had gotten to use different chemicals more often.",
    "It was a decent organic lab course overall. The experiments weren't always terribly exciting but still much better than general chemistry labs. I wish that the ability of the student to perform the experiments well and efficiently counted for a larger portion of the grade, instead of basing it mostly on the reports. I thought that the EPs and reports were graded a little arbitrarily, and each TA seemed to have slightly different grading policies and levels of strictness regarding formatting. I was always done with the experiments early and with good results, and had a good understanding of the material but ended up losing a lot of marks for formatting issues which I thought was a bit unfortunate.",
    "This course covers very interesting topics, and has very nice labs. However, the grading is not helpful or connected to actual science. All the points taken off are for formatting, which does not rely on the students' knowledge of chemistry, and instead on the specifics of the graders.",
    "The course was very good at teaching how to use different techniques in the laboratory and how to use those techniques to create a product, separate products, or purify them. However, it was very difficult sometimes to work on our own without any assistance, and lab reports were very lengthy and difficult to put together.",
    "The course overall was interesting and helpful in developing laboratory skills. I felt the course organization was one of the courses largest strengths. The only weakness that stood out was the emphasis on details in lab reports and EPs. For example, people could get every answer correct, but lose full letter grades based solely on a small spelling or grammar mistake.",
    "My strengths in this class were always coming to lab prepared and knowledgeable on the lab of that day. I could improve on looking things up that I didn't know, instead of waiting until lab day to be confused.",
    "I liked how it supplemented the organic chemistry lecture course. I also liked how the lab reports weren't due every week.",
    "The strengths of this course are that it leads the student step-by-step through organic chemistry lab until the student reaches higher level synthesis labs and lab reports. The workload is consistent and doesn't get greater, just covers different things towards the end of the semester.",
    "Very well organized, thoughtful instructors, interesting learning material.",
    "Strengths: quantity of material, depth of material Weaknesses: some questions on the final were very random (ex. the one about seawater). I wish there was some sort of topic outline \/ review session for those types of questions.",
    "Course material lists a lot of required nuances to the assignments but they're organized in a somewhat confusing way, with many sources of information, so it's quite tedious to figure out what's required of the assignment.",
    "Very good explanations.",
    "The course is very interesting and organized very well. The lab packet is easy to follow and very helpful. Professor DiMeglio is very helpful. I wish we spent more time going over the underlying chemical mechanism of the reactions we completed. They seemed to be important to know on the final exam, but we didn't really go over it in class.",
    "Strong course. As always, a lot of work for a lab course. Almost every point I missed (except for on the final) was a formatting mistake, which was of course kind of irritating but we were warned. New labs are a strength",
    "It was a good lab, much better than gen chem.",
    "It is an alright lab course and not as long as general chem lab, but the weakness it that it slightly confusing at times and boring.",
    "strengths: lots of practice with basic organic chemistry techniques and equipment deeper understanding of reactivities of different functional groups understanding of ways to evaluate products and product purity ability to read articles about organic chemistry techniques learned lots about salicylic acid and camphor! (I liked that we were able to focus on just a few molecules in depth--synthesizing, separating them, etc.-- instead of learning\/performing each new technique with a different molecule) scientific writing weaknesses: some of the assignments felt repetitive really high emphasis on formatting never knew where I stood grade wise (never told what the averages were for different assignments, etc.)",
    "The class is very disorganized and it is never clear what is expected of students. This class would benefit from a clearer explanation\/schedule of what is due for lab each week.",
    "The experiments are very straightforward and easy to understand.",
    "Great help during lab time - the instructor, TA, and lab manager are all there to answer your questions and want you to succeed. Only issue would be the final exam, it was just very abstract and hard to study for.",
    "This class was very well run. I learned a considerable amount about writing an effective lab report and felt that the work load was very fair for a lab course.",
    "This class was very interesting. I felt like I learned a lot but didn't have to work too hard. The lab reports were good because we had to understand the reactions at play but there wasn't too much writing.",
    "I thought this course provided a good opportunity to learn new technical skills for developing and working with organic compounds. In terms of weaknesses, the course seemed to be rather unorganized and confusing in its materials and instructions. I think sometimes material could have been outlined more clearly, especially in terms of what was required for assignments.",
    "The course was taught well, the procedures were straight forward, and the lab reports were very doable. The professor and the TA's were all very helpful and informative, which made the class worth while. The course's downfall is that it requires the same, if not more, time as any other class, but it worth half the credit.",
    "Strengths: The class is very fun, and you will produce interesting substances while being able to try novel techniques. It will feel much less tedious than general chemistry lab, as most labs have at least a few new components. The lab space itself is extremely nice and well kept, and you will have quite a bit of autonomy in the lab. Lab report grading, where the bulk of the grade comes from, although it takes quite a bit of steady, careful work, is fair and made explicit. Professor DiMeglio does her best to stay engaged with a large number of students. She is friendly, enthusiastic, and clearly very knowledgable. Weaknesses: A large portion of the final grade is dependent on a multiple choice exam, which I wish we had been more prepared for. Although the lab manual has \"exam questions,\" most students only began to use them, by our own faults, at the end of the semester. Would rather a lab practical, as that seems like it would better reflect what the semester was spent on.",
    "I enjoyed each lab and loved the fact that the grade was not reliant on percent yield or recovery. This allowed me to only worry about thinking through why each step was important rather than worrying about my yield at the end. My only suggestion for the course would be to have a group lecture at the beginning of the lab. I found that each TA discussed the experiment at different lengths which was not completely fair to each student.",
    "Didn't stress why reactions proceeded as they did. We really only learned how to perform the experiments, not why they happened as they did, like the mechanisms behind each. With the orgo lecture class we learned some of it but it should have been taught more.",
    "This course is very well-taught. The lab instructions were always very clear and the TAs and professor Dimeglio were always very helpful.",
    "I really enjoyed the course. It was the right amount of work for a chemistry lab, and I liked having the EPs before each lab and only some post labs in the semester.",
    "This class was very well taught. The course work was very straightforward and the TAs were very helpful.",
    "This course is well organized except for the final exam, which seemed like a disconnect from the way we learned in lab. Having a multiple choice exam removed us from actually focusing on doing all the techniques well.",
    "Some strengths of the course are its focus on building experimental and scientific writing skills as well as the frequent feedback received from my TF through graded assignments. A weakness of the course is that it only meets once a week, which limits the amount of material that can be covered.",
    "The course was very good at challenging students to actually understand the concepts behind the experiments, which was quite different from general chemistry lab, and that helped me to develop my ability to think scientifically. Overall, the course was well designed for learning.",
    "The labs were very easy but the grading of lab reports were unnecessarily hard. The instructions were not very straightforward or clear as to what was expected on the lab reports, and points were taken off disproportionately. I think the standards should be clarified more (course packet streamlined and updated). I also think there should be more incentive to show mastery in the techniques; I had some of the best results in the class but that gave no advantage in my grade.",
    "I was very happy with orgo chem lab, especially compared to general chemistry lab, which I took last year. We were not kept in lab for an excessive amount of time, and everything we did was worthwhile and beneficial to learning. I appreciated that each week built off of previous information, skills we learned, or experiments we had done, to allow us to build an in-depth understanding of organic chemistry lab practices. This structure really allowed me to learn and retain a lot, compared to other labs I have done which jump around each week.",
    "Overall this was a fantastic course. Every aspect was planned out perfectly, and I felt the the instructor and TFs cared deeply about the students' experiences with the course. Everything was fair and expectations were clearly laid out. Time was never wasted, and unlike in many other lab courses, working on the lab reports increased understanding of the material. My only suggestion for improvement is that the TFs could make the importance of safety and proper handling of chemicals are important for everyones success. I noticed that some students would ignore the instructions for handling different chemicals safely, for example, diluting acids in a graduated cylinder, or would be careless in using the wrong spatula for solid reagents or leaving volatile reagents uncapped or loosely capped. The TFs did an excellent job overall and explained that these things were important on the first day, but afterward did not enforce this very much.",
    "This course introduces students to a wide range of important Organic Chemistry laboratory techniques and equipment. There is a strong emphasis on proper communication of data, with thoroughness expected and rewarded (this can be both a strength and a weakness). I think this course could possibly be better if there were more correspondence between the experiments and the topics covered in first semester Organic Chemistry lecture classes, although I understand this might be difficult in practice."

   "comments": [
    "Yes, but I think it's better if you have taken gen. chem. lab first",
    "I would recommend this class to another student. DiMeglio is very helpful and willing to answer questions.",
    "Only if you have to take it, lab is horrible",
    "I would not recommend this class unless it is necessary.",
    "This was a time consuming and difficult lab class, but it was well done. It has a very clear course packet, creating structure, and it is very clear what is required of you in order to do well. I highly recommend this course as a complement to the Chem 220 class.",
    "You probably are taking this because you have to, but have no fear. It is nothing like orgo, the course. In fact, I would recommend this lab even to non-science majors.",
    "Great lab",
    "Yes, the information and techniques are valuable.",
    "Yes, would definitely recommend! Youre probably taking this lab because you have to, but since Prof. DiMeglio is super cool and well-organized with her expectations of the class (there are dozens of students in class every day of the week, but she makes a real effort to go around and get to know each student on a personal level, which is incredible considering the size of orgo lab), it should be very manageable. Lab starts at 1, but our section routinely finished and was out the door by 3:30 or even earlier. The course itself is really straightforward, and it is really easy to do well, especially if you have a great TF, though youll probably do just fine even without one.",
    "Likely, you're taking this in conjunction with Organic Chemistry. I recommend this, though. There's not much work and it's a phenomenal course. Lab is fun!",
    "If you're interested in learning about lab techniques and applying organic knowledge to a lab context, take this course!",
    "Maybe it was because of the new chemistry lab building that was open with lots of windows, but unlike gen chem lab, this lab does not make you want to kill yourself. The lab reports are so much more worthwhile than gen chem in that you don't waste an inordinate amount of time doing them (still more than a half credit should be...) and you do learn through completing them. If you have skilz at being efficient then you will always get out early from experiments, AND you aren't graded on results!!! So if the experiment didn't result in 100% yield (as none do in real life labs) you won't be counted off.",
    "This class is required for many science majors and pre-med students; I would not recommend it to students who don't have to take it.",
    "Orgo lab is loads of fun. Take it.",
    "Yes, fun and easy half credit.",
    "Great course.",
    "Yes, you get to learn so much from the course.But, keep in mind that you need to work for it too.",
    "No. It was a tolerable course literally only because of Dr. DiMeglio.",
    "So much better than the living hell that was Gen chem lab. God rest the souls of those poor freshmen this year. Bless orgo lab for the simple fact that it isn't gen chem lab.",
    "Take this for pre-med requirements or chemistry major",
    "Yes, loved it.",
    "The only lab I have ever taken that was actually a .5 credit class. Workload is pretty easy to stomach, lab itself is fun in its own way, and SO MUCH BETTER than GenChem lab. If GenChem scared you away, you will be put wonderfully at ease by this course. It's great.",
    "This course teaches valuable skills and is much more enjoyable than general chemistry lab. Kinda irrelevant to recommend though since you probably will only take it if you have to.",
    "Only if they need it for requirements? It's just an okay class overall. The instructor (loved DiMeglio) and lab staff were the only things I really liked about the course.",
    "This is sooo much better than gen chem lab. The work load is manageable (no weekly reports!), the procedures are clear, and Prof. Dimeglio takes a real interest in making sure every student knows what is going on and how to improve skills. It is all technique based and by the end of the semester, I felt very comfortable with techniques.",
    "I loved this lab. It was exactly what a lab should be - not too much work outside of class but still work that is good preparation for chemistry techniques and research.",
    "I would recommend the class but only if you need it for your major. It's quite a lot of work for half a credit.",
    "I would, especially if the student is also taking the class at the same time. I had a lot of fun in the class, and though it was well taught by the wonderful Dr. DiMeglio.",
    "If you're taking it, you probably have to take it. That said, it's fun, and don't dread it even though it takes up 4 hours of your day.",
    "I would recommend this course to you, only if you take it in conjunction with or after Organic Chemistry (CHEM 220). Otherwise, the concepts might be difficult and\/or not worthwhile to pick up.",
    "If you need a lab, this is a good one to take and was not too demanding",
    "Yeah its a fun lab.",
    "Don't take this course for fun. The lab work itself is fine and the subject itself is interesting, but the workload and the sheer amount of effort required to just format things the way they want is not worth it. If you're looking for a course that will stress you out over trivial things while only marginally increasing your knowledge of the subject in comparison, this is it.",
    "Yes I would. It definitely helps with student's practical lab skills.",
    "Yes, it is a premed recommended class.",
    "If another student is taking organic chemistry for fun, then yes. Otherwise, it is probably required.",
    "This course is important if you are pre-med, of course. And also if you are interested in chemistry.",
    "This course is definitely something that you take if you have to or if you really love chemistry, and want to work in organic chemistry synthesis. If you have to take this class it is totally fine and much better than general chemistry lab. If you love chemistry I am sure you will like it.",
    "Twas fine.",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend this course to another student. I was pleased with our labs and the instructors were wonderful!",
    "I would highly recommend this course to a student that has an interest in science and would like to learn some interesting, yet important aspects of organic chemistry.",
    "This was a really great class. It is much better than Gen Chem lab, and more fun than physics lab. If you are worried about it, don't be. The workload is pretty consistent throughout the semester, with only a few major lab reports, but make sure they don't sneak up on you. Overall, it was actually a great class that you shouldn't be afraid to take.",
    "Orgo lab is definitely miles better than other lab courses. The techniques and experiments build at a steady pace and you definitely come out with a good grasp of things like distillation and column chromatography. Relatively painless lab that always lets out about and 1-1.5 hours early. The assignments aren't too bad but start the Post-Lab Assignments in advance because those can creep up real fast! It doesn't make sense having a one-hour multiple-choice final exam since that is not a format that any other portion of the course follows, but you just have to memorize the answers to the exam study questions at the end of each lab.",
    "I would recommend this course to other students, but do study for the final lab exam. Study hard for it.",
    "Yes i would recommend it. It is a definite step up from Gen Chem Lab and Dr. DiMeglio is a great mentor. Not to mention the TA's were super helpful and very responsive to email. It allows you to gain more confidence in the lab with ample amount of guidance along the way.",
    "You're likely not taking this unless you have to, but in summary: this course is miles better than the intro genchem lab sequence--by far. However, you do need to keep on top of it and there are some bigger assignments. Grading seems to depend on your TF, some of which graded extremely harshly, so the only lowlight was that most of the semester was spent worrying about section grade curving. Besides that though, solid course.",
    "No, I would not recommend this course to most people unless you are premed or a chemistry major. The teaching staff and instructor are great, but you just do synthesis\/purification labs over and over again. I did not feel excited or passionate about the labs and reports, but I did learn a bit.",
    "This is a great lab, very interesting. Not very demanding and very enjoyable.",
    "You pretty much will only take it if you have to, but with that being said, it is pretty relaxed, and overall a good course.",
    "Dearest reader, you know you have no choice but to take this class anyway, but let me enlighten you on the details. First, if you are coming from CHEM 136, congratulations. This class pales in comparison to the tedious level of anxiety felt throughout that class. Prof. DiMeglio is a very fair and reasonable professor. She expects what a lab professor should from her students. Lab reports are few and far between but take those seriously. Those make up a very large chunk of you grade. If you do have time, ask you TF for help on anything you are confused about. Other than that, this is your standard lab class. Don't worry about grades too much per se. They still matter but unlike 134\/136, your grades are normalized to your TF, not to the entire class. Good luck my friend",
    "Probably a required class if you're taking it, but would recommend nonetheless.",
    "Yes, it's a good class to learn Organic Chemistry applied to a lab scenario.",
    "It's not hell if you have to take it for a major or some other requirement, but I wouldn't really classify it as \"light fun.\"",
    "First semester Orgo lab overall was an enjoyable experience. There were clear guidelines and examples of lab reports and experimental methods and there were weekly emails to help us plan and properly prepare for upcoming assignments. For student who have to take this lab, especially premed students, I would recommend it.",
    "Great class to supplement lecture orgo, and all around enjoyable class.",
    "Yes this course is very fun and you learn a lot as well.",
    "Totally recommended. From the labs themselves, to the TA, to the professor, to the facilities, this course is GREAT.",
    "You're probably taking this because you have to (don't commit yourself to 4 hours in a lab per week if you don't have too), but I think this is definitely a non-painful requirement. Definitely miles better than gen chem lab. Work load is super reasonable, DiMeglio is nice, and the labs are manageable.",
    "A much more manageable lab than gen chem. The experiments were pretty interesting, and the workload isn't that bad. The exam does sneak up on you, so prepare early for it.",
    "So much better than lab for GenChem. It's better equipped, for one thing, and the way the course is structured means that you actually learn something. There's more independent work outside of the lab (for the reports, you have to have some understanding; they don't just walk you through every calculation) but it just means you learn the material better. You probably have to take it anyways, but at least it's not terrible.",
    "Yes, it is a calm lab course and lets you learn the material without stressing out about the details.",
    "Yes. You'll learn different important techniques. The workload is much lighter than gen Chem lab with no weekly lab reports (only 3 cumulative lab reports) but weekly EPs before each lab. The labs are not difficult and are more straightforward than gen Chem.",
    "You do learn a lot during this course, and it is very well taught. However, though this is just half-a-credit of work, at times it did feel way more than that. The post lab assignments are very time-consuming , and the lab itself is tedious and tiring, so do not underestimate this course.",
    "Yes, if you are interested in hands-on approaches to organic chemistry.",
    "If you're taking it, you need it, but it's fine.",
    "Much better than intro chem lab. Less work, less stress, more straightforward, and more related to what you're actually learning in lecture. Plus, DiMeglio is an amazing lab instructor, who will help you with anything you need.",
    "Yes, but only to fulfill the lab requirement for chemistry and MB&B majors.",
    "I would recommend this lab to anyone who needs it. I don't necessarily think that students taking Orgo who don't have an Orgo Lab requirement (either for a major or med school) should take it.",
    "As far as required courses go, this one was pretty good.",
    "Taking lab is definitely a good learning experience, and as long as you pay attention, follow instructions, and come prepared, you will do well.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student.",
    "Overall a good organic lab course. The experiments and reports are quick and painless, though not very exciting. The grading policies and expectations for EPs and reports isn't always clear and consistent across TAs, which made it a bit frustrating.",
    "This course is very interesting, but the grading could be improved. The feedback is not clear at all.",
    "Yes, but only if the student has a requirement to take the course. It is very difficult and is geared towards people who need to learn how to use the laboratory and need to know how to write in scientific language.",
    "I would recommend this course if it is required for your major.",
    "WAY better than Gen. Chem lab.",
    "Yes, I liked it much more then general chemistry lab. It was fun and interesting.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student as a strong introduction to organic chemistry lab under relatively low-stress conditions.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this class to another student. It was a great lab course! It was much better and much more enjoyable than general chemistry lab. I felt like I learned a lot and understood everything that was going on. The workload was also much more manageable. Overall, it was a good experience!",
    "Obviously don't take it if you don't need to. But, as a requirement, it is relatively straightforward and engaging.",
    "Yes for STEM majors",
    "Yes. Very good experiments and instruction.",
    "This class is significantly better than gen Chem lab. If you have to take it, then take it. It's very enjoyable, but just be aware that the final exam is more difficult than the final practical in general chemistry lab.",
    "Yeah, but not an easy A. WATCH FORMATTING of lab reports\/worksheets. The lab reports are worth a lot of points. I love how DiMeglio cares so much about her students and tries to stop by and talk to everyone. Overall more fun and less tedious than Gen Chem, but not necessarily less work although there are no pre lab quizzes\/\/formal lectures. If your confused about a concept, go ahead and email DiMeglio as she answers promptly and has clear explanations.",
    "take if you need it, if not then don't bother.",
    "It goes along with the class well, not a bad pre-req.",
    "If you follow the rules, you should be fine. I didn't do well in this course because I didn't follow the guidelines thoroughly. Oh, and the final is multiple choice, which sounds nice, but it's actually pretty difficult.",
    "Enjoyed the course! Reinforced organic chemistry concepts, felt very comfortable with the techniques by the end of the term.",
    "Yes, this course teaches useful laboratory skills.",
    "A great organic chemistry lab course, you have to put in the work, but you are able to succeed.",
    "Absolutely!",
    "Take it! It's interesting and relatively painless. So much better than gen chem lab.",
    "If you want to improve your technical laboratory skills and conceptual understanding of organic chemistry, I recommend this course.",
    "The class requires a lot of time since labs take at least 3 hours to complete, but it is very doable and so much better than gen chem lab. The lab reports are also relatively short and to the point, although they require more thinking to complete.",
    "A fun lab, but definitely only for those that need it for a major\/pre-med requirements. Lab reports take quite a bit of time, and the lab period itself is quite a big chunk, so definitely quite interesting for those that are required to take it but not for those that do not need to.",
    "For anyone interested in organic chemistry or anyone that needs this course credit, this course is extremely interesting and engaging. I enjoyed each lab and looked forward to the experiments.",
    "Yes, better than gen chem lab for sure.",
    "Overall, orgo lab was never all too difficult or stressful. I feel as though I learned a fair amount, and the pace was good. In my opinion, this lab was a much more accurate reflection of what working in an actual lab is like than general chemistry lab, which was too fast-paced and had very stringent requirements.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course. It is a nice complementation to the lecture course and it's very interesting.",
    "If you have to take this class, make sure you take good notes on your EP and be careful to include all sections on your assignments.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to any student that is currently taken or has already taken their 1st semester of organic chemistry. The course provides a great introduction to performing basic organic chemistry research in the laboratory.",
    "This course was very useful and actually pretty fun. The lab work was targeted and felt like the sort of work that is done actual synthesis labs (but much simpler) as opposed to a set of experiments performed simply to demonstrate concepts.",
    "Yes, it is a great class and I enjoyed the lab. But be very careful to read exactly how lab reports are supposed to be prepared because there are instructions in separate documents that are easy to miss.",
    "I would highly recommend orgo chem lab to another student. It was well organized, understandable, and manageable. I felt like I benefited and learned from each experiment and lab write-up requirement, which made the course very satisfying.",
    "I would recommend this course. The organization of the course was excellent and the instructor and TFs could not have been nicer or more helpful. The workload is very manageable compared to other lab courses. Labs usually lasted 3 hours although some took more or less time. Preparation each week involved preparing an experimental procedure which took me 1-2 hours. We had three post lab assignments throughout the semester which each contained part of a lab report. These took 3-4 hours to complete thoroughly. Feedback and expectations are clear. You learn a lot about good general lab practices as well as organic chemistry techniques.",
    "I would recommend this course, as it provides a comprehensive introduction to Organic Chemistry laboratory experiments as well as training in proper scientific communication.",
    "Take it with DiMeglio. She's fantastic"
