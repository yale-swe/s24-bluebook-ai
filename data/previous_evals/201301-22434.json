    "This class is a study of the first avant garde movement: the Futurists. The course will look at the various aspects of the movement and its involvement in various fields of art with a strong eye for the confluence of art and life. Take this course if you are interested in seeing how life and art intertwine and how a movement fromthe early 1900s can challenge ideas that we hold even to this day.",
    "Pretty easy art course, the movement was very compelling.",
    "Excellent look at a controversial movement.",
    "Fabulous class. Dean Fabbri is a wonderful man and smiles often. Open-ended assignments and projects are a welcome and refreshing change to normal schoolwork at Yale - interactive, hands-on, interdisciplinary. I really enjoyed it. And I'm not the kind of person who enjoys class.",
    "Futurism is an awesome class, and dean Fabbri is an awesome teacher. He is creative and kind and dedicated to a very specific Italian time period. He's extremely knowledgable. Also, all the assignments are awesome.",
    "I would recommend this class to a curious student who wants to think about culture in a new way",
    "Take this course if you get in! It's really fun and the information is interesting. There is not much reading, but it is quality. Also, for your final and midterm, you have the option of cooking a meal, writing a short play, writing a poem, doing an artwork . . . you can pretty much do anything you want to do, as long as it relates to what you learned in class. Again, take it!"
