    "I would take it. This is the best way to learn economics at Yale. Tolga is awesome, and it's really nice to be in a seminar setting. Sometimes the material got dull, but that is just how economics is sometimes. The midterm and quizzes are very fair.",
    "Yes, take it absolutely - especially if all that is holding you back from the other econ options is calculus\/a math base.",
    "I would certainly recommend Econ 108 to another student, and have already. I would summarize that the course is a fun, upbeat class that covers all the necessities of introductory Microeconomics. The course is additionally wonderful because of the teaching of Professor Koker, and just generally by the fact that there is much time for one-on-one teaching with students and the professor.",
    "If you have to take this class, then you don't have a choice. If you have a passionate drive to begin to learn Economics, take this course3. If you just want a QR, DON'T take this course. You begin with the easy basics of supply and demand, but there are a lot of equations to memorize. And they become more and more difficult.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS!! You learn so much and its super life applicable. You will feel really enriched and the workload is super chill. Tolga is also a phenomenal teacher.",
    "This is a great class if you are interestedin Econ but do not have an especially strong math background. I havent had any past calculus experience and this class was fine for me. Tolga is very helpful and is willing to put in just as much time as you are to insure you understand the material. Attending his office hours any time you need help or emailing him is one way to be sure you understand everything. I would definitely recommend this class to another student. As far as microeconomics go, this class was very good. Nothing was too difficult and the teacher was very fun and upbeat and helpful."
