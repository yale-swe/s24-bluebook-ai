    "An amazingly in-depth survey of terrestrial Arthropods.",
    "Fun and interesting course that you can take even if you aren't a science major.",
    "PSA THIS IS NOT A SCIENCE GUT. Marta is a soothing, caring and dedicated professor but don't let that fool you. Unless you are one of those outdoorsy types who drape themselves in spider webs and dab yourselves with eau de dung beetle, you will find yourself in a harsh jungle of trivia. In short, one of the few Yale classes more about wasps than WASPs.",
    "Awesome class! You should definitely take it if you need a SC credit or a class to take in general. Marta is an engaging lecturer and extremely caring about her students.",
    "Great course! Dr. Wells is one of the most awesome professors you will ever meet. She has a great sense of what sort of things her students will like. For example: A beetle trying to have sex with a beer bottle. A bee trying to have sex with a flower. A bee colony frying a hornet to death. Zombie beetles. And lots of spiders with really chill dance moves. Shop it if you're even a bit interested, just be aware that it's quite memorization heavy (the tests are 100% writing).",
    "Yes! Great as a science credit, but also great for an E&EB major (I'm one). Not too hard, but you really learn quite a lot of cool stuff about insects. Though you don't have too, take the lab if you can! Gives a lot of context to the class, and it's really fun. Dr. Wells is also the absolute bomb!",
    "Don't be fooled by the subject-it is not a gut at all. In fact, it is a pretty comprehensive and fascinating look into arthropods with a big focus on spiders. You'll learn a lot, and you'll get a newfound appreciation for those little critters you wanted out of your house. Middle third of class is most interesting-it's about reproduction, predation, survival tactics, all that fun stuff. There are Nat geo vids in each class-really fucking cool. Marta is great-sometimes hard to follow, but lovely nonetheless. Midterms are hardish, you gotta study to get a good grade. Not too difficult a class though. Be warned, everyone will judge the shit out of you when you tell them you're in bugs. Haters gone hate, don't let me get to you.",
    "Computer science\/cog sci majors: Insects and other arthropods are basically little robots. If you are interested in your majors, you will find immensely interesting material in this course. Though this is a biology class that doesn't *explicitly* deal with invertebrate information processing or what kinds of algorithms are implemented or their brains to solve problems or anything, there is a ton of scholarship out there about insect visual processing\/navigation algorithms etc. that you can use for the short paper in the class. On top of that, lectures are consistently fun and interesting. Prepare to watch a bunch of footage of David Attenborough-narrated documentaries, too.",
    "A lecture with three tests (lowest grade dropped), a short paper, and a final. Optional lab.",
    "Biology of Terrestrial Arthropods is a survey course that introduces students to the diversity of arthropods on Earth and their general physiology. The class does not focus so much on taxonomy (the lab does), but rather on general behavior and morphology. I left the class with an appreciation of a part of this world that I knew little about and overlooked prior to the class. Man, there's some crazy stuff in this world! Professor Wells does a good job of passing off excitement at the arthropods of the world and incorporates lots of videos to show students examples of behaviors or species we are discussing about class. The class is intriguing and very little work so long as you pay attention in class. I would recommend this class if you want to learn more about the diversity of life on the Earth but don't expect to come away with an extremely in-depth understanding of all arthropods. The class is quite general.",
    "I'd thought this would be more like the botany class, where you walk through the entire phylogenetic tree and learn about all the different groups of critters. But most of it was broad biological concepts, which can be reduced to the following: there are lots of bugs. If you can think of it, there are bugs that do it. Which is interesting, from a species diversity and ecological perspective, but won't help one tell an aphid from an antlion.",
    "Definitely take this class. Light workload, interesting lectures, and lots of fun facts about bugs.",
    "A fantastic class. Marta is so clearly excited by the subject that you can't help but get excited too! I learned so much and \"cool facts about bugs\" ended up being the main conversation topic almost every time I skyped home. Not too much work, though you do have to study well for the exams (but it's fun to study for because the material is so interesting!) One mini-paper that doesn't take too long, and other than that just go to class and enjoy.",
    "I have already recommended E&EB 250 to many of my friends.",
    "The course is fun, the professor is kind, and the exams are not too difficult. I would recommend the course to any student with an interest in insects or who wants to learn more about the natural world.",
    "I loved this class! I'm not at all an E&EB major, and this was my science credit, which I chose because it's really interesting, and isn't a gut. It's definitely less work than probably most science classes, but you do need to study for the exams, and attending lecture is necessary unless you're willing to do almost all the reading. The professor, Marta Wells, is amazing, and she makes the class so worth it! She's super sweet, sincere, and her slides are great. ALL THE BUG VIDEOS!! The exams are fair, and the paper is an interesting way to learn more about the topic. Definitely take the class if you're interested in bugs, and if you aren't, take it anyway and you'll learn to love them!",
    "Take it! I learned a ton and actually enjoyed the class."
