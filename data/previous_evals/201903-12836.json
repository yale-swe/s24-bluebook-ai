    "This course, as an inherent part of how it is framed, required involvement of different faculty members to be a part of it at times, and contribute as guest lecturers on variety of topics that they individually have some expertise on. A few faculty members did, but many didn't. This idea that professional seminars could be a wonderful gateway to exposing students to individual expertise of different faculty members, providing the students the multi-dimensional exposure on how to be a successful scientist, was perhaps the greatest strength of this semester's professional seminar. The fact that many members of the faculty didn't get involved in that fantastic endeavor was perhaps its biggest weakness.",
    "This course was composed entirely of incoherent ramblings from the professor. The students gained nothing from this course, it only served to take away time from research, classes, and teaching duties. Most students just did this other work during the class time. The course could be improved by eliminating it. It's representative of this aging department's outdated practices. There desperately needs to be improvements, because it can't go on like this."

    "I would not recommend this course to another student. In its current form, with this professor, it is a complete waste of time."
