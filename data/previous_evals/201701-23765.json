    "This is a monthly seminar that brings in modelers from many different concentrations. These talks are consistently the most engaging, thought-provoking seminars across my experience at YSPH. Even people not enrolled in the modeling concentration can and do attend the talks.",

    "Good seminar series on healthcare modeling.",
    "Great seminar speakers. My only complaint would be to let us know when seminars are going to be cancelled.",
    "The seminars were interesting but communication about the events and when they are cancelled needs to be made more clear."
