   "comments": [
    "This course is demanding and requires you to really grapple with some of the key issues facing journalism and democracy today. It would be easy to criticize the course for being to Western-centric, but the readings are compelling and carefully chosen, and if you do the work, you'll be able to apply what you learn to any context. Sleeper has a real agenda with this course--he wants to inoculate you against all the horrible realities of the corporate agenda in today's world--and if you don't agree with him on that, the course might feel like a struggle.",
    "I would strongly recommend this course; it has been among my favorite classes at Yale. It both challenged and augmented my previous understanding of journalism and its implications for the public sphere. Much of what makes this seminar so rewarding is its broad scope and its ability to consider journalism within a multi-disciplinary context. I have to admit, after the first few weeks I began to question when we were going to start talking about journalism. This is because the class begins by exploring theories of nationalism, the public sphere, and the rise of newspapers through print capitalism. It wasn't until later that I realized we had been talking about journalism, in some sense, all along. The class takes the time to set up a foundation that ultimately proves very valuable to future discussions about journalism in its present and evolving form. Beyond this, Professor Sleeper is one of the most thoughtful and dedicated professors I've had at Yale. While he asks a lot of his students, he puts in just as much time and energy throughout the semester-- and all of it really does pay off in terms of deepening your understanding of the material. Don't pass up an opportunity to take this class!"
