    "You learn the main beliefs of many philosophers and how to work in the workplace when under strained circumstances.",
    "Horrible class. The homework is the most mind numbing busy work ever, lectures are as boring as you could ever imagine, and the material itself isn't much more interesting.",
    "I have never taken any kindness of ethics or philosophy course but this course was an incredible introduction to both. I became acquianted with a variety of philosophical schools of thought and learned how they have been applied throughout time as well as their strengths and weaknesses.",
    "I learned about interesting ethics dilemmas in careers in the professional and the basics of ethical theories.",

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I think the lectures could be more structured. That being said, the topics were incredibly interesting and thought-provoking each class.",
    "Reasonable amount of work and time commitment",
    "Strengths: the class has no exams, just weekly case studues which are basically reading comprehension, three take home case studues which are really similar, and a final paper. Sometimes attendance was taken but usually is based on if you pick up and drop off your case studies at each class. Mercedes is a great human being. Weaknesses: sometimes the case studies were a little long.",
    "I really liked the course and I feel that if you actually attend class and listen to lectures, you really do learn a lot. The presentations are very thorough and flow very logically, making it easy to understand some difficult concepts. I can't believe I'm writing this, but I think the class could actually be more punitive and harsher. I'm writing that preemptively not based on my experience, but because I'm sure a lot of people will write that they didn't learn that much, but they're also the ones who LITERALLY never showed up to class, or played on their computers the whole time if they did. Honestly if you showed up and paid attention, you learned a lot. Professor Carreras genuinely doesn't want her students to suffer (she puts a ton of effort into her classes) and it really bothers me that a lot of students seem to think that suffering is directly correlated with engagement.",
    "Professor carreras is great and very willing to meet with students. She makes complex concepts easy to understand.",
    "Maybe more in class discussion could elevate the level of engagement.",
    "Great professor i enjoyed whenever i was in class. The cases were also very interesting",
    "Her lectures were a little bit disjointed. I really appreciated how hard she tried to engage the students and let us participate but the setting of the classroom kind of made that difficult.",
    "The main strength of this course is that it teaches a lot of ethical theories that are very applicable to the real world and the cases we looked at for homework were all very interesting and relevant. No real weaknesses.",
    "Its a gut that is all",
    "Good content, but maybe turning in and picking up of homework could be better organized.",
    "Mercedes is very caring and understands that the life of a college student can be very stressful. Unfortunately, many of the students in the class did not use this opportunity wisely to come to class and have a conversation, which is what I think could improve the class even more. Mercedes encourages us to make our own decisions, and this gives us a chance to look at our own lives and decide what is ethical. I would not have read as much as I did if it weren't for this class and learned what I needed to through the case studies.",
    "Strengths: super easy Weaknesses: boring, poorly taught... and did I mention boring?",
    "This course provides a very reasonable amount of work while also stressing the main points of each topic learned. The one weakness is the organizational structure of the class in terms of receiving and returning work.",
    "This course could be improved by moving fully digital. It is environmentally insensitive that 150 students are using 3-5 pages for each case which is 2-3 sheets double sided for each of the 34 cases which would be 3*34*150 = 15, 300 SHEETS OF PAPER WASTED. this class is completely ridiculous waste of paper. Sorry I forgot the 12-15 page final essay that was also required in print so 15,300 +12*150 = 17,100 sheets of paper. 8,333.3 sheets of paper are in 1 tree which would mean this class has killed 2 trees more or less.",
    "I thought this was a great course and loved the way it was set up.",
    "Very easy course- Professor Carreras is a true gem and cares so much about her students!",
    "The strength is that all the lectures were engaging and focused on a new topic each time. We even had a guest speaker who was able to demonstrate how what we were researching was particularly relevant to the modern world.",
    "Dr. Carreras is fantastic. Extremely nice and accommodating, and really cares about her students. I learned more than I thought I would, and the class didn't have too high of a time commitment. It would be nice if the readings\/homeworks were closer to the material that was covered in lecture though.",
    "Professor Carreras is a kindhearted, insightful and intellectual woman. She truly cares about her students. I only wish that more people felt the urge to engage in the discussions she tries to facilitate. My strongest critique is that the questions for the reading responses are incredibly tedious and in some instances pointless\/without depth. In most cases are forced to regurgitate information rather than engage with it.",
    "Professor is very nice. Some of the material seemed somewhat redundant and repetitive.",
    "Strengths: Mercedes is awesome and really cares about her student's performance Weaknesses: the weekly homework cases got to be incredibly tedious",
    "The homework tends to get a little repetitive. Perhaps a few creative assignments\/projects could replace a few of the write-ups.",
    "A strength was that the readings are very interesting and relevant to everyone's lives. I felt like I got a lot out of the readings. A weakness is that the lectures were hard to follow and sometimes felt like a waste of time.",
    "Great course! Professor Carreras is fantastic and a great lecturer.",
    "I think this class is well intentioned and covers an important topic, but I think the mechanism through which it tries to instruct students about ethics in the workplace is poor. The homework assignments were too easy and it seemed like they were arbitrarily graded.",
    "The readings for this course are actually quite interesting. I enjoyed doing them, and I think that having the reading questions is a good way to force people to do it. However, answering these questions often took a long time and felt very tedious\/useless, because the questions essentially just tested reading comprehension. I think there could be fewer questions per reading, but the questions could force you to think more\/integrate what we talk about in lecture with what is in the reading.",
    "Strength: Very chill and relaxed, not much work, interesting videos in class Weakness: Not at all intellectually challenging or stimulating",
    "Strength is that the material extremely interesting. The weakness is that the material is not really tested upon, which creates a disinterest in the class.",
    "I thought the content (case studies) were very interesting and explored a variety of different subjects. I would say that having more in class discussions related to the case-studies could perhaps help with the understanding of the fundamental principles embedded within the studies.",
    "Designed for seniors who need an easy class. Great and stress free. Somewhat interesting"

   "comments": [
    "If you want to learn about a variety of topics take this class",
    "This is probably one of the worst classes I've taken at Yale. It has the reputation of being a gut, which is the reason a lot of people take it, but it has an annoying amount of weekly assignments which are nothing more than busy work. They're literally worksheets about articles, but the worksheets are often times incomprehensible and the entire activity boils down to you pulling lines straight out of the article to answer the question. Even though the questions are a joke, the grading isn't forgiving so you have to spend a lot of time on them and fluff up your answers if you want to do well on them. Really infuriating to have to spend a couple of hours doing something so mindless. Take a different class, put your work towards something more worthwhile.",
    "I would recommend this course as a relaxed but still interesting way to learn the basics of philosophy and ethics.",
    "YES.",
    "Yes! You learn about important philosophers and moral theories and how these then relate to the workplace. The class explores business ethics, bioethics, and sexual harrassment along with a whole host of other topics. Professor Carreras is also very kind.",
    "If you are interested in the moral and ethical implications of corporate actions, take it.",
    "Yes, Professor Carreras is excellent and you should take her class.",
    "Yes. Especially seniors. It is a chill class with some important stuff",
    "Good for a 5th or 6th course! I was taking a bunch of really hard pre-med classes this semester, so this class was a breath of fresh air.",
    "Yes, take this course if you can get in! Mercedes is a great professor and she really cares about her students. It's not a lot of work and you learn about a lot of different ethical cases that are very relevant to the world today.",
    "If you need a gut",
    "Yes",
    "Take this class if you need something to even out your workload. It's a good class where you can learn a lot just from listening to Mercedes speak and reading the case studies.",
    "Mercedes is awesome. Fairly easy class because no real tests, but there is homework EVERY Thursday. A little redundant, but nonetheless fairly easy. The homework takes about 1-2 hours every Wednesday night, so if you're not willing to do it then this class isn't for you",
    "Negative. Its easy in the sense that most stuff isn't graded very hard, but the weekly homework and 10-15 page final paper aren't worth it. You are way better of finding an easy lecture with a midterm and final.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to any Yale student. Professor Carreras is an incredible orator that makes old philosophy mean something to our everyday lives.",
    "It is very easy class very similar to a 6th grade ethics course. lots of reading comprehension. CAses are weekly and although easy take a lot of time to complete.",
    "Yes I would, Professor Carreras is amazing. Make sure to take at least one class with her before you graduate!",
    "Yes, I would encourage other students to take this course, because it is important for all people to consider these ethical theories and take the time to think about how they would behave or act in the various situations.",
    "Take it if you are a senior.",
    "Definitely take as an easy 5th course! Very little work needed, but professor Carreras is great and leads a fun class! The final 15 page paper does sneak up on you thought!",
    "I would ABSOLUTELY recommend this class to another student. We had weekly assignments which took about one or two hours to complete, in addition to some other work we did in class. The final essay was a great opportunity to explore an area we were interested in specifically.",
    "Yes. You've probably heard that this class is pretty easy. The homework can get a little repetitive\/lengthy, but for the most part this is true. Still, you can actually learn a fair amount from this class if you go to class and pay attention, especially if you have never taken a philosophy\/ethics class before. Dr. Carreras is very nice and accommodating.",
    "Yes, great class not too challenging",
    "I would recommend this course to other students because it is not overwhelming in work.",
    "Yes",
    "Yes",
    "Yes - great course with a fun, experienced instructor in Carreras",
    "Yes if you are looking for a light workload course.",
    "I would recommend this class to someone who needs a very low-stress class with interesting topics. You probably won't get too much out of the lectures, but the weekly homework assignments do take an hour or two so be prepared to put in work consistently.",
    "IF YOU ARE A SENIOR TAKE THIS COURSE!!!! IF IT IS THE LAST THING YOU DO - TAKE IT!",
    "Absolutely! Great class with easy workload (lots of case studies but you can breeze through them!)",
    "Probably not, again, the course topic is interesting but the class itself was not too engaging",
    "Yes",
    "I would not take this class if you are taking something like CS323. This class is a time drain too (large weekly write-ups).",
    "I would recommend to students interested in not only ethics but students looking to explore how ethics apply to a wide array of subjects.",
    "Take this class if you don't want an intellectual challenge, but an easy class to get through. Good if your work level is high."
