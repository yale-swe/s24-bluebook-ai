   "comments": [
    "The course is demanding, with a substantial amount of reading, which often requires subtle interpretation and insists on fluency (not working knowledge) of French. I would recommend it if the student capable of keeping up.",
    "Fren866 is a survey of art criticism from the 18th to the 19th century.I would recommend it to someone who has a background in art history (not a good introductory course) and who is specifically interested in this topic.",
    "An excellent premise executed poorly. Art criticism is a relatively neglected field of intellectual production outside of art historical scholarship, so the opportunity to study it seems promising. The course, however, read entirely in the primary sources, presenting no contemporary criticism of the nineteenth century material and none of the contemporary scholarly debate on the trajectories of nineteenth-century French art. Indeed, the instructors seemed to have a sense of a story of nineteenth-century art they wanted to tell, but they rarely insinuated the basic outlines of that story, focusing instead on the specifics of what the critics wrote\u00e2\u0080\u0094an approach common to philosophy or literature, but a good portion of the criticism was simply not dense enough to merit such minute examination. Images of works that appeared in the criticism were often presented, and could have opened deeper pathways into the text, but the instructors too rarely encouraged debate between the critics' close observations of the paintings and the students' close observations of the paintings. Few students had prior training in the close examination of art, but the course offered no models of how to carry out thatexamination. The instructors had such radically different reactions to the material and approaches to pedagogy that the seminars often felt like two separate sessions, rather than a discussion between disciplines or philosophies. At the very least, a future version of the syllabus needs to include only one or two historical critics each week and pair these critics with sophisticated contemporary accounts of either the criticism or the art under discussion.",
    "This course provides a survey of the issues treated by French art criticism in the 18th and 19th century and also interrogates criticism as a genre. The reading is interesting but not also relevant to classroom discussions, which were often lackluster. The Professors were clearly invested and knowledgeable, but they did not seem to coordinate with one another before class. I would not recommend this course to another student."

   "comments": [
    "While demanding, I found this course very useful and the material a rich base. Extremely pertinent to my specialization, I am thankful the course was offered and wish it could have been stretched to two semesters to allow for deeper and closer reading.",
    "My comprehension of French improved immensely and I know feel fully prepared to take and pass the language exam. It also lent me a new perspective to use in my analyses of 19th c. French art that I didn't have before. This class has allowed me to take one step closer to becoming versed and competent in understanding the purview of and continuing problems pertaining to 19th c. French art and criticism."
