   "comments": [
    "I would recommend it because you learn a lot. It is somewhat of a review from L1 and L2, but it improves your spanish a lot.",
    "Spanish 130 is basically a review of spanish rules for conjugation and grammar. Take this class if knowledge of these things is already attained, not to learn these things. If you placed into this class, chances are its better to take this class rather than start a new language.",
    "This is your pretty basic Spanish language course. A lot of emphasis is placed on grammar and vocab. The daily homework assignments are a little excessive and times, but the workload is definitely manageable. My biggest complaint with the class is that there is very little emphasis placed on speaking. Also, professor Safille is a lot of energy, but a lot to handle at times.",
    "It fits the description of intemediate spanish very well. There are a lot of workbook exercises, which includes dialogs with partners, with the occasional Spanish news presentation thrown in. It's conducted entirely in Spanish which was a nice change from high school. The workload is very manageable, and unless you are really into languages, I would take L3 (and possibly L4) to finish your requirement.",
    "Pretty straightforward class, take it if you like spanish and want to learn advanced grammar.",
    "It is a very organized course with constant homework, assessments, and compositions, but it is really effective in terms of being able to learn Spanish.",
    "You obviously have to take Spanish 130 if you need it for the requirement. It's a good review of everything you've learned in Spanish so far and helps to solidify your grammatical skills. I just wish I could have practiced speaking more.",
    "Yes I would recommend this class because I feel like I learned a lot and didn't stress over the class so much.",
    "Yes, take it if you need it for a distributional requirement or if you need a refresher course in spanish. Note that it is a review of L1 and L2, so if you're looking to seriously study spanish, you might want to try and skip to L4.",
    "I would recommend the class because I believe that it does help you strengthen your Spanish by encouraging that you write, read, and speak. Your grades are based on 3 exams, some quizzes, daily homework, two essay compositions, participation, and an oral exam that's a conversation with a partner. While the class is a lot of work, it does help you with your Spanish and Professor Safille is great because she has an engaging personality and cares about her students. If you want to or need to take the class, I recommend taking it and with her."
