    "I learned about Semantics and linguistics in general, as well as how to analytically look at language which was fascinating.",
    "This course gave me a very thorough background in the systems which linguists and philosophers use to model the meaning of natural language. Although the course material gets very advanced and interesting by the end (alternate worlds, modality, tenses, etc.), this course assumes very little prior knowledge and is taught quite accessibly.",
    "- An understanding of movement - A basic knowledge of syntax - usage of lambda calculus as it applies to modality, predicates, movement, adjectives - propositional and first order logic - assorted other topics in linguistics in a discussion section, including modality, tense, the English bare plural, etc.",
    "I learned a lot about semantics, which I had definitely not understood when I started taking this class, as well as an introduction to logic and logical thinking."

    "Overall this was a really good course. I don't think there really was anything to be improved.",
    "Overall this was a great course that I would recommend to almost anyone. However, since it aimed to be accessible to everyone regardless of their math background, the first few weeks were a little slow for me given that I had already taken various math and logic classes. Perhaps, if there is enough interest, it would make sense to teach two versions of this course: one which follows the current curriculum, and one for people with more math experience.",
    "Overall, this course was excellent, but I feel like sometimes we didn't get the chance to fully understand a topic before doing the assignment based on it. We would talk about it conceptually, and understand the theory, and then I would go home to do the assignment and realize that I didn't fully understand how to implement it practically."

    "This was a really great intro to Semantics. I loved learning about language and what it means. It is very math based, however, so be warned, but overall it's very logical and intuitive. I would absolutely recommend this class to people interested in linguistics and the meaning of language, or even mathematics.",
    "Yes. I think a lot of a people would enjoy this course.",
    "I highly recommend this course. It's really fascinating, and Hadas is a great teacher. Whether or not you're interested in linguistics, it's interesting to look at language from this perspective, in a way that's different from most linguistics classes and VERY different from how we think of it in everyday life."
