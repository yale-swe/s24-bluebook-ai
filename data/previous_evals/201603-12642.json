    "The course provided me a substantial background on the history of genocide in the world. It was an invaluable chance for me to put my own research project into conversation with other cases of mass killing in history and to derive new ways of understanding the processes that underpinned genocidal outbursts.",
    "Though this sounds fairly obvious, I feel like I have a much more comprehensive understanding of genocide in different historical contexts (versus the example of my own particular area of study). I can recognize similarities and continuities between what I previously considered unrelated genocidal acts. Prof Kiernan's ability to frame genocide within certain social and historical situations was very helpful for me.",

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Overall, the course was very well designed and informative. I don't perceive any weakness.",
    "The reading was very focused, and discussion was helpful. Prof Kiernan found a healthy balance between encouraging student discussion and providing context and additional details. Only possible improvement is to mitigate the interruption of the course schedule with the Genocide Studies Program seminars; this offset our reading and discussion several times. That said, the seminars were extremely interesting and we all enjoyed them. Hopefully they can be integrated into the syllabus. We also read a few books for weekly reading that were not on the initial book list - maybe include these in the book list so students can acquire the texts ahead of time."

   "comments": [
    "Absolutely, especially those with an interest in the development of mass violence in human society, regardless of their discipline.",
    "Absolutely - this was a comprehensive introduction to genocide and the historical contexts from which it developed. While there is a fair amount of reading, the discussion was useful and often very lively. I would recommend this course to anyone interested by the subject matter, however remotely."
