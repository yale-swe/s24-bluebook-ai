    "I absolutely recommend this course. It's a great introduction to basic Spanish. It's a bit fast paced, but you can definitely manage it. As someone who knew absolutely no Spanish, I did just fine in the course.",
    "I'm against the language requirement but if you get a good teacher it's not the worst in the world. Take a language you like though and don't shy away from obscure ones as kids seem to enjoy them.",
    "I would, but to really improve\/learn spanish, you need to be doing more work and studying than assigned. Take it to get a start on learning a very important language in today's world.",
    "I would recommend it to those who are just starting out spanish and those who want to get easy credit with not a lot of work.",
    "This is a good and well-organized class for learning elementary Spanish.",
    "Take it if you genuinely want to learn spanish. it's super boring but exciting to move forward at a fast pace. don't put the class at the bottom of your priority list because then you will do badly. it's not easy even if you do the homework every night and show up to class every day.",
    "Basically just an intro into the language of spanish. And I'd definitely recommend it."
