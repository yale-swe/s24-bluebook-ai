    "I learned how to be a better writer, a better reader, and a better thinker. This was by far my favorite class. Annie was very engaging, and a great teacher overall. Gave constructive feedback and helped me improve.",
    "I learned a lot of important writing and research skills that will be very helpful for me in future classes and in any career I choose.",
    "I learned a lot about academic writing and how to approach an essay in future humanities classes. Specifically the find a problem\/ respond to the they say framework was really helpful for me.",
    "I feel much more comfortable with my writing capabilities in college, and really feel like I understand how to dissect a piece of text now.",
    "I learned how to develop my complex thoughts and ideas in my essays as well as how to clarify all my information to make it easier for my readers to understand my message. I also learned the importance of finding proof to support all of my claims.",
    "English 114 was immensely useful to me. I had no background in English academic writing before taking English 114, but now I feel very prepared for any future writing assignments. I learned how to structure my ideas and more importantly, smoothly translate those ideas into good writing, something I was not able to do previously.",
    "I learned how to better improve my writing skills through the process of extensive revision. This class focused heavily on writing and rewriting, getting peer input along the way and valuing collaboration.",
    "I learned how to articulate my thoughts into coherent writing worthy of the college level.",
    "This class helped me become a much better writer. The class forces you to write each essay with good organization, which makes your writing clear. It is a great way to start off your writing in college."

   "comments": [
    "This course was engaging. Love it!",
    "There were many strengths of this class including an interesting topic and discussions, a small classroom setting that allowed you to get to know the professor and other students, and lots of valuable feedback and resources to turn to for help.",
    "It would be helpful if there were slightly more writing assignments but otherwise I found all of the assignments really productive and useful.",
    "This course allowed us to focus on a few essays and really develop our writing rather than write many essays with little development. I really thought this made the class more effective. Also, I really liked the topics our class covered as well as the assigned readings. They sparked a lot of thought.As far as weaknesses, I don't really have any. The class was great.",
    "The strong interaction between the teacher and the students, and the easiness at which we could contact Annie was definitely a big strength. I think that the length of the readings we had to do every week was overwhelming sometimes, especially the fact that we don't always use every part of the readings we do.",
    "The course's instructor and the material of this course were pretty strong. Class discussions were engaging as the type of students who took this class were usually genuinely interested in the subject material. The writing component of this course was strong, but there could be a little more guidance on expectations for certain papers. Also, although the readings were interesting, there were a lot of them and at times the workload could feel overwhelming.",
    "This course introduces students to a variety of types of writing. It also compels students to explore different texts, analyzing rhetorical strategies used."

    "Yes! A great course, very engaging, very interesting, very useful, especially given what is going on in the world today.",
    "I would highly recommend this course. It was my favorite course I've taken at Yale so far. You learn important skills and it is very enjoyable and manageable.",
    "Any student who wants to improve their writing should take this course, regardless of ability level coming in.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. I found the topic and a good amount of the readings very interesting, especially when we began to read and write about current issues.",
    "Yes, the topic of the class is very relevant to today's society and the class will give you a great base for writing at Yale. I learned a lot this year and I'm really glad I took the class.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to all upcoming freshmen, especially to international students. We had a lot of fun discussing our ideas, and we learned so much about academic writing over the course of the semester.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student as the subject was very interesting and it was a good way to get a feel of if you need to make some changes to the way you wrote in high school when writing for college. That being said, the class was probably so positive because of a good professor and pretty good group of students. If you take this course, make sure you find the same thing to be true because it is heavily based on interacting with your peers and group collaboration.",
