   "comments": [
    "In this class, I learned so much about value, line quality, line fluidity, and visual vocabulary",
    "This course improved my artistic eye and, in particular, helped me get better at putting what I see onto the page. It definitely improved my realistic drawing skills, but more importantly, it taught me what constitutes a good work of art (beyond realism). It also instilled in me a sense of confidence in my own abilities so that I was more willing to make bold works and work with mistakes instead of being afraid of them.",
    "I learned about the basics of 1 and 2 point perspective, charcoal drawing, value\/mass, and abstract art. I don't come from an art background at all, so I appreciated being exposed to many different styles of art and not feeling completely lost.",
    "Basic drawing speaks for itself in title, but additionally I enjoyed the focus on other Media too. For example, collage and ink.",
    "I developed the ability to draw a bit better. I learned technical knowledge and how to critique the work of others."

   "comments": [
    "I improved so much in this class, it is very rigorous. That being said, it was a very difficult experience for a beginner",
    "This course is great because it pushes everyone to improve but takes into account each student's ability level coming in. This way students are challenged but not overwhelmed. However, I would have liked more of the assignments to have more room for creativity. I always felt more engaged when the assignments were more open-ended or allowed some creative decision making.",
    "It was a great class but the only review I have would be that the details of assignments were sometimes unclear and miscommunicated. Perhaps she could consider sending an email about them on top of verbal communication.",
    "I loved learning about the basics of many styles of art, but I do think the class started out pretty slowly (we drew lines and circles for weeks), so we could have learned and accomplished much more if we just started earlier.",
    "Great survey of the topics presented. I wish there was specific grades more often with greater clarity about exactly what to do to score better.",
    "The strengths of this course are that the classes are small and there is quite a lot of individual attention placed on each student. I do think, however, that the process of assigning homework is quite dysfunctional and honestly very frustrating. If the instructor made use of classes v2 or canvas, even email more regularly so that students had something to rely on for referencing the guidelines of the assignment it would make life much easier for many students. Additionally, even though there were usually specific guidelines given for the assignments, the instructor often failed to bring up these guidelines or failure to actually make an effort to keep to these guidelines in class and during discussion.",
    "This course is strong in many aspects but weak in that it tries to force artists of all levels onto an equal playing field. Where some of the assignments were too hard for me, they were too easy for others.",
    "The course was a great introduction into drawing. However, I felt that the last few weeks were overloaded on work, and we did not have enough time to work on the final project. Also, I thought that there wasn't enough instruction on technique, especially during the figure drawing unit."

   "comments": [
    "Your drawing will improve so much! That being said, do not think of this as a \"gut class.\" Yes it is fun but it requires a lot of work",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to anyone interested in art or visual media. If you don't have experience with art, it will teach you a lot about translating what you see onto the page. If you are an artist, it will push you out of your comfort zone (ultimately improving your work). Regardless, this course will force you to be bold and sure in your artistic choices, to trust in your eye and hand. I'd recommend it to anyone who wants to develop more confidence in their abilities and for that confidence to show in their pieces.",
    "Overall yes I would recommend this class! I took this it as a senior wanting to balance the rest of my schedule and gain exposure to the arts. Some assignments are more interesting than others, but overall it was a fun and worthwhile time.",
    "Take this! Lots of work (time-wise) but a great break from academically intensive courses.",
    "Absolutely- the skills taught in class were absolutely vital to understanding the media. Definitely had a strong impact on my comprehension of how to clarify visually my work and ideas.",
    "Absolutely! One of the best classes I've taken at Yale.",
    "I wouldn't recommend taking this class. It was a huge workload, but I never really felt like I was gaining skills or improving.",
    "I would, but only if they are prepared to put in a lot of hours doing mundane tasks."
