    "Great class! Broad scope, be ready for a lot of memorization for the tests!",
    "A strong Art History lecture. Great readings and wonderful art. Really wonderful if you are interested in contemporary photography.",
    "HSAR 346 is an overview of primarily American 20th century photography. The lectures are interesting and the material is presented in a thought-provoking way. I would recommend the course; however, there are a lot of images to memorize for the midterm and final. Still, the subject is interesting and the readings are good. A solid course.",
    "Overall the class is a very good introduction to the American photographic canon although we do cover a fair amount of photographers from Europe and a few from other areas. Also, the class is a good introduction to photographic theory that can be further studied and applied to other classes. The biggest downside is that there are A LOT of photographs\/photographers that you must memorize for the midterm and final."
