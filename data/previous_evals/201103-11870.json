   "comments": [
    "WORST class i have ever taken every way possible. the psets were LONG and the TAs would tell us all the answers because no one could do those questions on their own. the topics covered were WEIRD and not related to life science AT ALL. Take 180 and youll be better off.",
    "I would recommend this course for those interested in some physics applied to life sciences but it is not particularly enjoyable in terms of the workload and often only has the opportunity to look at topics fairly superficially.",
    "Yes, I would recommend you take this physics course. It's cool to see how physics directly applies to the medical field too.",
    "As a premed I would definitely recommend this over 180 but otherwise I assume you take it because you are taking it for a requirement. Its not so bad at all!",
    "Yes, definitely recommend!",
    "If you're premed take this one I suppose. If not, think about taking 180.",
    "Be ready for difficult problem sets.",
    "Problem sets are a pain. Tests are EASY EASY EASY. Mochrie is charming but a little dry. Basically this class is typical Newtonian mechanics mixed in with some stuff about diffusion. You won't enjoy it but it won't kill you.",
    "This is a great class. You do need to put a decent amount of time in order to get the problem sets done and to study for the quizzes, but all of the required work will make you feel confident about the midterm and exam. Mochrie provides handouts for all of the lectures which are extremely helpful, and he chooses excellent TA's. May be best intro science course I have taken at Yale.",
    "The topics focused on in this class were more applicable to the life sciences than expected. Diffusion and binding as a probability distribution as well as flow\/current as applied to molecules across a membrane were some of the interesting topics. Overall this was a good physics class for premeds.",
    "Difficult problem sets, easier quizzes\/midterms. You will definitely need to attend section to complete the psets, but overall the class is not too much outside work. If you're taking it, you're probably a pre-med, so have fun!",
    "Thsi class is a mess; it might not be the best option if you want to really learn physics. The grading is at least easy though, so it's not a hard class to do well in.",
    "Its not a bad class. But be prepared to spend at least three evenings a week (sun, mon, tues) doing physics. quizzes aren't too bad. neither are exams. just work hard.",
    "If you're interested in biophysics, take this course. If you're interested in true physics, don't take this course.",
    "I don't know if anyone takes Physics 170 for fun, but it was generally much less painful than some other premed requirements. Professor Mochrie is really fun and helpful, Peter was the best TA ever, and the exams were generally fair. Homeworks were impossible, but generally graded generously. Definitely a much better experience with physics than I had been expecting:)",
    "YOu will take this not cause you want to.. but because you have it. Manageable. Don't fall behind.",
    "Good overview course of physics. If you're pre-med and not really a physics person, definitely take 170 over 180. Professor Mochrie is really personable and explains concepts very well. He takes the time to get to know his students and is more approachable than any other science professor I have met at Yale.The workload is certainly manageable: weekly problem sets, weekly quizzes, two midterms, and a final exam. The problem sets are fairly difficult, but the TAs are incredibly helpful. There are also numerous help sessions and tutors so you won't get behind. The weekly quizzes are actually good because they force you to learn the material and they're good practice for the midterms. The midterms were really fair and the average for them was pretty high (B\/B+ range). The final exam is also really fair.",
    "Good pre-med class.",
    "If you have to take physics even though you don't like it, take this class. They are determined for you to succeed, although expect your entire Sundays and Mondays to be devoted to physics (review sessions, study halls etc.). Exams are really fair... they want to give you points.",
    "Don't take it if you don't have to (although most of you probably have to). Don't know if it's better or worse than 180, but it's no fun. Not terribly difficult, but not pleasant.",
    "PHYS 170 has a good curve, but it is a lot of work. There is a problem set and a quiz every week. Sections are very useful however. And there are lots of opportunities to get help on your problem sets, so there is no excuse for not always getting a 100 on them. Simon is a reasonable guy and doesn't have a problem with letting the TAs review problems on the psets before they are due. Midterms are reasonable tests of knowledge but difficult to study for because he guides you through what he wants you to do. Study with practice problems - reviewing notes didn't really help me.",
    "I think this course is a great option for a pre-med. However, the main reason I took it instead of 180 was because I didn't want to deal with the multi-variable in PHYS181. Some of the material is good MCAT prep, but most of is not. MCAT practice problems are supplied on some of the problem sets, but to be honest after spending hours trying to figure out how to do the near-impossible problem sets the last thing I want to do is additional problems.",
    "Take it if you need Physics but don't like pure physics, and want to know the biological applications. Take it if you are pre-med. Do not take it if you are very into pure physics - you will hate this class.",
    "I had to take this course for bio and pre-med, but I think it was definitely better than 180. We covered the main important physics concepts and also did cool biophysics things like probability and diffusion. Also, the tests and quizzes are very fair, but the psets are too long and hard.",
    "It's physics, but with the addition of a caring professor.",
    "Phys 170 is a decent introduction to physics. I came in with absolutely no physics background, but I found it the perfect pace for me. Professor Mochrie seems to really care about his students and is very receptive to feedback about how to improve the course. There are 10-minute weekly quizzes that are not tough but are really good for helping to make sure you keep up with the material. The midterms are not too difficult, and Professor Mochrie gives you lots of practice problems ahead of time. Overall, a fine course.",
    "The class is extremely generous in its grading scale. The midterms are much easier than the problem sets, but you have to be careful because the curve is a little high. It seems like kids in 180 had a MUCH more difficult time than those in 170. Also, if you haven't taken physics before, you will probably have to do a lot of self study for the mechanics part.",
    "yes take it but not to prepare for the mcat",
    "Physics 170 is really perfect for pre-medical students. It really tailors lectures and topics to what future doctors might find interesting and applicable to the field. Although it is a large course-load, it is rewarding to be able to understand basic biological and chemical principles from a new physical perspective. I would certainly recommend it.",
    "It's an ok class. The curve is pretty nice. It'll get better over the years.Don't expect anything amazing though.",
    "If you don't mind not learning traditional physics, then Physics 170 is for you. It's great that the material is related to biology and medicine, but it can also be annoying sometimes because it feels like Mochrie is just making everything up. If you need to take physics for major or pre-med requirements, PHYS 170 is not a bad choice.",
    "Phys170 is a solid intro to physics and is definitely aimed toward the pre-med crowd. The workload isn't awful- 1 in-class quiz each week over really basic concepts and a fairly difficult pset each week. There's a lot of resources to help you with the psets (i.e. the TAs are available in help sessions and discussion sections each week) so getting them done is never a problem. I wouldn't really recommend it unless you need it, but overall its not a bad course.",
    "It's a lot more interesting than the physics i took in high school. The biology applications are pretty cool. Psets are hard but the TAs were helpful during section and basically just went over how to solve problems.",
    "This class is great for the physics pre-med requirement. It will help a lot with the MCAT.",
    "It's supposed to be biological applications of basic physics but I have come away from the class learning very little physics. If you do not have a slight physics background, do not expect to learn a lot of physics. If that is your goal take 180. However, I thought the class was interesting and perhaps more fulfilling for the many kids in the class that had already taken AP Physics. The problems sets are long but you basically go to the TAs for help with that. Simon provides a lot of outside of class help which is nice. However, given that 180 would have taught more physics and was supposedly very easy and curved this semester, I regret taking this class.",
    "Yes, definitely take it. Way better than 180.",
    "It's so boring. I've never been so uninspired in a course. They're still making changes to it, so it might get better.",
    "Its difficult but a fair course for pre-meds who need to take physics.",
    "If they have time in their schedule, then yes.",
    "PHYS 170 is a physics class intended for those interested in medicine or the biological sciences. We cover material relevant to classical physics, as well as biophysical concepts such as diffusion, random walks, etc.",
    "Would absolutely recommend. Way better than my high school physics class.",
    "Yes. Psets are nigh impossible. Midterms\/final was kind of hard, but manageable.",
    "Physics 170 is a good introductory, premed physics course. The problem sets are pretty challenging (in fact, you end up relying on the TA's to give you the answers during section\/study hall), but the quizzes and midterms are much easier. Simon also does a good job connecting what we're learning to biology, which makes the course a lot more interesting. I'm not sure if I actually intuitively understand any physics, but at least the course isn't too time consuming. Also, the professor (if you have Mochrie again) knows everyone's name pretty early on in the course, so it's nice not to feel anonymous in yet another big science lecture!",
    "If you're pre-med looking for a physics course, TAKE THIS OVER THE OTHER PHYSICS. Much easier grading\/ material than the other physics courses offered at Yale.",
    "The course was interesting and very manageable. I really enjoyed the biology\/ medical applications of the physics. Mochrie really tries to engage students and provides an abundance of resources for students to help them succeed. The problem sets are extremely difficult, but the TAs are a huge help for them, and the exams are manageable, though not as straight forward as it might have been sold in the past. Definitely study hard for them, and you will do well.",
    "Sure--the class is basically all pre-med, which Mochrie understands.",
    "Overall, it wasn't too bad. A lot of the material that's covered can be confusing and difficult, and the psets are often almost impossible to do on your own, but all the resources you need to succeed are provided - sections go over the problems that you can't do on your own, so there's no need to stress. Also, the quizzes and midterms are much more reasonable in terms of level of difficulty. The TA's are all great, and Simon REALLY cares about his students - he goes above and beyond giving us extra resources to make sure we succeed, plus he's a really entertaining, down-to-earth guy. This isn't a normal physics class - while mechanics was pretty similar to my AP physics B class, a lot of the semester is very specific to medical examples. It's interesting, but you won't be learning what you would in a normal physics class. You definitely do learn though, it's just that a lot of it is for specific problem types. If you're pre-med and looking for a fair class, take this.",
    "The course is good for pre-meds.",
    "I hear Physics 180 is hard as hell, but then again, I didn't enjoy physics 170 that much either. The grass is much greener on the other side, I guess.",
    "Problem sets are a doozy, and require going to section as well as the extra sessions to get them done. Easy weekly quizzes keep you on top of the material, and the exams are fair. Professor Mochrie gives you every resource possible to make sure you do well in the class. Lectures are not very interesting, but he puts up comprehensive notes of every one. There is debate whether the class actually helps with the MCATs or not. For the type of premed I am (not exceptionally strong in the sciences, and I need structure in a class to keep me on top of material), this class worked for me and I would recommend it. It is not very stressful, and I came out learning some physics.",
    "It's hard and really challenging and the class moves as a lightening pace. But if you like Physics or want to know more about the connection between physics and biology, you might want to consider taking this class.",
    "I would definitely recommend PHYS 170, especially if you\u0092re pre-med and are apprehensive or skeptical about the pre-med physics requirement. Based on my experience with AP Physics in high school, I thought physics was a chore and completely irrelevant to my future studies. Needless to say, PHYS 170 was a pleasant surprise. The class is extremely well-taught, and most importantly, it\u0092s designed from the ground-up to be both relevant (to pre-meds) and learnable. Every week there is a TA-led help session on Sunday, an in-class 10-minute quiz on Monday, and TA-led sections on Tuesday to help with the problem sets, which are due on Wednesday. The problem sets are long and require a lot of time,but the questions generally do a good job of leading you through learning and applying the concepts, models, and topics from that week\u0092s lectures. There are two midterms (each covering a digestible amount of material) and a final, and the questions on each are generally fairly written. However, if you\u0092re not interested in the biological applications or in things like probability distributions and membrane diffusion, you should consider taking PHYS 180 instead; I would suggest looking at the syllabus for PHYS 170, as it does a very good job of spelling out the course. If you're looking for a straight-up standard general physics course, take PHYS 180; if you're looking for a very well-taught, well-designed introductory physics class that bridges elements of classical physics and biophysics, you should take PHYS 170.",
    "This Physics class was actually fun, and pretty easy-especially if you took high school physics or are alright with math. Simon is really funny and actually a good lecturer. The material is more interesting and relevant than other physics courses. The problem sets are hard- but if you go to the Sunday sessions they go over them (same with section). The exams and quizzes are easy if you put in a little bit of studying. If Peter is a TA-try to go to his section-he's great!",
    "Physics 170 is an interesting experiment in making physics seem more relevant to biology. The biological applications are quite interesting. The class starts off interesting and gets frustratingly difficult, though it eventually grows on you. Many of the topics seem like they belong in a physical chemistry or statistics class rather than in an intro physics course, though they are pretty interesting. The problem sets are long, time-consuming, and require collaboration. No prior knowledge of advanced calculus is required. The professor and TAs do want students to do well and are often generous with points.",
    "Phys 170 is a good way to fulfill the pre-med req but don't take Phys 170 for fun bro, trust me."
