    "It is a course designed to help give us the time to work on a substantive article project during the second year. I would absolutely recommend it.",
    "As I understand it, Research and Writing stands and falls with the instructors and the group of students. I would definitely recommend taking research and writing with Ken Scheve, with a strong group of students, and if one has a good idea of a paper topic.",
    "solid course to work on your independent research skills. Little outside structure, you have to be your own boss, but its great to see if you can be an independent researcher.",
    "Hard to know as bulk of it is next semester."
