   "comments": [
    "Professor Jung is great! It is an organized class, but I think more can be done to bring those up to speed who aren't super knowledgeable about Catholic devotional practices. My only complaint is that there was a bit too much lecturing -- don't get me wrong -- Professor Jung is an excellent lecturer, but I personally learn best by really discussing what I read. Unfortunately, not sure it would be possible to run the class like this because it seemed like not many did the readings thoroughly. There were also a lot of people in the class -- it would have been more fun to have fewer people in the class. Overall, though, it was a great class. I hope Professor Jung will teach this again! I know the last time the class was taught, it was co-taught with a grad student. Maybe Professor Jung should consider involving one of her grad students again because its always nice to have different perspectives.",
    "This is a really nice class to study an incredibly underappreciated form of art. Professor Jung is incredible and very knowledgeable and the course materials are very good, the readings can be complex but engaging, and the class field trip to the MET was very enjoyable. I would warn though that the readings can be long and the workload could be a little exhausting. Overall: 8\/10 and would recommend.",
    "I am weirdly obsessed with medieval religious art, and so I fear that my emotional and intellectual response to HSAR 438 has little to do with the class itself. That said, Professor Jung is amazing! I can say with absolute certainty that she's terribly impressive (but also funny and kind). The class was at that awkward midway point between a lecture and a seminar, but I loved it because Prof. Jung made her dedication to the material so evident and (dare I say) inspiring. Take a class with her! Especially if you're interested in catholic theology! Students wrote one long paper and a few short assignments during the semester. Each week, we read 4-5 essays. All very manageable!",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS! You will learn so much. It was my first art history course, and with Prof. Jung's help, I was able to produce a pretty good paper by the end.",
    "It was such an incredible course!! Take it!!"
