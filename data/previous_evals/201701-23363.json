   "question_text": "Looking back on this course, what is your overall assessment of the course:  What are its strengths and weaknesses, and in what ways might it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I think the concepts of this course are important, but I do not think the lecture material could have been more clearly explained. I think a strength of the class was the weekly pass\/fail homework. I believe that the discussion sections facilitated a good understanding of the material, more so than the lectures.",
    "I think the organization could be improved. It lacked clarity and we fell behind schedule \/ out of order so that the syllabus wasn't very useful after the first month or so.",
    "First and foremost, I learned a lot from the course! I consider the material to be incredibly important and I gain useful skills. Regarding the way the course was structured, I'd say the greatest strength is having a weekly homework assignment, which is then reviewed in section by TAs. A TA can make or break a course and my TA this semester was the best. Epi concepts are theoretical in a classroom setting especially for someone like me who has never conducted research before. So struggling through the homework every week and then asking the right questions in section strongly reinforced the concepts for me. That was a critical aspect. The biggest weakness of the course is the excessive length of the slide decks that are presented in class. There was a lot of redundancy both in the slide decks (many literally duplicated slides from previous lectures) and this lead the professor to repeat simple concepts many times. This accumulated to a lot of wasted time during class and made it difficult to focus in on what was important.",
    "Strengths: you learn more about epidemiology Weaknesses: I did not feel that Fatma was a good teacher. It was mostly just aggressive slide reading. I did not feel comfortable asking questions or asking her to slow down. I eventually just stopped going to class, despite how much I paid for the class, because it was unenjoyable and unhelpful to my learning. Friday sections were also not enjoyable or helpful. It was just people going one-by-one, timidly offering their answers with qualifications about how they knew it was wrong, and the TA telling us why they were wrong. I wish that I never had to take the class, or that it had been taught in a way that was actually designed for the student learning experience rather than \"LEARN THIS. YOU WILL BE TESTED ON THIS. NOW LEARN THIS TOO. YOU WILL BE TESTED ON THIS TOO.\" I do not feel that Epi II should be a required class for SBS, especially given that EMD is not required. Many SBS students are not planning to work in research or epidemiology- otherwise, we would've pursued an MPH in EMD or CDE!",
    "There is a lot of information so the lecture seems dry but it is valuable information. I do not think it would be exciting regardless of who is teaching the course.",
    "I liked that it wasn't very repetitive from epi I. At the beginning of the semester, the material for each problem set was covered the week before the pset was due, but towards the end of the semester the material covered on a Wednesday was included in Friday's homework--I liked at the beginning of the semester when I could start the pset early and have time to go to office hours to get specific questions answered before going to section on Friday. I thought the review lectures before each exam were helpful. Both midterm exams seemed fair in questions and grading.",
    "Although I enjoyed this course, I felt like a lot of the material that was emphasized in lecture was material the students already understood pretty well, while we didn't spend much time reviewing more difficult concepts. Additionally, it was often difficult to understand the way material was presented through the lectures. The discussion sections totally made up for these issues, however.",
    "This course is one of the worst I've taken. Lectures were disorganized, expectations for students were unclear. Slides had way too much information and the material was repetitive. It was hard to gauge what Dr. Shebl wanted us to take away from any given lecture. Grading was extremely nit-picky.",
    "Too many assignments with too many questions, although useful.",
    "A lot of material taught very quickly and scattered. Instructor was a good teacher, and cared a lot about the students. But material was very scattered",
    "The course covered important material and I think it was an important class to take for a strong foundation in epidemiology. However, I think there are several things about lectures that could be improved. First, the format of the slides was not always conducive to the material being presented. When we were learning logistic regression and other quantitative methods, the material should not have been presented in a bulleted list of sentences - the equations got lost when set up this way. Second, it sometimes seemed like there was a misunderstanding of expectations between the students and the instructor. Often, nuanced concepts and specific details were not immediately understood in lecture and therefore not represented accurately on homework. This would have been fine with the students as long as the TF explained why we were wrong and gave us the explanation we needed. However, the reaction from the professor was often of surprise and not understanding why we didn't understand the material. Overall, I'm glad I took this course and I learned a lot, but I think there are ways in which it could be altered to help students grasp major concepts and important details better the first time around in lecture.",
    "The strength is the content of the course. It is very much necessary for students pursuing careers in epidemiology.",
    "I will preface what I'm about to say with the knowledge that my skills in epidemiology and my ability to critically evaluate epidemiological studies were greatly improved by this course and I really do feel much more comfortable with core public health principles that previously eluded me. However, from the beginning of the course to the end, Fatma's method of teaching the material just did not work with how I learn. Her slides are all over the place and it is SO difficult to discern what is important versus what is ancillary. I know the point of the course is to get into the meat of epi principles, but to not be able to figure out what is a key principle versus a tangent for the exams can drive a student to insanity. Be prepared to have to re-write and re-order all the class notes in a way that makes sense. I would recommend printing the slides and highlighting things she emphasizes in order to figure out what is important because there is just SO much info in the slides.",
    "I think this course could be improved by actually making the homework worth points. Although it was nice in the moment for them to just be pass\/fail based on completion, I ended up not really learning from them until the week of the exams, which turned out to be very stressful. It would be easier to keep up with the material if the course required more accountability throughout the semester.",
    "IT'S PAINFUL weekly assignment and discussion, two classes per week.... But it's really helpful. After the course you'll have a sense of how to design epidemiology study, and how to review literature.",
    "Strength: the format of homework assignments- allows you to dissect and really understand epidemiological studies that were published; Weakness: i wish the class was taught in a more efficient way",
    "I didn't really like this course -- I think a strength of this class was the professor. You can tell she really wants students to learn the material and encourages you to reach out to her if you want to meet one-on-one. A weakness is the grading scale. Making 80% of your total grade based on exams is ridiculous. I've always had difficulty taking exams like these, so these exams aren't a good indicator of the knowledge a student gains in the class -- I would recommend thinking more critically on this to improve the course. Also, I didn't find the discussion sections helpful at all. We literally just went over the answers on the homework. When someone would ask the TA a question to clarify, a common answer would be \"well that's what the answer key states\" NOT HELPFUL!",
    "I did not learn much from lecture, but it works well when lecture is combined with the discussion section. I wish the homework was shorter so we could have more time to discuss material instead of only having time to just barely make it through the questions.",
    "Does a great job going more indepth into epidemiology and reinforcing major themes. Downside maybe too much and too little time.",
    "This was an objectively bad course. Please fix it. I found that sitting in lecture made me more confused than when I just looked up the topics online. Halfway through the semester, other students just stopped showing up to lectures because they had realized that there was no point in going and confusing yourself. By the end of the semester, I saw about 1\/5 of the number of people who I assumed were enrolled. Psets took me twice as long as they should because I wasted time trying to decipher confusing slides that occasionally would even contradict themselves. The course material was fine, but I know I would've done better in the course if I had a better instructor. Please have a different instructor teach this course next year.",
    "Good - provided advanced knowledge of epidemiology, which is helpful for people going into research Weakness - the final was much more complicated than necessary and did not assess my knowledge base of epidemiology to the extent that I wanted it to",
    "This course was extremely frustrating. I felt more confused about Epi after taking it. For one, the papers we read were very dry, and catered to very specific interests. It is a required class for students in multiple departments, and I wish there was more of a range of topics covered that were more inclusive of all departments. The lectures and slides felt like they were trying to tell us too much instead of working through how to do things together. I also think it would be helpful to have smaller tests or perhaps quizzes. I felt like I had to learn material retroactively from the tests we had, which was frustrating. Perhaps this would have worked out better if we had had quizzes or smaller tests throughout the semester.",
    "The topics were very interesting and useful. The homework really helped to prepare us for the tests.",
    "While Dr. Shebl really wants students to learn the material and cares for them a great deal, the teaching style of this class does not work well. It should be broken up into smaller sections and not taught as a lecture in Winslow. Many students do not come to class, and those that do are not rewarded and are often more confused. The homework assignments are also very long.",
    "Strengths -Got into many of the finer details of conducting and evaluating epi research -Learned new practical, analytic skills that I anticipate using in the future (e.g. confounding, effect modification, survival analyses, epi curves) -The slides are very detailed, and the use of examples on the slides to illustrate concepts was effective -Exams were reflective of the most important topics we had covered in class and in homework assignments. Overall, the exams were challenging but very fair. -The review lectures were VERY helpful, and I used the slides from those to study for exams. Weaknesses -It took a long time for the first exam to be returned. -Some of the homework assignments were so long that we just barely finished reviewing them during section, and often that was only possible if we stopped asking questions (even when things were confusing). -The homework assignments were also inconsistent in their utility: some questions on the assignments were important, generalizable questions that were important to ask. Some questions had strange wording and assessed our understanding of small details in the articles that were not actually that relevant to the topics\/theories that the assignment was supposed to cover.",
    "I really enjoyed this course. It has been the most comprehensive course I have taken at YSPH. The material can be very dense and sometimes a little redundant with Epi I, and recommend focusing on material that hasn't been presented in that course.",
    "Strengths: Exposed to a variety of topics and issues regarding epidemiological studies. Weaknesses: Large amount of information gone through very quickly, no time to study one topic\/issue\/idea in depth.",
    "Great course to familiarize yourself with literature and interpretation of results. However, discussion was more helpful than lecture at times.",
    "There was a lot of information in this class and it was not taught in a digestible manner. The lectures and information provided online were not clear. The tests were overly complicated. The TAs seemed to be unclear on most of the concepts.",
    "The class was required for me to take as a CDE student and I learned the objectives of the class throughout the semester. I liked that the homework had us work off of published articles to show how that week's lecture is used in research and the real world. However, I didn't like that the discussion was required attendance or that we had to print out both the homework AND paper for class. Seemed like a waste to require it.",
    "This class is the first actual public health class I have taken. It is highly applied so that is definitely a strength, and students learn a lot throughout the course. However, there is a lot of room for improvement. This is not a class that you can learn sitting at Winslow staring at 100 slides twice a week. Most of the learning will happen either on your own or in section. There is a significant amount of material that you will probably never see or use again, especially if you are in not in CDE. It could be improved if content will be limited to very important subjects such as models, confounding, effect modification and if you are able to apply those, in for example a project you work on throughout the semester. Certain content is way too specific, students in SBS are not here to learn about the specific analyses of RCTs and matching, etc. Students would really get the most of this class if lectures will be significantly reduced in time and section would be twice a week where you can really delve into the content. In addition, it would be best to have a section on X subject before the homework on that same subject, therefore when doing the homework you actually understand the questions and know what they are getting at, instead of having to go through the thousand slides to try and find what it means. Then the second section could be used to go through the homework, as the current format. Alternatively the class could be worth two credits and section should be added."

   "comments": [
    "Instructor: Fatma Shebl \u00a0I think a strength of Dr. Shebl is that she really wants us to do well and understand the material. A weakness, however, is her style of teaching. I'm not sure how to describe it, but it may have to something to do with the flow of the material.",
    "Instructor: Fatma Shebl \u00a0Fatma is very knowledgable and very receptive to student comments\/concerns. I felt that while she was a good professor, she could improve the structure and organization of the class (it felt disheveled at times), as well as her engagement with students. As someone who usually participates actively in class, one issue I had was that Fatma would often pose a question to the class that had a very specific answer that was on the slide behind her or available verbatim in our notes. She would sometimes be frustrated by our lack of response, but asking a question that is so clearly available in her lecture notes that everyone in the class knows what she is expecting is a deterrent to student participation. No one wants to be the student to raise their hand and read the answer off of the slide. In the future, I think it would be much more productive to ask more thought provoking questions that are theoretical or opinion based to encourage students to think about and work through this complex material, rather than asking something that is written on the slides (even if it's a few slides in advance, we can still see the answer and that doesn't foster critical thought\/active participation). Overall though I found that Fatma did a great job explaining really complicated and abstract material. I know that time is always an issue, but I think the course could be better organized. We never finished the lectures and having consistent run over of topics makes it hard to follow. I'm not sure how to fix this - maybe we need to cover less material? I would definitely recommend shortening the lectures by at least 15 slides so that we could consistently end the topic for the day. Generally though I really enjoyed this class and thought that Fatma was a great professor. I would definitely take a course with her in the future.",
    "Instructor: Fatma Shebl \u00a0Dr. Shebl is one of the most caring and thoughtful professors I have met. It's completely clear that she cares about her students understanding the concepts and will go to great lengths to help her students. That said, there was a lot of redundancy throughout the classroom lectures and I think it would serve Dr. Shebl to rethink the structure of the powerpoint presentations. If she can cut them down by half and include only the critical overarching concepts, and rely more on the lecture readings, it would make classroom lectures more dynamic.",
    "Instructor: Fatma Shebl \u00a0Dr. Shebl is very kind when you speak to her in person. However, I did not feel that she was a good teacher. It was mostly just aggressive slide reading. I did not feel comfortable asking questions or asking her to slow down. I eventually just stopped going to class, despite how much I paid for the class, because it was unenjoyable and unhelpful to my learning. I don't doubt that Dr. Shebl is a brilliant researcher; however, I think that YSPH should have their professors take classes that teach them how to teach. It is an art and a skill that is very different than research!!!!",
    "Instructor: Fatma Shebl \u00a0Fatma is so so sweet and caring. She is very fair and hardworking. I think people complain about her teaching style because its not normal for America but being from Asia, her teaching style was fine with me. She is brilliant and she should continue teaching Epi II because the knowledge she has given me is invaluable. I have learned a lot and I appreciate Fatma working harder than I am to see me succeed in the class. She wants us all to do well and makes her available for office hours at all times, particularly during exams to remove our anxieties about the exams\/class. Fatma is a great professor who does not receive the positive acknowledgement she deserves.",
    "Instructor: Fatma Shebl \u00a0Professor Shebl provides many examples, which is helpful. I would sometimes be confused in class about a particular concept, but I found when I went back through the slides to study or complete the homework it would become clear. She did a good job of driving one key point home for each lecture-- I think the clicker questions were helpful to accomplish this!",
    "Instructor: Fatma Shebl \u00a0Dr. Shebl clearly cares immensely about her students, and she is very willing to work with us if we don't understand material, have conflicts with lectures\/homework\/exams, etc. I felt very comfortable talking to her outside of class, and it's obvious that she is passionate about epidemiology. Dr. Shebl's lecture style was a little bit abstract for me. I liked how Epi I was taught by first outlining\/defining a principle, then giving specific instructions for how to apply the principle. In Epi II, I often felt overwhelmed or confused by the numerous examples and multiple approaches and \"tricks\" for solving problems that were presented to us. This made it more difficult to understand the core of the concept, and instead I got wrapped up in trying to decipher which parts of the lecture were most important versus which were more like additional tips for use in the future. Also, it might be helpful in future years to minimize content overlap between Epi I and Epi II; the first 2 weeks or so of class were strictly review for me.",
    "Instructor: Fatma Shebl \u00a0Dr. Shebl is clearly an expert in her field, but her lecturing style is very difficult to stay engaged with. This was reflected by the very poor attendance of Epi lectures by mid semester.",
    "Instructor: Fatma Shebl \u00a0Hardworking",
    "Instructor: Fatma Shebl \u00a0Great professor.",
    "Instructor: Fatma Shebl \u00a0Her instruction is a bit confusing, but she tries so much to help students.",
    "Instructor: Fatma Shebl \u00a0Strengths: fair, cares about students, very knowledgable of course subject Weaknesses: sometimes it was difficult to recognize the important material and concepts in lecture because of how the slides were presented and because in speaking, emphasis wasn't really given to any slides in general",
    "Instructor: Fatma Shebl \u00a0The instructor is brilliant and I understand better from her answers to my questions than from lectures.",
    "Instructor: Fatma Shebl \u00a0I know that Fatma genuinely wanted her students to learn. That much was evident to me, and she is also incredibly knowledgeable. However, she is really unapproachable and I learned quickly not to ask questions in class because she makes you feel so stupid. I don't know if its a personality thing or what, but she has this tendency to laugh or smile when students ask questions and it makes it seem like she's laughing at your question. But what's worse is that she just repeats the same thing she said that confused you in 4 different ways rather than offer a new example or further definition to help confirm whatever was confusing. It's like being made fun of in front of all your classmates. I know she's brilliant, but she really can make you feel stupid sometimes.",
    "Instructor: Fatma Shebl \u00a0Professor Shebl is very kind but I think the lectures would be more engaging if there was less writing on the slides.",
    "Instructor: Fatma Shebl \u00a0Strengths: very responsive Weakness: accent, but it's ok with me",
    "Instructor: Fatma Shebl \u00a0My biggest feedback is that Professor Shebl needs to have more concise slides! Her slides are unnecessarily lengthy. Slides could benefit from more organization.",
    "Instructor: Fatma Shebl \u00a0I thought Professor Shebl was a good lecturer! You can tell she really cares about the students and that they learn the material.",
    "Instructor: Fatma Shebl \u00a0I like the professor a lot, but her lectures were often not helpful to me.",
    "Instructor: Fatma Shebl \u00a0Great professor! Always willing to listen and be helpful with complicated topics.",
    "Instructor: Fatma Shebl \u00a0Professor Shebl is a nice woman, but not a good professor. We had trouble understanding her during lecture, and she almost acted insulted when we asked for clarification on topics that seemed simple to her, but were clearly confusing to the class. Her slides were confusing. Her psets were long and only somewhat based on the lecture materials. She was somewhat approachable, but I never went to her for help because I didn't think that further conversation would have made much of a difference in my understanding.",
    "Instructor: Fatma Shebl \u00a0Strength - compassionate, brought her own opinions on various statistical procedures into class which showed us real world discussions on epidemiology Weakness - difficult to stay engaged during class",
    "Instructor: Fatma Shebl \u00a0Dr. Shebl is extremely smart, and I think sometimes that was a barrier to explaining\/teaching certain topics that maybe seemed obvious to her but not to myself or some of my peers. Sometimes I would know a correct answer but still be confused why it was correct, but I wasn't able to get support understanding the why because that seemed too obvious or assumed by the instructor. Also, there were too many slides and lectures were too verbose. It would have been more useful to maybe work through smaller examples together instead of just being lectured at all the time. Dr. Shebl is really helpful in office hours working through problems one and one. It is also really apparent that she is really invested in teaching the material and helping you learn it, it just didn't feel like lecture facilitated this well.",
    "Instructor: Fatma Shebl \u00a0Her teaching and train of thought was SO confusing and nonsensical that I was only able to excel when I didn't go to class and try to listen and learn from the teacher. I was really disappointed in the value of this class, especially as EPI 1 with Linda Nicollai was so difficult, useful, and raised my self-efficacy as a public health practitioner. EPI 1 was great. This class was a major disappointment and waste of time. YSPH should have just given us an epi book and lessons with Yasmyn.",
    "Instructor: Fatma Shebl \u00a0Dr. Shebl is very passionate about the material and wants students to do well, but her teaching style was difficult for many students. Her lectures often times are confusing and explanations unclear. She is great during office hours.",
    "Instructor: Fatma Shebl \u00a0Strengths -She clearly knew what she was talking about, and had a lot of passion for the concepts taught in Epi II. -She handled the end of the semester situation (her being sick, us missing lectures that would be covered on the final) very fairly and professionally. I wasn't always impressed with the administration of this class, but the transparency and flexibility offered at the end of the semester was excellent and really changed my perspective of the class. Weaknesses -There was not a single lecture in which we finished all of the lecture slides for the day. We consistently got through 12-15 pages of slides, yet the slides we were provided were usually around 20 pages. This was endlessly frustrating because we ran out of time for the things we were supposed to cover on the syllabus, and the things we missed out on were things that would have been extremely interesting. -Dr. Shebl occasionally misstated things during lecture (without correction) or made errors on the slides that took some time to resolve. -I can say in hindsight that I prepared appropriately for exams and did well, but we did not receive much instruction as to what exactly we should focus on when studying.",
    "Instructor: Fatma Shebl \u00a0Professor was great! She engaged very well with students and did a great job at effectively conveying the subject material. Her exam expectations were clear and she was very flexible with students regarding scheduling office hours.",
    "Instructor: Fatma Shebl \u00a0Knowledgeable, flexible with student schedules.",
    "Instructor: Fatma Shebl \u00a0Dr. Shebl definitely wants to help students succeed in the course and is generally pretty helpful outside of lecture. However, she does lack a little more organization during lecture as she sometimes vaguely describes topics which makes it tedious when reviewing the material.",
    "Instructor: Fatma Shebl \u00a0Very kind and amazing professor! Really cared about students and wanted them to excel",
    "Instructor: Fatma Shebl \u00a0Dr. Shebl provided class concepts in a convoluted manner.",
    "Instructor: Fatma Shebl \u00a0I like the fact that Dr. Shebl doesn't mind repeating herself or reviewing information from previous lectures if students have questions. She was always available for help during office hours or by appointment. Sometimes the wording of the information on powerpoints was confusing and made the material even more difficult to understand. Also the powerpoints were uploaded rather late so many of us couldn't print it before lecture to take notes on it. The second version of the powerpoints that were uploaded would often not answer the questions posed in the first version despite the fact that we were told it would.",
    "Instructor: Fatma Shebl \u00a0Dr Shebl is very knowledgeable and passionate. She cares a lot about her students, is very accessible and is really invested in your learning processes. She is kind and sensitive. However, she interacts the best when in smaller groups. During lecture she can provide too many details that may confuse rather than clarify."

I feel like I now have a better critical eye for evaluating studies I'm reading, and I feel more prepared to design effective studies in the future.",
    "I would not recommend this course to anyone unless they change the instructor and re-organize it.",
    "Just for students who really want to further in epi",
    "The material is interesting and necessary for a public health background but the class was challenging but not in a way that was worth it.",
    "Overall, the course was necessary and good.",
    "Just be prepared to work extra hard to understand the material. You'll struggle through concepts, be frustrated with Fatma, say stupid answers in section, but at the end of it you'll have learned a lot.",
    "For non-CDE student who don't want to be an epidemiologist: DON'T TAKE IT. For CDE student: good luck",
    "CDE students have no other option",
    "If it's not a requirement, don't take it. If it's required, keep up with the material, find a study group, and go to office hours.",
    "Take advantage of office hours and make time to complete your homework.",
    "Definitely reccommend it! A confidence booster in being able to critique and design studies.",
    "I took it with Professor Shebl, and it was terrible. I learned nothing in lecture. It was better to just review the slides on my own later. My TA was a lifesaver.",
    "Good for people wanting to go into research because it challenges students to critically think about their research protocol",
    "No. I would advocate for SBS students to have a separate Epi course that is SBS-specific.",
    "It's very useful, so I do think everyone should take it.",
    "It is like epi 1, but you might lose what you learned in epi 1 because of the impossible teaching.",
    "I would recommend this class because it teaches many important epi concepts, however, it needs improvement.",
    "This class was frustrating and I didn't feel like I was always learning that much, but when I got to the end of the class I realized that I actually knew quite a bit about epi and had some useful, tangible skills as a result of this class. I would recommend it to anyone who has a serious interest in epi, but I wouldn't recommend taking it for fun.",
    "This course was great! Epi 2 covers a lot of real world material and is very applicable. Recommend!",
    "Overview of a variety of important epidemiological issues, topics, and concepts. A must for any student interested in epidemiology.",
    "Epi II is not for the faint of heart. Definitely a heavy subject, but overall I think I have come out of the class being able to understand and interpret epidemiological papers better than ever before. If you feel shaky in your methods and results interpretation then this course will definitely help.",
    "I would tell the student to only take Principles of Epidemiology II, if they are required. Epidemiology lessons are incredibly important in the study of public health, but this course did not increase understanding.",
    "Useful class for CDE students, would recommend taking it.",
    "This is a very interesting class, definitely worth taking if you are interested in research. It can be significantly improved, it is hard and very demanding, but you will learn a lot."
