    "Take it. Hands down, take it. Lisa is the best, the class is super chill, and you get to take amazing film pictures that you'll have for the rest of your life. (but be ready for time in the darkroom...not that it is a bad thing at all - my favorite times of this semester were spent in the darkroom)",
    "TAKE PHOTOS REPEAT FALL IN LOVE WITH LISA",
    "Intro photo is a great class overall. Having never done photography before, I feel like I really learned the basics of how to use a camera, how to take a good photo, and how to print. We also had lectures on renowned photographers, which were fun and helped inform my own work. You have to shoot 35 rolls of film over the course of the semester, which doesn't seem like that much, but it really is. Especially because you don't really learn how to use a camera until about a month into the semester. So just bear in mind that this class is practically no work at the beginning of the semester, but a ton at the end. One thing I loved about the class was getting to know the other students pretty well, because we spent so much time in the dark room together. A caveat -- you will end up spending at least $500 between supplies (film, paper), the materials fee, and your camera. Just something to know going in.",
    "It's an intro photo class which means some people will have taken years of photo in high school and some people will have never touched a camera, but that's what makes it fun. I really enjoyed the class as a senior and would recommend it to anyone. That said, art classes take up a lot of time so be prepared to spend a long time in the darkroom especially near crit time. Worth it!!",
    "Definitely! You learn so much and are left with amazing memories by the end of the semester!",
    "Take it if you can fit it in your schedule!",
    "I would summarize the class as an introduction to black and white film photography. I would recommend the class to another student. It is a lot of work but it is very rewarding to make your own art and see a physical product of all of your hard work. Lisa is a great teacher who is very helpful. I felt like I grew a ton as a photographer.",
    "This class is great. Taking photos and being in the darkroom is a lot of work but very fun and adds variety to the schedule. Very different than any other classes. Lisa is fantastic and helpful.",
    "I would highly reccomend this course to any Yale student with even a mild interest in photography. It gave a very good background on the history of photography and photographic techniques and also taught not only how to take great photos but also how to critique them. A lot of work but worth it."
