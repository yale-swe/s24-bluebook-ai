   "comments": [
    "I think the weekly essays were hard but good. I think the readings we did in class were too difficult. Usually when we were reading there were far too many hard words I stopped paying attention. I really think the readings should be simplified.",
    "Good class overall. Was well structured, with weekly readings and approximately one new grammar skill every week. The reading level was variable, so we sometimes had really difficult readings, and sometimes longer easier ones. This made it kind of difficult to know where we should be.",
    "It's a nice community with classmates that help each other and a teacher that cares about her job. A weakness is that there is very little student talking time. Sometimes I barely say anything in Swahili for the whole hour. It would be better if students spoke to each other in Swahili instead of the teacher leading all discussions. The readings for this class were not good - sometimes really strange material, but almost always way too difficult for us to understand.",
    "Strengths: Small class size, dedicated teacher, great learning environment Weaknesses: course material was limited",
    "This course was very engaging, and I learned a lot about the language, the culture of those who speak it, and developed my ability to use it."

    "The course moves at a nice pace with good material.",
    "I would recommend this class. Swahili L3 is a good continuation of the Swahili language at Yale. You learn more grammar and vocab. There is more opportunity to speak, and you learn valuable vocab, that is applicable in the real world. There is more flexibility in L3, but less structure as well.",
    "If you are interested in learning Swahili, this is a great course.",
    "Yes! It was very engaging, fun, and I learned so much."
