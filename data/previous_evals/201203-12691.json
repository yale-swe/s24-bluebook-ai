    "Read plenty of short stories. Begin to learn what that really means, what a story looks like and does. Start to write your own. Well paced.",
    "This was the best course I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve taken at Yale. Every class made me eager to try something new. Emily removed the fear factor in trying new things, and each class was a morale booster. I just want to say that I, and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m pretty sure the rest of the class, believe that Professor Barton is simply one of the best professors and humans out there.If you get in, TAKE IT. Applications are competitive, and you competed and earned your place! If you are waitlisted, GO. I was pretty far down and still made it in by showing up!",
    "I am a better writer and reader after having taken this class. When I read stories, I see not only their metaphors but their structures, not only their meanings but their plots. This understanding helps me craft stories that have both the necessary logistical elements and the enjoyable aesthetic elements.This class was the most personally fulfilling class of the semester. I felt the most invested in the work that I completed for this class; successfully conveying an emotion, detailing a plot, or creating a character brought with it a kind of internal satisfaction that finishing a pset did not. I could feel this in the other students as well.I strongly recommend this class. The community of the students and the professor in this class was unlike any other class community. When we got to class early we actually talked to each other instead of sitting awkwardly waiting for the professor. Students frequently brought in unsolicited (but well appreciated!) baked goods. Some cried on the last day of class.",
    "If you can get into this class, take it, unless you're a weirdo and hater of friendship who would only drag down the community that develops throughout the semester. Because during this course you will become incredibly close with your fellow Intro Fictioneers (and with Emily), and if everything clicks (like it did this semester) it's pure magic. This one time, I had something really important scheduled for after class, but I accidentally showed up an hour late because even after half the semester had passed I had somehow never realized that the class was a full two hours long--I thought it was only one. That's how fun it is. Time actually flies. Apply to this class and take it, because you'll never regret it.",
    "An excellent workshop of twelve students in which you spend time discussing \"craft lessons\" through published work and workshopping other students' stories. Like all workshops, choice of professor is important, but as far as I know, they're all great. If you can, TAKE IT WITH EMILY, she is hilarious, adorable, kind, caring, and extremely committed to her students and their work. I had a great time in every single class and always looked forward to hearing the insights of her and the other students on what we had just read, whether it was published work or the work of a student.",
    "This course is incredible. You will read, and you will learn how things are written, and you will write. You will have your writing torn apart over and over, and it will never feel done, but that's why this course will set you on a path to becoming a better writer in a way that other courses can't. Emily is an amazing professor, and class is something to look forward to rather than something to dread. You will never have a dull minute in this class, and if you pace yourself, you will get through it without ever feeling very stressed. In terms of workload: several readings each week to annotate\/critique, two longer short stories and one very short story, and weekly exercises. 4-6 solid hours per week will be plenty, and closer to 12-14 in the 2 weeks leading up to when each of your stories are due. Take it if you can, doesn't matter who you are or why you want to take it. Take it even if you don't think you want to; everybody loves fiction deep down.",
    "Yes, definitely take it. It is one of my favorite courses I have taken at Yale.",
    "Amazing class, one of the best I've taken at Yale. The balance of reading and talking about published fiction and writing and workshopping our own short stories is just right and Professor Barton has selected a wide and varied range of works to help develop us as readers and writers. The workshops were well led, the comments helpful, and I can't imagine leaving Yale without having taken this class.",
    "Definitely recommended if you want to learn about Fiction writing."
