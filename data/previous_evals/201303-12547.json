   "comments": [
    "I'm not sure how I would summarize it, but I would probably use the reading list. I would definitely recommend it to someone who was interested in the themes and readings.",
    "I would highly recommend the class to another student--I got so much out of it.",
    "I would highly recommend this class to any student interested in modernism, Victorian lit, or literature of the 20th century. The material was chronologically quite broad, but conceptually deep. I walked away with a much stronger understanding of the broad and slippery concept of literary modernism\/s.",
    "Comparative Literature 857 isa demanding yet interesting course that will challenge you to apply theoretical texts to literary ones, and in the process you will question and explore what constitutes literary modernism, especially in Anglophone literatures.",
    "A heavy load of coursework every week.",
    "Yes, of course. Any class with Prof Cleary--even with twenty students--would be great. I hope he teaches the postmodernism class next fall"

   "question_text": "How did this course deepen your knowledge of your discipline\/profession? To what extent did this course contribute to your dissertation\/research?",
   "comments": [
    "I will definitely use all the theoretical readings and related discussions in my research.",
    "I found the course to be very helpful for thinking about my own research--it provided a broader context and deepened my understanding of modernism and contemporary theories about modernism. Though we often dealt with specific texts and regions outside my own, many of the issues under consideration were useful to think about in comparison with my area.",
    "This course was incredibly useful to my field of interest, and though I have taken classes in literary modernism before, we covered theory that I have not studied; in addition, the material shed new light on texts I have previously read. I will definitely be using theories and concepts covered in this course in my own research.",
    "It would be hard to overstate this. The Casanova book was really great and I have used it in multiple papers this semester. The working definitions we offered for modern, postmodern, etc have become my working definitions. All the stuff on \"autonomy\" has given me a new way to talk about self-consciousness in literature--the only thing I can talk about. And in general, the class made me commit to working hard and gave me a new way of thinking about the relationship between literature and politics. My dissertation will no doubt be informed by many of the things I learned this semester"
