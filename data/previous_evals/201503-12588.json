    "I would definitely recommend the course",
    "A fairly difficult class with a good amount of homework every night. Although you will be comfortable with cyrillic in a few weeks, the pace really picks up. Not sure if I would've started with Russian if I needed to do it all over again.",
    "This is an incredible class! If you are contemplating learning Russian but are apprehensive about it due to its reputation for being difficult, take it! Julia is an incredible professor and will go above and beyond what you would expect to help you and make sure you understand the language. I have enjoyed myself immensely in this class and can confidently say that I have learned a great deal of Russian in just one semester, I highly recommend this course.",
    "A fun language that will stretch the mind, work is not too hard if you go to class every day and do the homework every day."
