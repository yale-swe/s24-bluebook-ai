   "comments": [
    "learned a lot about terrorism",
    "I liked the fact that it was an overview of many different conflicts and themes in terrorism. I learned a lot about Northern Ireland, which I didn't know much about before.",
    "Knowledge relating to political science theory, the organization, employment, and rationale of terrorism and the history of its many manifestations-and the academic efforts to define it. Skills at meshing quantitative and qualitative data in producing papers based on hard data throughout the semester. An ability to critique quantitative work. Opportunity with the final paper to conduct theory building of a sort well beyond other undergraduate courses. Insights into the lives of practitioners and theorists of counterterror due to frequent in class discussion and the participation of guest speakers.",
    "Professor Weir is awesome. You should definitely take this class!!!!",
    "This course helped me to gain a much greater understanding of the ideology, methodology, and the many different types of terrorism that have existed throughout history and at present.",
    "I know much more about the importance of exact definitions (such as the definition of terrorism). I learned a lot about different perspectives, influences and reasons for terrorism. Through talking and listening to guest speakers I gained important first hand information."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "This course was amazing! The student presentations were helpful and I learned so much.",
    "great class",
    "This course provides an excellent foundation of terrorism. Most classes are primarily student led, as each week different students create powerpoints on the material. While this method provided lots of insightful discussion, I wish Professor Weir would have given more of her insights. Learning from peers is great, but I wish that we had just a little more Professor-student interaction. Otherwise, the course was great!",
    "Strengths: Really interesting and relevant topic. I really liked how each student did a presentation which helped facilitate discussions. Weakness: Way too focused on terrorism in Northern Ireland. Would be more interesting if a more diverse set of terrorist groups were covered.",
    "The strength was in the contributions of the students and professor to the seminar learning environment. Most people in the class contributed to help make the class really interesting with plenty of diverse opinions, while the professor did a good job in making sure that we stayed on topic\/fact-checking the conversations. I also thought that presentations were generally good. One weakness, although minor, was that it would have been nice to get a little more feedback regarding work handed in. We submitted plenty of assignments, but I was generally unsure as to where I stood in the class grade-wise. Also, it would have been nicer to have a better system for presentations on days where speakers were coming to talk. While some presentation days without speakers would go on for most of the class, presentations on speaker days were usually limited to around 10 minutes. Another minor weakness would be clearer guidelines regarding the length of the short assignments.",
    "Much of the course was student-led with presentations given by students and Q&As with presenters. I think more involvement by the professor would have been nice, but it was a good balance nonetheless.",
    "Strengths: excellent syllabus, great variety of assignments, the guest speaking events went above and beyond what I would expect from any seminar. Emphasis on developing new and useful skills in addition to learning the material which is again a marked improvement over the norm. Will doubtlessly recommend this course personally to everyone who inquires; it was one of my favorites throughout my time at Yale. Improvements: I thought the workload did not translate well into grading per the syllabus. I wrote more pages for this course than I did for my 1 semester capstone. This is not necessarily bad as the assignments were diverse and enjoyable (but might warrant a WR credit for those short of them), but the equalized grading distribution between participation, presentation, final paper and weekly assignments meant that all that writing only amounted to about 50% of the final grade. I would either increase the relative weight of the writing or specify word\/page limits for all the assignments if the grade scheme remains unchanged. I appreciated the extra credit opportunity, took advantage of it, and enjoyed the event thoroughly, but would recommend it not be worth as much in future years. It was a lot of credit for a small investment that some people could never have made despite their interest due to other courses and needlessly disadvantaged them throughout the rest of the course.",
    "Strengths: interesting discussion, diverse reading, interesting assignments that did not include reading responses which was nice for a change Weaknesses: Never received grades back.",
    "The main strength of the course was the instructor Professor Bonnie Weir. Her superior knowledge, experience, and true passion for the study of terrorism was evident throughout the seminar. The classes were interesting, original, and allowed a format for open discussion among the students. The guest speakers were extremely interesting, as well as accessible, open and straight forward. The professor was always available for office hours to discuss any concern or aspect of the course. It was one of my favorite courses at Yale. I really have no recommendations for improvement.",
    "This was an amazing class!! I really don't know how else it could be improved, other then adding a couple more speakers.",
    "The strengths were in my opinion the guest speakers and the greeat discussions in class. All presentations were great and useful. Compared to my other classes I had to do a lot of work for this class (reactions, questions and assignments...)."

    "Definitely take this class!",
    "great class. learned about what makes a terrorist group, how to combat them, motivations for joining them, etc. very enlightening but also made me a little depressed after class because i don't see how we can eliminate terrorism. overall would recommend.",
    "YES! Loved this class. It's such an interesting topic and I constantly found myself doing the extra readings, and doing additional research for the course. Great mix of learning about historical terrorist groups and discussing current active groups.",
    "This class is absolutely amazing, and I would highly recommend it! The class has a great combination of theory and case studies, all designed to help you explore why people engage in terrorism and what a terrorist group truly is (it's not as clear cut as you may think!). One thing to watch out for: make sure you have a solid group of students in the class before choosing to take the class. I think this class would have been great either way, but this semester was highly engaging because there was a really good group of engaged people with diverse opinions.",
    "Amazing class but the most writing I've ever done for a single course over all 4 years, so be ready.",
    "Good overview course of terrorism. This really is what you make of it, it can be as engaging or as high-level you want it to be.",
    "I highly recommend this course. It has been one of the best learning experiences I have had at Yale. Professor Bonnie Weir is extremely knowledgeable about the topic and very open to different opinions. I enjoyed every seminar meeting this semester. I recommend this class not only for students who have related majors but to anyone that would like to acquire a greater understanding of the challenges of terrorism in the world around them. Professor Weir was always available for office hours to discuss any concern or aspect of the course.",
    "Yes and I already have!",
    "I recommend this class and Dr. Weir to everyone who wants to learn more about terrorism. It is a fair amount of work but definetly worth it."
