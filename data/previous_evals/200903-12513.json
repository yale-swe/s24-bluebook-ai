    "I would not recommend this course unless it is restructured. While you get to learn how to use some useful tools, it's probably not worth the amount of anguish you will have to go through. Don't expect the teacher to be able to give you much hands on feedback because he also teaches elsewhere and is only at Yale once a week. You also will have no good idea of how well you're doing in class because you don't get letter grades and your work is only evaluated in relation to other students. You also will have no clear idea as to exactly what you are supposed to do on homework because the teacher wants you to figure things out on your own. Don't ask him and don't expect him to give you feedback about what you could have done to do better. This is taught more like a grad class where you can't get much help.Also, most importantly---MAKE SURE THAT YOU HAVE WINDOWS RUNNING ON YOUR COMPUTER BEFORE TAKING THIS CLASS: DON'T TRY TO SET IT UP DURING THE SEMESTER!",
    "If you really want to learn it then yes. I wasn't sure so I didn't get as much out of it.",
    "It can be a great class if you are willing to deal with the frustration of figuring much of it on your own but Professor Tomlin is always there for guidence through emails. It can be annoying how everything is related to your term project because there are some cool techniques that you won't ever learn well if you don't need to apply it to your work.",
    "A great class if you want to learn GIS. I felt I got a basic understanding for a program (ArGIS) which is a really excellent skill\/understanding to have. It's such an amazingly powerful tool.Dana is great. As he reminded us several times, \"We're such undergrads\" (Dana usually teaches FES and UPenn grad students). Meaning: he's more interested that we are interested in this stuff, and that deadlines, dates, and grades aren't as important to him and shouldn't be as important to us in contrast to whether or not we're and learning and applying the material well. It was painfully obvious this mindset did not apply to a handful of students in the class, but for most of us I think this approach was great. So: got intrinsic motivation for geospatial programs? The class, the teacher, and the teaching style are perfect for you. Are you principally extrinsically motivated by your GPA and not so concerned with GIS? Maybe you should find something else.",
    "Evst290 is an excellent introduction to GIS and at the end of the course you will have a great skill set.",
    "An incredibly useful class for those thinking about going into urban planning or environmental professions! Amazing that Yale is actually offering a skills-based class like this, but take it!",
    "EVST 290 is refreshing from other courses in that it is very skill-based. You learn about a capability of ArcGIS in class and then complete an assignment each week that acknowledges that capability. Professor Tomlin is extremely helpful in helping students find data and willing to explain capabilities of the pogram. Even if you don't foresee using ArcGIS in any further academic or professional setting, it is interesting to see new visual interpretations and representations of environmental and social data.",
    "I would recommend the course to anyone that's curious about GIS. I would particularly recommend it to people who could apply GIS skills to a project they have already encountered in another class or job.",
    "Very highly recommended. Overall, I thought that FES 290 was an excellent course. The objective of the course is to introduce students to GIS as a tool for environmental problem-solving, and I certainly emerged from the class with an understanding of and appreciation for its capabilities. GIS is a very important tool in today's world - with applications ranging from ecology to economics and engineering. A great way to get some highly applicable skills that will undoubtedly come in handy in future classes or work opportunities. Professor Tomlin, if he teaches it again, is a wonderful professor; very caring and supportive.",
    "Environmental Studies 290 is a delightful course that teaches you the basics about the computer program ArcGIS which deals with spatial analysis and mapping. Each week students learn a new set of skills, and then are asked to apply them to a personal project. The class is a wonderful opportunity to create visually compelling maps for a Senior Thesis or outside research project. Professor Tomlin is very knowledgeable in the area of Geographic Information Systems, and it was a pleasure to take his class!",
    "Highly recommended. It teaches a real set of skills that could be potentially useful in any number of jobs."
