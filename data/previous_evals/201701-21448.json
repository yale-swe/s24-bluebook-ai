    "how to french",
    "I learned some French, though not as much as I would have really liked.",
    "This course is what you make of it. It is easy to learn the structures and tenses that you need to know to do well on tests. However, the actual learning of French--the idioms, the accent, the understanding of culture--comes from interacting with the professor and from putting in effort. I could have put in more effort, but I learned a lot of French and I am very grateful to the professors of this course.",
    "Reading, speaking, listening, writing French",
    "This course is a good second level French class focused on developing conversational and written French.",
    "This course is amazing, but my great experience is due completely to the actions of my teacher. She was amazing and was able to prepare us for the weekly tests in ways better than any other language teacher I have had. That being said, I think that having complex weekly tests without being fully prepared for these tests is setting students up for failure. I understand that weekly tests force students to spend time with the material, however, I think it is ridiculous to expect an out of class test every week.",
    "I learned more complex conjugations and how to speak more fluently."

   "comments": [
    "FiA is sometimes very ridiculous and would distract from the actual lesson",
    "The FiA program is badly outdated and its pedagogy doesn't seem to be working like intended. What seems like it's going to be an immersive language course kind of turns into an extremely memorization heavy slog. There is very little focus on actual conversation and comprehension, and more on teaching exactly the topics on each of the insane number of tests. Honestly felt a lot more like a high school course than a college one. It could be improved with many fewer tests, no FiA, and a greater focus on actual conversation, writing, and reading rather than rote memorization.",
    "Weaknesses: French in Action is outdated, racist, sexist, and sometimes just relatively useless. Stengths: The professors are great, the class is a lot of fun, and the immersion style learning is helpful.",
    "The course is taught well and covers a lot of material; however, I think that the French in Action videos could be updated to be less Pariscentric and more applicable to the current times.",
    "Strengths: Overall, I learned a lot and French l2 was good at preparing me to have conversations in French. Weaknesses: I did not like that review for conjugations was not continuous and that vocabulary was not very useful (e.g learning about car parts). Story line and movie choice could be updated. The workbook is very lengthy and time consuming where I learned most from class this semester. The class and personal experience is variable based on the teacher you get. I think that more measures need to be taken to make the classes more uniform in terms of the information and preparation that some students receive and not others."

   "comments": [
    "I would not recommend this course as is. The teachers are very nice people but they're all stuck with a teaching program that simply has grown too bloated. There's too many tests, too much pointless busywork, and too little actual French. While I'm normally pretty bad with languages, I've never hated the process of learning them, but I did come to hate learning French because of this course.",
    "I started L1\/L2 with no french background and now I can literally have sophisticated conversations in French and could probably write a novel. It was also the easiest 3 credits of A grades for me (granted that I'm a stem major so As are not abundant usually)",
    "Yes. The French department is awesome here and you learn an incredible amount in 1 year!",
    "This course is a lot of work but is also rewarding because you will get a fundamental understanding of the French language, especially if you keep up with the workload.",
    "I would recommend my french instructor, I'm not sure if I would recommend this course. It takes a lot of work and the class structure does not support learning, instead it almost forces students to struggle.",
    "I would recommend the course, but be advised that your experience is very much based on your TA."
