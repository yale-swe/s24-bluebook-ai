   "comments": [
    "New way of thinking about art and approaching drawing",
    "I gained insight about hard work and pushing myself outside of my (artistic) comfort zone. One of the most important thing I learned was patience, often my work did not look as good as I'd envisioned at first, but as I kept working it kept improving. I think my overall sketching and drafting ability improved because of this course.",
    "I learned about different mediums to draw with. Also, I inquired skills about looking at images in different ways. There are many ways to draw a figure with different shades and thicknesses.",
    "My drawing skills became much better.",
    "I know how to draw better and faster",
    "Professor Messer taught me how to see differently. This is a must class to learn how to draw basics. Type of work is exciting!",
    "I become more comfortable using and combining different media. I developed a better understanding of my own skills and my artistic styleand in doing so, I think I gained an appreciation for a broader range of artwork.",
    "This course made me decide that I want to double major in art and I really got an understanding of the logic and patience behind drawing. I feel like I really grew as an artist in my technical work because of this class and I'm so glad I took it.",
    "I do see the objects and people around me a little differently now that I took Basic Drawing. The act of drawing is a very beautiful way of conveying your vision of the world on a sheet of paper. I really liked the class, because it was very different from what I had ever done before and I could see myself improve more and more over the course of the semester."

   "comments": [
    "2 hours is necessary. Maybe more assignments to turn in to keep students accountable",
    "At times the class time felt very long. However, this was both a strength and a weakness. Occasionally I felt bored, but it was probably good for me to learn to work through that boredom while being patient with my work. The professor and TF were both great at encouraging and critiquing while allowing me to steer my work in the direction of my choice.",
    "The course was run very well. The strengths include a reasonable amount of work and a flexible final project. However, a weaknesses is the length of each class which was quite long.",
    "This class was incredible. Never before have I drawn from models, and doing so really improved my drawing ability. I can't think of any weaknesses for this course.",
    "I think the way Sam teaches this class is absolutely wonderful. He pays equal attention to everyone and expects according to their skills.",
    "I honestly think this class was great as it is. It's entry-level drawing and it's easy for everyone, even non-artists, to learn a lot and do well. The homework assignments were short and flexible; they were less about giving the professor something to grade and more about us just getting practice outside of the studio."

   "comments": [
    "Absolutely! Take cr\/d",
    "Yes, absolutely! A low-stress environment to greatly refine your drawing skills.",
    "I recommend this course if you have a lot of patience or want to develop a lot of patience! We spent a lot of time drawing and listening to music.",
    "I would if the student enjoys art. I enjoyed learning about different aspects of art and the homework was not tedious, but enjoyable for me since I like to draw.",
    "Take this if you get in!!",
    "This is one of the best classes I have taken so far at Yale. Professor Messer is very down to earth, and helped my drawing skills improve: i would definitely recommend taking this class.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to anyone who wants to improv their drawing",
    "I would 100% recommend. I left class each day wishing I could've stayed there all day.",
    "Yes!",
    "I would totally recommend this class to another student, because it is very fun, completely different from the other classes I've taken at Yale and you can see yourself improve over the course of the semester. The TA (Tunji) and Prof. Messer were the chillest and most kind people and they made the class a whole lot more enjoyable. It is a gem! and not too much work (except the final project, but the time commitment entirely depends on you)."
