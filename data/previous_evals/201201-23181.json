    "i would recommend it, it wasn't too high stress but still learned a lot",
    "This is a pretty standard introductory writing course! You'll read a bunch of interesting poems and novels from all different time periods and write four papers that are nicely spread out over the semester. The one thing that definitely sets this class apart from others is the professor! Tessie is an amazing teacher with so much to offer. She's always really friendly and happy, which makes for a wonderful class atmosphere. If she's teaching this or any class you're looking into, I strongly recommend that you take it. She's a really wonderful professor - don't miss out!",
    "I wonderful and interesting English course, I would definitely recommend.",
    "In \"Troubled Minds, Troubled Texts\", we read several poems and novels either about mental illness or written by authors with mental illnesses. The topic is interesting, but I think like with all 114 and 115 classes, the nature of the class still limits the depth of exploration into one specific topic. Like, don't take this class expecting to leave understanding schizophrenia. However, it will make you more aware of some interesting things that happen in this genre of literature. I would recommend the class, especially if you enjoy reading, writing, and participating in class discussions. Tessie is super strict about assignments, so if you tend to not take \"class participation\" assignments seriously, this class may not be for you.",
    "A literature seminar, but not necessarily delving into syntax and diction. More general. Conceptually easier than AP Lit.",
    "Definitely. You probably won't gain too much insight on madness, but it's a good writing\/intro lit class. I was a little surprised that the emphasis was more on analyzing literature than writing, since it's a WR credit, but it strikes a pretty good balance. The reading is generally interesting (King Lear, Woman in White, Mrs Dalloway, The Wasteland), and classes generally involve good group discussion.",
    "Great class, great instructor. My writing and analytical skills have improved, and I also gained a lot from discussions with class members.",
    "I would definitely recommend English 115 to any student regardless of their anticipated major. English 115 isa course that greatly helped me improve my writing and my critical analysis skills, and the theme of the materials covered (madness in writing) was particularly intriguing.",
    "YEP YEP",
    "English 115 is a class very similar to AP LIt. It really depends upon the teacher you have and be incredibly wary of taking the class for the texts rather than the professor. It's taught by a grad student so it's really hit or miss."
