   "comments": [
    "This is a fairly lightweight class. If you are interested in linguistics and the evolution of languages, I would recommend this class highly. Professor Poole is a warm and engaging instructor who is clearly passionate about this area of study (particularly the middle ages).",
    "Most definitely! I feel like it really helps you understand the diversity in the modern language as a whole and you should definitely take this course. If you're not into the history side of things you might have to suffer through a bit of boring stuff, but you'll get through it and then make weird faces as you're pronouncing sounds for no reason. It's great.",
    "Yes, definitely take this course. Kevin Poole is the greatest and his class is so chill. It's pretty much a survey of all things linguistic and historical with regard to the development of the Spanish language, and Kevin knows EVERYTHING there is to know about it. Note that this isn't a conversational class. Kevin will just talk at you for an hour but it's so interesting and he's soooo smart. So keep that in mind: you may not say a word all semester, but if you're proactive about it you can get some entertaining conversations going.",
    "It is a linguistics class really. I wanted to learn more about the history of the language (which I did) but I guess the history is all linguistics. I would recommend it if linguistics is your thing.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class if you like linguistics and speak Spanish. You will learn why the language is what it is now and rules you learned in L1-L4 will be explained in a historial\/linguistical context. Professor Poole is funny, knowledgeable and a joy to listen to. Besides, there is not that much work. This class just make me love Spanish even more.",
    "Cool overview of the language from linguistic and historical perspectives. At times it can be very dry - A 75 minute 9 am lecture about the historical influence of the [i] sound in nouns is not ideal for me - but with an interest in linguistics and history it is a worthwhile course. I would have loved to have learned more about modern-era developments like Latin American Spanish, creoles, and things like that, but all in all I enjoyed the material. If you're looking for an opportunity to keep up with your use of spoken Spanish, however, I wouldn't say this is it. There is not a ton of opportunity to participate in class, and there are so few assignments that, while pretty easy\/undemanding, the course is more than anything an exercise in listening to Spanish.",
    "I really appreciate the perspective that Span 363 has given me. Seeing the Spanish language from a larger historicolinguistic perspective is truly valuable. Now I understand, to some extent, why Spanish sounds the way it does. The class also gives you a number of linguistic tools and terms that can be used to further analyze and make sense of the changes you hear in Spanish today. Also, Kevin Poole really makes the class, as he\u2019s a super fun professor with an encyclopedic mind. It was clear to me that this is exactly the kind of class that he likes to teach. I completely recommend it.",
    "The course goes through the linguistic history of the Spanish language, from prehistory to modern times. It is interesting and a very reasonable work load.",
    "If you are really interested in the material and can stay focused during an hour and a half lecture -- go for it. I found it alternately interesting and boring, but this is likely because it was not the class for me. It's a very easy going class with out many grades at all.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to other students, especially to those interested in history, Spanish and culture. The professor is fantastic, the subjects we covered during the year were fascinating, and the course load is not very high. Without a doubt, take it!",
    "I highly recommend any class with Professor Poole. He is incredibly willing to entertain thoughts and questions, and is truly interested in his students. This class had an interesting topic, and almost no work outside of nightly readings, which were rarely tested. This may sound nice, but I feel as if my knowledge of the topic was limited by the lack of homework.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to a fellow student of Spanish, especially one interested in pursuing a Spanish major. Too many L5 Spanish courses are run-of-the-mill history or literature subjects, but this is a refreshing break from that. It's also not too difficult; it's a class where you can learn without being stressed out."
