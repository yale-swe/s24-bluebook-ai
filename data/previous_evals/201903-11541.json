    "A skill that I believe this course has been especially helpful in helping me develop is how to read and prepare for seminars where the topics vary quite a lot and where the prep time is limited - viz. week-to-week. This has at times been challenging seeing as I had read almost none of the articles in the past. But for this very reason, too, the course helped me gain a deeper insight in a wide variety of philosophical issues. I have felt very welcome to the department through this course, which helped the transition from my previous institution. Plus it was simply great fun!"
