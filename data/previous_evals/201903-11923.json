    "Learned some stuff in the first half, but it was kind of boring. Second half was semi-informative but taught poorly.",
    "I learned how to evaluate medical papers and the types of clinical trials they used.",
    "Basic stats course---what you learn in AP stats.",
    "This course was a pretty good intro stat class. I thought the 100 part went decently fast, but it was set up to succeed and get a lot of help.",
    "basic statistical skills",
    "How to use minitab and an overview of statistical principles and topics.",
    "I learned a lot of foundational statistics concepts in the first half of the class. And while the second half started promising in terms of learning about clinical trial design and other statistics related to medicine, the complete disorganization of the course once professor Barbour took over the class, negatively impacted both my interest and learning.",
    "I learned more about basic methods in statistics.",
    "Learned all about how to interpret and analyze data, how to set up an experiment, relevance of data, etc.",
    "The first half of the course was great. I learned relevant statistics at a basic enough level and pace to retain the information. In the second half, I genuinely don't think I learned anything. In fact, I believe I may have lost knowledge.",
    "I learned basic skills in performing statistical analysis and the use of MiniTab.",
    "Well, the first half of the class was a good class. I learned about basic statistics and gained a strong introductory knowledge of the concepts. JDRS is a great teacher who cares about student learning. The second half of the class was a true joke. I legitimately think I learned nothing. I may have actually lost knowledge. I have never taken a class in my life where I think my intellectual ability actually decreased.",
    "I learned basic statistical analysis that I am now able to apply both in daily life and in moments relevant to my major.",
    "With JDRS, I learned basic statistics and how common they are in everyday life. Once we were divided into our sections, I learned that 105 may be the reason why I lost a few brain cells (because I learned nothing).",
    "I reviewed basic statistical principles and improved my ability to create and understand statistics.",
    "Not sure",
    "A basic knowledge of statistics in relation to medical research.",
    "stats, how to analyze stats papers",
    "I learned about all those funny numbers that are associated with studies and data that I didn't understand before. Before I took the course I didn't quite know how to tell what made something solid, statistically speaking, and it gave me depression. But now \"p-values\" are second nature and I understand linear regression.",
    "I learned the basic principles and concepts of statistics such as regression and the p-test. We then learned to interpret clinical research papers with our knowledge of the principles.",
    "A lot of statistics I would need to know for analyzing medical papers and statistical studies.",
    "Data analysis and use of MiniTab",
    "Basic understanding of stats and it also taught me how to read papers about medicine.",
    "How to read medical papers",
    "I learned a lot about basic statistics. I did not take AP Statistics in high school and found the rigor of the course to be appropriate. For the \"Medicine\" section, I learned how to read and understand clinical trials and papers, which was interesting when thinking about medicine and the data interpretation necessary.",
    "reading papers",
    "I learned some basic statistical concepts.",
    "I learned about statistics and how to interpret clinical trial papers",
    "This course was a great introduction into statistics and what it is. The content is fairly basic, for the beginning part of the semester, we learned things such as linear regression and probability.",
    "The first eight weeks of Intro Stats with JDRS were great, and I learned a lot about how to do basic statistical calculations and analyses.",
    "I learned intro to stats knowledge and how to more or less identify different randomized clinical trials. I learned how missing data, placebo effect, sample size, etc. affected these trials. I also learned about various other trial types and their relevant uses (e.g. step-wedge design when you have small sample size).",
    "basic regression, understanding better the stat used in medical papers and the importance of looking closely at them, realizing that stats can make data look skewed depending on how it is presented, making my own conclusions for the stats which may not necessarily align with what the paper says.",
    "I learned the basics of statistics and how to perform statistical analyses, especially regarding the medical field.",
    "A lot about basic statistics and medicine",
    "Transitioned from simple stat concepts like standard deviation and interquartile range to methods of calculating probability\/running surveys and hypothesis testing in the group section and then learned how to read\/conduct a satisfactory clinical trial during the second half of the term.",
    "First half of the course was great- learned a lot about basic stats, and JDRS was an energetic lecture. Second half? Oh boy... out of the 2 classes that I actually attended, the professor legitimately just read off of his slides (which he mainly got off the internet). So I did not gain much (or any, for that matter) knowledge from the second half.",
    "stats",
    "I gained a solid foundation in statistics.",
    "JDS did a great job teaching intro stats. We went over a lot of applicable material, especially for a premed student. He helped me understand what statistics actually means in light of all of the jargon.",
    "The first half of the course, was a very comprehensive and well-structured introduction to statistics. I learned the fundamentals of statistics and probability, in a clear way that was easy to understand and follow. In the second half of the course, things got somewhat less efficient, clear, and understandable, and I cannot omit to say that I felt at times as if I was learning nothing from that part of the course. I feel that in the second half of the course, I learned how to read through medical literature and analyze some the statistics behind it.",
    "I have developed a basic understanding of statistics, and how to apply this knowledge into very real and important clinical trials that the public uses when making decisions on taking medications.",
    "How to read medical stats papers pretty well, lots of different ways of analysis."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Wish we learned R in the first half instead of Mini-tab. The second half (105) was poorly taught--lecture and the PSETs were unclear.",
    "A major weakness is that the professor never really teaches us how to read medical papers. During lectures, he just gives us terminology and expects us to automatically know how to connect them together and apply them to medical journals. Speaking of lectures, there is very little engagement with the professor since he just reads off the powerpoint. Another problem I had was the lack of organization on his Canvas. I never knew how I was supposed to be preparing myself for class, and I could never find out what medical journal we are discussing until the day of class. Really hard to follow along, and the professor doesn't help to mitigate that.",
    "Strengths: JDRS's part was great---fun, engaging, lots of opportunities to learn and practice. Weaknesses: 105 was so disorganized. We didn't have a syllabus, the professor thought we knew R even though this is an intro course, and I still don't know what the grade breakdown is going to be like, even though we're essentially at the end of the course. The professor read off the slides in class. The only reason I would rate this class as 'good' is for the first portion taught by JDRS. 105 was a bit of a logistical nightmare.",
    "I like how the class splits and is recorded so you can watch from home. This gives major flexibility to the course which is nice for a lot of people taking the class. Once in med stat however, I felt there was a lot of things that I had no idea what they were and it was hard to express this to Prof Barbour.",
    "I did not really learn much, especially during the medicine specific portion of the class.",
    "JDRS was an incredible professor who was very engaging and taught the material clearly. I liked the format of the course, having psets and quizzes through canvas to learn the material, and having two midterms through canvas as well.",
    "Starting everyone in the same class with JDRS is great. However, a huge weakness was the complete lack of organization once we break off into our 105 specific section.",
    "The first half of this course was very well done. Once Prof Barbour started teaching, things went down hill.",
    "JDRS is a fantastic lecturer. I liked how many office hours there were.",
    "Amazing course. Perfect. Only complaint is that I wish we had a classroom big enough to fit everybody.",
    "The first half of the course with JDRS was great! It was very clear and very fair. However, the second half was an absolute mess. All of the knowledge I gained came from the first half. More people went to the TA's office hours than to lecture.",
    "The first half was well-organized, PSETS were fair and helpful, and the exams were a good checkup on my progress. Honestly no complaints at all here--JDRS is great. The second half was absurdly irrelevant and unhelpful. More people went to office hours then lecture. It was that bad. I'm not even sure if the TAs knew what was going on. The assignments were incredibly unclear, unhelpful, and there was essentially no way to get the answers even if you attended lecture and paid attention. The TA office hours were the only way. At least the course was easy.",
    "JDRS is an amazing, engaging professor. Love having lecture online so I can rewatch and learn at my own pace. I also really liked having extra time for the midterms because I tended to be slow at answering the questions.",
    "I was not a fan of the online midterms because as a varsity athlete in season, I actually never have a continuous three hour block of time free in which to take the exams, and ended up having to miss practice in order to take the tests for this class.",
    "JDRS taught super well (and you didn't even have to go to class, just watch the videos\/recordings of the classes!). He really allowed us to focus on the learning aspect rather than the grade. The second section\/105 is a bit rough. He reads off the lecture slides basically every class so staying awake can be a challenge. But he does post all of the lectures after class which was much appreciated for the homework.",
    "It is a tremendously large course which can make it seem impersonal at times. However, I feel that it is well-designed for learning.",
    "Strengths- syllabus in theory Weaknesses- big gap between umbrella to section",
    "The strengths were that it was very easy to follow along for the first part, however, when we started talking about medical research it became very confusing and there was not much of a connection between how basic statistical values related to what was being discussed. It was possible to figure out, but it would have been nice to see a stronger\/clearer connection.",
    "strengths: not too stressful with recorded lectures and take home exams weaknesses: first half of the semester went by kind of fast and was confusing at times (but there are a lot of peer tutors so if you are committed to the course then that shouldn't be an issue)",
    "Strength- JRDS Weakness- very long p-sets that even with multiple visits to office hours can take days to finish causing more stress on handing something in than actually learning.",
    "I thought the first half of the semester was incredible. I learned a lot about statistical analysis and how to perform it. In the second half, the course got very dry. While I think I got better at reading and interpreting medical papers, the class itself was pretty boring, and all the useful information could get read from the slide. It just felt like a thrown-together-at-the-last-minute class in the second half of the semester.",
    "Strength was that JDRS was a very funny and interactive instructor. Weakness was course was a little disorganized.",
    "The umbrella course is fantastic - JDRS is an engaging lecturer his materials are very illuminating. The medicine section, however, is undoubtedly the worst course I have ever taken at Yale. There was absolutely zero organisation to the class, and decisions regarding grading, work and material seemed to be made impromptu when the course section was already in progress. The lecture content didn't really correspond to the problem sets' questions, and the TAs weren't even granted access to the Canvas site in the first week, so literally no one had any idea how to do the problem sets. Overall, it was extremely frustrating to do the medicine section, because no one was able to prepare for anything for more than 5 days in advance.",
    "The second half of the course was taught at a level that is too high for the students in the class. The professor discussed plug ins for R before the students were aware of how to use R. Also I think that the course could have been more engaging in general.",
    "The topic was interesting, which is sad because it was honestly the worst taught class I have taken at Yale, which is sad because the professor was so nice and considerate. He simply does not know how to teach. I have never had a teacher so blatantly read words off a lecture slide before.",
    "The huge number of resources (many office hours and many different times and locations, online lectures, and clear course notes) was very helpful in JDRS's class. However, often, the instruction in the \"medicine\" section was unclear and office hours were at inconvenient locations.",
    "not much feedback, professor was very nice",
    "This course moves much too fast. It was practically impossible to keep up with it if this is serving as your first encounter with statistics, despite what the course title would suggest. Those who have had exposure to the material prior to the course generally found it easy, however, those who I talked to who haven't, including myself, found the concepts too complex and too numerous to be grasped in such a short time frame.",
    "the content is not too difficult. I think the split semester concept does not make too much sense though, because since I was in medicine, very little of the content I learned in the first half of the semester applied to what I did in the second part of the semester",
    "JRDS is a pretty engaging lecturer, and he makes the content more enjoyable to learn. There are five sets and two midterms for the beginning part of the course, the midterms being take-home, which are usually good assessments of how you are keeping up in the class. Grading is fairly easy, and it is not hard to get an A in this class with some effort.",
    "I learnt very little in this course about statistics.",
    "For the combined Intro Stats, I liked how the classes were recorded so I could take watch and take notes and my own pace. For the Medical Stats, the lectures were very dry and confusing and the problem sets lacked any direction whatsoever.",
    "The professor could perhaps instead of merely presenting information on slides, give more concrete examples of how the statistical theory could be applied to various cases.",
    "I think taking the basic course as 10X was pretty cool. I wish there was more basic R used in the course as opposed to minitab since R seems to be more used in the real world.",
    "This course was a very good introduction to statistics. Some concepts are hard to understand and it would be great if those concepts could be explained more.",
    "The second half way a bit hard to follow at times",
    "The first section with Jonathan was excellent between his engaging style, videocasted lectures, help sessions, and manageable homework. The second section had interesting papers.",
    "Strengths: First half was fair and systematic. Weaknesses: Second half was utter chaos, where office hours were attended more than the lectures.",
    "good",
    "The first half of the course moved at a reasonable pace. However, the second half of the course was taught in an unorganized manner.",
    "Live streaming the class was a great idea. It allowed me to look back at lectures to better understand complex topics that may have tricked me up on the homework.",
    "First half of the course: The course was well-outlined, and built in such a way that facilitated learning and allowed me to learn the content that was presented in class. The lectures were extremely useful, and I loved how they were uploaded online, as that actually allowed me to retain much more from them and go back to them if need be. The homework sets were useful in reinforcing the concepts that were taught in class. Second half of the course: This half was very much not what the first one was. The lectures were not helpful at all, the slides made little sense, and it was extremely hard to understand what was taught most of the time. The course lacked organization, context, and purpose: it was really not clear what we learning and why every fact that we were called to learn made sense. We did not look to build up on anything we were taught on the first half of the semester. If it wasn't for Mark Torres, a ULA, I do not think I could have made it through any of the homework assignments, simply because they made no sense, and lacked some times structure too. Mark was a godsend, an amazing ULA, who worked extremely hard to make certain everyone understood the concepts that were taught, so as to be able to complete the homework assignments. Overall, I really thought that apart from the fact that I got in touch with some medical literature, I gained very few things from this course. This course is in urgent need for restructuring, and rethinking of its aim and purpose.",
    "The course is overall well taught. However, I found the first half to be very fast paced and sometimes a little bit difficult to keep up with.",
    "Poorly organized, no syllabus, we didn't know for a while how the class was graded and what the final project\/exam would be. Homework questions are unclear so office hours is essential."

   "comments": [
    "I would take a different stats class.",
    "I would recommend this course only if you're interested in reading medical journals and you have the time to learn how to do so by yourself. If you're looking for student-professor engagement or homework that doesn't make you go on a wild goose chase through all of his files to figure out what the questions are even talking about, I would not take this class.",
    "Yes---if you want a nice intro course that's not too hard. If you've taken AP stats and are interested in taking more stats classes, don't take this. If you've taken AP stats and just want to get a requirement done, this is a good option.",
    "If you want a good introduction to stats, this is probably the best class for you- however if you just want to learn simple stats, take the half semester of just 100. If you are pre-med I thought the med stat portion was interesting but still difficult.",
    "It was very easy, so if you are just looking for an easy class, then sure, but there are plenty of better statistics classes if you are actually interested in learning statistics.",
    "Yes it was a great introduction to statistics!",
    "Not if professor Barbour is teaching the medicine portion again. I think even premed students would benefit more by taking the R class or literally any of the other subsections over this one as currently taught.",
    "Dont take it unless you have to, or choose a different section that has a better teacher.",
    "Yes, I would. The workload isn't too bad and you actually learn a lot.",
    "Yes. It is amazing, enjoyable, and you learn a lot!",
    "I would recommend this if you are looking for a low workload course.",
    "Yes, unless you already took AP statistics or something of that nature. I believe basic knowledge statistics and data analysis is very important no matter what field you're interested in. However, do not take 105 (I am talking to you, pre-meds) as long as Barbour is teaching (though I believe he may be leaving?). It's not helpful.",
    "I would recommend the general 100 series, but I would not recommend 105 as a section. The material we learned was not well explained, and the TAs were necessary in order to get through all of the material clearly and answer the problem sets.",
    "If you want to have a very easy class then yes, but if you want to learn literally anything take another section.",
    "Yes, if they were interested in a good intro level stats class.",
    "Sure! Pretty chill stats class and you do learn the basics pretty well!",
    "Yes, this is a great course to review basic statistical principles if you don't want to get too advanced. It is also a great intro to the more advanced statistics classes if you want a refresher.",
    "No",
    "Yes. It incorporates important values that are relevant across many different fields.",
    "Honestly I don't think I got that much out of this class, but also I didn't put that much into it. Overall I probably would recommend this course if you need it for some reason (for example its probably one of the easier QRs) and JDRS is a great professor.",
    "The first 8 weeks of the class I recommend to anyone as it helps them understand what they should listen to in terms of trustworthy data.",
    "I highly recommend the first part of the class to everyone. It really is an incredible introduction to statistical analysis, and it is taught at level that anyone can take but still moves quickly to more complicated concepts. I thought the medical aspect of the course had some value to it; I improved my ability to read clinical study papers. However, it was very dry, boring, and I question if I could have learned just as much by reading more clinical studies in my free time with my new knowledge from the first half of the semester.",
    "I would not recommend it to a student who really wants to learn in-depth about medical statistics. The concepts we cover are very surface-level.",
    "nah",
    "Stick with 103. Don't do 105. You will learn nothing in the medicine section.",
    "I would if they are interested in learning how to read about medical trials and are very interested in medical literature.",
    "If you have to, it is a fine class. Also, IT IS NOT A GUT. YOUR FRIENDS ARE ONLY SAYING THIS BECAUSE THEY TOOK AP STATS IN HIGH SCHOOL. IF YOU DID NOT TAKE AP STATS IN HIGH SCHOOL YOU WILL SUFFER",
    "I would recommend this course to another student. It was interesting but not overly challenging.",
    "only if necessary",
    "I would not recommend this course to students new to statistics. The class is better suited to students who need a refresher on core statistical concepts.",
    "yes, it is not too difficult, you learn a lot about statistics and the information is relevant for later classes",
    "I would recommend this course to another student who is looking for an easy QR credit or someone who has not taken statistics before and wants a good introductory course to the topic.",
    "I would recommend Intro to Stats, but not 105. Students would be better off taking another version of Intro to Stats.",
    "I'm not sure if I would recommend, just because the lectures are a drag. You can probably learn the material on your own if given the syllabus.",
    "Yes. You get out of it what you put in and it is a non-intimidating way to start off learning stats.",
    "I would recommend this course because it is a great way to get to know statistics.",
    "Yes",
    "If you do take Intro Stats, do not take STATS 105. It is truly a waste of your time. The p-sets were wack, and you would basically only get full points if you showed up to office hours and write down what the TA said word for word.",
    "no",
    "The first half of the course was a great experience. However, the second half seemed disorganized and incoherent at times.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course because it is very relaxed and you get to learn about introductory statistics which will help you understand the world better.",
    "If you want to get acquainted with statistics in general the 100 sequence is a great place to start. For 105 in specific, I would say that it doesn't really offer that much, and it really is badly taught but if you take it you probably have to.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to another student. I found both professors to be very kind and care about student learning, and really enjoyed the course.",
    "I think you'd be better off taking a different more standard stats class. I didn't learn much."
