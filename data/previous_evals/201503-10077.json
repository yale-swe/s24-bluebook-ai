    "Instructor: Janna Kelly Gonwa \u00a0Janna was thoughtful and actively engaged in garnering section participation in section. Her provisional surveys of theologians and their respective governing themes and historical contexts also proved helpful. Her consideration of our papers were most helpful, however. The time she spent analyzing our exegetical efforts and commenting on them accordingly helped orient me as I traversed the coursework. Thanks, Janna!",
    "Instructor: Janna Kelly Gonwa \u00a0The strengths of Ms. Gonwa were great understanding for the students regarding their strengths, weaknesses, and individual personalities. She managed to create a safe space for discussion where everyone could be heard, including myself as an introvert, but where there was still room for critical engagement with authors and the different opinions of students. She also managed to explain and situate the theologians in ways that attributed to Prof. Elder's teaching. The only fault I would have would be the time it took for papers to be returned, but I have full understanding that Ms. Gonwa herself has a lot more reading and work on her plate than we do. Overall, Ms. Gonwa was the best TF, I have yet experienced at YDS.",
    "Instructor: Janna Kelly Gonwa \u00a0Janna did an excellent job of merging lectures with our readings and helping us to understand the material while keeping everyone actively engaged in sections. Her comments on how to thing about writing our papers as well as the comments on the papers are extremely helpful.",
    "Instructor: Janna Kelly Gonwa \u00a0Excellent. Clear, well organised, always helpful and willing to give constructive comments. Be more confident! She is doing really well; one of the best TA I have met at Yale so far.",
    "Instructor: Janna Kelly Gonwa \u00a0Janna was an incredible TF. Amazingly helpful in discussion sections and with papers.",
    "Instructor: Janna Kelly Gonwa \u00a0Prof. Elder would hint at the practical implications of the theologies that we were examining. Janna would then build upon these implications in section. Her ability to demonstrate the practical implications of abstract, heady theology showed especially strongly during our unit on James Cone. Even though I personally strongly disliked Cone, after Janna spoke to us about the ways in which Cone's theology can function to empower Black people in the United States, I actually do appreciate what Cone was doing. Furthermore, she was a very effective discussion leader. Early on, she would use a system of cards to give people a clear turn at offering comments and questions, but as those in our section grew more comfortable with each other, she would often step back and let us dialogue with each other and only stepped in as a fellow theologian-in-training who was interested in the ideas. Generally, I would suggest that she just develop more confidence. She is a good theologian and a good teacher who is clearly passionate about the material; a small dose of self-confidence would take her from good to great.",
    "Instructor: Janna Kelly Gonwa \u00a0Her ability to explain the technical aspects of the class. Her ability to be interactive with the students Her knowledge of the subject matter",
    "Instructor: Janna Kelly Gonwa \u00a0The teaching fellow was extremely helpful and provided great comments and assistance in section. She is clearly passionate about the subject and that excitement translated into some great section discussions. Her comments on papers were really helpful as well.",
    "Instructor: Janna Kelly Gonwa \u00a0Janna was a truly incredible teaching fellow. She showed concern for how the material was being engaged with on a practical and meaningful level. She was able to explain difficult and complex problems woth grace. She created a space for respectful intellectual disagreement. I would take another course just to have her as a teaching fellow again.",
    "Instructor: Janna Kelly Gonwa \u00a0Janna did a good job. My only complaint would be that, in the interest of her not giving us too much guidance with the papers and exam, she would often not answer questions that it seems like she could have answered. She probably just needs to continue to navigate the boundaries between being helpful and feeding us the answers. Otherwise, section was great!",
    "Instructor: Janna Kelly Gonwa \u00a0Janna was extraordinarily well-prepared for every section. She responded to questions carefully and critically, always making sure that students understood her answer before proceeding. Janna challenged us to go beyond simply grasping the texts, encouraging us to engage in analysis and critique. Her comments on my papers were helpful and extensive. She worked very hard, and her effort was both noticed and greatly appreciated by her students."
