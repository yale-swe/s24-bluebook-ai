   "comments": [
    "This is a good survey course in the Roman Empire. I would recommend it.",
    "I would recommend this course if you are Classics major, or just like history.",
    "Yes, take this.",
    "Take the class regardless of whether you've studied the Empire or not. Professor Matthews really gets into the material and is extremely passionate.",
    "This is an awesome class. I love John Matthews as a teacher, and he really got me excited about Roman History. I'm a science person who found this a very relaxed and easy way to get a writing\/humanities credit. I really enjoyed the lectures, and if you get someone to take notes for you, it could be like story time with grandpa twice a week.",
    "Yes, I would.",
    "Good WR credit, though material may become dull at times.",
    "The lectures for this course range from engaging to agonizingly pedantic. The course material was often poorly organized and expectations for the course were very difficult to understand because of it. That being said, the material is fascinating, and it is a topic and reading list that any Yale student should have at least a survey-level understanding of. I recommend it for the material, but hope that the course itself improves the next time around. This would be an interesting Cr\/D\/Fail course.",
    "A highly engaging survey course on Roman imperial history. Essential for anyone interested in ancient history. The days we spent covering late antiquity were also highly interesting, and taught me a lot about a period that I had never learned much before. I would recommend it to anyone with even the slightest interest in history, it's hard to go wrong with this course. The amount of reading is considerable, though not impossibly so, if you decide to do it all. Be warned, even non-WR students have to write a lengthy term paper, but all in all eventhat was a useful experience.",
    "This class was kind of a mixed bag. The lectures were fairly interesting, but they were often disorganized and a little hard to follow. The professor would often jump back and forth between topics that were only tangentially related with no clear motive. The class is very little work, though. This was great for me, since I really only took it because I needed a writing credit. Overall, I would recommend this class to anybody who needs a writing credit and doesn't want to put in a whole lot of work. The entire grade for this class is based on section participation, two papers, and the final, so you can get a decent grade with not much effort.",
    "I would recommend Roman Empire for anyone interested in history.",
    "Roman Empire offers an excellent survey of the era while sticking to solid evidence in the readings and compelling anecdotes in class. The professor and TAs did good jobs of conveying the content both as a narrative and as themes, and it was a highly enjoyable course to take.",
    "This is a class that could be a lot better. I would not recommend it, but if you're very into the Roman Empire, you may like it.",
    "This class is an excellent survey of a period which is so complex and lengthy. Johm Matthews is a very engaging lecturer and extremely adorable, beyond his obvious expertise in his field. The material covered in lecture is really interesting and important to know in the light of the development of Western history. The reading from the coursepacket is useful and is covered on the final, but the rest can largely be ignored. There is a take home midterm (for the non-WR option) and a longer final paper, but both seem pretty fairly graded. Overall, a really enjoyable course.",
    "Yes. Take it.",
    "Yes especially if you have not taken a history class before or really like Roman history! Great class to take for a writing credit.",
    "Take this class! The material is interesting, and Professor Matthews is an excellent professor. A lot of reading though.",
    "Interesting and (at times) surprisingly funny lecture. I took it non-WR and the midterm was very easy, and the final was pretty decent too. To do well you need to learn the larger themes, but thankfully you don't have to get bogged down in memorizing tiny things.",
    "A great overview of the Roman Empire if you are interested (and even if you\u0092re not!) I myself enjoyed the class very much, and I felt like a learned a lot afterwards about an entire era instead of just a brief time period. There is a lot of reading, but a lot of it is extra and not really necessary. Read Suetonius, though. It\u0092s worth it.I took this class for a WR credit as a freshman hoping to learn at least a little about writing at the college level, but we did not focus on writing techniques in my WR sections at all, which was disappointing. This is a less intense WR credit, with a midterm paper and final paper. I think that your level of interest in this class certainly correlates with how much you are able to enjoy it. I love classics and classical civilization, and I felt like a learned a lot!",
    "I would recommend this class if you are interested in the Roman Empire, otherwise you might find it a little boring. The writing credit that comes along with it is great if that's what you're looking for.",
    "Took it Credit\/D, I don't recommend doing that. I think the class would be good if you do the readings and take it seriously for a grade. Cr\/D just makes it boring becuase you don't have enough of the info to connect the dots.",
    "This is a must-take class. Not so much workload. Though the reading might be significant, the reading materials are very interesting.",
    "If you need a humanities req, or you're interested in Roman history, yes, definitely.",
    "A very enjoyable course if you're interested in the Roman Empire. John Matthews was an amazing lecturer, but to really know the information you need to read or super cram when it comes to final time. I would recommend Roman Empire, especially for WR.",
    "This a great course all-in-all, and I would endorse it to almost anyone. Most people are delighted that they don't actually have to do the reading, but it is worth doing. The primary sourcesare especially good. Lectures can be fascinating, but they can also be a bit rambling and incoherent. It's about a 50\/50 shot each lecture. The subject matter is wonderful--who isn't interested in Roman imperial history? The one real downside is the disparity between the classics majors and the non-classics majors. The former can find things too slow; the latter, too fast.",
    "A good class, but there is a lot of reading of primary sources that may lead you to turn to outside texts for the more \"historical\" stuff. Overall, Roman History is extremely interesting and I would recommend the class.",
    "I would recommend this class if a student does not have an otherwise heavy workload",
    "I would recommend the course. It is just an amazing history course.",
    "Yes, I learned a ton and the class is a easy writing credit with just two papers (and one is the midterm)",
    "Roman Empire is a fantastic course. This, combined with the Republic course in the fall, made me a Classics major. John Matthews is wonderful. He is a leading scholar of the late Empire, and is also a great lecturer. Though the class was large, Professor Matthews was very accessible and helpful in answering individual questions about the subject matter if one took the initiative to ask. Take a class with him if you can.",
    "Good way to get a writing credit.",
    "Matthews is a fantastic lecturer, although the middle portion of the class this year (roughly Aurelius to Diocletian) was vague and dealt endlessly with only two themes (Christianity and the military, both ascendant). It's not a difficult class, the subject matter is interesting, and you'll be reading mostly primary sources (which is AWESOME).It's a large lecture, so you're unlikely to be ableto engage personally with the professor. If you want a relationship with your instructor, or if you want to avoid brushing over big swaths of history, consider his Historians of the Roman Empire seminar, which, from what I understand, is very good. The timeline's a bit different, of course. If you want an overview of Imperial history, stay right here.",
    "Great class to take. Really interesting and great for a writing credit.",
    "Roman Empire is a great class. A lot of people wind up taking it for the writing credit, but looking beyond that the course is extremely informative and a great look at the history of the ancient world. The course covers the rise of Octavian up till the reign of Justinian. Professor Matthews is very knowledgeable about the subject, and though his lecturing style may seem a bit disjointed at times, he is a great source of information on the topic and very good at imparting a compelling human element to otherwise distant history. Highly recommended.",
    "This is an excellent way to get a WR credit, but I loved the class as well. It was usually very entertaining. The workload is minimal, but the material is actually interesting if you are somewhat interested in the topic. If you hate learning about Romans, then don't take the class."
