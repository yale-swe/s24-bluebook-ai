   "comments": [
    "Writing a senior thesis was invaluable to my development as an academic. Having a colloquium to structure deadlines and writing was incredibly helpful for learning how to conceptualize and complete a longer project.",
    "Research skills, how to write a year-long thesis ; how to revise and reorganize such a large body of writing.",
    "I learned how to write a comprehensive, long essay and how to self-motivate on a large, year-long project like a senior essay.",
    "The year-long senior project encourages you to develop your own project and work on it throughout the senior year, an invaluable skill if you are thinking about pursuing this type of research after Yale. It is a nice way to spend your senior year and a nice way to cap off your American Studies program.",
    "Beyond what I learned from the work itself, I learned how to support my peers who were in the same struggle bus. I learned how to sustain my ideas throughout a long project and how to share my ideas with people who weren't as familiar with my topic. All of the conversations I had with my classmates and Jorge helped me clarify what I was doing and pushed me forward."

   "comments": [
    "None!",
    "The colloquium was structured incredibly well, and met all of our individual and group needs, specific to our own research projects, which helped us stay motivated and focused throughout the course of the entire year.",
    "Strengths: we got great feedback along the way, we had a set time every week to check in, which I found useful, and we had the group as a support system. Weaknesses: I'm not sure really what to say here or how it could have been improved. A lot of this course depended on an individual's own ability to self-motivate due to the nature of what it was. No weaknesses I can think of.",
    "I loved the organization of the course meeting once a week, with more focused attention during the first semester and more freedom to write, edit, and revise during the second semester. Of course, a lot of your experience in this class depends on your faculty advisor and the relationship you have with him\/her.",
    "STRENGTHS: Conversations in class were well-tailored to helping us figure out what we were doing and what we needed to do next It was great to have a space in the second-semester to just think and work on the projects It was really nice that everyone rallied to see the play project at the end of second semester It was really nice to have the colloquium at the end, and to see that grad students had read the works and engaged with them Class felt like a no-judgement zone, like no shame if you didn't do what you set out to do--everyone understood the struggle. IMPROVEMENT: Everyone was working on different types of projects, which made deadlines weird. It would have been helpful to have a stronger sense of what was due when without the deadlines shifting. I wish there was more peer-editing!"

   "comments": [
    "Yes",
    "Yes! For anyone strongly considering or even on the fence about a year-long thesis\/research project, I say go for it. Our colloquium leader made the project manageable.",
    "Yes! I would recommend the senior project intensive year-long option for American Studies majors because it was really great to feel deeply engaged over a long period of time and we developed a nice sense of camaraderie as a group, helping each other out when needed.",
    "I would recommend the year-long thesis; it is a lot of work, especially compared against fulfilling the senior requirement with a senior seminar, but it was rewarding.",
    "Do the yearlong! You'll get to know your fellow AMST majors, get a better sense of how to \"do\" American Studies, and work on something you really care about. It'll be worth it in the end, trust me!"
