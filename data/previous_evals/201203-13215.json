    "Great reading list. Professor Quint is funny, dedicated, brilliant. Perhaps the most constructive paper-writing experience I have encountered thus far at Yale. Interesting regardless of prior exposure to Milton or the classical epic tradition. (Despite having studied Paradise Lost twice before, I always left each class with new appreciation of and understanding for the poem.)",
    "If you are at all interested in Western epics, take this class. You will be consistently amazed by Prof. Quint's scholarship and happy to learn all the things he has to say. This is definitely a heavy class (if you plan to do all the reading, which you must) but a very satisfying one at that.",
    "I would recommend this course, but with a few minor reservations. Because of the length of many of these poems, details from the less well known ones can be hard to recall as the semester goes on, given the limited amount of time that is spent on many of them. Nevertheless, the reads are great, and Quint is a deeply knowledgable and accommodating professor."
