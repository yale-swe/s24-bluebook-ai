    "it was awesome. Got out of the anxiety of speaking German. Its still rough, but Max has been great.",
    "I got a great introduction to the German language. I've learned a lot, considering that I've only been exposed to German for a few short months. It has helped me learn to communicate in German, but has also taught me about linguistic roots of words, and has helped generalize my knowledge of languages and their varying structures.",
    "I started this class not knowing one word of german and by the end I can make sentences and talk to my family in the language. The class goes through a lot of topics and grammar and really focuses on speaking ability.",
    "The fact that this class was taught in German really helped me to hear and get a handle on the different grammatical structures of the language a lot faster than I believe i would have otherwise. We also got a little introduction into some of the different cultural practices in Germany, though mostly the focus was on language. I definitely feel like I now have a strong foundation to help me keep learning German in an effective way.",

   "comments": [
    "its awesome. don't change anything.",
    "Although at times I was frustrated that this course was taught entirely in German (for example, it's hard to explain the German alphabet in German to a group of students who have only been in the class for 20 minutes and don't know a single word) I'm glad that it was an immersion style class. It definitely helped me learn the language faster, and I was forced to work on my speaking so that I could ask questions in class. The course was a good mix of listening and speaking (both passive and active learning).",
    "This class was all in german, no english. At times it was hard to understand but I think it really helped in the long run. You forget about english for a while and just learn to think in german. The class does not have many weaknesses as far as i'm concerned.",
    "strength: very small class allows everyone to contribut cons: too much theory, more reading would have helped"

   "comments": [
    "yes. absolutely!",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another Yale student. German is a very interesting language, and I think the intro courses are taught much better than those of other languages. The sequence is focused on getting students to a conversational level, so it's more about learning vocabulary and practicing speaking and understanding than it is about minute grammar and writing rules. This makes the class interactive and fun, as opposed to other languages that focus more on memorization of vocabulary and grammar.",
    "German is not an easy language, but if you have a genuine interest in it and a good professor, you will have a great time. The language is so fun to learn and as a class, you can make mistakes and laugh together. German is a rising business language and I can't imagine another place where I'd be able to learn the language outside of school.",
    "I would highly recommend this course and this language, specifically, to any of my peers. I really enjoyed learning the language, culture, and history of Germany.",
    "This class was great! Despite being 5 days a week, it didn't feel overwhelming, and there wasn't daily homework so it didn't take over my life. The class is taught in German so you learn a lot very quickly, and get used to hearing words and structures you don't know, without feeling uncomfortable. You learn how to listen for what you can understand, and how to try to communicate without being anywhere close to perfect. The class is really fun and laid back. Make sure you plan ahead for the final video project, as it can take a lot of time to do script editing, filming and to learn your lines. I hear all the professors are quite good -- I had max and he was GREAT.",
    "yeah",
    "Yes it was fun and interesting!",
    "yes, if they want to learn German",
    "If you want to learn German fast, YES!"
