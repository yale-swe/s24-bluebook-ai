   "comments": [
    "If you are interested in the material I would suggest taking this class. However, some of the material is very dense and there is a lot of it.",
    "One of the most unbelievable aspects of this course was that it wasn't full. This is a crucial area of study if one wants to really understand not only Spain, but colonial and modern-day Latin America as well (and the course is continually expanding its examination of Latin America). Professor Jord\u00c3\u00a1n is a wonderful instructor who is very invested in her students and will go the extra mile to help students with presentations or papers if they take the time to consult her. Readings are enjoyable and rewarding, ranging from Siglo de Oro theater to arbitrios from varied characters in Hapsburg Spanish history. Having serious knowledge of the Spanish language (i.e. being able to do readings in Spanish) really enriches the course and helps tremendously with research for the final paper. If you're interested in the history of Spain or much of the Western Hemisphere or if you're simply looking for a great experience with a substantial but far from insurmountable amount of work, take this class.",
    "Take it! Great history class that is both challenging, you will learn a lot, but under a very nurturing and helpful environment. Also, take it if Prof. Maria is offering it.",
    "I would recommend this course to any History major who is looking to have a deep knowledge of Spanish history. The course is a great class with a solid work load, but great readings and topics.",
    "Yes, take this class with Professor Jordan. It was spectacular."
