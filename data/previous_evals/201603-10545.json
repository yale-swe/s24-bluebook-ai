   "comments": [
    "I learned very much about the evolution of both political thought and the manner in which these ideas were expressed. These were very helpful when exploring areas of personal interest through essays.",
    "I learned about and read the works of a large variety of authors; the pace of the course means it's impossible to delve deeply into any one author, but I gained a valuable overview of some major historical and political thinkers. I also vastly improved my ability to write, with engaging and constructive feedback from Professor Semmel.",
    "I learned about a variety of different authors writing about different historical time periods, the political landscape of ancient civilizations, and the development of major ideas on law, religion, politics, and society.",
    "How to make connections between historical texts and political philosophers by having in depth discussions",
    "My reading and writing skills definitely improved immensely in this class. It was very rewarding to see improvement on every essay I write. The texts we read in H&P are challenging and select works are even fun to read. I learned a lot about the philosophy of many great thinkers and taking DS H&P gave me the opportunity to study works that I never would have time to read on my own.",
    "I learned a few snippets of classical and medieval Western history and gained a much broader understanding of historiography and human politics."

   "question_id": "YC403",
   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The course is structured so that works logically build off of one another, which was a great way to encourage constant participation. They were also arranged so as to benefit discussions in other Directed Studies classes, with relevant works from similar time periods being examined within the same weeks. Unlike in some of the other courses, however, readings were also reasonably abridged; selections were long enough, and sufficiently linked, to allow insight into the author's work and time, but not so long as to be overwhelming. My only suggestion for improvement is that more lectures provide general history of the author and his time.",
    "The program moves very, very quickly, but that's the nature of what DS is. Also, I felt like there wasn't enough guidance for my writing. I came into the program with very little knowledge of how to write well, and had to learn through grades as they came in and the professorial comments (which can't possible address everything that needs to be covered).",
    "Strengths - I liked the addition of various Arabic authors, who demonstrated how ideas across time and space complemented each other. I appreciated reading the wide variety of works and being able to analyze them from a political standpoint and seeing how the problems our governments face today have been analyzed and encountered across centuries. I liked learning how to write better due to the ample amount of essay feedback. Weaknesses - some of the reading selections seemed more cursory than as a good springboard for discussion. In addition, there could have been more emphasis on the development of ideas than about the occurrence of certain events, which at times did make H&P feel more like a history class.",
    "Strengths of the course are the scope of the readings and fruitful class discussions.",
    "The course is very student discussion-based and I really like that about the section. The professor never dominates a particular discussion and really pushes the students to express their thoughts in class. However I do think there are some weeks where the reading material is extremely heavy but we do not get enough time in class to go over everything that I thought would be relevant to talk about.",
    "STRENGTHS: 1. Fascinating curriculum. 2. Great discussion sections. 3. Interesting lectures. WEAKNESSES: 1. We didn't have nearly enough time to cover Polybius, Livy, and Tacitus. Unfortunately, they tend to blur together in my mind as a result.",
    "I really liked the written feedback on papers, but sometimes I thought the class discussions could be rough. I think often they were helpful but very slow going in the beginning. Sometimes, the discussions took a very long time to get going.",
    "I really enjoyed the H&P portion of DS. It provided a nice backdrop for the things we learned in Philosophy and Lit, and it is also a little more straightforward."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "Absolutely. This course is applicable for people of all interests due to the all-encompassing nature of the works. Despite negligible aptitude for history, for example, I found the readings applicable to modern situations.",
    "Honestly, evaluating DS as a whole is a difficult task to do,e specially form the outside. But if you think you have any interest, I would definitely recommend at least shopping the program. It's fascinating and comprehensive--an overview that's hard to easily replicate and provides solid structural foundation for any course of study. The individual relationship you can develop with professors and the direct exposure to their knowledge is incredible. That said, if you know you won't love it or shop it for a few days and find yourself zoning out in section, it's probably not worth it. It's a huge commitment, both in terms of time out of your week (massive amounts of readings that are basically impossible to do all of) and taking up 3 courses.",
    "Great class. Professor Semmel did a good job of facilitating discussion but not playing too large of a role so that students could speak and work through issues faced in the texts. His comments on papers are to the point and very good at giving specific things that can be done to improve writing - the most helpful of any of my 3 DS courses.",
    "Definitely take DS if it seems like something you'll enjoy. First semester HP is a great way to understand broad historical trends. Don't come into this class with unreal expectations thinking you will thoroughly cover every idea of every book or thinking you can get away not doing the reading.",
    "If you are taking DS, Prof. Semmel is a good section leader for H&P *if* you have a lively, interactive section. Overall, I found H&P to be a decent course - one that was applicable to the real world but also had more potential in terms of examining work interactions, connections, and giving texts more depth rather than breadth. If you are considering whether or not to do Directed Studies as a whole, that's a different story. If you are a fan of the classics and humanities, then this program is definitely for you. If not...it's a little more difficult to say. As a first-gen student, I found this a difficult program to get a grasp of in comparison with classmates from boarding schools who had a) learned the material already, b) also knew a range of classics languages, and c) learned in this format throughout high school. The classes often feel divorced from reality and have a definite \"ivory tower\" feeling, especially if your section is filled with other students who have little real-life worries. There is little guide about what an exemplary DS essay should address\/look like, and the balance of the program prefers breadth (reading lots of works) over depth (going into some works more deeply). There is a culture around celebrating DS as a prestigious program, and pressure to do it if accepted because there's simply \"nothing like it.\" That is not exactly true, and I would encourage a freshman with interests in other places to explore them. There's also this pull towards DS because you have 3\/4 of your freshman credits pre-determined for you and don't have to enter the hectic blue-booking fray. You only have 36 credits at Yale! Spending 6 of them on DS is a huge investment. Decide wisely.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this class to another student because I think the works that we read are extremely relevant in helping students develop higher thinking. I also think students would greatly benefit from smaller class sections and intimate class discussions like the ones found in H&P and other DS classes.",
    "Yes. It's a lot of reading, and you are expected to at least do most of it, but it's interesting, and the discussion sections are great.",
    "Yes.",
    "I would recommend the entire DS curriculum, though I realize it's not for everyone. I feel completely without direction, and DS was a really nice way to ave some grounded learning, particularly at the beginning of college. I also hate the hype (both negative and positive) around DS. Its just three classes, and though its rigorous, treating it as extremely different from other Yale courses is, I think, a mistake."
