    "Religious Studies 703 01 is a topically and thematically broad exploration of contemporary discourses on modern Islam and its so-called 'crisis'. Each week, students read an entire book cover-to-cover and discuss it. Grewal contextualizes the week's reading in relation to other readings masterfully. Her summaries and take-aways from each week are profound. I would recommend this course to anyone interested in modern Islam specifically, or political science\/american studies\/islamic studies more generally. In fact, if it were up to me I would make this course mandatory for every student at Yale!",
    "This course is an exploration of contemporary Islam from the voices of Muslims themselves. Professor Grewal was careful to craft a balanced syllabus that included Middle Eastern voices. I would absolutely recommend it!",
    "We read a book a week, then a person was assigned a week to respond to each text. At the end of the class, we were required to write a 15-20 page final paper on the topic of our choice. I appreciated the freedom in what we were able to write about, as I was able to write about a topic which I found incredibly stimulating and look forward to further investigating, allowing me to continue to do work in Africana Studies while in American Studies. I think that there could have been more time allotted to conversations amongst the seminar participants."

   "comments": [
    "This course complements my own academic\/textual training in Islamic Studies. It has changed the way I would teach courses on Islam for good. There is no significant overlap between this course and my dissertation or research.",
    "I came away with a new set of methodological tools for approaching topics in the Muslim World.I felt more comfortable in discourses outside the main ones I work in.",
    "American Studies 719 highlights a critical aspect of American Studies which has been underemphasized...the role of religion. When I say the role of religion, I do not mean it as simply an object of analysis, rather as a analytical concept, or as Charles Long and Paul Ricoeur have called it, a \"hermeneutic of suspicion\". I believe that this class would be beneficial in helping further the field of the discipline. One important part was understanding the role of religion and the secular as not simply a negation of religion, but as the ability to control and dictate what religion is able to do."
