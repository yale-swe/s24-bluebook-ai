    "Cant think of any! :)",
    "The class structure with a mix of lectures and guest speakers was a huge strength. Dr. Chertow is a strength all by herself. The workload was manageable and well planned out.",
    "Strengths: The sheer range of topics covered were very helpful in understanding the subject and knowing the important concepts. I really liked Prof. Corts lecture as well. Weaknesses: The other guest lectures were not always as effective.",
    "strength- content, readings, instructors, TAs, final project, assignments, guest lectures",
    "Strengths - very case study based which helped apply the concepts to actual corporate functioning",
    "The course explains key concepts well but it could of done a better job of driving them home for us. Perhaps there could of been more assessments or just interactive exercises to push the main teachings of the class more.",
    "I occasionally felt that certain positive CSR initiatives for companies like Exxon, British Petroleum, or Nestle were presented without greater context for the harm that these companies have done. For example, even though BP attempted a \"Beyond Petroleum\" rebrand, we should recognize the amount of harm they are actively doing in the climate change context, or Exxon's massive disinformation campaign in the 90's and 80's that they used to undermine potential climate change action in a time where political consensus could have actually been bipartisan. Though many MEM students are likely already aware of these issues, I wonder if some of the MBA students could get a false impression that these CSR initiatives are un-qualified acts of goodness.",
    "strengths: a breadth of topics covered which offer exposure to the different dimensions of corporate sustainability, term project is a great way to study the real world sustainability strategies employed by big companies. weakness: topics are not explored enough in depth, as covering various topics in-depth is not feasible perhaps a select few can be explored further based on student's consensus."

    "Great! If a bit green-wash-y at times.",
    "Don't hesitate, take it. It is well worth it because of how much you'll learn, how involved you will get, and how much fun you'll have!",
    "This is a great class to understand the fundamentals of corporate environmental management and strategy. The readings are really important, and the group project is very important in getting the most out of this course.",
    "good course to take if you plan to move into corporate roles post F&ES. Focus on term project. its a good way to learn new stuff",
    "A good introduction to the different approaches to corporate sustainability, and helpful in identifying where your career\/opinions could be placed",
    "If you plan to have an impact in the corporate world then take this course and read the readings and form your own takeaways dont expect an exam to push that out for you.",
    "The gains you get from the course are directly proportional to your input- though you can do very well without doing all the readings they are pretty vital to getting the most you can out of the lectures.",
    "definitely take it as it offers a great introduction which is helpful especially in the first semester."
