    "This was a great survey of the history of Baroque and Galant music of the 17th and 18th centuries.",
    "This class was absolutely incredible. I loved the way the history of music was framed through the context of form. It allowed for us to escape the \"great composer\" strict narrative and have a cohesive string tying the history of Western classical music together.",
    "I learned everything I've ever wanted to know about classical music, and memorized a few important melodies, too.",
    "I really gained a greater appreciation of music in this era. To know the stories and historical situations behind famous pieces really increases my depth of understanding as I listen to them.",
    "I had not taken a history course since high school, and really enjoyed rekindling that scholarly approach, and even the study strategies, in an area that was familiar to me as a performer but not a historian. I feel like I got (one part of) exactly what I was looking for by deciding to be a music major; learning more about the music that I grew up playing and hearing. I wish that I had taken advantage more of the TAs and their offers to read drafts of papers, etc.",
    "Good background on the \"classical\" era. Interesting stuff from a professor who is very knowledgeable. Unfortunate that it seems so tailored to students who have been immersed in classical music since childhood. Hard to keep up if this stuff is all new to you.",
    "The course is 17th-18th centuries but focus's on 18th, especially Bach Mozart and Haydn and sonata form.",
    "A remarkable overview of the development or \"liberation\" of instrumental music, with a look at the development of opera as well (secondary). A really great balance of the social climates that led to the production of the music with the aesthetic considerations\/compositional procedures as they evolved throughout the periods we discussed.",
    "I got an amazing overview of the baroque and classical period (a lot of Bach, Haydn, and Mozart).",
    "I gained a better understanding of the emergence of musical form through to the 18th century. I got better at active listening and being able to identify larger musical structures with more fluency. I learned many, many facts about European, literate music in the 17th and mostly 18th centuries.",
    "The course placed significant emphasis on the development of different musical forms, so this was fairly insightful. I definitely gained a sense of significant developments of Western music from taking this class, even if omissions were made regarding the scope of the course material.",
    "I think the main idea I take away from the course relates to the evolution of form (and of sonata form in particular). It's useful to me to be able to think about how instrumental music got the structure that is familiar to us today. I also gained exposure to various composers I had not heard before - and found a particular interest in Monteverdi from the assigned listening."

   "comments": [
    "I often didn't have a clear idea of what would and would not be required information for the listening exams. For example, I spent a lot of time memorizing the first names of composers for the first listening exam, and, on the day of the test, it was revealed that we only had to provide last names. This has happened several times, always on the day of the exams -- for example, I spent a lot of time learning how to differentiate the D. Scarlatti keyboard sonatas from one another, and it turned out that we didn't have to be able to differentiate them on the actual quiz. It would be nice to have had a clearer idea of exactly what we'd have to know for the quizzes.",
    "N\/A",
    "An excellent course that should not be mandatory for the major. I believe this course as an elective would increase student engagement! Please consider other models of a music history requirement that do not limit students to the Western canon.",
    "It probably shouldn't be mandatory for music majors! That might make it a more enjoyable experience all around.",
    "I love everything about how this course is taught. It has not only changed how I view the history of this period, but it has changed the way I perform the music of this period as well. The lectures are engaging, and the sections function as a great way to clarify points that may have been more confusing during the lecture. I wouldn't change a thing about this course.",
    "For what this course is meant to be, it is great.",
    "Overall, the class is really well structured. A thought that I had throughout the semester is that, since I took the Thursday section and sometimes we had the listening quiz and the written exam on the same day, it may not have been fair, since people who took it friday had another day to study for the written exam after the listening quiz. Also, I always thought that grading was a bit harsh with the quizzes and exams, and I know it deterred a lot of people to drop. Some people in the class also already knew half (or more) of the material in the class, so there is quite a big disparity I feel.",
    "The lectures were excellent and memorable. Sections were thoughtful, fun, and engaging. Of course, it's difficult to encompass all of western classical music in one semester, but I think it would have been nice to explore a wider range of music: varying kinds of instrumental works, music from places other than Germany. The lack of range is understandable though, since the focus of the course is sonata form.",
    "Having three midterm exams rather than a final was hugely helpful both in terms of workload, and processing the material in a constructive way. The terms and concept sheets are incredibly helpful. I would have liked to have a listing ahead of time of readings, rather than getting the assignments each class. The term paper was introduced too close to the deadline; it would have been helpful to have a discussion of it before spring break. Grading of exams and listening quizzes was fair, and the feedback the TAs gave after each exam was very helpful. One problem with the music history sequence is that people come in to it with very different musical backgrounds. Not everyone has taken 211 before this class, while some people are well-versed in sonata form, many are not. That was a very difficult part of the class to navigate, because that knowledge was assumed. There should be more of an introduction to sonata theory, or more deliberate supplementary material discussed in section or extra sessions.",
    "This course is very informative and builds a good background on the time period. However, this course is really tailored to students who come from a classical music background and have been immersed in this musical tradition since childhood. For those of us who don't have this background, it is exceedingly difficult to keep up, and many incorrect assumptions are made about overarching paradigms with regard to the music that non-classical students may not necessarily take for granted in the way that the professor, the TAs, and the other students do.",
    "As music history surveys go, this is a good one - Hepo is an excellent lecturer, sections run well, the material is organized well. I'd like it if there were more social\/political history tied into the music. My main problem is fact that it is required - that Vivaldi and Bach are mandatory component of our music department but so many other genres and continents of music are completely missing. It is crazy, also, that the entire role of Women in our music history sequence is boiled down into one section on \"the role of women.\" But honestly the class is sort of doomed for failure in the sense that it drawing on such traditional material and educational models that it naturally feels dated.",
    "This class's overwhelming strength is Hepo's lectures. They were truly phenomenal. His preparation and delivery made every lecture a joy to attend. The biggest drawbacks might be the final essay, which was a comparison of two textbook's staging of a historical period. For a ten page essay, it's too bad that we couldn't choose a relevant topic of our choice.",
    "This course is phenomenal. Professor Hepokoski is a fantastic lecturerer, who has crafted a course that takes he students through his interpretation of music in the 17th and 18th centuries in Europe, leading to the crystallization of larger instrumental forms with Haydn and Mozart. While his may not be the whole truth (there is much less focus on the 17th century) and only pieces that fit the narrative are chosen, he daws a remarkably clear and accessible line from Monteverdi to Mozart.",
    "The lecturing was definitely a highlight of the course. Professor Hepokoski's lectures were generally speaking very engaging, and the same can be said of his overall style of lecturing. The course's most significant weaknesses were probably in the fact that missing lecture made making up the material very difficult. The \"general overview\" presentations which were posted on Classes did not really contain enough detailed information to be comparable to the lectures where many details which turned out to be important were delivered verbally.",
    "I think the design of the course having one paper and six tests is a weak structure for learning; in particular, I would have liked to have had more coursework that involved more individual analysis. In particular, I think a short writing assignment looking at pieces not analyzed by Taruskin or in class would have had substantial value, since I think the practical aspect of the course is being able to interact with music and see it in historical context, which is hard to learn from just memorizing what a lot of works sounds like and when they were written. A writing assignment on a particular historical event would also have had value. In general, I found it a little frustrating that we were only asked to make analyses on primary sources on the factual exams (which is somewhat limited in terms of depth, since it's rather hard to defend a nuanced thesis regarding someone's music without having their music at hand). Also, within the structure of the tests, given that tests did expect a fine granularity of knowledge, it would have been helpful if the study guides we were provided were posted on a more regular basis - it was a little troublesome if two were posted together long after the lectures had occurred, but soon before a test. That said, I think the lectures were generally good. The professor was clearly passionate about the subject and interacted with it in interesting ways. It was generally fairly clear to me how the concepts throughout the course related to each other, especially with regards to musical form."

    "This was a great survey of Baroque and Galant music. Professor Hepokoski's lectures are engaging and informative, and you will learn a great dear about music history, in addition to exploring the way such history is recorded. I had to spend a significant amount of time memorizing for tests (and at times the amount of material on the study guides seemed overwhelming). Take this course, even if you aren't a music major, and get excited for Sonata Form!",
    "I personally am not a fan of Baroque or Classical music, so I would not recommend it to anyone, but regardless of content, the class is well taught.",
    "Yes",
    "Hepo is the greatest professor I've ever had. I credit\/D'd the class, but it was still one of the most fascinating experiences of my life. Cannot reccomend it highly enough!",
    "This course is incredible. I can't recommend it highly enough. Every lecture is engaging to the point I'm legitimately sad when they're over. If you're at all interested in classical music, no matter what period is your area of focus (I know this wasn't mine) absolutely take this class.",
    "Even if you just attend the lectures, your knowledge and appreciation of music from this era (Bach, Mozart, etc.) will skyrocket.",
    "If you're not a music major, definitely take it credit\/D if you can. I loved this class and studying for it was quite fun. However, the stress of grades is real. I really gained a greater appreciation of music in this era. To know the stories and historical situations behind famous pieces really increases my depth of understanding as I listen to them. Overall, the class is really well structured. A thought that I had throughout the semester is that, since I took the Thursday section and sometimes we had the listening quiz and the written exam on the same day, it may not have been fair, since people who took it friday had another day to study for the written exam after the listening quiz.

Some people in the class also already knew half (or more) of the material in the class, so there is quite a big disparity I feel.",
    "My advice to other students would be if you don't have to take this class, then don't. I hated every second of this class and doubt I will ever use anything I learned in it again. I've never felt more sure that a class was a complete waste of my time, not to mention the ridiculous amount of effort needed to do well.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this to another student, but probably as a Credit\/D for non-music majors; or, it should be cross-listed as a History class.",
    "This course will be very interesting to take. If you come from a classical music background, it will make sense and be quite intuitive and even fun. If you do not come from a classical music background, it will be disorienting, difficult to keep up with, and you will have a difficult time. Regardless, it is required for the major, and does teach interesting\/useful background knowledge.",
    "Not really - if I were to recommend any of the required music history courses it would be 352. The music in it is great but teaching a purely western cannon class is simply dated",
    "Highly. If you are interested in the music of the past 200 years, this is a great way of getting into what brought us there. I also just personally really enjoy reading Taruskin so there's that.",
    "Absolutely. I mean, if Hepo's teaching, then it's a must. (I say this as a non-music major; if you're a music major than it's a literal must to complete the requirements).",
    "This course is required for the music major, but even so was a very interesting survey of one portion of the history of Western music with regards in particular to the development of the sonata and other musical forms. Hepokoski's lectures were really interesting and engaging (in general), and were (again, generally) much more enjoyable than other lecture classes. This class is not one where you can skip lecture all the time and easily make up all of the information for the written exams; while the textbook readings cover a large amount of material (and are pretty lengthy--difficult to successfully procrastinate), a lot of the material comes from the lectures and presentations, which cover lots of material in each class."
