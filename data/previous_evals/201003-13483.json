    "Wonderful and engaging course! I really enjoyed it, especially with the discussion format. It was really interesting to have other students lead specific sections and I thought that worked well. Learned so much and had fun doing so!",
    "This was an interesting course as I did not know much about the subject matter. It opened my eyes to an area of public health that I was unfamiliar and definitely has me taking different ideas and belief models into consideration.",
    "There was a lot of freedom in leading the interest of the class. The professor allowed us to lead discussions and she was always willing to help with readings.",
    "Great course. Yale needs to offer more courses within this subject area. We were very fortunate to learn from Aunchalee. Overall, this was a great, really interesting course."

    "Instructor: Aunchalee Palmquist \u00a0Wonderful instructor, especially for the discussion-based class. Needs a little more confidence when leading the lecture, but was incredibly informative and interesting! So helpful and responsive to questions outside of class too!",
    "Instructor: Aunchalee Palmquist \u00a0Aunchalee was amazing professor; kind, thoughtful, and insightful. She is one of the few professors I believe actually cares that we succeed.",
    "Instructor: Aunchalee Palmquist \u00a0Although she is a first time professor, she was a great, enthusiastic, and knowledgeable teacher who was always willing to take feedback and incorporate that in the class.",
    "Instructor: Aunchalee Palmquist \u00a0Excellent instructor who took the time to tailor the material for our individual interests.",
    "Instructor: Aunchalee Palmquist \u00a0Aunchalee is incredibly sensitive to the needs of students, making her a great instructor. She was able to lead a discussion based course and still maintain a sense of structure, which is a hard feat. Tangential conversations probably couldve been better controlled, but they also contributed to the warm, inviting atmosphere of her class. The number of readings per week and written summaries per semester was a little heavy and at certain times of the school year nearly unmanageable."

    "Absolutely excellent course ... it was wonderful to actually enjoy a class to this extent again! I thought that enjoyment had ended when I entered grad school. Looking forward to taking Anthropology of Food in the spring!",
    "There were times when I did not like that students lead the course discussions because we tended to get off topic a bit. While the professor did bring us back I think there could have been times where we would have learned more if the class was not as self-taught.",
    "It's a great introduction to how medical anthropology can play a crucial role in global health!",
    "An introductory course to medical anthropology taught with a graduate work load. I would absolutely recommend it to other students-- especially to those working in health professions.Aunchalee is,and will continue to be where ever she ends up next, a fantastic teacher."
