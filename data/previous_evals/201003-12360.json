   "comments": [
    "205 is a good introduction to theory concepts, and is a good class to take. I would recommend it.",
    "This class tackles a lot of material that will help you really understand music. In addition, Andre Redwood is a chill and wonderful teacher who has a great sense of humor and is completely willing to help students outside of class.",
    "Music 205 is a great course to take if, like me, you cringed when someone mentioned \"The Circle of Fifths\" or \"diminished seventh cords\" (what ARE those, anyway?). Now, however, I feel very confident in my theory skills... it is nice to be competent in more than just playing my instrument when it comes to music! Also, if you are planning on taking 205, try to get Andre as your TA. He is nice, humorous, and always available to help you if you are having difficulties in the course.",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend it whether you want to take MUSI 210 later on or not.",
    "205 is the best thing since sliced bread. Andre Redwood is the greatest thing since 205. If you like music, take it. Take it, take it, take it.",
    "This class is a really great introduction to music theory. If you get the chance, definitely take it with Andre. Not only is he a really funny, laid-back teacher, but he's also really knowledgeable and genuinely cares about his students. One thing people complained about in the course was the dictations that would show up on the tests but that we didn't practice too much in class. I highly recommend taking the course concurrently with MUSI 218 because you will master dictations and even learn some other important stuff that will help you out in 205. Also, don't let the fact that there is homework due every class throw you off. Andre is a really generous grader and the homework is usually pretty short. Besides, he always goes over it in class before you hand it in, so you have time to change anything you may have gotten really wrong. Plus, it's super helpful. Take this course. Take it with Andre.",
    "I would absolutely recommend Music 205 to another student, especially someone interested in learning the foundations of music composition, chordal analysis, and musical form. It definitely helps to either be a singer or play an instrument if you are interested in taking the class. The course material moves at a very reasonable pace, beginning with basic foundations and triads, moving into counterpoint, and then extending into chordal analysis, cadences, four-part harmonization of bass and soprano lines, periods, sentences, and binary form. The daily homework assignments comprise the bulk of the course grade and are very manageable although sometimes they take a lot of time, especially during part-writing because of the myriad errors to avoid. Make sure you check your work! After making repeated errors, you will lose significant points on an assignment. Most of the homework can be completed based on your notes from class, but the Laitz textbook acts as a great (though often unnecessary) resource if you're ever confused, although sometimes Laitz approaches concepts in a different way than we learn in class. My enjoyment of this class was tied to the interesting and useful material, but also the classroom dynamic. Make sure you shop different sections and find a good professor or TA and a class of students you want to take the class with. Andre Redwood was absolutely fantastic--easy to understand, flexible, clearly passionate about the subject. Take it with him!",
    "This is such a fun class! The pace is pretty fast, especially if you don't have much music theory background, but the work is manageable (and-I found it was always 1 or two hours on Tuesdays and Thursdays). The material covered is interesting, but to some extent seems pointless on it's own, as if demanding you to take more music theory classes. In a way that makes you want to do it.predictible",
    "Definitely take it if you are interested in music theory.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to musicians interested in using their music skills. A very practical class for writing\/performing music.",
    "This class is a great introduction to music theory, covering a lot of advanced content in a short time yet still being manageable and fun. I would recommend this class to another student because I found it interesting and fulfilling.",
    "Music205 is an intermediate theory course that gives you a good foundation in writing and understanding harmonies. With a minimal music background, I had first tried to take it without 110, but found it too intimidating, but after taking 110, the class was perfect. It was really a pleasure learning, and so exciting to start to see your ability to write musical phrases grow.",
    "If you're going to take 205, you have to take it with Andre. Music theory can get pretty dry at times, but Andre makes it fun. He is very chill and creates a really relaxed classroom environment, which really helped me learn and actually get into music theory, and he's super helpful if you have any problems or get stuck on something. The homeworks count for a lot of the grade, so it's worth putting time into them, so it's not a 5th class. But seriously, take this class with Andre, he's the best.",
    "The homeworks become repetitive, but don't get discouraged: the repetition is necessary to achieve enough facillity with chord analysis that you might realistically continue to analyze chords outside of class. Also, 205 was a great (though possibly stressful) opportunity for a motivated novice to develop some rudimentary ear training skills. Indeed, my newfound (though meager) listening skills are already paying dividends on my trumpet-playing. My instructor, Ande Redwood, was particularly committed to his students, and I certainly benefited from his one-on-one attention after hours.",
    "This class is great. The work is tedious but the payoff at the end of the semester is worth it. You'll be able to understand music on a whole different level."
