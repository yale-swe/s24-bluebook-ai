    "A range of insights about international development, as well as econometric skills necessary to do social science research.",
    "I learned about problems with international development that would allow me to be able to talk about them colloquially.",
    "GLBL 225 is primarily a development econometrics course. You receive rigorous, trial-by-fire training in statistical and econometric methods (instrument variables, RCTs, diff-in-diff, etc.) including long-form proofs and hands on applications. Additionally, the course does a very brief introduction to a number of development topics, including education, credit, savings, insurance, technology, and foreign aid, among others.",
    "This is one of the worst classes I have taken at Yale.",
    "I learned how to read and analyze current development economics research and to question many predominant theories on development.",
    "I gained some knowledge of different areas of international development interventions and of some statistical methods of evaluating these interventions. I did not gain as much knowledge as I would have liked about international development however, and much of the course felt disjointed in its approach to the material.",
    "Regression tables are integral to this course. I'm glad for the practice to to interpret them.",
    "I developed a good understand of empirical methods of social science research, and am familiar with literature and topics in international development.",
    "I gained a good understanding of some methods of statistical analysis.",
    "I learned techniques for evaluating development economics literature. I also learned how to apply these techniques to my own research projects. In addition, I gained a general familiarity with some of the major areas of research within international development.",
    "I honestly learned very little. I still can't really read a regression table like the ones Professor Keniston showed us.",
    "Mostly econometrics regarding development and general development topics.",
    "As one of the TAs said, this is not a development class but a development econometrics class. It is rather technical, but Professor Keniston includes a lot of papers so that we get to see how the tools that we learn can be applied and so that there is actually something related to development in this course. Overall, I am happy for the skills that I learned, but the path to learning these skills was a bit tedious.",
    "The insight I gained is that international development is incredible dense and not that rewarding.",
    "I honestly feel like I did not learn too much during this class. Empirically, I think that I learned enough to complete the problem sets and do the exams but did not have a thorough understanding of the methodologies. This was hard for me, especially after I really loved AQA and now feel a little more confused. Subject-wise I feel like I learned a lot of facts about specific studies,",
    "Covered some quantitative and empirical strategies, as well as general overview of key development economics concepts",
    "How to quickly read and critique microeconomic papers, particularly their output tables and regressions; a basic understanding of imperfect models used in development economics.",
    "The material in the class is incredibly interesting, but also incredibly economics heavy. It is essentially an economics course, and thus the material is difficult for many GLBL students who have only ever had to complete the introductory economics sequence. However, coming out of the class, I feel as though I have a better understanding of world of developmental economics, which is ultimately the goal of the class.",
    "impact evaluations\/development econometrics, more stata commands",
    "I learned about multivariate regression and soem other econometric methods.",
    "I learned some interesting studies in development economics and some theories about some stuff with development.",

   "comments": [
    "Turn this into a seminar - revamp the syllabus. Make sure everyone reads the papers and are ready to discuss their merits and drawbacks.",
    "This is the worst course I have taken at Yale, and I'm extremely disappointed that after years of terrible reviews, it still hasn't been overhauled like Approaches to Security was. Professor Keniston seems like a good guy who honestly wants his students to have a good experience - I really hope he takes our feedback to heart so that future years don't have the same class I had. I see the most urgent improvements as follows: 1: Fully integrate Stata code lessons into lectures. At the moment, when new statistical concepts are taught in lecture, they are in purely theoretical form - either a conceptual explanation of how something works (for example, the general cutoff concept of a difference-in-difference analysis) or are in theoretical equation terms. Explanation of how to actually do things in Stata is left to sections, which sometimes help and sometimes don't, leaving some things slipping through the cracks. (I blame this not on the TAs but on the course's organization). As a result, Professor Keniston's irritated statement in class that everything we had to do in problem sets was covered in lecture or section, and didn't have to be googled, was all too frequently false. 2: Sections should share Stata notes. This is a no-brainer. The concern that students won't come to section unless something they know they can't miss is being taught is probably valid, but is a ridiculous ordering of priorities. Students should have the notes on the commands they need to do the problem sets even if they don't show up to section and desperately type down everything that goes by on the screen rather than listen to the TA, or have a friend who does so. 3: If the TAs can't tell what problem set questions are asking, something's wrong. 4: Reading quizzes are a waste of everyone's time. They can easily be answered by using control-f to search through a document for words in the question or the answers.",
    "Important content, but disjointed and disorganized.",
    "Problem sets weren't really related to class material or the exams, we just had to recreate a bunch of datasets. Lectures were unengaging and attempted to cover extremely broad topics in both econometrics and development in a very constrained period of time. Also, a lot of super sweeping generalizations got made about parts of the developing world\/poor people that were kind of problematic.",
    "While global affairs as a profession may be becoming more quantitative, this class is too hard. That is something I do not say often (if at all), but this class is not good. I somehow got through the class without being taught how to write a regression once, how to properly interpret different types of regressions, and how to properly do stata (and the logic behind it). In my opinion, the class either needs to be heavily revamped to be less quantitative and more like the security seminar or it needs to be taught by someone like Justin Thomas who can actually teach how to do math, the logic behind it, and why it is important. Additionally, it needs highly-qualified TA's who can VERY SIMPLY break down material.",
    "There is far too much material here to be covered in one semester. It is vital to teach rigorous statistical methods so that students can evaluate papers and analyze their own data. It is also crucial to apply these skills to real world topics in development. One semester does not offer enough time to substantially delve into both areas. I think the course would be much stronger if it were broken into a two-semester sequence (development econometrics first, topics in international development second).",
    "There is very little connection between the material in section, in lecture, and on the p-sets. Going to lecture and section alone will not prepare you for the problem sets. They are disastrously difficult and will cause many hours of pain. If you cannot already use Stata proficiently this class will likely be a nightmare. The class would be greatly improved if the skills required for the problem sets were actually taught in class. The exams are somewhat fair, although the language used in a few of the questions is imprecise, causing unnecessary difficulties. Very little helpful feedback is given at any point in the semester. Professor Keniston and the TA's mean well, they just need to restructure much of the course.",
    "This is a poorly organized and poorly taught course. While the material itself is very interesting, it is communicated in a confusing and overwhelming manner. I was disappointed by every lecture and found myself having to re-teach myself the material for the midterm and final. The worst part of the course, however, is the TFs. They do not understand the course material and are unable to answer questions. The grading is entirely arbitrary. This was the worst class I have taken at Yale.",
    "This course suffers a lot from a disjointed presentation of the material and from poorly constructed problem sets. The problem sets were quite lengthy and complex, often calling on us to do things we had not learned in class, and quite often questions were worded in such a way as to make it very unclear what was being asked (the same was an issue on the exams). The lectures jumped around, making it a bit hard to follow the overall trajectory. When it came time for exams, I prepared by carefully studying the previous year's exams, because those were the only sources of valuable information on what kinds of questions would be asked and how to answer those questions. The questions on the problem sets were not helpful for answering exam questions. Overall, more guidance on the types of questions we would be expected to answer on exams and more practice on those types of questions over the course of the semester would have been extremely helpful.",
    "This class is great at teaching you how to consume research, and develop skills in development econometrics. Sometimes Keniston would write on the chalkboard, and he would lose us. Perhaps find a more engaging way to teach us the empirical techniques.",
    "The course wasn't as bad as I'd expected or told it was going to be. Prof Keniston taught the statistics parts (instrumental variables, diff-in-diff) fairly well, except when he did long equations for a whole class very fast without explaining. The content was interesting sometimes, but it was basically just a superficial overview of development topics that most of us have studied in more detail in seminars\/other classes. However, he used some topics well to illustrate the statistical concepts. The biggest weakness was definitely the problem sets - instead of reinforcing the stats\/content that we'd learnt in class, we spent hours getting exactly the right Stata syntax, which taught us nothing and was simply time consuming. Either the problem sets should go over actual concepts, or Prof Keniston should outline the Stata commands at the end of each lecture so we don't spend hours learning nothing while trying to figure them out.",
    "This course's strength is in its quantitative nature. A course on international development could take many forms, but I appreciated that we focused on rigorous, statistical evaluations of development projects. I liked the framework of the class: the progression of development topics was interesting and engaging, though I did prefer the latter half's subject matter. Professor Keniston's lecture style was occasionally confusing because he would often correct himself. However, I found his assignments and exams to be instructive and fair. The TAs were excellent, but sections were most helpful when they focused on Stata skills for the psets. As a general comment, I sometimes found it frustrating that what we were learning could only be applied in limited contexts. The development literature made frequent, large assumptions that were almost always violated in practice, and results typically could not be generalized. The outcomes of the class were almost always inconclusive in this regard.",
    "This class feels extremely all over the place.",
    "Although Professor Keniston is very nice and makes some nice jokes, the class was poorly taught. I felt behind on everything -- from how the stata we were supposed to use works to the econ intuition we were supposed to be building. The problem sets and tests were sometimes very confusingly worded and I would often come away from class or working on a problem set and be more confused than I was before.",
    "This course is horrible. Jackson seriously needs to intervene to improve it. The psets are an awful amount of busy work and honestly some of the content just isn't that digestible for Security track students.",
    "I feel like there were a lot of math and not enough topic attention",
    "This class struggles to strike a balance between the econometrics part and the development part of the class. We are supposed to learn both, but I often felt that the econometrics part was more important than the readings. Also, the exams don't really test us on the development aspect (only with one or two questions), so it becomes a nuisance to have to spend time learning it when the important takeaway from this class is, in reality, the econometrical tools. I would also advise students to team up when doing the psets. My least favorite part of this class, however, was the students. Many were not motivated, and that had a negative effect on my motivation as well.",
    "Terribly taught, and no strengths.",
    "I think that this class would benefit from thinking more big picture and then zooming in specifically. The classes seemed somewhat disconnected, flirted with complex models and also super specific studies but I am not sure what I learned. I wish we had dealt more with big picture development questions or used different formats (watched interviews and documentaries, worked on designed studies, etc)",
    "A lot of people will say this is an awful course, but I disagree. I wish Keniston had a little bit more charisma, but the lecture content is good. The class is absurdly interesting. Where everything falls apart is the psets. They're poorly written and not related enough to the lecture content\/exam content. They focus on Stata code which is not taught or very briefly taught in optional section. Change the psets, and the course would be miles better. They could be easier, less stata focused, and more like the exam questions.",
    "Very well organized lectures. PSets were related to material taught in class. Sections and TFs were very unhelpful and did not always seem to know the material very well. PSets were graded and returned very slowly, and its was usually very unclear why points had been taken off.",
    "The strengths are that it covers both methodology\/econometrics and topics in international development. Its weakness is organization.",
    "Horrendous class. The group-of-4 leviathan problem set construct lets every student free-ride while learning a quarter of the coursework, particularly as classes are unnecessarily dry and seek no application, sections hastily pump code into students' notebooks so they can attempt the problem sets, and examinations loosely draw theoretically on classroom content. The sheer scale of the problem sets requires students to so divvy, while castrating late entrants who did not fall neatly into a group. No matter how personally nice Dr. Keniston is, he couldn't tilt the class from a perfect balance of simultaneously feeling like learning is at a glacial pace and that missing a class would leave you unforgivably behind.",
    "Years of awful reviews and student complaints seem to have changed very little about this course. I'm unclear why the Jackson Institute has continued to maintain the same structure of this course, despite all the push back from students who are required to take this class for their major. They are changing the security core class to a lecture, but seem to have left this untouched? I don't quite understand. That being said, the overwhelmingly negative reviews from years past are partly true. The exams and problem sets have open questions with narrow answer possibilities, and my group submitted nearly half the problem sets before starting to receive feedback regarding our performance. The material, though interesting, is definitely more accessible to kids who have more economics exposure. Given the number of students who double with Econ in Global and also the number of Security track students who have only taken the intro sequence, the level of knowledge ranges. Also, there is an assumption of a level of Stata that does not get reached in GLBL 121.",
    "Professor does not explain things well. Slides are confusing. If we cannot use laptops then the MOST UP TO DATE version of the slides should be posted before class -- posting after class or posting old versions SEVERELY HURTS learning. Good TAs and helpful section. This class should 100% be renamed to match the actual course material: development econometrics. This class currently looks like an introductory level course on my transcript, which greatly upsets me. As even the TAs told me, this course is taught at the graduate if not PhD level.",
    "I think that Prof. Keniston should move a bit slower than his current pace.",
    "There are no strengths. This class needs to be redesigned to ENGAGE students. there needs to be more support and honestly it should be totally different then it is currently. There is nothing about this class that helps Global Affairs. It has such potential to be so good, but it is just terrible. this is coming from someone in the development track who feels they are so much further away from why they chose this major and the passion they have for global affairs.",
    "The course is poorly taught for the most part. I don't find Prof Keniston particularly adept at explaining concepts. He frequently confuses himself in class, which confuses the rest of us. This is perhaps the worst class I took at Yale (I'm a graduating senior).",
    "The course is currently taught largely as a literature review course, with academic papers as the driving force of the teaching. The result is an overdependence on recalling specific examples instead of taking hold of the larger, broader topics of the class. Rather than going through each topic in its most thorough presentation, the class instead focused on the success and shortcomings of specific papers, which doesn't make any sense whatsoever.",
    "Very understaffed in terms of TAs. It's too large a class with too many problem sets to have any good feedback that is relevant (not given four weeks after the assignment). Other than that the time was prettty inconvenient. The strength of this course is tProfessor Keniston. He's quite good at lecturing I'd say."

   "comments": [
    "Not really. Keniston is actually great one on one, however because no one is excited by the class, the purpose of learning is defeated.",
    "It is a required course, so yes. I don't think it was nearly as bad as other evaluations have said.",
    "If you're taking this course, it's required. Hopefully it's finally been improved by the time you get here due to the overwhelmingly negative feedback over the last couple of years. Personally, it was the worst course I've taken at Yale - despite the vast amount of time required to slog through problem sets (much of it spent trying to figure out what the questions are actually asking, and a fair amount spent on Google trying to find out how to do the required Stata commands) I felt that I learned very little. Lectures are basically just summaries of the findings of the readings, and though the Stata you haphazardly learn goes a bit beyond what you do in AQA, it's nothing to get excited about. Keniston seems like a good guy who actually wants his students to have a good experience, the class is just terribly organized at the moment.",
    "As it has been said year after year, this course is absolutely terrible and is in need of some serious restructuring. It is quite unfortunate that it is a required course for the global affairs major. What's more, when you have students dropping out of the major because of this couse, there is a serious problem! For a course titled \"Approaches to International Development\", you actually learn very little on the subject. (All you will learn in terms of development is that worms are bad, Africa is poor, and no one knows what to do about it, except maybe Angelina Jolie.) Instead, a disorganized array of quantitative theories are thrown at you without any real direction or connection to development work. I'm sure Professor Keniston is brilliant, however he is a poor lecturer. In preparation for exams and problem sets, you will have to learn most of the material on your own outside of the class. (And I say this as a person who only missed 1.5 lectures.) It seems that they except student to come into this course already having advanced quantitative skills - this shouldn't be the case. My only hope is that the class is restructured soon. If it's not, my best of luck to those of you who have to go through it.",
    "Don't take it unless you're a global student and literally have to.",
    "My advice would be 1) don't take this class if you are bad at math 2) don't take this class if you are not a global affairs major.",
    "Global majors have to take it, but I would also recommend that people outside of Jackson take this course. GLBL 225 is primarily a development econometrics course. You receive rigorous, trial-by-fire training in statistical and econometric methods (instrument variables, RCTs, diff-in-diff, etc.) including long-form proofs and hands on applications. Additionally, the course does a very brief introduction to a number of development topics, including education, credit, savings, insurance, technology, and foreign aid, among others. In combination, these approaches help students understand, analyze, and work on econometric research in the development space. Professor Keniston is very earnest and helpful, and although some of these topics are difficult to teach, he goes above and beyond to make himself available to students for out-of-class assistance. Even still, he and TFs can be sloppy with the exams and grading which adds unnecessary headaches to the course. Overall, however, very good class.",
    "No. For the love of God do not take this course unless you absolutely must. And you must, since you're a global major.",
    "DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS UNLESS YOU HAVE TO. While the material is itself interesting, the class is graded unfairly (the TFs are literal idiots and are unable to answer any questions, even about why you got points off of a problem set), lectures are confusing and the midterm and final are difficult. The Jackson Institute understands how awful this course is and chooses to do nothing about it. DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS.",
    "Nope, but it's required, so you'll be taking it anyway. Just hope Jackson does something to fix it, but they haven't yet after years of students recommending it, so probably won't happen this year either.",
    "If you are a Global Affairs major, take it your junior year. I would not recommend this course otherwise.",
    "No, but it's required. It's not as terrible as people have said in the past.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student interested in development economics and econometrics. I would also recommend it to students who prefer a quantitative approach to global affairs. However, this course is definitely a challenge for the less QR-minded and for those who haven't looked at stats, math, or Stata in a while. Be prepared for difficult problem sets that are crucial to understanding course material.",
    "I would not recommend this course to any student who does not absolutely have to take it as a requirement. As it is, this class negatively affects the quality of the Global Affairs program as a whole. Please fix it!",
    "No, I would not. If you don't need to, don't take this class.",
    "Can't think of a single reason why you would take this if you aren't Global Affairs.",
    "If global affairs then it's a required course; but otherwise no need to take it.",
    "No. Do not take this class, it is terribly taught. I only took it to fulfill my major requirements.",
    "I would not recommend this course to another student.",
    "Dont take this course if you dont have to. Interesting topic, but the psets are hard and sometimes feel totally unrelated. If GLBL keeps this required, gut it out and find some kids who are experienced with STATA to do psets with.",
    "You have to take it if you're in Global. It's really not as bad as a lot of other reviews in the past have said!",
    "You kind of gain a basic understanding of impact evaluations and econometric skills, but you don't really learn them well...in theory it could be interesting as the content is all interesting, yet lecture is boring as hell. still a good way to improve\/keep up your stata skills.",
    "You have to take it for Global.",
    "Well honestly this class is required but I have now dissuaded people from being global affairs majors because of thsi course. it is so useless.",
    "This is a required class. I do wish it were labeled something different, because on our transcript it just says \"Approaches to International Development,\" but we should actually be getting credit for an econometrics course, which sounds a lot more rigorous.",
    "Absolutely not.",
    "Definitely. Even if you're not Global, I would say this is the best introduction to development economics. Problem sets aren't easy but you learn a lot and they are super interesting."
