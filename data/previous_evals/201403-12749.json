    "Super-hard but rewarding course that taught me how to think mathematically.",
    "If you are deciding between M244 and CS202, take this course because 1) Naplan is more enjoyable, 2) the material is more enjoyable, and 3) you'll actually learn something.",
    "Yes - take this over CPSC 202 which is apparently bad. Prof. Kaplan is a fantastic lecturer, the material lends itself to very fulfilling a-ha moments, and it is overall very fairly graded. The two midterms are not hard enough that you will find yourself lost, but not hilariously easy either. The problem sets are on the longer side, and some of the problems are quite hard, but they are quite fulfilling once you do them - plus the TA, Shaked, is really helpful in his homework sessions. I also cannot stress enough how great a professor Nathan Kaplan is - he is really engaged with the material, explains it very intuitively and is great at answering questions. He also really cares about his students, and will schedule extra office hours, send clarifying emails and resources after class, and even rescheduled the final exam because it was too late in finals period.",
    "MATH 244 is a great class, especially when taught by Professor Kaplan. Sure it is a hard class as many of the topics are not intuitive on first glance, however Professor Kaplan does a good job making sure you understand the material and getting you on the right track. I would highly recommend the class to anyone who enjoys mathematics, but if you don't enjoy mathematics then this class will be difficult simply because of the large number of proofs and concepts one has to understand.",
    "A fulfilling class. Psets are not by any means impossible and can always be completed with accuracy given that you use the right resources (your friends, the peer tutors, etc). Be sure to come to every lecture because the problems often refer to things he only mentioned during lecture. Would definitely recommend this course to anyone who's a little interested in the fun aspects of math.",
    "This is a great course for all math students. I would especially recommend it to students with some previous experience in proof-based math classes and\/or combinatorics, although neither is required.",
    "Discrete Math is a course that you need to take if you're interested in math. It really was an awesome experience. The long hours spent on problem sets were worth it, the office hours were fun, and you come out of the class feeling that you know what \"real math\" might mean. It teaches you how to reason mathematically, how to count things (no, you don't know how to do this already), and how to approach problems that might seem out of reach. This is a must-take course for anyone interested in math. Oh, and there's no question that this is better than CPSC 202.",
    "This is a challenging math course. The material is difficult, particularly if you do not come from a proof-writing background. However, if you stick it out, it is a very rewarding course. The problem sets become fun puzzles once you get the hang of them, and Professor Kaplan is a really funny, engaging lecturer.",
    "This course mainly covers combinatorics and graph theory. I would strongly recommend it as it is a very interesting course. Often the problem sets are fun in a sense to do because they're like cool puzzles. Although it's a really nice course, be aware that it's not an easy course. The problem sets are often difficult and time consuming. Also, for the most part it does not deal with deep conceptual topics as some math courses do, but instead it has lots of interesting problems.",
    "This class is difficult if you are not used to this kind of math, however Professor Kaplan is a good lecturer. Don't leave the problem sets to the last minute as they can be difficult.",
    "Really cool math class. Would recommend to any QR leaning fellow students.",
    "Discrete Math with Nathan Kaplan was a pretty swell class. Discrete math is pretty interesting, but don't be fooled by the first lecture: it gets tough, especially if you've never had experience with proofs (like me!). Well dictated and nicely paced lectures are good for the most part, except I got pretty bored during the classes that were just one long proof. Psets are manageable, probably took 5hrs on average not working with other people. Midterms are pretty tough, but I thought the final was a perfect difficulty (the extra half hour was nice). Take this with nathan if you can, apparently he only has 1 year left until he's gone and he's a great instructor. All in all, take this! You will never be able to walk through a forest the same way ever again.",
    "Amazing class! Admittedly, people seem to think it is hard, but it is definitely my favorite math class so far! It is proof-based but not so much in a formal way as in a way where you have to write a lot for all the homework. Professor Kaplan is the best, and you should shop this class just to see the first few lectures even if you won't take it. He previews all the material, and will probably hook you. If you are comparing this and CPSC 202, you should take this one.",
    "It's a decent math class - an overview of discrete math, like combinatorics, graph theory, etc, with proof writing. If you're a CS major you'll have to take either this or CPSC 202 - it seemed like most of the students in the class were CS majors. If you're trying to choose between this and CPSC 202, this is a better class lecture-wise but the psets take a lot longer and are much harder. Midterms were tough, final wasn't too bad. Don't take it in the same term as CPSC 323 unless you want a difficult semester. If you have a lighter semester, it would be a pretty good discrete math class.",
    "Very challenging survey of combinatorics, asymptotic notation, and graph theory. If your goal is to learn a lot, take the class and plan to go to all office hours, buy both the textbooks, and spend 10+ hours\/week on each problem set unless you're naturally gifted in this area or have seen the material before. If your goal is just to get a good grade and you're not already good at this stuff or you don't have much time, try Math Tools for CS instead.",
    "Math 244 is a brilliantly taught course. The lectures are engaging, the problem sets are challenging, and the tests are difficult but fair. It is a hard course, but you learn a lot, and the enthusiasm of the professor makes you want to do well.",
    "Math 244 is fascinating, but also quite challenging so be prepared for it. This might be a difficult class to take along with other high level courses (CS 323 or Math 350 for example) but it is doable. The psets are pretty long so try to start them early if you can, and go to office hours (there are peer tutors, TAs, and Prof. Kaplan's office hours) when something doesn't make sense. If you are a math major, you may struggle a bit early on due to how different the proofs and problems are in this course compared to algebra or analysis classes, but you should be able to get up to speed after a few weeks. Study a lot for the exams, and make sure you know all of the definitions really well.",
    "High quality class that covers interesting material. Be aware that this is not an easy class. Relatively long problem sets, and challenging exams. Worth it though, for the most part--students leave with a good understanding of combinatorics and graph theory. Kaplan is very engaging, and clearly is into the material of the course. With him as the instructor, this class is far from dry. Also very willing to engage with students, both in office hours, and during class.",
    "Lots of long problem sets but all the questions in the courses really make you think and use problem solving techniques.",
    "It's a lot of cool combinatorics and graph theory applied to cute problems. Also requires some proof writing, but at a somewhat basic level. I would highly recommend this course for anyone vaguely interested in math and math in computer science.",
    "Absolutely. Kaplan is the man. More time commitment and more difficult than CPSC 202 if you're taking it for the major, but you'll learn a lot more. Problem sets were a little long, usually took around 7-9 hours. Kaplan is excited about the material and gives engaging lectures. He explains the concepts well and is sensitive to the needs of students. I felt very well prepared for the final without needing to study much. Great for math majors, and great for comp sci majors. I've heard you'll be more prepared going into CPSC 365 if you take this class over 202.",
    "YES! Please take it regardless of your major. You would have a lot of fun!",
    "take it if you think you are smart enough. knowing the material alone only help you do 25% of the test, the remaining 75% is like IQ test, if you have been doing math olympiad in high school then you will thrive, if not you will die.",
    "Math 244 is a great, very challenging, but ultimately rewarding class. Combinatorics and graph theory are both really fascinating topics in math that have a lot of real-world applications, but are also difficult topics. This is a very hard class. The weekly problem sets are very difficult, tests even more difficult, and final impossible, but I am still glad I took the class. Kaplan is a great lecturer. I felt like I knew where the lecture was going at all times because he made sure to have a very understandable structure. This was very important, because they moved at such a fast pace that I don't think I could have kept up if he was not as organized.",
    "An incredible math class! Yes, it is difficult. Many people dropped and the weekly psets usually took me 10 to 15 hours. But it's one of those classes that requires a lot to be put in so that you get a lot out. You learn more problem-solving techniques than plug-and-chug equations. The problem sets require a lot of thinking, so you really have to start them early to let the ideas ferment. Kaplan is an incredible professor. He always relates the concepts in class to real life and cracks jokes. He's very relatable and his office hours are always helpful and relaxed (ask him about his times on game shows). I recommend taking this instead of copping out and taking 202 (for you learn so much more), or taking this if you wanted a higher level math class that is applicable to life and problem-solving.",
    "Anyone who is looking to take CS 365 or wants to learn about combinatorics\/graphs with no other background knowledge would benefit from this class.",
    "This is a really really really good class. This is also not an easy class. Don't take is as a random easy credit, because it has a pretty high work load and is pretty tough. If you're choosing between 202 and 244 and Nathan is teaching 244, take 244 (unless you're taking 323 concurrently and then you might want to consider the easier 202). Kaplan is amazing and the material is really interesting. The problems sets take a long time and are hard, but are completely doable if you develop a study group. Don't start the first couple too late before you know how long you can expect them to take. Then try to start early so you can go to TA office hours on problems you're stuck on. The exams are really hard and there is a lot of time pressure, but the homework is worth 40% so it balances out a bit.",
    "A really good class for people really interested in math. This class requires a unique type of thinking which takes some getting used to and can be very hard for some people. Problem sets are pretty lengthy and difficult, but they really help teach the material. Professor Kaplan is brilliant and really helps make this course doable.",
    "DO NOT TAKE THIS AT THE SAME TIME AS CPSC 323, UNLESS YOU ARE READY\/ NEED TO. BE PREPARED FOR SUFFERING. I was not prepared for how difficult MATH 244 was going to be. Unless everything clicks, problem sets can take 10+ hours (that includes going to office hours, etc.) This has been the hardest course I've taken at Yale based solely on the material. That said, Nathan Kaplan is fair. The exams are not as hard as the problem sets (just sometimes too long). If you are deciding between this and CPSC 202. MATH 244 will most definitely teach you more discrete mathematics (which has many applications to cpsc). Despite it being more difficult, I believe you come out being more confident with the material than students of 202. People say 244 will better prepare you for Algorithms, CPSC 365, as well. Beware. If you take it at the same time as 323 - don't neglect your other, easier, courses because you spend so much time on your harder ones. Time management becomes essential.",
    "Take it if you need it for a major (if you're a comp sci major, I dunno how CS 202 is, but this is good) or if u like Math. Pretty simple.",
    "If you want to learn about counting and graphs, take this course. It's pretty fun and interesting, and Nathan Kaplan is an amazing professor. The exams are hard. They require that you see the \"trick\" to solving each problem. Do not underestimate the challenge in that. The problem sets can take a long time and are quite difficult, but you will learn a bunch of interesting math. I recommend it.",
    "In the first 2\/3 of the term we did combinatorics and in the last 1\/3 we did graph theory (though combinatorics did come back into play towards the end of graph theory). I would definitely recommend this class. Professor Kaplan is clearly really smart and loves the material and he brings that energy to class every day. But be warned: this enthusiasm and intelligence sometimes manifests itself in a breakneck pace because he just figures that students understand everything the first time \/ way he explains it (or alludes to it). It's usually a big class, but don't be afraid or embarrassed to speak up in lecture if you want something explained a second time or in a different way. (Chances are a bunch of other people also have the same question.) The tests are tough because the nature of the material requires more creativity and stretches your brain in a different way than a more plug-and-chug type class like MATH120 (where you can pretty much be fine memorizing formulas). But overall good class, well taught, and enjoyable.",
    "A wonderful course. The material is really interesting and lectures are really good. The workload is pretty heavy, but definitely worth it. I definitely would recommend this over CS202. I would also recommend it if you're looking for a challenging but rewarding QR.",
    "Math 244 is a great class, but depending on your math background, it can be a lot of hard work. It was my most time consuming and difficult class this semester, and even if I started the problem sets early, it wouldn't be uncommon to still be up late the night before the problem set was due. But I loved the course anyways. The professor is great and the material is interesting. If you stress too much about the grade, then this course might be less pleasant, but otherwise I'm confident that you will learn a lot and your time will be well spent.",
    "It is difficult, but totally worth taking. It covers things that anyone interested in math needs to know.",
    "A truly incredible course, MATH 244 reminded me of why I liked math to begin with. Split primarily between topics in combinatorics and graph theory, Kaplans course is ostensibly much more about the process of refining your ability to write proofs than to cover a set amount of material. But I must say that while this course doesnt feel like a race to cover the textbook, as is the case with MATH 250, I do feel like I have a very strong, albeit introductory, foundation in the major problems and concepts of discrete math. While Professor Kaplans lectures are simply brilliant, the bulk of the course rests in his problem sets, which are carefully written to expand your understanding of the concepts. While I know why more of the final course grade cant be based on the problem set grades, it does seem a bit odd that 60% of the grade in the course comes from a series of rather brief exams. Despite this, MATH 244 stands as my favorite course taken at Yale. I would definitely recommend it to those who have the time (or can make the time) to grapple with truly fascinating problems and concepts.",
    "Awesome course. If you're doing comp sci and you're willing to put in a little more time than in 202, this class (with Kaplan) is totally worth it.",
    "Some math courses are fairly technical. MATH 244 is not; it's far more important to be able to think about problems than to know arbitrary theorems. Prof. Kaplan is great, and the course is paced pretty well. Highly recommended.",
    "This class was very challenging and a lot of work, but it was also incredibly rewarding and worth the effort. Nathan Kaplan is absolutely incredible this class had probably the most comprehensive and clear mathematics lectures I've ever experienced at Yale. I highly recommend taking the class just so you can have him as a professor. If you're considering it over CPSC 202, know that it goes very much in depth and will be very difficult, but you'll also learn a lot. Don't worry too much about not having a proof-based math background, though. Lectures move fast, but he starts every topic in its most general form and then gets more deep and specific, so not knowing anything about the subject doesn't make it harder to access.",
    "A very good introduction to discrete maths. Kaplan is an amazing lecturer, and a really nice guy. Be prepared though; p sets are long (6-9 hours) and tests are difficult",
    "This was a very fulfilling course. I'm a sophomore CS major. This was my first math course at Yale, and my first math course since BC Calc in Junior year of high school, so it has been a good 2+ years since I've done real math (though I did AP Physics Mech+EM in senior year of HS), and I was never a super math oriented person. I was intimidated going in, but if you put the work in, you can do it, and it may be rewarding. For me, the way of thinking of the course is clearly important to CS, but Kaplan covers quite a few topics and we students spend quite a long time doing problems and concepts that are not so directly related to CS, and at those times I felt like my time might be used better elsewhere, but hey pushing your intellectual bounds and comforts is what we are here for. I worked in a study group, which gave me more confidence in the beginning, and with that group + some alone time I would spend 17 - 19 hours a week on the PSET for the first four PSETS or so, and I eventually progressed to being confident enough to do more on my own and complete the PSETS in about 13 hours a week. I studied hard and got above the median on both midterms, but I feel like I botched the final (don'tknow my grade yet).",
    "Basically, Math 244 can be between 6-20 hrs of work per week depending on your math background and math ability. It was consistently 12-20 hours, tending toward 20 hrs for me. This is a class that you will do well in if you are \"smart\" in math. I was not smart in this class, and even though I feel like I studied more for this class than any of my other classes combined, I still did very poorly on the tests. Prof. Kaplan is good lecturer and he's extremely approachable in office hours and by email. Should definitely go to office hours. However, my frustration with the course is that to do well, you really need some insight. I love math, but I'd never seen proofs until college. I took math 225 before this class, and while I felt prepared, my lack of insight in math meant that I just didn't \"get\" most of the problems in 244. I could not perform on the midterms. If you lack insight, this class will be very frustrating. Great class, but if you're not smart in math, you may be constantly saddened that the tests are way to hard with too little time to even get a passing grade on. Even though I did poorly, I feel like I've learned a lot. I don't know about if there's a curve or not. If you work hard you will do better than not, but you won't be guaranteed even a C.",
    "Great course. We were exposed to mathematical proof writing and thinking mathematically. Professor Kaplan was a great professor, very enthusiastic, engaging and very welcoming. Though some people found the material somewhat challenging, Professor Kaplan was there for all kinds of help and questions.",
    "take only if you're interested in proof based math. If you're doing this for the CPSC track, I think 202 is definitely the way to go"
