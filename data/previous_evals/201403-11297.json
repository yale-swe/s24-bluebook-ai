    "I would definitely recommend this course even to students that aren't in sociology. Anyone interested in philosophy or theory will really enjoy this class. I felt it was probably the most useful as a sociologist-in-training! I'm really glad I had the opportunity to take it.",
    "I would certainly recommend this to fellow students.",
    "It was a class which covered the major theories in the history of sociology -- and social sciences more broadly.",
    "Yes!",
    "Yes- good overview of some of the many theoretical areas in Sociology.",
    "I recommend this class for every student of social science. This course is a great opportunity to build a foundation of thinking towards social phenomena. Also, students can learn different perspective from own one through discussion with classmates having different backgrounds. The instructor will facilitate discussions in an unbiased way."

   "comments": [
    "It definitely deepened my knowledge of sociology--particularly the sections moving toward contemporary theory on institutions, relations, and groups. As difficult as the section on social mechanisms were, I felt it helped open sociology to me in a very new and different way. My training as a undergraduate was quite different, so it was refreshing to read more recent theorists and to see the overall intellectual trajectory. It definitely helped me better theorize what I'm interested in for my dissertation--I enjoyed writing the two papers I did for the class.",
    "It was very helpful in helping me place an intellectual trajectory. And, many of the concepts will be applicable to my own research.",
    "Introduced me to many theoretical areas and theorists that I was entirely unfamiliar with, many of these readings I am sure I will return to again.",
    "By this course, I learned common knowledge of sociology and its theorizing process, which is essential to write dissertation in the sociology department. Especially for me, I could complement the lack of knowledge to understand social theories deeply. Moreover, because I knew another attitude than mine, I can see my research target with multi standpoints; that must improve the quality of my researches."
