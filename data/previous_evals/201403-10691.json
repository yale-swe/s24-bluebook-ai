    "I would recommend this course to an individual interested in human anatomy, physiology, and pathology. Discussing normal functioning GI, then disease state, and then seeing the tissues in person is really great.",
    "Highly recommend, this is the capstone of the MRSP program.",
    "Mentored Clinical Experience is a course that allows students to learn about human disease from a clinical perspective, discuss translational research being pursued on the topic, observe tissue samples from patients with the disease, and meet patients currently experiencing disease-related problems. I would highly recommend the course to another student, because it is extremely engaging and provides knowledge that would not otherwise be obtained by a graduate student."

   "comments": [
    "Although I don't work with humans or the GI tract, learning more about it made me think more about what I study (mechanosensitive ion channels) in the context of the GI tract. It's always interesting to think about what you study in a different context.",
    "I'm interested in medically-applicable research and this course gives wonderful insight into how medical doctors approach research. This course also does a wonderful job of showing practical applications of the knowledge gained in other MRSP courses. Thank you!",
    "This course have given me an appreciation for the human side of disease. I spend my time in the lab learning about the molecular mechanisms underlying the disease, but the MCE has allowed me to expand my viewpoint to include human beings. While the course does not directly contribute to my dissertation\/research, it has opened up doors for me to further pursue a human understand of the disease that I am studying for my thesis (through the connections that I've made during this course)."
