   "comments": [
    "German 110 is a great intro language course that should be taken if you have ANY interest in taking German. It's organized pretty well, and once you get into the swing of things, you begin to learn very quickly.",
    "I would definitely recommend German 110 to another student. As soon as you step into class on the first day you are immersed in a completely German-speaking environment. The teacher is very insistent on speaking and explaining everything in German which forces you to learn to listen to the language. Just one semester of the language here is probably equivalent to several years of high school language study, at least in my experience. If you want to learn German, definitely take this course.",
    "German 110 is an intensive intro to German, it walks you through basic vocab and sentence structure. I would recommend the class, but know the commitment you're getting into."
