    "If you are serious about learning how to use Medium Format cameras, and you are willing to put in the work and spend the money, then this is your best opportunity. The Yale darkroom is amazing and the Professors are dedicated, plus you are given the privilege of renting a few different types of very expensive and incredible cameras to this end. Not for the faint of heart!",
    "Medium Format is a little more stressful and challenging than intro, because more attention is pointed at how you print, and what your project is. You can't really just go around doing whatever as you would have in intro. But it's a fruitful challenge and Lisa has you thinking about your picture-making more critically at the end of it."
