    "504 is a survey of quantitative methods that builds upon 500 and 503 but moves beyond the heavy emphasis on experiments and gives students tools for analyzing data.",
    "I would certainly recommend PLSC 504 to another student.",
    "A review of leading quantitative methods.",
    "Yes, even for primarily qualitative researchers, I strongly recommend this class.",
    "Yes. I'm not sure that PLSC 504 is a 'fun' class, but it's a must if you consider graduate school a time to develop or hone skills you'll need to be successful in the profession.",
    "504 is a great class. I came into the PhD program expecting to be a fully qualitative researcher, and found myself immersed in the methods and techniques offered in 504. This class should be required for empirical political scientists, even qualitative methodologists, as it lays the foundation for so much of what social science research is today."

   "comments": [
    "Through this course, I gained more comfort working with data. I gained an appreciation for a Bayesian approach, which also applies to qualitative research.",
    "Above.",
    "504 helped me realize how important the way in which you employ quantitative methods can either strengthen or weaken your research. I think that the most helpful part of the course might have been forcing us to learn LaTeX and teaching us about how to generate figures and present data transparently.",
    "This class taught me the groundwork of empirical social science as it is conducted today. I now feel \"research literate\" and even confident in my ability to conduct my own data analyses without succumbing to the worst sins of quantitative research. I will surely use the concepts and techniques taught in this class in my own research."
