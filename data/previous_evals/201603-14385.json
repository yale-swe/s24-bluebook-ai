    "The knowledge that will stick with me longest, I think, was gained in researching for my final presentation. But I also liked the discussion about particle freeze-out times and the thermal history of the universe.",
    "ASTR 600 provided me with a very strong background in several parts of Cosmology, both in theoretical and observational aspects of it. During the course I was exposed to many active areas of research in the field, from models of inflation to Big Bang Nucleosynthesis to many others. As a result, after ASTR 600 I can say I have a much stronger grasp on the field of Cosmology, which helps me with my research now and in the future, should I decide to follow the field (which this course has encouraged me to).",
    "This course taught a wide overview of many topics in cosmology, including the fundamental cosmological metrics, big bang nucleosynthesis, and inflation."

   "comments": [
    "I wanted to love this course, but I often found it frustrating. The lectures were hard to follow for a few reasons: equations were written down (often using numbers mixed with variables) and it wasn't usually clear where they came from or whether these numbers were physical constants or experimentally derived; there were no supplementary lecture notes provided (except for one or two lectures); and after a few problem sets, it became clear that what we discussed in class wouldn't actually be tested on the problem sets, so it started to feel a little useless to take perfect notes if I knew they wouldn't help me there. I really like to have a textbook or set of lecture notes to serve as a guide in my learning outside of class, but recommending 8 or 9 textbooks rather than one or two was overwhelming. The problem sets were very inconsistent in their difficulty and the instructions were sometimes unclear, e.g. when we were told to do all integrals by hand, but the integrals on the next pset were unwieldy and really required numerical integration (hypergeometric functions). And while the questions touched on ideas we had discussed in class, nothing in lecture really matched up with the kinds of problems we were addressing. Overall strengths: I can tell that Prof. Nagai really cared about his students, plus he was a careful lecturer who used the board well. Was very patient and I appreciated getting his comments on my slides before I gave my talk. Suggestions for improvement: Add structure to lectures by pairing them with a set of lecture notes, even if just handwritten, that sticks to the schedule of topics. Follow a few derivations out in full rather than jumping between equations. Pare down the textbook suggestions to one or two primary ones, with others as optional readings. Most of all: work out example problems in class that will help us with homeworks later, and review the psets to make sure each problem matches well with the content of the lectures -- otherwise your students might feel rather lost at sea with no idea how to start.",
    "The only weakness I can point out is the slight lack of correlation between the homeworks and what was being covered in class. This problem was addressed in the second half of the course, but it did affect my experience during the first few weeks. Other than that, everything was nearly perfect: the breadth and depth of each lecture, as well as the order they were put in, were extremely well decided.",
    "I was not happy with the overall structure of this course. Each lecture seemed to be just a constant stream of formulas without much signposting to allow the students to know where each equation comes from and what they describe. This may just be a quirk of astronomy, but many of these formulas included numbers (rather than variables) without much description of where they came from. Looking through the syllabus now that the course is over, I've now realized that we hardly touched all the concepts on there. This made it difficult to use the references provided there, since we didn't really cover those topics. Therefore, I would have appreciated more precise references for where the professor was taking material and formalism in his lectures. Additionally, the homeworks did not always follow the material of the course, meaning that they were at first overly difficult (becoming essentially a test in finding the proper formula that wasn't presented in class) and then overly simple (simply writing a program step by step without much room for student interpretation). Homeworks are most effective when they are straightforward formulaically (usually by using exactly the formulas found in lecture), but allow the student to discover something new about the material that wasn't strictly covered in class (such as a complex derivation or an exploration of a certain parameter's limitations). All of these complaints will most likely be easily fixed in later iterations of this course. Daisuke is very approachable and willing to fix the courses shortcomings, so I have no doubt that these problems will be overcome. It was just unfortunate to be stuck in a course during the first semester it was taught."

    "There are fun moments in this course, particularly the final presentations, but beware of mismatches between what's expected on problem sets and what you actually do in lectures. I often felt like I had no idea where to begin on problem sets, even though they shared thematic ideas with the lectures. There are several textbooks suggested to supplement your class notes, but without a set of lecture notes to guide me, it was often pretty unclear where to go for help on a certain question outside of attending office hours each week (which almost all the students ended up doing, I think, and sometimes for every week). There are definitely structural revisions to the course that I would suggest in future iterations, but the bright sideis that Prof. Nagai is quite devoted as a teacher, available for help outside of class, and engaged with his students.",
    "I would recommend this course ONLY if the student is definitely going into a related field AND if the professor is well experienced teaching the material. The concepts were interesting and there is much material to explore beyond the scope of the lectures, but unfortunately, the iteration of the course that I took was overtly disorganized and not well suited for students slightly outside cosmological research.",
    "Yes I would recommend this course. I gained valuable insights into the field of cosmology."
