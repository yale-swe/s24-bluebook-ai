   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend the course. It provides both the background readings needed for every student of gender and sexuality as well as a number of more recent articles and books on the subject. The discussions are stimulating and fruitful and help prepare one for being able to speak eloquently about the merits of any work of historical scholarship.",
    "This course is a survey of recent academic work in the history of sexuality (mainly American sexuality). Professors Chauncey and Meyerowitz are brilliant professors and do a wonderful job of giving an overview of the field while also encouraging serious, thoughtful discussion.",
    "Survey in the history of sexuality in the United States that focuses heavily on homosexuality, particularly gay male history.I would recommend it, but not if they hadn't taken a previous course on the subject or were auditing the intro to sexuality for undergrads.",
    "Highly recommended: this is a well-taught class on fascinating material, with an important focus on historiography.",
    "An in depth course in the the history of American Sexuality; most readings are focused on the US with some transnational connections. Reading is fairly light compared to other courses; expectation of command of the material in class is high; class discussions are lively, provocative.I would absolutely recommend this course if one had an interest in the subject."

   "comments": [
    "I have definitely benefited from the course and will no doubt come back to the syllabus time and again.",
    "It's unclear whether this course will help me in my dissertation preparation. I thought that some of the texts were helpful, but the preference for articles over monographs or edited volumes sometimes made class not very cohesive.",
    "The final project of this course was to write a dissertation\/thesis prospectus. I used this assignment as an opportunity to think through many of the issues of a research project I had already been planning. The work is directly applicable to my current work. The project was exciting and feedback from the professors was invaluable.",
    "Greatly deepened; led me to what I believe will be my future dissertation\/interest area."
