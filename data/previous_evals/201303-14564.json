   "comments": [
    "American Indian Religions and Ecology is a great topic. I certainly feel more educated now about Native traditions and current issues, whereas before I took this class I had no idea if what I thought I knew about Native Americans was anything more than romanticized or biased information. John Grim is also a good professor, although I think it would have helped balance the class if Mary Evelyn Tucker had co-lead the discussions with him instead of only coming to one class.The one downside to this course is that several of the books are extremely dry and academic. I wanted to be interested, but they made good topics so boring! Overall, the course was probably split half and half between good readings and boring readings.So, in sum, I would recommend this course, but not a huge recommendation. If the reading list for this course is improved next year (i.e. The Shaman and Trust in the Land are cut), then I would recommend it more.",
    "I recommend American Indian Religion and Ecology to students that are interested in the concept and also will be able to come into the course with an open-mind. With that being said, the students will leave feeling enlightened and opened to a new world of religious cosmology and the importance of ecology in our changing world. The workload is very manageable, the discussions are navigable, and the assignments are fun and applicable to real-world situations. You will get to learn a lot about different tribes from all over the nation and increase your knowledge about American Indians in general.",
    "EVST 280 is a fantastic course and I really encourage other students to take it if offered. Professor Grim is an incredible professor who you need to learn from if you have the opportunity. Not only is he unbelievably well-versed in American Indian culture and history, he's a wonderful person to just be around.The course will make you rethink your relationship to land, to the environment, and to story-telling. It will expose you to new ways of thinking about religion and nature, American Indians, and traditional knowledge and lifeways. Through case studies of different tribes and the challenges they face, American Indian creation stories and legends, and indigenous philosophies, you might just leave the course with a more humble and present worldview. That probably sounds really New Age-y, but don't disqualify the course just because of that.",
    "This is a very disorganized course that involves disjointed readings. I would not necessarily recommend it to another student.",
    "This class takes a walk through the myriad ways that indigenous people have worked tirelessly to forge spiritual and ecological connections to the natural world. It not only provides a foundation in the study of American Indian religions as well as the study of religious ecology, but it will better you as a person and member of the planet's natural community. You will question and perhaps alter your most fundamental assumptions about human life. Please take it. Everyone should take it.",
    "Great course, really interesting, really varied, unlike any other class I have taken at Yale. Has a good balance of traditional native spiritual lifeways and discussion of modern problems that plague native communities. Prof Grim is v supportive, charming, and cares deeply about the subject in a way that gets students invested. I will be taking every course he teaches for the rest of my time at Yale.",
    "Enjoyable - you'll learn a lot - but Prof. Grim can be a bit all over the place. Be prepared to do the readings and still be wholly unsure of what was being discussed in class. Not the most earth-shattering course I've taken, but certainly an important subject (only wish there were even more comprehensive courses!).",
    "This class was really interesting and made me think a lot in ways that I hadn't before. If you want a really organized, straightforward class, this is not for you, but if you're interested in the topics and ready to try something new, it's great. Grad students are also hilarious!"
