    "Yes. I would recommend the course to another student.This is an excellent introduction to both the Holocaust as an event and to the development of its historiography. To anyone interested in the Holocaust, in genocide studies, or in looking at transnational history research through a special lens, this class would be a very meaningful experience.",

    "This class did help me tremendously. Even though my specialty isn't the Holocaust, the Holocaust is such a defining event in 20th century that for me it seems like an important junction through which I can gain a better understanding of many of the other historical issues that I'm studying. More importantly, through the example of the Holocaust, the course really problematized history writing for me, and these lessons will be particularly lasting."
