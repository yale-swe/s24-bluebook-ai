    "The homework for Strategic Planning almost always allowed me to think critically about the material and prepared me well for seminar, without ever being an undue burden on my already busy workload. Assignments were informative, challenging, just the right size. That said, having at least two weeks between classes meant that I often lost track of what we had been studying by the time I sat down to address the homework for the next class."

    "The organization of the class made sense. The only thing I wish we had was a syllabus apart from the list of all of the assignments for the semester - some kind of guide to inform us at a glance what we were going to discuss each week.",

    "Greg is a good instructor - he is passionate about his work, and eager to teach his students how to perform it. He enjoys stimulating class discussion, though occasionally he can go off on a story for a particularly long time, which limits the opportunities for discussion as a whole, and can occasionally derail the educational thrust of the conversation. Sometimes, we go off on tangents that add little to our understanding of the strategic planning process. Nevertheless, his explanations are clear and very informative.",
    "While very knowledgeable about the subjects he is teaching, the class could be a little more interactive. I sometimes felt like he was talking at us. Stories aren't always the best way to impart knowledge on a student.",
    "I appreciated when Greg would allow the class to break into longer discussions and would tie it back to the focus of the class."

    "The Strategic Planning process as taught by Greg is like 80% intuitive application of principles that we study throughout our curriculum - the real trick is how to bridge that intuition with planning and structure. Greg's experience and his planning process teaches us a great deal of how to bring that thinking into practice. Furthermore, our class discussion encouraged us to think deeper into the principles of mission and strategy.",
    "The source material for the course was fascinating to read, giving both context and visualization to strategic planning. Greg's structure of the class, clearly laid out in the syllabus, also made it easier to learn and understand his strategic planning process."

    "- More clear road-mapping of how each week's lessons build towards the future weeks would be useful in preparing us for the large assignment in Week 6. - It might be helpful to have assignments due before the day of the class in order to encourage us to keep up with the reading and thought on strategic planning during weeks when we do not have class."
