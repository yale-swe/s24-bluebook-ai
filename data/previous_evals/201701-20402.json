    "Feel like I understand far better what materials and biophysical chemistry are like as research areas -- I learned as much from talking to the very accessible professors as I did from the course itself.",
    "A ton of laboratory techniques relevant to modern chemistry, as well as substantial practice and feedback in writing journal communication-style lab reports. Techniques included solution phase materials synthesis, solid state materials synthesis, FTIR, SEM\/EDS, fluorimetry, XRD, optical microscopy (including super-resolution), image processing, and optical trapping."

    "Every module was very interesting and a \"cool\" bit of chemistry. Would have liked to better understand what the matlab code was actually doing and what the benefits of specific synthesis steps in the materials portion were.",
    "This course is incredibly strong due to its small lab sections and constant engagement from the professors, which makes sure you're really learning effectively. The professors grade the lab reports themselves, and give ample feedback. My only complaint really (super minor) is that sometimes report grading was a little slow, so we'd get a lab report back after the next one was due, which made improving based on feedback a little difficult. People have also complained that the two halves of the course (materials with Prof. Wang and biophysical with Prof. Ganim) aren't really related or connected in any way, but I don't see that as a problem -- we learned a variety of information from each professor, and I don't see a reason to force connections between them if there aren't any."

    "Very interesting and cool lab course -- would recommend!",
    "A fantastic class that I'd definitely recommend. Profs Wang and Ganim basically created this course by asking \"what should students interested in chemistry know how to do that isn't being taught in any other course at this university?\" Among other things, you synthesize nanoparticle-functionalized graphene and look at it under an electron microscope, make a fluorescent lanthanum oxide powder by doing a solid state synthesis in a 1200 degree furnace, watch quantum dots blink and find them with super-resolution using a fluorescent microscope you build yourself, and measure the torque exerted by bacterial flagella by trapping them with a laser. There are six experimental write-ups that have to be fairly detailed and aren't inconsequential (3 pages single-spaced text with a few pages of figures), but they're great practice for writing scientific papers and are super low key if you're coming out of pchem lab. You definitely don't need to be a chemistry major to take this class and will get a lot out of it, just be prepared to do a little background reading on electronic states and term symbols if you're not.",
    "Really cool, unique lab course. I took this as an MCDB major the content is accessible assuming you've at least taken some chemistry (e.g. gen chem and\/or orgo) and are open to learning some more. If you clear it with the DUS ahead of time, it can also count as an MCDB lab. I don't believe there is any other class at Yale that teaches you the principles of microscopy as thoroughly as this one, which is valuable across virtually all the sciences. I think the materials chem modules and optics modules were also more tightly integrated this year than they were last year. For example, you synthesize CdSe and CdS quantum dots in the first section, and then a few months later image\/analyze their blinking behavior with a fluorescence microscope that you construct yourself. Also, Ziad is one of the most engaged, accessible professors I've ever had, which is a huge plus.",
    "Yes - great course, reasonable workload, and you learn a lot."
