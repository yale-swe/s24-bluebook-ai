    "I highly recommend it!",
    "This section was the bioscience-inspired one, and it differed a lot from the other sections: more real-world applications (population dynamics, lung volumes, etc.), quirky and esoteric course content (some basic linear algebra, fractals, iterative equations). Still, I would recommend you take it. Michael Frame is probably the best professor in the department, and he is amazingly available for people who need extra help, and you are still perfectly qualified for Math 120.",
    "This 115 course concentrates on biosciences, so while you still need the skills youlearned in Calculus in high school, you will learn things very differently (and the course material will be very different) than the other 115 sections. Overall, even if you don't concentrate in the sciences, this course is very interesting.",
    "Math 115 07 is NOT 115! The ideal student is one who has taken the equivalent of Calculus BC. The course covers a few concepts in the equivalent of Calc BC but over half is fractal, linear, and multivariable. Be prepared for this! However, Michael is phenomenal. If this is your only chance to have him as a professor take this class no matter what. You can certainly handle to work and your grade in the course is more so how you do on the final exam.",
    "TAKE PROFESSOR FRAME'S SECTION. He's so funny, and the bioscience section is the best. Really really interesting.",
    "Math 115 for biomedical and biological sciences was an extremely interesting course filled with many new concepts and problem-solving methods. I would definitely recommend it to someone looking for a doable calculus II class that teaches calculus in a different way than calculus BC from high school.",
    "Michael Frame is an amazing, person. I wish I could take more classes with him. This class is significantly different from the other Math 115 classes. If you took BC in high school, and are looking for an easy A, don't take this class, because it's new stuff. However, it is fairly interesting. Class is awesome because Michael Frame is awesome. I would recommend taking this class if you're like me and know you won't go\/stay awake in another 115 class taught by some 30 yr old who doesn't speak english. The grading is fair too. The final is either 50% of your final grade, or 100% if you do better on the final than your other grades.",
    "I would definitely recommend it. If you're interested in any area of biology it's a great course. I always thought math was kind of boring, but the topics we covered were really cool for the most part. A common reservation students have is that they wonder if it'll prepare them for 120 or ENAS 151. Well, the first day of class Professor Frame answered the question and said, \"Yes it does. How do I know? Well I developed the curriculum for 120, so I would know.\"",
    "If you do not plan on going further in math and need this for a major or pre med requirement I would recommend this class. It is just one midterm, a final and weekly problem sets. Michael Frame is an amazing teacher and his office hours are great. There are also undergraduate tutors who hold office hours and they are very helpful when you need to finish a problem set the night before it is due. If you plan on going on to Math 120 I would be hesitant to recommend this class to another student. This class does do some things that the normal Nath 11 class does like series, integration by parts and substitution, According to Michael Frame, who made the Math 120 curriculum, this class will prepare you for Math 120, but I am not so sure about that. If you do move on to Math 120 after this class self learning Calc 2 over the break would be a smart thing to do. Its 100% doable. You should at least be confident in integration. But overall this was still a good class and after taking the final I felt like I did learn a lot. Michael Frame is great, but unfortunately he won't be teaching this class anymore.",
    "Math 115 for Biological and Biomedical Sciences is a great course for those who are looking for a Calculus course at Yale that will prepare them for Math 120. It is a fun, relaxed course with 1 midterm exam only and it is very interesting because the professor is a great educator. Math never seemed so fun! I strongly recommend it.",
    "If you're a pre-med or just generally interested in math and science, you should consider taking this course. I personally took it because I'm ehhh about math, but I really like science. I took Calc BC and got a 5, but I just felt like I wasn't interested enough in math to do Multivariable here (Math-120). I took this thinking that it would be a good inter-disciplinary course, but I didn't find it as interesting as I thought I would have. However, I think that I was happier in this class compared to my other friends in the regular Math 115.Basically, if you haven't taken Calc BC, the regular 115 focuses on the pure math skills that will help you more if you want to go further to other math classes. But if you haven't taken BC and you only want to take one math class at Yale, consider making this the one.If you have taken Calc BC and you don't want to take Multivariable\/want to learn about how math can be applied in a pretty unique way, consider taking this class.Last thing -- DO NOT be scared of the first couple lectures! About 60% of this class is comprised of stuff you haven't seen before if you've taken Calc BC. This class is NOT hard, it's just different.",
    "It is a rigorous but valuable intro course",
    "Yes.",
    "Take it only if you absolutely must.",
    "Yes. If you need to take 115, this seems to be the course to take. I took this class at the same time as friends in general 115, and they seemed much more stressed overall than I was. That being said, learning the material definitely takes some serious work, though the problem sets were generally manageable afterward.",
    "I think the material covered a the beginning of the year was kind of scary because it was difficult and unfamiliar, but overall this class was very valuable. Granted, the problem sets were very time consuming, and at times extremely difficult, but I think that it was Frame's way of getting his students to think more in depth about math and how it applies to everyday life. I would recommend this course, especially to pre-med students, but also to those who want to better understand biological systems or who just want a challenge.",
    "It is a good class to take if you want to learn math related to biology even though it is beyond standard 115 level.",
    "Math 115-07 is not calc II like calc BC. In fact, we did integrals for a total of 1.5 class periods. We did power series for about two class periods. This class will take you out of the box of systematic mathematics and into the world of real math. It's all very interesting, but don't expect to understand it at the first try. I suggest reading the section before class, and again after class, and going to the tutoring hours because they make a world of a difference. At the end of the class when everything comes together for you, it will seem like a whole new world. You will feel accomplished. Michael Frame is amazing. I recommend this class; be ready to test your mind and put in the effort, and you will be rewarded.",
    "Do NOT take this class as a review or replacement of calculus BC, because that is not what it is. Basic integrals and series (substitution, by parts, power series, etc.) are covered in a couple of chapters, and the other 15 or so are dedicated to linear algebra, differential equations, and statistics. Only take this class if you are already comfortable with all of that material and are looking for a challenging new way to apply what you know and learn new things. That said, it is an excellent course, grading is very fair, and if you do the work diligently, follow along with the course notes, and go to lecture, you will learn the material and at the end of the class you will feel immensely accomplished when you finally see how everything fits together.",
    "You should probably only take it if you have to. If Michael Frame offers this class again definitely take it with him. Make sure to do all the problem sets and ask questions if you need help\/go to office hours.",
    "I would recommend the course to another student.",
    "This is the best way to take Math 115. The biological examples make the class more interesting than the standard math. They also helped me to remember the calculus. I would wholeheartedly recommend this calss to anyone who has take 115 at Yale.",
    "I wouldn't recommend this class unless you have to take it. It's not easy, the problem sets are a pain. The only good news is that the tests are open notes.",
    "This was an incredible class. Michael Frame is an amazing person and professor, invested in the material, so you become invested as well. I learned a lot and had a lot of fun. Highly recommended.",
    "I would recommend Professor Frame's section for math because he is an amazing professor. He is very clear and helpful. It is clear that he is passionate about what he does and his enthusiasm is infectious.",
    "This section presents much of the same content as the regular 115, but employs biological applications. In my opinion, that makes the math much more interesting. Frame does a great job teaching it (he actually wrote the text book we use). If that sounds interesting to you, it's well worth taking the course.",
    "The class material was confusing at first, but after doing the homework it maked a lot of sense. It's a good class for a pre-med student, since it shows the link between math and biology--two subjects you wouldn't normally think were related. It's also nice if you want to take a math class that's a little different and makes you think about what a problem means or how it can be applied.",
    "YES. take it."
