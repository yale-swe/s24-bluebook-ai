   "comments": [
    "Background knowledge about global warming and basic climate processes; better skills in reading scientific papers",
    "I learned so much about global warming and I am so glad I took this class. I feel like I have a confident knowledge about the history and current situation of global warming and climate science in general now.",
    "A solid overview foundation of the scientific theory, data evidence, methodology, and history behind our current understanding of climate change. As a scientist that doesn't work on environmental research, I've never had an opportunity to connect my scientific skills and my interest in climate issues, but this class gave me a wonderful overview of the science of climate change, which is awesome.",
    "I learned about the causes of global warming to a far deeper level than I imagined- I learned what's real in the media and what's just sound bites for a story.",
    "a history of the understanding of climate change through evaluation of different climate models and theories throughout the last century and a half or so. I developed a much more holistic understanding of how important an issue global warming is, and can now back it up with a bunch of info about the development of our understanding of GW",
    "The inner-workings of climate change and global warming, the history of climate change papers, and a more scientific perspective on these issues.",
    "This course provided me with an excellent introduction to climate change beyond what is assumed and known by the global populace. Professor Trude makes this material easy to understand and does not complicate our comprehension of the material with the underlying equations that support all of our knowledge of climate physics. In addition, I have a in-breadth understanding of the history of research on climate change, and how it ties into today's perception of the matter.",
    "This course increased my knowledge of general concepts relating to global warming and climate physics. I feel generally conversant in basic climate science and am excited to learn more about global warming. The class also introduced me to the seminal scientific papers on climate science. My ability to read and critically analyze scientific writing has greatly improved. Also, the final term paper greatly improved my ability to carry out an in depth research paper on a scientific topic.",
    "I now understand the main causes of global warming from a scientific perspective, can name and refute common misconceptions about climate change, and can explain the growing necessity for action to help the climate before it warms to a point that makes life difficult on the planet."

   "comments": [
    "Definitely a good way to engage non-STEM majors in the subject! It got a little repetitive though because of the weekly paper-reading format - I personally would have enjoyed more focus on and engagement with the science of it.",
    "I thoroughly enjoyed the lecture-paper structure of the classes, which gave us both a solid structured knowledge of climate physics and an intimate interaction with the research work behind. The weekly bullet points were light in workload but very effective in helping us keep up with the reading, re-digest what we got out of the papers, and keep their key points in mind.",
    "Strengths: Most of the class. Paper discussions are great, so is the final paper. Weaknesses: Unclear expectations around the quiz and participation.",
    "Strengths- Trude was great! Sad she's leaving :( Weaknesses- Not as much physics as I expected",
    "Strengths: engaging and open lecture style,Trude allowed us to engage with topics that interested us for the final paper Weaknesses: hard terms for non-science students Improved: Provide definition of terms used in the reading before the bullet points are due.",
    "This is a near-perfect course. The class is well designed and allows students without a science background to better understand how earth's climate works. Professor Storelvmo knows what she's doing and has crafted the syllabus with thought and care. The class is so compelling that my main criticism is that I wish we had covered more ground throughout the term. That being said, the course schedule is already dense and I'm not sure that there would be room for additional information or lectures. Also, I would recommend slightly reworking weekly discussions. Our weekly seminars often broke down into three components: context questions on the paper we had read, summarizing the major findings of that paper, and identifying the flaws of that paper. Though these served as a useful conversational framework, I felt that the best parts of our discussions came when the conversation went a little bit off-the-rails and delved into issues that went beyond those three talking points. I would recommend straying slightly from the questions, findings, flaws format in the future, simply to allow for broader discussion and more room for inquiry.",
    "The class was great at breaking down the science for students not familiar with physics or geology. The Warming Papers were interesting insofar as they aided in showing the progression of climate science, but perhaps too much time was spent on them. I would have liked to delve into the science a little more instead of discussing the papers at such great length (some of which were quite redundant)."

   "comments": [
    "Great gut science credit, highly reccomend",
    "I would definitely recommend it to a non-STEM major interested in climate issues. However, I'm not sure I'd recommend it to people with a serious interest in climate or earth science, because I felt like it only scratched the surface of the science and was a little boring at times.",
    "yes! great science credit.",
    "This is one of those classes where you learn things that you will continue to apply and use later in your career even if you don't work in the field. This class gives you a much more complete, structured, and realistic understanding of the climate science behind the current climate change issues, e.g. seeing what some surprising challenges and nuances are in quantifying the climate, the avenues of evidence that support our understanding about climate change, and the efficacy of those strategies that people dream of that can \"save the world\" immediately. You come out of this class knowing how to properly talk about the science of anthropogenic climate change, both to those working in the field and those that deny this is happening. I've had many meaningful conversations with people of diverse viewpoints using what I learned from this class. A must-take.",
    "Yes but do not expect much science.",
    "Fine course, good for learning about global warming, but also not super interesting. Could be better.",
    "Great class! I learned about the causes of global warming to a far deeper level than I imagined- I learned what's real in the media and what's just sound bites for a story. Trude was awesome, but she's unfortunately leaving :(",
    "would definitely recommend to anyone interested in climate change who is looking for a relatively easy class that is still very interesting",
    "Yes because, although it is hard to understand the papers, the lectures and the student presentations really help us engage with the material and understand these topics.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to anyone who is interested in furthering one's own understanding of climate change, because I found that I was one of the few who had a misconception about climate change. Also, I believe this class would be a great way to determine if one is interested in geology or geophysics.",
    "All Yale students should take this class. Being conversant in climate science is critical to understanding our modern world. Moreover, Professor Storelvmo makes all of the science very accessible. As someone without a science background, I found the course very compelling and easy to follow along. The exams and assignments are very straightforward and you'll do well if you pay attention in class. I'm very glad that I took this class and plan on carrying with me all that I learned over the course of the term.",
    "Yes I would recommend this course. The content is incredibly important information as the planet is of utmost importance for the survival of humankind, purely from a pragmatic sense. Anyone can learn something new in the class as a wide range of issues regarding climate change are discussed."
