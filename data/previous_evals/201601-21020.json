    "You get to read four amazing books under the guidance of an expert who cares deeply about teasing out their splendors, nuances, and internal contradictions. Alexandrovs fantastic lectures are not to be missed (whether youre up to date on the reading or not). That said, the reading load is substantial, bordering on unreasonable. Mentally prepare yourself to always be behind, and consider Cr\/Dbut take the course.",
    "Lots and lots of reading, but very much worth it.",
    "A very dank class. Take it.",
    "Fantastic course, Professor Alexandrov's lectures are among the best at Yale, TFs are great and know the material, I don't have any criticisms.",
    "If you want to read these books at any point then take it! You will definitely learn way more than if you do it on your own. Take it with a friend and then you can have Russian Lit book club and discuss on your own, too.",
    "Great course but a lot of reading! Not too many papers though, which is great. Take this for an interesting set of lectures.",
    "Take this class. Lots of readings, but certainly worth it. Some of the greatest books ever written!"
