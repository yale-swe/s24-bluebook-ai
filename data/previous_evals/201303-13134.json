    "I would recommend MUSI 625 to every student on the theory track because the skills the course was designed to strengthen will in all likelihood be part and parcel of our teaching and our work as instructors during our post-graduate careers. The \"new formenlehre\" is also a hot topic these days and becoming familiar with sonata theory is a sine qua non for access to and participation in certain sectors of our discourse today. However, I would say that MUSI 625 has probably endowed me with certain biases with regards to the debates on form analysis\/theory that are active today.",
    "I would certainly recommend the course strongly to anyone with a strong interest in theories of form and\/or in classical-era music. Sonata Theory is so important both in the instruction of Yale undergraduates and in the music theory and musicology worlds at large, and the course will do great things for improving the knowledge base and analytical understanding of anyone with a strong interest in the material. And of course, in learning Sonata Theory, there is hardly anyone better to study under than Professor Hepokoski himself, one of the method's creators and a demanding instructor who will push the student's grasp on his or her own knowledge to much stronger positions. I would, however, caution those who are interested in the course in more of a dabbler's type of way. I probably would not recommend it as a way of getting into the classical period from a standpoint of little familiarity--one must already have a fairly strong amount of dedication to its repertoire to get a lot out of the class. In other words, the more time a student has (willingly) spent with material of this nature before taking the class, the better off he or she will be during it."

   "comments": [
    "Since this course is so tied to what I am most directly knowledgeable and interested in, it was very important in deepening my knowledge and did so a great deal. My analytical grasp on all music with any sort of family relation to sonata-form music has forever been strengthened--my ears and eyes feel as if they have been outfitted with permanent enhancements, and although as a first-year student I don't know yet at all what my dissertation and research will be about, there is really no question that this course's material will play a crucial role in it. I was expecting this to be the case, since I already knew what the course would address, and I'm happy to say I wasn't disappointed."
