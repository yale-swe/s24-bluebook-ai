    "This is the last time it's being taught, unfortunately.",
    "This class involves weekly seminars with prepared readings and writing assignments. Although there are a lot of readings, a lot of them are very interesting! If you took the time to read the assignments, the reading responses essentially wrote themselves. Professor Kevles expects some discussion of her assignments in class, but also opens the floor for different discussion points. She also has so many related anecdotes that make the course exciting and personal!",
    "Yes, but unfortunately this was the last time the class was offered.",
    "This class was informal and very engaging. It was relevant in so many ways to life and to other courses. Prof. Kevles was absolutely fantastic...so sweet and had such a wealth of knowledge. She made the course what it was.",
    "Medical Imaging is a very chill seminar (my class had only 5 students) where you will do a lot of listening from an expert. Not very much discussion, but for me that was fine, since I was so engrossed in what Professor Kevles was saying."
