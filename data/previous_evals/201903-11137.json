    "This course offered an introduction to some of the most important theoretical approaches to and historiographical debates in U.S. and Latin American history. Assigned readings included both foundational works of theory and new books in the fields of American and international history. Class discussion allowed for a helpful working through of the intersections of theory and history.",

    "Strengths: Good reading list; opportunity to shape course syllabus to fit students' interests over the course of the semester; very productive and engaged conversation; one of the best classes I have taken so far in its approach to theory Weaknesses: the malleability of the syllabus also meant that the course did not have as clear of an intellectual through-line as others I have taken",
    "This class was exceptional in that it was student-directed, which meant that we were able to request readings and guide the direction of class discussion. In future iterations, it would be nice to receive some feedback on our reading responses."

    "I would definitely recommend this course to students interested in U.S., Latin American, and\/or international history, as well as to students seeking to familiarize themselves with the major theoretical and intellectual currents in 20th century history and social science (Marxism, most importantly).",
    "Yes! It was a breath of fresh air to be able to build the syllabus together, and we got to read many new and important books."
