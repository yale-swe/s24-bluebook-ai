    "Take it and take any class with her teaching!",
    "Language classes are tough because they meet every day but Spanish 140 is a good continuation of spanish 130 with just more talking and more difficult readings.",
    "I wouldn't recommend it unless you have to take it to advance in Spanish or fulfill a language requirement.",
    "This class is focuses on complex grammar, as well as reading short stories and then one short novel at the end of the semester. If you want to speak, write and read better in Spanish, I recommend taking this course. Also, take it with Mercedes Carreras! She made the class fun and truly wanted each student to do well in the course.",
    "It is the same as Spanish III, but grading is tougher. Take the class if you need it for the requirement.",
    "Lots of work, but totally worth it if you need to get to L5",
    "If you have to take L4 to fulfill your language requirement, Carreras is a really kind professor that cares about her students doing well. The grading started out very harsh in the beginning of the semester, but she gave higher scores as the semester progressed. Professor Cividanes is in charge of the course, though, so students in her section thought that she was the person writing the tests.",
    "If you're taking it you, you probably have to for language requirement. It's harder than L3 but manageable. If you've already taken L3 you've got to take it to get credit for that so you might as well.",
    "Mercedes Carreras is great! Take her class."
