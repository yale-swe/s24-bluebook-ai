   "comments": [
    "I did not gain anything by taking this class. This class did not teach anything and the only students that performed well were the ones that already knew the subject before taking the class. I would not recomend this class to anyone because it was a complete waste of time.",
    "I would absolutely not recommend it. If you want to learn modeling, take a modeling class. This material is only useful for people who want lots of theory and don't care about applications.",
    "I would not recommend this class to someone who already has a strong background in Econometrics.",
    "Take it, study it and love it! Alway through questions if you have doubts in class, because that's where sparks come out!",
    "I would only recommend this course if somebody is really and only interested in linear regression and not in econometrics in general.",
    "Covers the technical details of the basics of econometrics to good depth. Useful since it helps you better understand what is going on when regressions are being carried out.",
    "Yes, I would recommend it to an IDE student.",
    "I don't recommend this course for those who learned econometrics before because most of the material was covered in the undergrad econometrics.",
    "require course for IDE students",
    "I would warn that this is not a course to take if you are solely interested in Stata applications of econometrics and that the emphasis is heavily on the underlying theory and equations that are implemented in Stata. I still think this is helpful to know, especially in terms of the applied thinking problem sets and exam questions which involved determining how variables would change by modifying the data set.",
    "It depends on their interests, it's an introductory course.",
    "This class is a good introduction to econometrics and a very applied course.",
    "Excellent graduate overview of econometrics.",
    "It's a pretty intense and theoretical econometrics course. We did not use any software to actually do analyses. Nonetheless, I learned a lot and would definitely recommend it.",
    "I would recommend students who have never done econometrics yet having some statistics or other stat related classes.",
    "It is a very good course for learning how to understand and interpret econometric assessments which are very commonly seen in research and academic papers.",
    "I would recommend this course but complemented with some applied STATA work.",
    "Econ 558 is a course that gives an overview of the econometrics involved in policy analysis. Most of the examples in the course are focused on development and it considers mainly cross-sectional data analysis. I would recommend it if you do not have a very strong background in this type of econometrics yet. If you do, or if you are more interested in time series analysis, this course may not be that helpful.",
    "A pretty tough introduction to econometrics. Gives you enough of the mathematics to understand\/read econometrics textbooks and gives some intuitive undersatnding of linear regression(and its weaknesses)"

   "question_text": "How did this course deepen your knowledge of your discipline\/profession? To what extent did this course contribute to your dissertation\/research?",
   "comments": [
    "Not really unfortunately.",
    "I learned some very theoretical stuff about projection matrices, for example, but I doubt any employer will ever ask me about this topic.",
    "Though I had already seen a lot of the things we saw in class, I regret very much that the pace wasn't much higher.It did help me have a better grasp on everything, but it would have been much more profitable had we seen all the material as suggested in the outline. I was bored more than once in class...",
    "I just wish we can finished everything we planned to cover in the beginning of the course. But that's a very minor thing.",
    "Yes. The knowledge learnt was useful even in other courses I've taken this semester. It will definitely come in handy in the future.",
    "I think the course presented a range of basic tools in econometrics to students with a poor background in econometrics, and to that extent I think the professor did a great job of ensuring that each student at least reached a basic, solid understanding of econometrics. However, for the purposes of future work\/studies, I personally would have preferred a slightly faster pace that would have allowed for treatment of more advanced econometric techniques. A faster pace would also have allowed slightly slower treatment of material towards the end of the course, which was (in my opinion) the most interesting and useful of the course.",
    "As I conduct my literature review for my master's thesis and am reading through valuation methods, I am beginning to find more literature related to the topics discussed in class and feel that I have a better understanding of it than I did before taking the course.",
    "This class helped me to develop analytical skill. I really appreciate the class.",
    "As most of the cohort are only taking one econometrics class, more of a focus on applied econometrics and preparation for STATA use may have been helpful.",
    "This course helped me to understand better the concepts that we discussed particularly after the break such as non-stochastic regressors, endogeneity, and instrumental variables. I thinkt these topics were interesting and well taught.However, I would have liked to learn more about other topics such as binary response models, simultaneous equations, as well as topics in time series and panel data. I understand that you cannot cover all topics in one course, however."
