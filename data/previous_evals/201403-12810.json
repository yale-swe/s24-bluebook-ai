   "comments": [
    "Historical Linguistics is the study of language change over time. If that sounds interesting to you, take it! The class is structured well, covers a lot of material without an excessive workload, and Professor Deo is a good teacher. If you've taken prior linguistics classes, this one should be fairly easy. People who didn't have experience with the IPA (international phonetic alphabet) and related ling concepts had a harder time. Keep this in mind when shopping!",
    "I probably wouldn't recommend LING 112 to another student (especially a non ling major), but I certainly wouldn't recommend against it, either. I would warn people not to take it if they haven't at least taken Intro Ling.",
    "This is a class that looks at types of language change and why they occur. At times it was really interesting, but sometimes the material felt boring and irrelevant. There was not very much work, just 7 psets, a midterm and a final research paper on a topic of our choosing. For those of you with no linguistics experience, think hard about whether you will be willing to put in extra time to learn the concepts that some people with linguistic experience will already be familiar with. Professor Deo is really nice and fun though!",
    "I would summarize it as a course focusing on the processes and mechanisms that cause languages to change over time. I would not recommend it.",
    "I would recommend this to any student looking to take their first linguistics class. I would, however, warn them that it can be very difficult to initially get used to the subject, and that from the beginning the material covered in the reading and homework is quite intense. If you stick it out, you may surprise yourself with how good a command you develop of the fundamentals of linguistics.",
    "Historical Linguistics is a great class. Neat, broad-spectrum material, a good textbook, lots of examples, and great professors (I had Prof. Deo) - but do try to take Intro Linguistics first, or really understand how phonology and allophones and the like work before you step into the classroom. It'll be incredibly helpful and it'll save you a lot of the struggle in the first month.",
    "I would recommend this class only to students who already had an interest in and a basic knowledge of linguistics. The class is about language change, and the class name \"historical linguistics\" can be a little misleading if it leads people to expect the incorporation of history into the class. It's specifically about language change.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student with that caveat that without linguistics experience it would be somewhat difficult\/take some extra work (though it is not impossible to do fine without background). However, I did find the material really interesting and overall enjoyed the class.",
    "Ling 112 is a good course to fulfill a writing or humanities requirement while covering interesting material across a variety of fields of linguistics. The overall thread is language change, but this is studied in turn through the lens of phonetics, phonology, morphology, syntax, and semantics. Professor Deo is very engaging and eager to answer questions in class. The class does not presuppose any linguistics background but will also not be a bore to someone who has taken a few classes in the subject already.",
    "This was a really interesting class. I have never taken a linguistics class before and I learnt a lot. However, despite the description of the course stating that no previous linguistics experience is required, I disagree with this. There were some in the class who were even linguistics majors - I felt I either could not contribute to the class, or my contributions were inferior to what they had to say. I also struggled to understand some of the material the class covered. Nevertheless, I kept up with the readings and sought help where I could and therefore was able to understand the material, and really enjoyed learning so many new concepts. I really liked how we were able to cover such a variety of material in the linguistics field. The assignments are very reasonable! They are fun to complete, and the TF is fantastic. The research paper at the end of the semester is really interesting."
