    "YES! The teacher is a living-legend!",
    "First of all, just let me say that it's very important to separate out the COURSE from the PROFESSOR.Frame is the best of the best of the best. There is no one like him (not even close) in the Math Dept, and I'm pretty sure all around Yale as well. He adores teaching, loves the contact with students, puts all the effort he has after his chemo into class time, has really good patience, and is the epitome of a professor. Funny and has his quirky ways, and overall a really really good professor. He can get pretty inspirational when he talks about life and goals in general. I swear I shed tears during the last class, when he encouraged us about just doing what we love in life and all that good stuff. It's sad that his time left at Yale is getting shorter as I write. Definitely take a class with Frame and get to know him; he's awesome.However, the class, MATH 116, was a miss. The material, at least to me, was pretty boring. I spent most of the semester (even now) not knowing what the hell was going on, and none of the biological applications made any sense. I'm sure Frame has good intentions in teaching it to us, but most people in the class just don't know enough math or have the intuition required to really make much out of what he's teaching. It's a really good idea and substantial effort for the course, but it was just not my thing and I kind of started to hate it sometime past the midterm. That being said, however, other people in the class enjoyed it a lot, and Frame is truly a joy to be around. Try it out, and take another class alongside it so you don't end up with too little credits if you don't like 116.Once again. 116 sucked. Frame is the complete, polar opposite.",
    "I would definitely recommend the course. Bio-systems are a great way to approach calculus and make the class pertinent and gives a good starting point for anyone interested in mathematical models.",
    "Overall, I would say that it is often difficult to relate the content of this class to math in previous classes or the overall realm of calculus. If you are planning on taking Math 120 after this course, it might be difficult due to the fact that Math 116 appears to overlook or skim over certain very important calculus concepts. In the end, it comes down to what you are looking for in a math class. If you love inspirational professors, value people who offer life wisdom, and are less concerned with conceptually understanding the course material, I would definitely recommend this class. I cannot stress enough how amazing Professor Frame is, and the striking ability he has to offer golden advice on life that allows you to appreciate fully what it means to be alivein this world and pursue a passion for curiosity's sake.",
    "Amazing class, but I heard that Professor Frame might not be teaching it anymore. Frame is an awesome instructor.",
    "A great class if you don't want to do 115 but don't necessarily want to do 120 yet. I would recommend it to all those who fall into this category. Unfortunately, Michael Frame won't be teaching it anymore so don't know how the course will change in the future.",
    "Great alternative to Math 115, which I is not taught very well (lots of grad students who don't have much experience teaching and have thick accents). The main benefit of Math 116 is that it is taught by Michael Frame, who is a kind, clear, and inspiring teacher. The class is very low-stress and straightforward. One midterm and one final exam. Prof Frame writes everything you need to know on the board, you copy it down, work through the psets, and go to office hours if you don't understand. Seriously, go to office hours--it will make your life so much easier. There are no surprises.My only complaint is that some of the \"biological applications\" material seemed a little obscure and I'm not sure when I will use it again. I would have liked more biomedical applications (for example drug dosages, virus populations, etc.)Overall, if you are premed and need a term of calc do this instead of 115!",
    "Math 116 was different than the typical introductory math experience. We applied equations to real life situations in some lessons and it was very interesting, but sometimes more difficult to follow. I now have a new perspective. This class made me more excited to actually use math and not just memorize equations. The topics covered are like a buffet... there's a little bit of everything!!",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. It's calculus with more relevant applications to biology. I would definitely recommend this class over Math 115. Math 116 is a low-stress way to learn the material and appreciate it.",
    "I would highly recommend this class to another student. It makes calculus more engaging and interesting, and everyone should experience having Professor Frame as a teacher.",
    "Math 116 is a class focused on integral calculus that covers a wide array of biological models and mathematical applications. It's a tough class that uses some linear algebra, but if you're premed or a science person the work will make sense. I'd recommend this class to another student, although it might not be the same without Prof. Frame.",
    "Yes. It gives you an appreciation for the power and possibilities of math.",
    "If you think you need to take Math 115, take this course instead. It enables you to get to MATH120, and generally covers the same concepts as regular MATH115. However, this course provides a fascinating look at the way mathematical models are applied in the context of biological systems, such as population modeling, disease transmission and cardiac rhythms. But the bottom line is this: if it is taught by Michael Frame, take it without question. Prof. Frame is literally the best math teacher I have ever had. He explained everything clearly and kindly and has substantial office hours throughout the week. His enthusiasm is infectious, and the book that he wrote for this course is provided free online, so it is all integrated very well. The workload is very manageable, with a problem set due every week and a midterm and final. Once again, if you feel like you may need Math 115, take this course from Michael Frame.",
    "I think 116 is going to be a better course than 115, and simply to take a class with michael frame would make this worthwhile.",
    "One of the best classes I have taken at Yale. The material is organized and interesting. It's a really good alternative to 120, you learn a good mix of calculus you learned in high school and new material.",
    "MUST TAKE CLASS",
    "I would recommend it. Content taught in class was very reasonable, and was taught in a way that your own notes on lecture content became a useful guide to the course. The course textbook was mostly comprehensive and put together concisely and thoughtfully. Professor Frame was an invaluable resource for when you were stuck on a problem set question or had a question about class material\/concepts. A way this class could be better: if it were at 10:30 or 11 instead of 9! If only.",
    "Math for Pre-Med. \"115 without the useless stuff\"",
    "Take this class if you need a calculus course and want to see it applied in the biological sciences. It was a pretty good class.",
    "I really recommend it. It was fascinating and awesome.",
    "This math class was really difficult (and competitive) to me, but it's one of those classes that you're glad you took at the end of the semester. It leaves you with such a sense of accomplishment and contentment. My favorite part of the class was by far the professor, though. Michael Frame is an absolutely incredible human being. I am so thankful that I was able to take this class taught by him. His words are inspiring, and his immense passion for his work and life pursuit leaves me speechless. I'm forever grateful for him, and I just hope that future students can have the same experience with him.",
    "I would recommend it to a student, as long as they understand that the course name is a bit misleading. As long as they are prepared to work hard to learn math that a lot of people don't know (and therefore can't help you with), it will be a very enjoyable class with a great professor. I would also recommend it to a student who wants to learn material beyond BC Calc but doesn't want to start multivariable calc yet.",
    "Yes, if you can take it with Michael Frame. He is a phenomenal and awe-inspiring professor who wrote the course notes for the course, so he really knows what he's talking about. Granted, it was a difficult class with concepts beyond the Calc II that is expected, but by test time it is very fair (also the tests are open-book, which is very nice). There is more than adequate preparation for the tests, but you take this class because Michael Frame is teaching it. He may or may not be teaching it again next semester, but if he does, definitely take it. From what I hear from my friends in MATH 115, this is the much much better alternative, and it counts for credit \/ pre-med \/ whatever.",
    "Definitely. I hope Professor Frame is around to teach this class. For me, I had a deep interest in both math and biology. This class was perfect for me. There is a lot of interesting topics that get covered: chaos theory, cardiac and neural dynamics, and population models for the most part. This class is for visual learners, for those who want challenging psets, for those who have a passion in the subject. If you don't pay attention in class or really try to get a grasp on the material, you won't be able to appreciate the enormity of what is being taught.",
    "If you are a pre-med student, take this over 115. It is a better class all around.",
    "I would recommend this course to someone who's looking to challenge themselves beyond 115 and learn concepts with interesting applications. This class is different from anything I'd ever seen before and the first unit was especially surprising but Professor Frame and the tutors do their best to make the concepts accessible.",
    "Math 116 was an interesting look at many medical applications of calculus. Beware that the material covered is much different from 115.",
    "Take this class! (you won't regret it)",
    "I would say that it is a difficult yet doable calculus course. The midterm and final were open note, but this did not mean that they were easy, it just removed monotonous memorizing from the studying. If you are looking for a science based math course, then I would definitely recommend this course.",
    "I'd say that Math 116 was like a math 115 but it involved bioscience models. I would recommend the class for someone interested in the biosciences because its really interesting to see how math is involved in biology.",
    "Yes especially if you need a fulfill a math requirement for pre-med"
