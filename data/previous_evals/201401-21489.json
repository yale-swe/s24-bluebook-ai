   "comments": [
    "Very general overview of evolutionary biology. Straightforward combination of micro- and macroevolution. Taught by great professors, although I loved Prof. Turner so much more than Prof. Near. TAs were helpful, too. Only cons: testing was easy at the beginning and hard at the end, grading was never really explained, and section readings can seem disjointed from what we learn in lecture.",
    "If you're EEB, you probably have to take this. That being said, it's a good overview of evolutionary bio, and both professors (Prof Near and Prof Turner) are good lecturers. It's kind of odd sometimes switching between lecture styles\/broad topics between weeks, but it's kind of necessary to cover both macro and micro concepts over the course of the semester, since there's so much to evolutionary biology.",
    "This class isn't too much work. Most of the work I did was preparation for the midterms and the term paper. Both Professor Near and Professor Turner use examples out of the book so the readings do help with the class. While some of our midterms were ridiculously long, the questions themselves were not that hard to answer. Overall, I'd say this is a fair class with interesting material.",
    "It's definitely a good overview of evolutionary biology (as the name would suggest) but as I took it only to fulfill a requirement, I would caution to take it only as such or if you had a strong interest in the subject.",
    "E&EB 225 is a great class. It requires adjusting to varying teaching styles due to the professors switching every few lectures, but each one\u2019s material is interesting. The workload is lighter than some other Yale science courses. The teachers are both exceptional and experts in their fields. Definitely take this class, even if it isn't one of your requirements.",
    "I really enjoyed this course. Professor Turner and Near were both good and clear lecturers, and I think the class will get better as they better figure out how to switch off and coordinate together. The three midterms were harder and graded more harshly than I expected, but definitely fair and do-able. There's a final research paper instead of a final exam, which you should start early on. Definitely recommend the class!",
    "A necessary course in the basics of evolutionary biology. Well-taught if somewhat basic; you'll learn quite a lot.",
    "This class needs some serious revamping to make it more cohesive and meaningful. However, if they put the effort, only put one professor instead of two, and focus on quality not quantity of information it could be a really awesome class.",
    "I would recommend this course to any one interested in Evolutionary Biology. If you're in E&EB, you may, depending on track, be required to take it, but it's absolutely worthwhile. Both professors give strong lectures and are very approachable and enthusiastic. The TFs were good, and the textbook was also surprisingly readable, if a bit over-detailed. And the workload is pretty low - no p-sets, three exams, and a final paper that doesn't count for much. Since it only meets twice a week, lecture material can be pretty crammed in and come at a fast pace, and the exams can be difficult, but it's generally a positive experience, and one that I'd really recommend to science and non-science majors alike."
