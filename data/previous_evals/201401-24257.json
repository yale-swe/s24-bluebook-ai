    "Relax course in which you pick a subject and photograph it for 10 weeks.",
    "Yes! Great introduction to look at photography from the social documentary perspective",
    "This class was pretty awesome-- different than most other classes and even other seminars at Yale. It was also pretty chill for the most part. It's very project oriented and you spend a lot of time working independently on a topic of choice. Projects can't be Yale related, so it's a good chance to get out in New Haven and discover something new. You don't learn all that much technical stuff about photography but you talk a lot about ethics and telling a story and creating interesting shots.",
    "If you go to Yale and haven't already engaged with the city, you need to take this course. You will learn about the city and some of its inhabitants and learn there to more to life than your life as a Yale student.",

    "This class gives you back what you put into it. You pick a topic, and each week, you bring in photos to select from, give\/listen to a presentation on a photojournalist, discuss the readings, and talk to Lori about her experiences. Our class projects ranged from abandoned buildings to a troubled teen to a dance company. It is a very practical class, and you have to be committed to going out and shooting every week. Lori is very invested in her students' work, but I found the lack of evaluation frustrating. I never knew where I stood with her. I liked the photographs I came out of the class with, but it was a lot of work. We were always running out of time. Also, everyone was relatively adept with a camera, and I have no idea how we could have gotten through everything if we had to spend time learning basic technique.",
    "This course is a fun introduction to, or opportunity to hone further, one's skills in documentary photography. All photographers from amateurs to near professionals can take a lot away from this course. The premise of this course is to document a local, non-Yale subject through the lens of photography. The course mission lends to a wide variety of topics and experiences, which is a valuable learning opportunity in and of itself. Professor Grinker, a professional photographer with a lot of skill and practice, offers guidance and firm instruction on how to improve one's photography and creativity. In-class discussions serve a similar purpose. When coupled with readings about the lives of documentarians, the opportunities to photograph a subject in New Haven for an entire semester, parse down ten or a dozen great shots from thousands of photos for an exhibition, and learn from a skilled professional photographer and one's classmates makes this course worth taking."
