    "I would definitely recommend this class. The guest lecturers are amazing, and the material is very interesting. The averages are really high, so it's hard to really ace a test, but the material is so interesting that I don't think it matters.",
    "It is a good look into the biology of reproduction in humans and I would recommend it.",
    "This was a pretty goodcourse. I think it started off rather slow. Some of the early lectures weren't quite as engaging. However once familiar with some of the more basic terms and systems, the class was more interesting. It was refreshing to have different lecturers who were each experts in their field. The only problem with that was the difference in pace and the fact that they did not always know what background we had in the topic. At times, this led to too much review or not enough explanation.That being said, I'm not a bio major and took this class for premed requirements. I would have taken it regardless to avoid taking other classes that were more stress intensive. The material is pretty interesting as long as you don't start thinking about what could happen to you.",
    "It's an extremely relevant class. I recommend it to any bio majors who need an elective. However, for any woman who wants to pursue a career in the sciences or in medicine, as most of the females who want to take this course probably do, this course can be pretty disheartening. You'll learn comforting facts like: your biological clock is ticking, you must have a child before 35 if you don't want a child with Down, if you never do have children, you run a greater risk of having breast cancer, etc. Basically, this class will teach you alot, if not just to run out now and have babies.",
    "Depends on the lecture. Some were absolutely horrendous, others were great and educational. Hard too, if you're not used to bio classes.",
    "Interesting class. Premeds make grading a bitch. Rotating professors are hit or miss.",
    "The material is interesting, but there was surprisingly little (maybe 1 whole lecture) about the crucial events thatoccur between the blastocyst stage of an embryo and becoming a mature fetus.There are almost as many lecturers as there are lectures, so don't expect the lectures to fit in perfectly with each other, and don't expect the lecturers to know exactly what you have and haven't been taught from other lectures.The three midterms were multiple choice and short answer, and were very straightforward.",
    "yes, but not as easy as people say.",
    "MCDB 240 is a pretty good class about reproductive biology. Almost every lecture is given by a different professor, generally from the medical school, so it is a bit hit-or-miss in terms of quality. They are all passionate about their topic and work and this shows, but of course not all lecturers are equal. Take good notes - I found that using a computer is actually the easiest method for me. The textbook also seems a bit useless for the class, since exams seem solely from the lectures. I'd recommend the class with some hesitance: if you look the topic a lot as I do (I'm a history major, possibly pre-med), then you should take it, but it's not quite the easy science credit in terms of the curve, as you may believe it to be.",
    "one of the better bio courses i've taken. but definitely less of a joke\/gut than i had been led to believe.",
    "yes, if you are interested in topics in reproductive biology",
    "This class has minimal work during the course of the year (other than intense work studying right before each of the 3 exams), and is pretty interesting and covers a very interesting topic (reproductive biology). but (and seriously, listen to me when I say this) it is NOT a gut class in that you cannot expect to do little work and get an A. In fact, because of the many pre-meds in the class who pull the average up, you probably won't get an A (unless you are one of them). And though the material isn't difficult like organic chemistry for example, you will definitely be tested on and expected to know enough material that this doesn't qualify as a gut class.So to summarize: easy (kinda --workload is light other than exams, but the material isn't a cakewalk); interesting (definitely, if reproductive biology interests you, and if it doesn't you really shouldn't take the class), high grades (nope...you'll be in aclass with pre-meds who are using it as their relatively easy science credit, so to do above average you'll need to really know your stuff). If you are pre-med though, this class shouldn't be a problem for you.",
    "I would recommend it if you find the subject matter interesting and you're good at memorization.",
    "The class is not as easy as some evaluations make it seem. You still have to be engaged with the material and study hard. Some test questions are completely arbitrary, but hopefully your TA will help direct you towards the right material to study.",
    "Totally recommend it if you want a science credit that's not too demanding. Definitely a lot of memorization in the days leading up to the exam but then again it could be worse. A lot of the info is easy to grasp.",
    "Go to class, pay attention and take notes. Don't do the reading.",
    "This is a bio class with easy information but a difficult delivery system. It's nice to hear from experts in each specialty, but it makes class disjointed and studying for tests difficult.",
    "It's a great intro to reproductive biology. I am a non-science major and I found it really interesting and not too difficult. The tests, however, are very poorly worded and can lead to some confusion. Because the tests are not written by the professors who lecture, there can be some disconnect which makes them hard. All in all really interesting topic, and for the most part the lecturers were really good. Oh and little reading (optional).",
    "It's an interesting class if you're interested in learning about reproductive sciences and current research. Don't expect to go in too much detail about any of it though, as this class is also designed for people without science backgrounds. The tests seem simple, but some questions are very nit-picky in an effort to create an artificial curve.",
    "You learn a lot of interesting information but the course is disorganized.",
    "I would definitely recommend MCDB 240. Some of the most interesting material was during the pregnancy\/immunology of pregnancy lectures. Just realizing how much of a parasite the fetus is makes me a little nicer to my mother (but just a little). Be warned, though: Repro Bio is not the easy class you're hoping for. I came into this expecting the class to be pretty easy, but after taking the exams (which have some pretty trick questions), I realized that you've got to respect this class, which means study the slides, go to review sessions, and read the book.",
    "Great biology class - very interesting, doesn't take over your life (which is refreshing), and overall a rewarding experience.",
    "Reproductive Biology is the best biology course I have taken so far at Yale. I really enjoyed its applications to medicine and I feel like I will remember much more of what I learned in this class than I am used to remembering from my other science classes. It is also definitely easier than Cell Bio for example (and probably even than MCDB120), and it is the only biology class I have taken at Yale and not fallen asleep during. To do well, you just have to study but not ridiculous amounts like for some other science courses.There is also no assigned reading and no final (3 noncumulative midterms). There is no reason to buy the textbook. I bought a used copy for $10 and never opened it. The only things on the tests are what is said in lecture.",
    "This isn't a bad bio class to take, but I think there are better ones to take if you're a biology major. The three exams aren't too bad either as long as you study for them.",
    "Great course for non-science majors who don't want a gut. Tests are picky, so know all the details. Not much work.",
    "One of the most interesting MCDB courses offered, and a relatively easy one at that. Of course, you'll still have to study, but the exams are a lot like high school biology exams--a lot of memorization and random facts to know.",
    "interesting - definitely take it. Best science class i've taken at yale and I'm a premed.",
    "I would take this class again. It is fairly interesting, and not terribly stressful. Also, the fact that there is no final exam is a big plus. Great for a second bio class if you are pre-med.",
    "MCDB 240 is a broad overview of reproductive biology. The course should be quite accessible to anyone with some biology background (even if it's just AP in high school). A dozen or so lecturers teach the class over the semester, so there's a lot of variety.",
    "Definitely take this class! You learn a lot, and it's very enjoyable.",
    "This class is very interesting and also not a lot of work. There are only three exams and no final. Exams are based only on lectures, not on readings. There is a different lecturer almost every time. Most of them are really good. A few are not, but you only have to have them once. Most of the lecturers are doctors from the med school and it is really interesting to get to hear them talk about their experiences and encounters with patients.",
    "",
    "Great class. No work, interesting subject-matter, good lecturers (every once in awhile, you'll get a terrible one), three midterms based completely off the powerpoint slides (and no final), no section (but at least one\/two helpful TAs), 10:30am, not too far away...I learned a lot and probably only went to 4\/5 of the lectures. This was the first Bio class I took here, and it wasn't stressful at all.",
    "Yes it was fine.",
    "This is a great class! Although some people wont like the use of guest lecturers every week, it's pretty cool when you get to have someone from the medical school come in and talk about their specialty.",
    "I loved this class-the subject matter was almost always interesting since it is pretty relevant. The workload was not too heavy at all, most of the time spent goes into studying like mad the days leading up to the midterms. There are good and bad lecturers, but overall I would rate them all pretty highly. I would definitely recommend this course to anyone looking for a good bio class, especially if you have a tough courseload.",
    "It's a very good overview of anything and everything related to reproduction, and almost every lecture is given by a different guest lecturer. The lecturers can be crazy and really funny, which made class interesting, and there was no section (or just an optional one) which was awesome. The tests are multiple choice and very fair, as they come ONLY from what was presented in lecture (the book was said to be optional and just a reference), but they were VERY specific. They'd ask about the most minute details of everything, and as it's multiple choice all points are all or nothing. Overall, I liked it.",
    "it can be a very interesting course if you're really into the biology of reproduction.it's not only a class about babies being born and bodily changes. it involves signaling, STI's, sexual dysfunction, etc. a conglomerate of topics.at times it felt kind of random and disjointed. and it was hard to study for the tests because there was so much material and you didn't know which to focus on.",
    "Solid Bio credit for senior year. Never went to class, studied the night (maybe 2 nights) before, and did fine (I guess I'll find out in a few seconds). Interesting material, fair tests.",
    "This was an amazing course! You learn so much about the human body and reproduction. It is a course you MUST take before you graduate from Yale. Also, it's really nice because different professors (from the OB\/GYN at Yale Med, MCDB, and EEB departments) teach different lectures. The exams are fair as long as you put time and effort into studying (and if you go to class).",
    "Sure, take it. No homework, no mandatory section, and no final. Why not?",
    "Yes--take it as a science during a hard semester. The class isn't too hard, but beware that the averages of the tests are ridiculously high.",
    "Very interesting topics. Very much enjoyed the rotation of lecturers although some of them were better than other and had better slides to study from. TA review sessions were quite poor because the TA 's were not on top of their stuff.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. Definitely very straightforward but very interesting!",
    "I would recommend the class if you're looking for a 5th class or an easier semester.",
    "Repro Bio is a pretty easy course, but very interesting none the less. There's not much work - just show up for lectures and take three multiple choice midterms (no final). The rotating lecturers can sometimes be a pain and make the course seem disjointed. The lecturers are quite hit or miss themselves. You'll enjoy studying this material - take the class if you want to learn about human reproduction, not for the teaching style.",
    "good bio course. very interesting and no final.",
    "Klein CANNOT justify making the test questions \"tricky\" just so it would be harder. This is the stupidest reason I've ever heard. Students should be tested on WHAT THEY KNOW, not whether they can decipher what the question really is asking. Also, they need to update the tests to match the current lectures because oftentimes there are questions that have no relation to what we are learning. Lazyass.",
    "If you really like the topic take this class. However, if you don't do well on multiple choice, short answer, true\/false questions, you might want to think about it. The exams are really nit-picky and it was frustrating at times because I found myself genuinely interested in the topic, bu feeling frustrated with how my knowledge was being tested. For me personally (I'm a girl btdubs), because of this class, this has made me consider possibly going into OBGYN someday, so that says something to the lectures themselves (for most of them anyways).",
    "It was a great class. There are three exams, which are all multiple choice and fill in the blank, and they were fair. The class felt more related to medicine than the other biology classes I've taken at Yale.",
    "Ugh, I don't know. It was very focused on the \"Life is a war between the sexes!!!1!!\" point of view which maybe was okay but I wish they could have at least acknowledged that there are other interpretations - because this was not just science (which was quite interesting to learn), but science presented with a very specific perspective which was very strong throughout the course but nevertheless went completely unacknowledged. It was depressing. So if you're interested in the topic, I'd almost recommend reading up on it on your own, rather than taking this course. Oh, and the exams were bizarrely nitpicky and often picked one lecture to focus on, seemingly arbitrarily. If you must take it, take it Cr\/D because although it's not particularly complex information compared to a lot of science classes, the stupidity of how the exams are written gives it great potential to fuck up your GPA.",
    "It's an okay class. The tests are fair, and the material is not very difficult. It could use some major streamlining, as most of the lectures are repetitive or confusing, and it's filled with freshmen who study way too much and swarm the professors at the end of each class to chirp at them, but it's not overly painful.NO FINAL--just 3 midterms.",
    "Take it if you're into rote memorization for a class.",
    "I would recommend this class for a good overview course in reproductive biology.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS. You won't regret it.",
    "Take this class if you enjoy bio. Also take it ifyou would like to learn some of the material for the MCAT in a lot more detail than is necessary. The work is not overly difficult and it is one of those classes where your grade reflects the work that you put into the class. The lecture slides are all online, so as long as you study, you'll be fine.",
    "Definitely a worthwhile bio class to take.",
    "Take it. The most interesting and the least amount of work of all bio classes.",
    "It's a biology class that focuses on reproduction, but not in a facetious way, which is nice, for a change. The difficulty level is not too high, but the exams are challenging enough, and you come out of the class feeling like you learned something as opposed to nothing. I would recommend it to a student like myself who is trying to be pre-med but whose classes for their major (i.e. physics) are constantly scheduled at the same time as other bio classes.",
    "I took this class as a non-science major and thought it was great and not too difficult. If you want to take a legit science class this is a good one to take that won't hurt your GPA. The material is really interesting and the multiplicity of professors from the med-school let me learn a lot.",
    "I would not recommend this course. You don't learn very much and there are much better bio courses at Yale. Additionally, your whole grade is determined by three multiple choice tests. Everyone does really well on the tests, so you have to do really, really well to beat the curve, and that's hard to do when the material is not engaging and it's easy to stop paying attention in lectures. Take another bio course.",
    "This is a good bio class. YOu have only 3 non-cumulative midterms. They said there was no curve applied to the midterms. You don't need to get the book. I read these comments last year and got the book anyway; I just sold it for $12- what a waste. Everything you will need to know comes from the lecture, so go to lecture.",
    "Good class, first half is difficult but the last half was very interesting...learning about STD, pregnancy, all the fun stuff"
