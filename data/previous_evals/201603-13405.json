   "comments": [
    "I got a background in historical and political thought from Herodotus to Machiavelli.",
    "In Directed Studies Historical and Political Thought, students read works from before the Persian Wars, through the fall of the Roman empire from various sources and viewpoints. Through these readings, students learn how to analyze different interpretations of historical events and political viewpoints. The timespan of history covered can seem overwhelming, but you will be surprised at how much youve actually retained.",
    "This course really improved my writing skills and my ability to organize clear, linear arguments. It also exposed me to political theory and ideas of government.",
    "Throughout the course I garnered skills involve deep thinking through the modes of writing and discussion.",
    "Read and analyzed significant works in history and political thought from the western canon; discussed and inquired works in class with peers and instructor; improved paper writing skills",
    "I became familiar with Greek and Roman histories - Herodotus, Thucydides, Tacitus, etc. - and writings in political science by Aquinas, Aristotle, Machiavelli, and others.",
    "Critical reasoning, writing skills.",
    "I gained an understanding of how to analyze historical records and systems of political thought in the context of statecraft, as well as a better ability to write essays, participate in discussions and manage a large workload.",
    "The DS Historical and Political Thought course taught me to observe patterns of thinking across historical and political writers, and study historical events in their appropriate context."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "It wasn't always clear to me exactly how each work connected thematically to the class until one of the lecturers framed a series of questions like \"What is the baggage of the past on the present? What is the weight of tradition, custom and social norms on society?\" that helped me connected the dots between often disparate works. It might help to get a better background thematically on the class before we jump in since we read works on such varied subjects. I think the blog posts helped me organize my thoughts before class, although I didn't enjoy them that much. Class discussions weren't always super interesting, but I don't know how we would fix that and it may have been a product of the specific group of people in the seminar not meshing together super well. Paper feedback was excellent for the first paper when we met to discuss, but on later papers the feedback was pretty minimal. I think I could have requested a meeting to talk about my papers with Professor Oskian, but I think it would help to get some written feedback as well.",
    "The strengths of this course are that students get a broad overview of Greek and Roman history along with accompanying political theory. Compared to other courses in Directed Studies, the pace of H&P doesnt seem to be quite as rushed. You cover a similar amount of material, but it seems much less rushed. One weakness of the course is that the directive of the semester doesnt seem clear, particularly at the beginning of the class. Many students, myself included, werent quite sure what the aim of the course was, and how our papers should be written in accordance with that. By the last half of the semester however, I feel that that issue was resolved.",
    "The discussions were really interesting and Professor Oskian always provided extra information and guided us through the old texts. I think the course could have benefited from more varied classes--we had debates a couple of times, and it was a different and very helpful way to learn the material, instead of just having discussions.",
    "H\/P is not the most exciting DS course this fall. The reading is too long so in discussion we often only focus on some specific paragraphs and pages. I'm not sure what difference it makes if I finish all the reading, which nobody does.",
    "The strength of the course is how it introduces to students a new way of thinking. A weakness would be the amount time spent per reading -- seems to be prioritizing breadth over depth.",
    "Very accessible professors, one on one help with papers and class activities, strong discussions and great teaching. Very few weaknesses; only difficulty was spending so little time on such significant works and not having enough time to discuss each sufficiently.",
    "The strengths are a lot of readings which make one very comfortable with the material. The weaknesses are that sometimes, the readings are too voluminous to be comprehended in detail.",
    "Strengths included the level of intensity with which we tackled the works we read. Weaknesses I believe included the structure of discussions, which at times seemed to not follow a coherent path.",
    "The strengths of this course are that it exposes freshmen to both lectures and smaller discussion sections, the workload is well-distributed, and the curriculum provides a good introduction to western historical and political thought."

   "comments": [
    "Yes! I love the reading and Directed Studies as a whole is so worth it.",
    "I would recommend this course. Prof. Oskian is smart, helpful, and generally engaging.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class, especially with Professor Oskian. Directed Studies, despite its flaws, is a unique experience that is immensely valuable. In this course, you will learn to appreciate the western cannon, and grow as a writer. Many students have not had much exposure in writing essays that would fit under historical and political thought, but by the end of the semester, most, if not all, students had a good grasp on this process. The work in Directed Studies is manageable and the pay-off is huge. In short, take this class and take it with Professor Oskian if you can.",
    "I recommend DS H\/P! It's only in the reading period when everything came together and I realized how much I had learned. The relationship between each historian is far less obvious than in the two other classes. But it's really rewarding when I looked at the material again after the class ended.",
    "Most definitely, if anyone is interested in taking Directed Studies.",
    "This course is an excellent introduction to some extremely significant works of history and political philosophy. This course allowed me to explore an area I am now strongly considering for a major. The instructors sincerely care about your wellbeing in this class and work with you indidvually in order to improve your essays and class participation. Overall such a positive experience and a truly unique Yale offering.",
    "Yes, it is a good and rigorous course in early historical and political thought.",
    "Yes",
    "Yes, I would recommend this class. It was a great introduction to political thought of the Western world.",
    "Yes; it is an excellent course that builds solid critical reading and writing skills and provides a framework with which to understand and evaluate western historical and political thought."
