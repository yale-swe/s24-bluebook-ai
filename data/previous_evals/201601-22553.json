   "comments": [
    "PATH 650 provided an introduction to the current topics in the field of cancer biology, with lectures from leaders in the field. I would recommend this class to other students because it provides students with the general knowledge they need to pursue research in cancer biology.",
    "My favorite class at Yale so far. I would recommend it to anyone in the BBS program, and think it is essential for anyone in a cancer research lab.",
    "Highly Recommend",
    "Give you a basic understanding of cancer and updated information.",
    "Yes I would recommend it. This is a very helpful class and very practical. It really gives you an update on the current field of cancer. It is not something you can get out of reading a textbook.",
    "A deep dive into the biology of cancers. Lots of reading, but course is accessible even if you listen just to the lectures.",
    "A good survey course in cancer biology",
    "A good first pass at cancer biology. You take out as much as you put into this class, and if you just want the basics you'll definitely walk away with those. If you want more detail, there is plenty of additional reading material and papers to gain a deeper understanding of the field",
    "The Biology of Cancer course is an excellent overview of the current questions and topics related to understanding and treating cancer. This course should be mandatory for any student wishing to conduct cancer research at Yale. It provided a historical perspective of cancer biology, a deeper understanding of the challenges facing cancer treatment, and an introduction to the Yale experts in each cancer subtopic."

   "comments": [
    "This course reinforced some of my previous knowledge about cancer biology and introduced me to new concepts that will help me throughout my research and into the future.",
    "I learned so much more about the broad sub-categories of cancer research. It also reinforced my knowledge of the parts of cancer that I do know and understand. It will certainly help my research\/dissertation, by providing me with a more in-depth understanding of cancer.",
    "My thesis is on cancer, and this give me a broad range of knowledge on cancer topics.",
    "Helped me better understand the biology the models I use are trying to learn. Very helpful to gaining an intuition and understanding for results in genomics.",
    "This course helped me understand the current state of basic cancer research while providing a glimpse into how cancer patients are treated in the clinic. This course contributed significantly to my research by revealing the fundamentals of cancer biology as I begin my thesis work on cancer therapeutics."
