   "comments": [
    "Don't take it, there are better history course on about every subject that he briefly talks about.",
    "Definitely take this class, the lecture was very interesting and the books you get to read couldn't be better.",
    "really long readings that you actually have to do since the lectures are a total waste of time",
    "For goodness' sake, please teach some actual events and facts next time! I hoped to learn about military history; instead, I learned about Paul Kennedy's philosophy of warfare. The course was rambling and uncohesive; we'd race through centuries in an hour and then spend half a lecture on air power in the 2006 Lebanon War. The survey and air power components did not hold together, and the readings, while good, were not sufficient to give us background to knowledgeably discuss the topics we were supposed to be studying. Good section, though.",
    "Definitely take it. It fills a gap in the history department and has really interesting material. The readings can get a little overwhelming so maybe start out Cr\/D but it is definitely not a class to miss.",
    "This course is fairly interesting, but definitely not the best. It is a lot of reading, and it's nearly impossible to be proficient in all of the material unless you have prior background. I would highly recommend a background in European history if taking this course. However, the material is interesting, and Professor Kennedy offers great insights.",
    "Great class; actually enjoyable to come to lecture. Not too difficult and yet interesting as well. The midterm and the final were really fair and fairly graded, and the subject of military history is of somewhat universal relevance to today's political climate. Definitely recommend. Alison is a wonderful TF, if you have an option.",
    "would recommend, but do the reading. its essential if you're a non-history major who doesn't know everything already",
    "This course summarizes the course western warfare has taken since 1500. The first half of the course concentrates on land warfare and early naval warfare from 1500 to about 1890. After that there is a much greater emphasis on airpower. Great course - take it, its incredibly interesting",
    "If you're interested in the subject definitely take it.",
    "Take this course! Kennedy gives amazing lectures, take it CR\/D, go to the lectures and read when you can.",
    "Nice class, not graded too harshly, learned some cool stuff, but I feel like I already knew a lot of it from AP Euro in high school. Definitely got some good big concepts out of it though.",
    "Good, very general course of the history of Western militarization and power. It doesn't really go into detail (we did WWI in half a lecture, and WWII in one) which is a pity, but it does cover broadly the trends that the west saw between 1500 and the present that led to it being the forerunner of technology and the colonizers of the world. I'd give it a few years, though, so all of the kinks can be worked out of the course. As it it stands, Kennedy's book was more informative than the lectures, which shouldn't be a thing. In general, I found the readings a necessary addition to the lectures, instead of nice accompaniments, which also shouldn't be a thing.",
    "If you are interested in global affairs, rise and fall of nations, etc, take it! (Grading is tough...)",
    "Certainly take it but don't expect to memorize lots of facts about war. This is not that type of class. It forces you to engage with big ideas and historical themes. The reading is great.",
    "take the class. it is a great survey of western military history and kennedy is good lecturer",
    "No - this course is too new and not well organized yet. Kennedy seems to be dialing it in, which is a shame because he obviously knows a lot about this subject. The first 4 lectures are well organized and strong -- but don't be deceived, there are a lot of guest lecturers in the second half from military colleges who only talk about the airplanes. If you want to learn more about military history, take the classes that focus on each war (Winter, Freeman, Blight, etc.). You will learn a lot more than in this class.",
    "This is a great course! As a senior history major I highly recommend that you take it. It provides the lens of military history and technology to the politics of the western world over the last 500 years.",
    "Yes, amazing lecture by Professor Kennedy and guests.",
    "Lectures can be hard to follow and not very content-rich, but a good class to take to understand key events in military history and how they fit into the very broad themes of the class",
    "This was the first year this class was offered and it sucked. Guest lectures were great, my section was awesome (though obviously this is hit-or-miss), but Kennedy's lectures were terribly boring. I would have liked them when I was an military history buff in fifth grade, but college me wanted something much more fast-paced, nuanced, and interesting.The exams were frankly insulting. \"Was geography responsible for the rise of Europe?\" Seriously? That question is (I think) unanswerable on a philosophical level, but seeing how much bullshit we can spout in an hour demanded neither original ideas nor having gone to or paid attention in lecture or section nor having done any of the reading. I did about 5% of the reading and was fine.The airpower focus was a interesting at times but mostly a distraction. This class is not a discussion of military history or strategy in the way you think about it normally, like learning about cool battles and campaigns or the specific choices made by Napoleon.In fact, I would summarize this class as \"Grand Strategy lite.\" And the answers are: geography and organization. Whatever that means.",
    "Lovely course, you get exactly what you came for. Totally recommended.",
    "Great introduction to the field. Some more modern material on counterinsurgency would be great. The whole focus on air power ruins the latter part of the course.",
    "I try to be as fair in my evaluations as possible, so believe me when I say lectures were just long rants and often missed the big picture. Professor Kennedy is a great writer and kind person. But he is a mediocre, rambling lecturer. 67% final (2 essays), 33% midterm (1 essays). Reading is not so bad, but it's not worth it. I loved my TF, but I go to Yale to learn from professors. And I don't want us to just end up summarizing things in section because certain things that were supposed to be covered in lecture simply weren't.Freshmen, please don't take this class. I'm a junior history major, and there are so many better history classes. Please don't let this experience turn you away from the history major. It was painful.",
    "This is a survey of Western history focusing on warfare and how it was conducted. I would recommend it.",
    "Despite my negativity, there are gems in this course. If military history interests you, you'll probably enjoy it, even if it may not teach you much.",
    "I would recommend it if you are even the slightest bit interested in the topic. A lot of the lessons are really widely applicable and interesting and it's a great survey class of a broad topic.",
    "yes great!",
    "DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS -- it is terribly organized, both in terms of lectures and material.",
    "1) Paul Kennedy is a boss. He definitely started freewheeling the lectures towards the second half of the class. You might be forced to clap at the end of lecture whether the lecture was good or not because PK is PK2) Pick a section that suits you. There's something the military\/fighting\/combat that really gets those section ahs going",
    "It's a great class that covers some really interesting material. Professor Kennedy is awesome and you should definitely take a class of his before you leave Yale. It also isn't that heavy of a workload as long as you keep up with the reading.",
    "I would recommend this class to everyone who is interested in European history and strategy.",
    "Despite being its first year taught, this class will be a Yale classic. Take it.",
    "It was an amazing experience to be able to take one of Kennedy's lectures. The lectures are really interesting but could benefit from more information each lecture. The reading was heavy.. .too heavy. That being said, you don't have to do it all.",
    "The class is great! The lectures are generally very interesting.",
    "Great survey lecture of European history! Pretty easy with only two exams. Kennedy is awesome! Definitely take it.",
    "This course tried to cover too much for a semester, with the first having focusing on 1500 to WWI and the second half on the 20th Century and more of a focus on airpower. Do not take this for the wow factor of Kennedy because his lectures were really broad and less than stellar. There's also a lot of reading from disparate sources each week, so it's hard to focus in on what really matters. Overall this was a decent class in a very interesting subject area underrepresented at Yale, so if you're interested in it then shop it.",
    "This course needs to be reworked and reorganized; the material is far to disconnected, and it is very hard to take away any central themes from the whole term. Despite the attempts of the Professor and teaching assistants, it was difficult to see the continuity of the course through all of the various themes and topics. Lectures, despite Kennedy's charisma and charm, were not altogether interesting or helpful in providing any sort of coherent theses to accompany the reading.Paul Kennedy clearly has an overabundantknowledge of the material, but this course in simply uninteresting without all of that material being somehow systematically incorporated into one or two salient ideas.",
    "Definitely take this class if you want a good grasp of broad themes in history!",
    "Absolutely take it. I'm not a History or Global Affairs major, and I still thoroughly enjoyed the course. Professor Kennedy's knowledge is extensive and impressive. He's in many ways the quintessential Yale professor, and to pass up on a class with him would be a shame. I appreciated the class's emphasis not only on developments in warfare but also on the history and importance of strategic decisions made in the Vasco de Gama era. The workload is very manageable: one midterm comprising of an in class essay and a final which is just 2 essays. The weekly readings are extensive, but you can get away with just doing one of the assigned readings for each lecture, as the readings tend to be repetitive.",
    "I would recommend the class. It is very manageable if you do the reading and pay attention in lecture. The workload is very reasonable for a history course.",
    "Pretty easy class, and Prof. Kennedy just emits gravitas with every word. Col. Manning is an awesome guy, and you should get to know him.",
    "Military History of the West Since 1500 was exceptionally disappointing. I had hoped that, by taking a class with such an interesting description with such a renowned professor, I would have the opportunity to learn quite a bit. However, the class failed on 2 counts.First, the lectures were rambling, confusing, poorly structured, boring and generally uninformative (With the exception of any and all of the guest lectures)Second, the class turned out to be more of \"European History with a vague concentration on War\" than actual \"Military History.\" I didn't learn anything new or particularly interesting throughout the entire course.Don't take it.",
    "The reading list is incredible, and If you have any interest in military history (which Yale typically sidelines), you should absolutely take this course. As all the grading fell to exams, they are fairly high-stakes but not bad at all as long as you prepare. At least for us, Prof. Kennedy was fairly rambling and his points tended to be scattered, but the reading and the guest lectures (from military colleges often) helped more than clarify this. I personally loved this class.",
    "It's hard to get a good read on this course, as this was the first semester it was offered, and Professor Kennedy and his TA staff were inevitably working out some kinks. Professor Kennedy is an amusing speaker full of charming anecdotes, but I wouldn't recommend this course for a freshman or non-history major. It requires you to have a fairly firm grasp on the historical context of this time period going in, the reading is absolutely mandatory, as Professor Kennedy's lectures do not offer a complete picture of the historical narrative, and the midterm\/final format of broad essays lends itself to experienced history majors who know how to structure and execute a coherent and complete final essay of this kind. The grading was more than fair, but be prepared to do a lot of legwork outside of class to understand what is going on over a hugely vast time period (1500-post1945).",
    "Broad overview of western military history since 1500. First half considers major themes in military history up until WWI\/WWII, and the second pays special attention to airpower and present issues in military affairs. The ideas and concepts are intriguing, though much of the most interesting are taught in the first half, whereas the second half is more of a meditation of unanswered questions facing the 21st century. The work is very manageable, Kennedy is a fantastic lecturer, and if you can, get Andrew Crawford as a TA. Highly recommended.",
    "Excellent course. Well organized. gives a broad yet meaningful and rigorous perspective of the past 500 years' western military history. kennedy is terrific.",
    "I recommend this course if you\u00c2\u00b4re interested in airpower and military weapons.",
    "An excellent history class! I would recommend it to all students.",
    "Interesting course, one of the few of its kind; an opportunity to hear from one of the preeminent historians of our time.",
    "Fantastic. Professor Kennedy teachers you to truly understand history and gain an intuition for it. Do the readings even though you really do not have to. Very interesting and you will forever be thankful that you did. A course to follow you throughout your life.",
    "Very interesting course. However, if you're a History major, the material covered throughout the semester might seem repetitive. Look over the syllabus, relevant readings, and lecture materials before committing to the class.",
    "Absolutely.",
    "A really good introductory course in military history. Fascinating to learn how geography and technology changed the methods of warfare over the years. My TA, Andrew Seal, was really good and helped us out tremendously. A must-take course before you graduate.",
    "Fascinating material, but shop this class with caution. One half of the semester is spent covering 400 years of history, and then the syllabus abruptly switches to air power in the 20th century without actually spending enough time on what happens during the 20th century. This class would have been a nightmare without extensive previous knowledge of both World Wars and the Cold War.",
    "I would recommend this class because the material is very interesting. You definitely need to have a pretty solid background in world history prior to this class, however, as many things are kind of brushed upon and not gone into detail, as the assumption is that you will have already known this information from previous exposure. Also, your entire grade rests essentially on your midterm and final, both of which are essay-style exams, so that can be either a good or bad thing depending on your interpretation.",
    "Great class, very interesting and it covers a worthwhile topic. However it is often unclear what will be examined because the class covers such a large span of time",
    "This course was sort of a mess the way that it was taught this semester. Covering 500 years of history in one semester was biting off way too much to chew. Given this, you should have a good background in European history going into the course - something I did not have and which definitely hurt me for the midterm. The material has to be covered in extremely broad strokes (though you are reading quite a lot of sometimes dry, technical, and redundant material) with touchstone examples that fail to clarify the big picture. The section and readings do not match up to the lecture so it felt like three separate courses glued together which further confused me. The midterm and final are supposedly your only grades - both of which consist of huge essays - but the section may factor in somewhat. I can really not predict what my grade for the course is though my overall understanding is much lower than I expected going into the course. If Kennedy offers this again as a seminar and you have the background, go for it - you will not be disappointed, he is a highly funny, smart, and engaging professor and definitely a personality you would like to meet. But if it is offered as a lecture again, be wary of taking this as your introduction to military history. It is a seminar disguised as a lecture so be prepared.",
    "Absolutely 100% yes",
    "Take it. It is interesting and easy.",
    "Absolutely.",
    "This is not really a true military history class, do not expect to learn about military strategy, technology, or events in any significant detail (or at all). This class was far too broad in subject matter. Sections seemed to discuss only the way authors described evens (as in a literature section), rather than the details and impact of the events themselves. This is likely because the TA's were not military historians but Grad Students pulled from other areas of study to fill in. The only times we actually discussed any military history were the last three classes when Officers did guest lectures.",
    "Yes and no. You don't get to learn in depth about campaigns or battles or generals or weapons. I went into it hoping for what the History Channel used to be (before ghosts and aliens) and it's definitely not that. It's a lot of grand scale theories about the West and geography and organization--which frankly meant you spent more time trying to weigh different author's theories than you did learning about the stuff. The most enjoyable reading by far is Max Boot, but you have to read Kennedy's book. Lecture's are dull, except for the guest lectures from the Navy War College, USAF, and the like. Those are really cool. Maybe take it Credit\/D so you don't have to sweat over how your TF will grade the exam, because there can be a huge difference in how the hard TFs grade it over the easy TFs.",
    "Absolutely recommended.",
    "Yes, but only if they already have a background in military history and aren't actually interested in learning any. It's an entertaining lecture, though.",
    "This class started around 1500. We talked a lot about finance, economics, and geography. After this period in history, we began to talk about airpower. The class during the second half talks a lot about airplanes so be warned about that. If you don't like the subject matter, you probably won't like the class.",
    "Yes - take this. It's not that hard: only 2 exams. Interesting reading and you get a real sense of the world today and what drives history.",
    "History 221 = Kennedy talks about what's on his mind for fifty minutesThis class needs some organizational work. The reading did nothing to support the lectures. The lectures were erratic. There was very little actual military history. This was just talking about larger trends and tropes over 500 years. Kennedy also skipped from 1815 to 1914 like nothing happened in between, so that seems like a bit of a problem. This was the first time it was offerred, though, so some of the issues are understandable. Most people wanted detailed accounts of major battles, strategies in war, studies of famous military geniuses - not long term economic trends.",
    "Not really recommended. The coursework is unfortunately rather too vague. The course attempts to cover too much, and as a result there is not enough emphasis on detail. Essentially it is a pretty basic world history course, and most of the topics covered are ones that students should\/probably do know anyway. In addition, after midterm the course swings too heavily towards airpower and neglects other important factors. For example: the first half of the course emphasises the importance of geography, trade, finance etc. and is an astute analysis of the rise of the West. The second half of the course loses this wide lens approach and as a result the course feels very disjointed.",
    "Yes, take it.",
    "I would recommend this course, certainly got me very interested in history as a major.",
    "Take it! Kinks are definitely still being worked out but the TFs on a whole had very interesting things to say and perspectives you probably won't get in any other class. PK is just the best and it's really interesting. There is a logical flow to it but I think the lecture, the sections, and the readings could be better integrated (if only that there is a lot of reading and it seems a bit absurd to cover 500 years of military history in 1 semester). Still, the point of the class is to get a sweeping view of where we came from and where we are going and you definitely get that. Great great guest lecturers (and Colonel Manning is awesome) and this is a course unlike any other at Yale. \u00e2\u0080\u00a8",
    "Take it, absolutely.",
    "Professor Kennedy is great, and I would recommend taking this class if you are interested in the material.",
    "Very interesting class, although some of my friends who are history majors complained about the structure. I say take it, Professor Kennedy is an amusing lecturer",
    "Military History of the West since 1500 was an excellent course that not only surveyed a plethora of historical material, but also focused in on some of the larger themes that still hold true today. I really enjoyed the emphasis on broader ideas such as the importance of geography, technology, and finance in the development of military history. Moreover, it was great to learn a lot about the airforce in the latter portion of the course. There is only a midterm and final, and of course, the lectures by Professor Kennedy are awesome. Sometimes the exam questions require outside knowledge, which made some of the questions difficult as a non-history major. All in all, this is an excellent course if you want to broaden your historical knowledge, as well as learn about many historical events through the lens of military developments.",
    "You should take this class. Interesting and cool.",
    "This course is a combination between a history on the progression of militaries (their tactics, organization, etc.) and a geopolitical history of the west since 1500. This combination puts all of the more technical aspects in the perspective of a broader history, which makes the course much more meaningful. I would absolutely recommend the class, largely because of Professor Kennedy, but also because it is a very comprehensive overview of European and Western power politics since 1500.",
    "Interested in the military? TAKE THIS COURSE! Professor Kennedy is knowledgeable and engaging. Prepare yourself, though - you are going to hear about the wonders of the British military over and over again.",
    "Military History is a great course, which covers history in a broad way that is helpful to understand while focusing on the decisive factors in armed conflict overall. I would recommend this course if you have any interest in all in the subject",
    "I would recommend this course. There was not that much work, the lectures were very interesting, and section was enjoyable for the most part. However, make sure you can synthesize good arguments for the exams, as the really only depend on how well you can write.",
    "Geography, the Royal Navy, and the U.S. Air Force, roughly in that order. Rough start, but interesting subject and should be better next year.",
    "An easy introductory history course for those who are interested in major European wars. Prof. Kennedy is one of the best lecturers at Yale."
