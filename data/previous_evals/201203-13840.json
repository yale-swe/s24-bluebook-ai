    "Professor Brewer did a great job putting this course together, and he was also an excellent instructor during the classes. His orientation outside class and real life examples in explaining the material were something I never saw in other professors.",
    "The class is great not only for people interested in Latin America sustaainbility, but for everyone interested in a class that is integrative and for anyone looking to expand their knowledge towards management problems regarding diverse problems.",
    "Professor Brewer puts a lot of effort into the class and it shows. The material for each week was alwaysvery interested with a reasonable amount of readings easy to get through.",

   "comments": [
    "Apart from building a bridge between Latin American issues and FES, this class guest lectures were a true highlight. The visiting scholars from Colombia and Brazil were exceptional in bringing an up to date status on the sustainability issues in those countries.",
    "The guest lecturers from Colombia.",
    "I valued having the opportunity to meet speakers coming from Colombia. The group project was a good way to learn about the subject we were assigned. I think it is important to learn how to work in teams and this course helped me strenghten my teamwork skills.",
    "Dr brewer knows his shit and if you care to ask him. Hell tell you the truth.",
    "The instructor and the interaction with UniAndes.",
    "Invited professor, Prof. Brewer, and the diversity of topics.",
    "The guest lecturers who were brought in from the University of the Andes as experts in the topic we werefocusing on. The class focused on interdisciplinary work and did a great job of covering a range of material without seeming disorganized. It also was very effective at giving clear introductions to topics I either wasn't at all familiar with or knew only a little about. I learned a lot in this course. The group projects and final proposal were just about the only assignments and were useful activities since they kept us working consistently without being burdened. I also think they were conducive to building skills applicable after the course.",
    "The group project was a great professional experience",
    "1) Guess lecturers straight from Latin America was an amazing part of this course. Their experience as practitioners brought a good dynamic into class discussions and assignments. In addition, the lunch meetings that professor Brewer arranged for us with the speakers was a invaluable opportunity. Thank you prof. Brewer.2) The group projects, while sometime frustrating, they are key to learning how to coordinate things and communicate in the real world.",
    "Guest speakers",
    "I really liked the format of the course, in which class lectures were mixed with guest lecturers, who taught us about their experiences and areas of expertise, as well as assigned very helpful readings about these topics.I found the group project a great learning experience. It provided me an opportunity to not only learn about a specific topic in detail, but also to learn how to work with a group to produce diverse professional products."

   "comments": [
    "I think the syllabus needs to restructure the work load better along the semester. Using the same module approach, I would add the Team A and Team B assignments on the week after the guest lecture finishes. Providing a more integrated \"module\" than the actual concentration of student presentations at the end of the semester.",
    "This course is dependent on four guest lecturers from Colombia and the literature they recommend. This did not provide a solid foundation in any of the topics we covered. Additional reading materials and solid lectures\/discussions between the guests would have improved the course.",
    "Even though cases from other countries were talked about. I would have liked to have more diverse speakers (from other coutries in latin-america besides Colombia and Brazil)It would be a good idea to ask speakers to provide students with methologies to do their job. Brief explanation so that if we are ever needed to work on the same thing we can be able to know where to start.",
    "I can't think in any point for improvement.",
    "Teacher assistant and less readings so everyone can read everything.",
    "Sometimes the readings were repetitive, but I think the guest lecturers suggested these not the professor.",
    "The course could be expanded to better include the urban innovations in sustainability that are occuring in South America. I hope that next year that the class can highlight innovators from a broader representation of countries.",
    "Two things:1) I think the class could benefit greatly from Classes V2 access. Having all the readings and updates in one location is often very useful for students with many other classes and commitments going on.2) I think the assignments could be spread out more evenly throughout the semester. I felt that we had four major assignments back to back in November alone, right in between thanksgiving week and finals. Considering that a lot of these projects were group based I think having early deadlines would have avoided some of those 'off' dates when the group members are all away.NOTE - I did see how the speaker schedule somewhat dictated the deadlines for assignments and it could be hard or less beneficial for students to turn in work before the guess comes.",
    "More precise Syllabus, better overall structure, readings should be on V2.",
    "I feel that the class lectures in between the guest lecturers could have been, at times, better organized and structured. Also, I would have liked to spend several class periods on HOW to write professional proposals (such as reading through examples of proposals and identifying their strengths\/weaknesses, etc), in order to use class time to further develop my skills in producing professional products (ie, proposals and professional presentations).I also would have liked to get written feedback on our proposals, both the preliminary and final group proposals, as well as the individual project proposals."

    "It was really effective. The lectures and the readings were directed to understanding the issues in Latin America.

It's my appreciation that a US student will find it more interesting if the issues where approached differently.",

    "I'm in the school of architecture and took this course as an elective. The architecture school offers virtually no courses that address development or developing regions, however this is where my interests lie, so what I learned in this course definitely supports my overall academic goals.",
    "Course fits perfectly! For those of us that are attempting to focus on Latin American environmental management it is perfect. I think this class was a great addition to the FES curriculum that was up to now missing a Latin American focus (FES seems to have a lot of focus on South East Asia, China, and somewhat Brazil).",

I've never encountered such a thorny environment engaging as a team. I believe it was a true learning experience.",
    "The group environment allowed me to learn about how other people approach certain concepts and problems. Unfortunately, I felt like the group did not have an even distribution of work and that other members of the group weren't as interested in learning and doing a good job as me.",

    "I enjoyed the group assignments since they got us to get to know one another and probably lessened the overall workload. The only thing that was confusing was that Garry seemed to be a little inconsistent with feedback and because the bulk of our work was at the very end of the semester and all done collectively it was difficult to gage how we were preforming as individuals in the course.",

This class is about the challenges of sustainability in developing countries and by that it covers a lot of topics useful for many tracks or interests.",

    "This was the one of the best courses I've taken since being at Yale and I would recommend it to anyone interested in development or Latin America. The only thing I might suggest is checking the topics the instructor intends on covering that semester since they apparently rotate. I could be worth it to take it another year if the material is more relevant to you then.",
