   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this class to another student. Writing 5 short (1-2) page papers over the course of the semester, plus a midterm and a final, is not much work. I would just make sure I started them early to get early feedback. I may or may not recommend taking this class Cr\/D at the beginning and seeing how you do overall. The class brings up some very interesting questions, although sometimes there is a lot of reading in class and not much discussion. I would shop this for sure.",
    "It's a fantastic class that deals with material that everybody should be familiar with. The work is not worse than your average seminar and Prof. Bilakovics is extremely intelligent. Classes often include very heated debate which makes them fun.",
    "I would recommend this to anyone willing to do a little extra writing, and who is passionately interested in American political philosophy",
    "My big complaint with this class is that it really isn't a \"seminar.\" The professor is really knowledgeable and is a nice guy with a dry sense of humor, but he doesn't really know how to facilitate a good discussion. Basically every week consisted of him doing a close reading of some text -- which was great, informative and interesting -- and then running out of time before we could get into any substantive class discussion. As a result, people just stopped doing the reading and everyone goofed off on their laptops (which the prof. started openly complaining about during the last few class meetings).He also had us do these analysis assignments for the sole purpose of making presentations in the seminar, and we always ran short on time so hardly anyone ever got to present. That was nice.Great readings, smart professor, bad seminar.",
    "I would recommend it, only if you're looking at PoliSci as a major. Or if you're just really into politics. Other than that, don't take it just for fun. Cause it isn't that fun.",
    "I'm doubtful that, presented with a do-over, I'd take this class again. It was my first upper-level seminar at Yale, and my expectations going into it were correspondingly high. My mistake lay in not realizing, until well after shopping period was over, that the class would be based almost exclusively on the writings of the Founding Fathers. A close reading of The Federalist was not what I'd bargained for, although Professor Bilakovics, to his credit, spent the first half of every session analyzing it aloud with fluency and insight.The professor was entertaining and informative all at once, and I can't fault him for sticking to the syllabus as it was designed. Still, I would've far preferred an explicit linkage of issues the Framers fretted about to their (mis)application in the present-day. Had we read more from Sabato and Levinson, the modern counterparts to the Framers on the syllabus, I feel that we would've come out with a better appreciation of the inherent, timeless difficulties in setting up the republic and seeing to its preservation for posterity. That didn't happen, at least in my case. When we would touch upon current events in the latter half of classtime, the ensuing discussion was too often dominated by a vocal few, and too little related to the readings at hand. I wish the professor, as accommodating and genuinely nice as he was, would have expounded less at times and guided the discussion more at other times, interspersing those two elements better than he did.Also, the grading of reading responses was a little erratic, not that I took issue with the professor's goal of having us limit ourselves to one or two aspects of the text and addressing them in-depth. I took the class Credit\/D\/Fail, and shouldn't have in retrospect.I advise you to read The Federalist on your own, meditate on it some, and take another class instead."
