   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strength: it covered many important and relevant topics in cell biology. Having multiple professors was good because it gives us a chance to get to know the professors in the department. Weakness: it was a very intensive class (but I guess it has to be if we are going to cover so much material). Also, professors should be careful how they word their homework questions, since the wording can make it difficult for us to figure out what exactly the professor is asking. Suggestion: I think students who are taking cell bio seminar 603 should be exempt from the paper discussion sessions for this class, since they are essentially the same thing.",
    "Often boring to sit through lectures. Grading of homework assignments from different professors was also very unpredictable and difficulty in questions also varied.",
    "This course needs work to become more effectively taught. There was no communication among professors as to what had been taught previously, and multiple professors touched on topics that required knowledge of cell cycle events throughout the semester even though the cell cycle lecture was given at the very end of the course. I would recommend moving this lecture up. A majority of the lectures were very unorganized and difficult to pay attention to because they were presented in ways that were illogical with no clear structure or reiteration of key points. Some lecturers also spoke so quickly that students just gave up attempting to take notes and closed laptops halfway through the class. I would also recommend that homework assignments be evaluated by course directors before they are posted by the assigning professor. Many homework assignments had little to no relevance to what was taught in lecture, making attending the lectures completely irrelevant. This introduces a huge bias in the grading distribution between students who have previously taken courses that cover the topics covered in this class and those who have not. It is unfair and frustrating for students to have assignments and grades based on things that were never discussed in class. Additionally, requiring feedback from professors or teaching fellows on homework assignments when points were deducted would be helpful for the students in determining what mistakes were made on the homework assignments that were essentially self-taught. It seems like students were required to put in significant effort to pay attention to drivel lectures and complete assignments, while most instructors paid little care to the quality of their lectures or the evaluation of assigned homework. The disparities between grades on homework assignments were also questionable, as it seems that there was no correlation between the quality of work submitted and the grade received on the assignment. Having some type of standard among assignments would be helpful.",
    "It was very disjointed and did not facilitate student interaction",
    "Strengths: The variety of topics covered in the class was great and the discussions were a nice change from the traditional lecture. Weaknesses: Some of the instructors were not great at teaching (they moved too quickly or were too technical) This course could be improved if we could give instructors feedback right after they teach and not months later once we've forgotten what their class was like. That way we could give better feedback to improve the course.",
    "Sometimes, given the wide variety of professors, it was difficult to judge the expectations of each. As a result, assignments and grading seemed to have little consistency.",
    "The topics in lecture assumed greatly different levels of background knowledge. Some lectures were too basic while others assumed we had extensive background in specific fields. It would've been nice if lecturers had communicated with each other more to avoid repeating material and to put the more basic lectures towards the beginning of the course. Feedback was not always provided in a timely manner on homework assignments. The grading also seemed arbitrary at times when no comments were provided for an assignment. The paper summaries for class discussions were graded inconsistently. The class discussions centered around a summary of the paper and figures, but I would've enjoyed delving more deeply into the material.",
    "It was interesting to hear about different topics in cell biology from different professors, but because each week was led by a different professor, there were multiple lectures that were highly repetitive. I felt like each topic we covered jumped around quite a bit rather than progressing through topics in a logical flow. For example, we learned about the cell cycle in one of the final lectures of the semester, but this seems to be a very basic concept in cell biology that should have been introduced much earlier. Similarly, the first few classes addressed complex genetic concepts (for example, TADs, boundary elements, epigenetics, etc.) that may have made more sense to introduce later in the course. The course would have greatly benefited from a higher level of communication between professors about what had already been covered to reduce redundancy and to ensure that all of the basics were covered.",
    "The major strength of this course is that different faculty lecture on different topics. It is helpful to learn the newest developments on a topic from an expert of the field. The major downside to this is that each faculty assigns and grades their own homework. It is difficult to get a sense of how to answer the questions since each professor grades differently.",
    "I think the discussion session is very good, which helps me understand the subject.",
    "Unfortunately, I think the weakness is in partly inherent to the course: The course rapidly moves over a wide array of topics and (generally) attempts to move from global perspective to specific cases. I think this is an good approach. The limited time given for each topic means that it is difficult to understand the specific in a meaningful way (integrating into other cell biology\/genetics\/physiology\/chemistry knowledge) when these details involve highly specific\/arcane exampleskeeping track of protein names can often become a hindrance. I infer that students are supposed to use their own time to delve into topics of interestthat the lecture offers a brief intro. Given that the homework does not often involve all or even some of the specific cases, there is likely little drive for the majority of students to take this extra time. In this way, this course format could lead to many hours of lost time for these students as they sit through the detailed second halves of lectures. In the end, I think whether or not this issue is considered a weakness of the course worthy of address depends on the goal of the course. I do think that interested students will take the time to explore topics of interest, regardless of the specific details in class. In the end, I think that students would get more out of a course that focuses more heavily on the conceptual aspects and inter-relatedness of topics, alongside declassified specific examples.",
    "more feedback on assignments",
    "strength: much information about the different parts of cells weakness: some are a little too detailed and therefore confusing",
    "The professors in cell biology were very effective at delivering effective presentations. They had great enthusiasm and clarity - much better than courses from one other department that will remain unnamed. Only three or so professors were less effective at delivering the lectures. However, the content and organization overall was great - the topics built upon one another and were definitely applicable to the research I am interested in here at Yale.",
    "the class is not an introductory level, it requires some certain level of biology knowledge.",
    "Heterogeneity in grading between homework assignments. Sometimes feedback was unclear.",
    "More Discussion sessions would be better.",
    "Most of the lectures were dense; I liked this. I found it easier to understand things when specific protein names were referenced. Obviously it is a huge topic to address in a short time, but the coverage of cell signaling was very general. As such I didn't really retain as much from this.",
    "More engagements",
    "Some of the lecturers were really dry and not engaging. It felt like the material was kind of contrived. Homework questions didnt always relate to the lecture. Having learning goals at the beginning of each lecture and maybe more group discussion may help.",
    "Strengths: different professors teach different parts of class, which can give us many different views of the advanced filed. Weakness: Every part is a little short, I hope to get more details.",
    "Strengths: -Covers a broad array of topics in molecular cell biology -Incorporates data analysis from previous publications to explain each topic Weaknesses: -Assumes that first year PhD students from different backgrounds (only B.S., post-bacs, M.S., etc.) all have a thorough understanding of a broad array of molecular cell biology topics. Personally I was able to follow some of the presentations easily while others I was not able to follow along at all. Suggestion: Provide sources that students may access and read before going to a lecture that focuses on a topic in which they have little to no background on. -In some cases, experimental data and theoretical background are patched up together in ways that don't seem to follow a logical sequence. An example of this was the lecture on cyclin:CDK complexes. Being one of the lectures that I had the background information on, I still found it hard to follow because the correct order of the cyclins along the cell cycle, as well as the actual effect\/function of the cyclin:CDK complexes was not properly explained until the second part of the lecture. The function of the cyclins was explained after the activating and regulatory mechanisms (ATP binding to the ATP groove, CDK binding, proteasomal degradation, inhibitory and activating phosphorylation, etc). While this was not a bad lecture, molecular mechanisms are, at best, moderately confusing. The order chosen to explain the subtopics leaves students wondering what the actual importance of the mechanisms is and for example, what effect does proteosomal degradation actually have at the cellular level. Disclaimer: I chose the cyclin lecture as an example because it was one of the lectures I was most familiar with. In no way was the cyclin lecture a particularly bad lecture nor does it represent the only case where logical sequence was an issue.",
    "Strengths: in depth lectures, and suitable instructors for each topic made sure we got the best idea of where each topic is currently in the field.",
    "Many of the lectures could have been improved with more audience participation. While there was some discussion of experimental techniques, I think it would have been beneficial to cover more. It also would have been helpful if homework was graded more promptly so you could apply the feedback to later homework assignments.",
    "All the lecturers lectured very well. I felt there could have been more discussion sections (maybe weekly like for genetics) and small group sessions.",
    "not very cohesive... also very detailed could have been more useful if big-picture, then zoom in, for every lecture. really liked the repetition of summary slides though",
    "It is difficult having so many different professors.",
    "I think a strength is that I was able to look for external sources to incorporate into my assignments and increase onowkedge in a topic\/field. A weakness was to try to navigate a field that I am not familiar with."
