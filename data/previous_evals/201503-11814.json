    "This is a great electrical engineering elective. You'll learn a lot about computer architecture. It's a great parallel to CPSC 323, summarizing complicated elements of computer architecture and new topics in the field. Projects are challenging and informative. I would absolutely recommend this class to anyone who likes the hardware side of computer science.",
    "This covers CPSC 323 at a more practical level and goes beyond with topics like security and energy usage. It was a bit dry for some of the lectures, but that's unavoidable because of the material. I found the projects really cool (the cache simulator especially), but maybe some others didn't. If you want to learn a bit more about the practical side of computer organization, at least shop this class.",
    "Great class! Covered a lot of material pretty well, problem sets were interesting but not too time-consuming."
