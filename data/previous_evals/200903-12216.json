    "Everything related to FDI.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. Well taught, fun and interesting. Some say the class gets repetitive. Duh. It's about a very specific topic-- FDI. There is certainly overlap in the readings and classes, but it's generally productive and helps to tie things together. I knew a lot about the topic going in and know more having taken the class. If you can get in, take it.",
    "It is pretty challenging, if you don't know much about finance\/MNCs\/global business, but it's a great chance to learn, if you take the readings seriously and make an effort to participate in class. Also, go to office hours often!",
    "This class isn't too much reading for a seminar, which is good, and you can still get a lot out of it. It gets a little repetitive, but is still probably worth taking.",
    "Unless the subject material is diversified and the role of student presentations is reduced, I don't recommend this class. After a few weeks of interesting discussions and mini-lectures by the very knowledgeable Professor LaPalombara, the class becomes a weekly cycle of identical and not particularly informative or useful student-led presentations. Professor LaPalombara dictates the format and to some extent the content of the presentations, giving groups little creative input and a strong incentive to do the same thing as everyone else has done. He reacts very negatively and somewhat harshly if he doesn't agree with the group.If you really want to learn about FDI and if the format improves, this could be an interesting seminar... but as it is, I wouldn't recommend it.",
    "No, I would not recommend it.",
    "I would recommend this class to another student. You learn about the positive and negative effects of foreign direct investment, the challenges developing countries face in attracting FDI and more. It is very relevant. There is not too much work. Two short papers and a final paper or test.",
    "NO, This was a horrible course, it had great potential since the topic is very interesting and the professor has great experience in many areas of business, but instead the last 10 weeks were all the same kind of student presentations which didnt learn us anything. Also, take credit\/d because the professor can be an arbitrary grader.",
    "yes, definitely.",
    "This was a really fun class. Although it was a bit unfocused at times and it wasn't always clear what the main thrust of each session was (which made it interesting to study for the exam...), I still feel like I learned a lot about an interesting subject that is incredibly important to how the new global economy works. Class time is a good mix of discussion, lecture, and role-playing games (Group 1 is Sony, Group 2 is Malaysia; see if you can work out a foreign direct investment relationship). The workload is totally manageable as well. Plus, Prof. LaPalombara really knows his stuff and clearly enjoys teaching the class. To sum up: a bit disorganized, but fun, not too hard, and very informative. I would recommend it.",
    "If you're an EPE major, take the seminar. this is why you applied to the major. If you're not an EPE major, beg to get in and LaP may have mercy on you.",
    "Do not take this class. Most people, regardless of what they may say in these evaluations, did not like this class or find it to be at all stimulating. This class will help you to learn a lot about FDI and explore the legal and international contexts of its growth, as well as the ways in which it threatens the power of the nation-state. Regardless, this class was extremely unenjoyable and does not rank near the best political science seminars I have taken. Sub-par class from a brilliant professor, I would have expected more.",
    "You'll learn a lot about foreign direct investment in this class. As someone interested in international business and government, this was fascinating for me. Each student will participate in or lead a group discussion and simulation every week, which includes a fun case."
