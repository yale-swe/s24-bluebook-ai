    "If you are at all interested in the development of babies, but don't want to take the extremely detailed dev. psych, this is a great course for you. Also, if you want to learn more about animal mentality and how it relates to human beings, this seems to be the only way to do that at yale.",
    "A really informative, but laid back, class about babies and animals!!!",
    "The class was disorganized and not scientific. Random anecdotes were often presented as if they proved something about babies or animals. The slides were disorganized and the lectures impossible to follow. The readings were also dry and contradictory.",
    "Great class to take if you already took Intro to Psych. Very fascinating topic, great lecturer, and engaging T.As. The textbook readings are VERY dry, but the other portion of the readings (online articles, research studies, excerpts from books) is extremely interesting.",
    "Psych 304 is not hard to get into at all. Professor Wynn does not cap the class. There are students from all kinds of backgrounds and ages, so you don't have to be a psych major to take this class. There are 2 papers and 2 essays. The lectures are long, but the slides and posted afterward. All the info you need is pretty much on the slides. I think this is why a lot of peopleskipped lecture. The tests and essays are hard though--beware! This is not an easy A class.",
    "Yes. Figure it out for yourself.",
    "Yes! I really enjoyed this class and would recommend this class to another student. I think that some people are deceived by the name of the course, thinking that the course will not be that serious, but it is a lot of reading and a lot of information to learn! If you are really interested in evolutionary and or developmental psychology this class will be a really wonderful experience, though.",
    "This is a phenomenal class! The lectures always gave me interesting stories to share with my friends, the readings were interesting, and Professor Wynn is amazingly endearing. Take it if you like watching video clips of babies and animals and listening to funny stories. You learn a lot, and the best part isthat you don't even need to have taken intro psych or cog sci to understand the material. I came away with so much more appreciation for how incredible human and animal minds are, and I would definitely recommend this class to everyone.",
    "I would recommend this class for non-psych\/cogsci majors, or people just beginning the psych\/cogsci major. If you've already taken Developmental Psych, a lot of this class will be a review. In fact, a lot of this class is also a review of Intro Psych\/Intro CogSci. As a senior cognitive science major, I didn't learn very much new information. But the subject matter is usually interesting, there are lots of adorable videos of babies, animals, and baby animals in class, and Professor Wynn is a great lecturer.",
    "Definitely take this class. Very low work load (two papers and two not-so-difficult exams), reading is voluminous at times but never dense, and lecture is a joy.",
    "I would definitely take this class again.",
    "This was a great class! Some elements are similar to intro cog sci but I would definitely recommend this class instead.",
    "Take this class!! Prof. Wynn is GREAT! She's such a dynamic lecturer, very lively. She's sure to keep you awake and engaged. If you're interested in animals and infants and understanding what they know and don't know, definitely take this class. The coursework is manageable: 2 short papers&2 non-cumulative exams that are spread out. The readings are also doable and the primary scientific articles are interesting to read. Prof. Wynn uses fun examples for everything and also makes use of youtube videos&other video clips, as well as audience participation. Her lectures are never dry and she really cares about teaching, which is not always true for a researcher, and her students and she's more than happy to answer questions after class or via email (quite speedily, I should add). She's one of the most engaging professors I've had at Yale and the class was pretty interesting. I definitely know more about what's going on in infant&animal minds. Don't be fooled by the title; it might sound like a fluffy class, but there's genuine science behind these findings, some of which is surprising, and it's not just about looking at pictures of babies&monkeys and philosophizing. Everything has been backed up with numerous scientific findings (although there's still a lot that's unknown). The textbook is quite detailed, but it's a really fascinating read (I have a much greater appreciation for animals now) and Prof. Wynn is never concerned with the details but with the big picture. Exams aren't too tough as long as you've done the reading and attended lecture (and there's no reason not to attend the lecture; you'll be missing out on such a lively performance and Prof. Wynn's constantly cracking jokes and trying to keep us engaged!). Definitely take this class if you're looking for a social science credit (no psyc background is really needed) or an upper division psyc class, or a list A class. You'll have fun :)",
    "This course was pretty interesting. The material was fairly engaging, though a bit of it was review from intro psych\/intro cogsci. Professor wynn is funny and engaging, though sometimes she gets sidetracked on topics and spends too much time on pretty basic things. Overall i would recommend this course...lots of cute pictures of babies and animals :)",
    "Pretty interesting large lecture course. Not mind blowing, but an easy and fun So credit.",
    "For sure. Lectures were awesome, workload was completely manageable, and Karen is so sweet. This is also just a really interesting class!",
    "Psych 304 is an incredibly interesting class. I would recommend this class to anyone interested in child or animal psychology, the human experience, and mental processes of individuals without language.",
    "PSYC 304 is a fantastic class that covers the interesting challenges of studying infants and non-human animals, the creative solutions researchers have developed to overcome those challenges, and the fascinating findings that have been uncovered. I highly recommend the class because the material is very engaging, Karen Wynn is a fantastic professor, and I feel like I learned a lot without putting in an absurd amount of work.",
    "This is a good overview of developmental psychology in both infants and animals. I would definitely recommend it, as it's not too challenging and I felt like I learned a lot!",
    "Psych 304 is a consistently entertaining introduction to animal and infant cognition. However, it is not particularly in depth and the work is far from challenging. Great if that's what you're looking for but otherwise will leave you wanting more.",
    "This is a great class for anyone interested in babies, animals, or cognitive science in general. You do not need to have taken a previous psych class, though it certainly wouldn't hurt. There is definitely a lot of overlap on the baby side with Developmental Psychology, but there was enough new stuff that I was still interested. Professor Wynn is a really fun teacher, and each lecture was very interesting. I highly recommend this class!",
    "I would definitely recommend Psych 304 to students who are specifically interested in learned about the mental processes of animal and babies. If this does not sound interesting students should not take it because it is a very specific topic. But if it does sound appealing then it's a great class with not too much work and you learn a lot of awesome things that will blow your mind and cause you to think completely differently about animals and babies and how smart they really are!",
    "Take Mental Lives of Babies and Animals if you are really interested in Psychology. The class pretty much is true to its name; you study different aspects of psychology (emotion, theory of mind, social interaction, altruism, communication, navigation) focusing solely on babies and animals. If you are really interested in psychology, or want to know a lot about babies or animals, definitely take the course.Lectures are fun and engaging; you watch a lot of movies. You only have two midterms (no final) and two short essays that are interesting to think about.Overall, take it if you are interested in psych. It doesn't have too much work and is super interesting. It's a great psych credit and you'll learn a ton about child development and animal cognition.I really enjoyed it.",
    "A great class, Professor Wynn is a lot of fun. The class material is very interesting and engaging, and the workload isn't too heavy. I would definitely recommend this course, if you're at all interested. It's very accessible to anyone.",
    "so so so good.The perfect balance of a scientific approach and and not overly science-y material. I am a humanities person and I too this class with my bio major friend. She was excited by how science-like it was and I was excited by how science-like it was not. Dr. Wynn has fascinating insight!If you are interested, you are an absolute fool not to take this class.",
    "Interesting lecture on infants and animals. A lot of material that I had seen before in other ling\/psych classes. Some new stuff. Professor Wynn is really fantastic and a great resource. Not too much work.",
    "I would definitely take this course, if you're prepared to seriously study for the exams. It is little time commitment generally, but the exams are sneaky and sometimes random, so you need enough time to learn everything. Otherwise, great and interesting. Pretty simple stuff.",
    "I very much enjoyed this class! Professor Wynn is funny, enthusiastic, and approachable, and overall the material was very interesting (and honestly, who doesn't like watching videos of cute animals and babies?). However, I can only recommend taking this course if they change the exams and grading system in the future. With so few questions on the final, getting more than one question wrong can basically toss your test grade in the toilet--and according to how Professor Wynn explained her system, points on the exams and assignments are essentially equal to actual points in your grade. Thus, I'm pretty sure I'm not going to get good marks in this class, and it is not because I didn't come to class or didn't study for the exams.",
    "I would whole-heartedly recommend this class. It was by far my favorite taken at Yale. Fantastic in every way.",
    "Very entertaining topic, great 5th credit\/d course although if you want to take it for a grade it won't be too hard either. 1 midterm and 1 final (noncumulative), 2 short papers. Workload wasn't bad at all and subject was relatively easy to grasp. Watched cute baby\/animal videos!",
    "I wouldn't necessarily recommend this class. It's very interesting, but the beginning of the course was just a review of intro to psychology which I had just taken, and the rest of the course information gets a little boring. An interesting class, but only take it if you don't have another psyc class you're more interested in.",
    "Yes! A great class, lots of interesting things combining psychology, cognitive science, developmental psychology, etc. Always captivating lectures.",
    "I would recommend it as a Cr\/D. It got a little confusing and in general the material is interesting.",
    "Professor Wynn is wonderful! It's hard to sit still and listen for an hour and 15 min, but she was always engaging. And she was very approachable for questions after class or during office hours. The material was exactly what I'm interested in, as it's a sort of blend between Developmental Psychology and Comparative Cognition, with some Evolutionary Psychology thrown in. The articles were great, and though the textbook was a little tedious it had good material and we didn't have to read from it much.",
    "Yes. Lectures weren't the most captivating classes I've ever been to, but the course covers some interesting topics about the mental capacities of both human infants and nonhuman animals. It also includes a lot of cute pictures of babies, animals, and baby animals. The class is well-organized; Professor Wynn is very excited about the material and does a good job of explaining everything clearly. There were two 1000-1500 word papers and two exams, grading is very fair and as long as you do some amount of reading, studying, or attending class it is not that difficult.",
    "Interesting class. DO ALL THE READINGS THOUGH.",
    "Fun, but don't take it if you've taken both intro psych and intro cogsci. It does not offer any new information if you've taken both.",
    "It is a cross between evolutionary psychology and developmental psychology. The information is really interesting and often fun.",
    "Eh. Cute baby and animal videos, and a couple interesting studies, but always ended up getting back to the same unanswerable question about whether or not babies and\/or animals can think. Wasn't too hard, though the second paper grade was a bit of a nasty surprise.",
    "Overall, I would say this class is good. It is very interesting but could be improved by some structural changes. Professor Wynnis great and that is what makes this class worth taking.",
    "I don't know if I would recommend this class to another student, but that is mostly because I personally was not very interested in the subject, so I don't feel like I took very much from the class.",
    "This course is okay. I think I had very high expectations for it so that's why I didn't think it was that great. It's interesting though. Take it, Professor Wynn is cool.",
    "I would not recommend this course to any psych or cogsci major. It's super low level, and sometimes difficult to take seriously. That said, if you're interested in the subject and don't know much about it, its a decent overview of human uniqueness. Plus, it will likely get better, as this was the first year it was offered.",
    "If you're interested in Psych at all, TAKE IT."
