    "This is a very interesting class, and important if you are thinking about doing anything conservation or development related. Prof. Carpenter is great, and the readings are manageable.",

    "The class offers a great introduction and overview to key literature on conservation and development. It provides the necessary foundation for students interested in pursuing developmental professional work."
