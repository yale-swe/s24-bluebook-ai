    "Work is pretty easy, you just read other people's drafts. And that got pretty repetitive and people started slacking off.",
    "Great class if you like to write. Work hard and you'll be pleased with the results. If you are sensitive, toughen up because MC is not going to sugarcoat things.",
    "it's fantastic, especially as an introductory writing course. it's a great way to hear other people's writing.",
    "Take it if you get in. Professor Cunningham is the real deal. A great writer and a great teacher who meets with you individually and helps you improve.",
    "Yes. Best course. Cunningham is brilliant. He makes workshop engaging and useful and worthwhile. He provides you and your work with a tremendous amount of attention. The other students are for the most part good writers. You get to write stories for credit. Just yes, yes, yes. I learned so much and had so much fun. Take this class. Work hard in this class. Use the amazing opportunity to have Cunningham give you so much of his time.",
    "Good reading, good discussions, good people. Start working on stories early. I would even suggest working on your first story over winter break in case you are one of the first few people to workshop.",
    "Take it."
