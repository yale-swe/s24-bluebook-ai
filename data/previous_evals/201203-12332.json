    "ECON 498 is designed for students who want to study a subject in depth with the guidance of a faculty member. My mentor, Professor Gary Gorton from the Yale School of Management, is one of the most supportive faculty members at Yale. He was always willing to revise the syllabus to add things that would fit my interests. Besides, he always gave me the chance to talk about my career in economics and he always provided the most unusual advice, which I soon realized that was all correct and accurate. What else an undergraduate could ask for? This class provided me with close contact to one of the best researchers at Yale, career guidance, and focus on a subject that I am interested in. Everyone should look for this kind of opportunity with a faculty member in her\/his own field of interest."
