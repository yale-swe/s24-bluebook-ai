   "comments": [
    "The studio was pretty well coordinated... there was a discussion with a structural engineer that was helpful, and both Mimi and Eric encouraged integration of building design with landscape, structure, and other disciplines.",
    "the instructors made an attempt to incoorporate structural systems and approaches into the studio. however, the timing might have been too early to effectively have an impact to the projects.",
    "A structural engineer was invited to critique the projects, which was somewhat resourceful but not that helpful. The structural component was more stressed than actually implemented.",
    "The coordination with structural consultants and our contact in Paris seemed a little forced. Not all projects were developed enough to engage in a meaningful conversation at the time of these reviews."

   "comments": [
    "One-time use of engineering consultant not helpful. More sustained interaction (2-3 visits) would have been better.",
    "group pin-ups, class discussions were great and followed well by the sequence of the course, however inthe desk-crits there were some distractions while Eric and Mimi had conflicts between two.",
    "I think the most valuable aspects were our pin-ups with outside critics. Both times it gave me a different perspective on my project that were very helpful.",
    "the most valuable aspects of the studio where the meeting with city planning officials in paris, which enabled us to have a close understanding of the issues of the site and possible constituents of our projects. desk crits were also helpful, when conducted by mimi hoang.the weekly and lengthy pin-ups were sometimes helpful,but most of the time seemed to have little value beyond unnecessary time spent on presentation rather than design. despite this emphasis on presentation, clear suggestions or comments were never made.",
    "The least valuable aspects were the informal-desk-crit- reviews where everyone had to be present. They were really a personal discussion that did not require everyone's attendance in the intervention and the time could of been better spent working on individual projects.",
    "The desk-crits with multiple students and both Mimi and Eric present were the most helpful. I learned the most from listening to Eric and Mimi debate the same issue and then having a discussion about it."

   "comments": [
    "programs were a little bit confusing, but schedule, production and the exploration were great.",
    "I think the studio was well structured, and I learned a lot. The workload was quite intense, but led towards projects that were well developed and thought out.",
    "the studio could have potentially been very interesting, with the idea of the double driving conceptual, programmatic and systematic explorations. however, the concept of the double was never really explored beyond the short introduction in the studio brief. suggested readings or discussion of the issue would have been helpful but were never provided, even when asked for by the students.",
    "I believe the studio was taught in a very straightforward \"architectural\" manner that would be more appropriate for first or second year, but less relevant for third year. The program, schedule, and production outlines were all reasonable expectations but the micro-management tendencies of the instructors were a little stifling for advanced studio. I would of found the studio more productive and enjoyable if the instructors gave the students a little more self-will and liberty. That said - the intense scrutiny by both instructors were done with the best intentions and it made the students work scrupulously.",
    "Some of the deadlines, especially toward the end of the semester, seemed a little arbitrary. Some of the objectives for the internal reviews were unclear."

   "question_text": "What were your expectations for this studio and how well were they met?",
   "comments": [
    "For a comprehensive studio, not much technical knowledge conveyed.",
    "my expectation was to acheive challanging typical architectural idea through the design and thesis, and it was good enough and well completed.",
    "I think my expectations for this studio were met.",
    "my expectations for the studio were very high, with the studio being my first choice in the lottery. however, the instructors were not able to live up to their reputation and made a potentially very inspiring and challenging studio brief frustrating to the point that creative learning was prohibited.",
    "based upon the project description, my expectations of the studio were very different. Many of the issues that were proposed in the brief dissolved as the studio progressed. Studio was very much about image and the process was very inconsistent due to disagreements between critics.",
    "I expected the studio to be an \"architectural building\" studio and my expectations were met.",
    "I had very high expectations for this studio and feel that they were met satisfactorily. This has been the most productive studio I have taken at Yale and I am very proud of what I've accomplished."

   "comments": [
    "Both Mimi and Eric were strong critics. The advice and guidance they gave was helpful and led to good results in the end. I think the studio could have a little more freedom in terms of organization and design process, but overall it was an enjoyable semester.",
    "to work with two studio heads of equal standing was at best challenging and at worst very frustrating. there was often unprofessional quarelling between the studio critics even during official reviews. feedback received during desk-crits was rarely coordinated, resulting in a lot of time wasted when strategies had to be readjusted according to the opposing opinions of the critics.in general, ms. hoang seems to be a very competent teacher, with the ability to listen and react to students' ideas, while at the same time being able to inspire and push students out of their comfort zone.i would evaluate mr. bunge less favourably. he does not seem to be able to move beyond his ownagenda of building a teaching portfolio and is unable to accept preconceived notions of what a student's design should look like. although a very good designer himself, he does not seem to have enough experience or ability to react to students' individual propositions in order to push a project out of the initial concept phase into further development.",
    "Both instructors seem to be decent teachers, but it was very difficult to work with them together. There was a tendency to micro-manage both design and production which was frustrating at the advanced studio level.",
    "I appreciated how attentive and dedicated both instructors were to the studio - it was quite obvious that they were both invested whole-heartedly in everyones' projects."
