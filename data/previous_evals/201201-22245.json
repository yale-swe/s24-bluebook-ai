    "So before taking this course I read the evaluations for it in the past, and they were pretty much mostly terrible.However, luckily Yair Minsky, the chairman of the department was teaching it this year. And he's great!I liked this class much more than 301. You get to see the power of the lebesgue measure and fourier series. Some results like weyl's equidistribution theorem are really cool.Oh and you finally get to sum 1\/n^2 from 1 to infinity and get pi^2\/6. That's really cool too, how you can evaluate this weird sum using fourier analysis.I'm not sure how much the teaching varies year to year. Because Beals is not a great book for self study, it is fairly dependent on how good the lectures are.",
    "I would recommend it to math and physics majors.",
    "Math 305 was great. I learned a lot, and Yair was an amazing professor. He was really focused on having us understand all the concepts behind the theorems he proved on the board. One of my favorite math classes taken so far.",
    "This class is neat and exceedingly theoretical. Prof Minsky is brilliant. Worth taking if you do not already know about measures and like pure mathematics.",
    "If you're interested in the Math major or just like Analysis, you should take it.",
    "Great course on Real Analysis. We used Beals, which has some issues but is still a nice text. The pace of the class and the workload were all reasonable.",
    "This is a great course. The material is a lot more abstract and interesting than 301. Should definitely consider taking it early on if you are a math major.",
    "This is a great course if you want to learn more math. However, be prepared to work very hard."
