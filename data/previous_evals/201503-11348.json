    "It's an okay class and one that a lot of students just have to take in order to participate in a biology department. Pay attention to the weekly quizzes- they can be trickier than they seem and they add up! It can seem like kind of a glitzy class, but overall it's fine.",
    "BIOL 101 is a frustrating class, albeit a necessary one if you plan on majoring in anything biological. The material moves very quickly over a wide range of topics without going into much depth in any of them, and the quizzes are very hard to score well on, even if you have a mastery of the material. For most students who have taken AP Bio or who just generally have an interest in biology, this course will be largely review, and the new topics that are covered will only be very briefly touched on. Despite loving biology, I did not enjoy this course, and I found it to be very disappointing.",
    "This course is not as bad as the first lecture makes it to be. In the end, it's quite enjoyable, if you're willing to ignore the weekly quizzes (which suck). Take it with prof. Koelle, sign up for the lunches and be prepared to commiserate with your fellow students when BIOL 102 starts.",
    "Not bad, not great",
    "Exactly what you expect. Nothing too exciting but a good class even if you made a 5 on the AP Bio exam, and approachable even w\/o prior AP Bio experience.",
    "I would say it is easy content wise, but difficult because of the weekly quizzes. I would recommend it because it is a requirement for many majors.",
    "It's a brief overview of molecular biology which touches lightly on biophysics. I would recommend it to another student because it is an informative and manageable course.",
    "BIOL 101 is a very straightforward class with clear and fair expectations and a moderate amount of studying\/weekly assignments. The material is interesting, especially if you are planning on studying the life sciences or going to medical school. If you have taken AP Biology in high school, you will be extremely well prepared from this class, and a lot of the material will be review of concepts that you are already familiar with.",
    "Take this if you have to or if you're interested in biology. I didn't do bio in high school and it wasn't that hard. Honestly, if you just study a decent amount the class isn't very difficult.",
    "Odds are you are taking this to fulfill some sort of requirement. Wouldn't suggest this class to someone who didn't need to take it unless you are really interested in bio and have some background. Otherwise, take it credit\/d.",
    "Good course. Very good introduction to research papers and critical thinking.",
    "BIO 101 is a lot of memorization of facts and does not particularly address thematically interesting topics in biology.",
    "Professor Koelle is a great lecturer and also very engaging. He provides more information than is necessary for the course, but it all relates in some way, shape, or form, to the material being covered and makes it all more interesting. He is open to meeting with students (Wednesday lunch lotteries) and answering questions (~5 minute Q\/A session at the end of lecture right before you leave). His \"Professor Challenges the class\" slides were always very enjoyable and allowed for lots of active discussion in one of the otherwise largest and most cutthroat lectures at Yale. You can almost always feel the tension in the room and everyone's stress is overwhelming at times, but what else can you expect from a required Pre-Med course? The quizzes weren't always exactly fair, and be prepared to put up with picky grading. I.E. putting \"Prepare a cell extract\" will get 0 points while the accepted answer was \"burst the cell,\" despite the fact that the first basically equals the second. That being said, they recommend you write in pencil, but you can only get your quiz regraded if you write in pen, so you should really do that instead. The large lecture and the amount of overqualified students (the main content of this lecture is really just a review of AP Bio) make it necessary to have overly picky grading and questions that are unnecessarily difficult and nuanced that have to be answered in short periods of time. Without this kind of method, the grade distribution wouldn't be as wide and they (obviously) can't give everyone A's, so just hold your breath and get through it. It's probably required for your major\/career track anyway. Good luck!",
    "DO NOT RECOMMEND. This course was one of the worst (if not the worst) courses I've taken at Yale so far (I'm a sophomore). From the first lecture, they tell you that they will focus on applying concepts we've learned to new questions, rather than making you memorize tons of terms. This leads to tests and quizzes where even if you know everything they asked you to learn, you can still get a 0. The grading is insanely unfair, and I'm not saying this as a bitter student. If you do not write exactly what they want, expect no credit for the answer. Even if what you write is the equivalent of the wording they want, they will not give you credit. The course coordinator keeps insisting that everything we need to know is in the one-page study guides given out for each lecture. This is one of the biggest lies I've ever heard- if you want to do well, expect to have to look up millions of things by yourself. If you just memorize the study guides, you will fail the quizzes. Further, this \"application of concepts to new problems\" basically means they will give you quizzes with questions that have answers completely outside of what you learned in class. If you have covered a concept, they'll try to fit it into a question that is completely unrelated and useless in the real world. The \"review\" session for the final test was a huge waste of time. If you come prepared with questions, the TA's, who seem adamant on not giving straight answers, will \"hmm\" and \"uhhhh\" between themselves for a few minutes before giving you a vague answer that doesn't really answer anything. They say things like \"Hm... we never covered that\" when in reality, we were told to know it. There seems to be no communication between TA's or course coordinator or professor. People who are taking this class probably are doing it because they have to- I'm sorry for everyone who has to go through it. This is truly one of the classes that made me regret coming to Yale for a STEM education.",
    "You're probably premed, so you'll probably take it no matter what. If you're not premed, and on the slight chance you're a physical science major looking to get a bit of a bio background, just take 101 and not 102 (I guess this might just be for chem majors bc I don't know what requirements for other STEM majors might be) and then you can take biochem later. Also DO ENRICHMENT if you don't have an AP bio background or if you just don't feel comfortable with your bio background. It's such a small extra commitment, but it's really helpful.",
    "As an absolute beginner in biology, I felt that biology 101 was still manageable and was well taught. I would recommend utilizing piazza if you have a question and you want the answer before you can visit your TA or the peer tutors.",
    "Biology 101a was the most thoughtful and well prepared introductory course I have taken at Yale. Here are the main reasons why this course was successful in my opinion. 1. The lecture slides were prepared and distributed well in advance of the actual class, allowing the instructor and students to be prepared. 2. It was clear the homework and discussion section problems were reviewed and done by the instructor and teaching aids BEFORE they were assigned or graded. In contrast, I often bring problem sets to TFs in other (intro) classes and they are totally unprepared to answer questions. I am a Yale student. Most of us \"google\" and \"youtube\" and consult the textbook before coming to office hours. If the TF has not even read the question before this point, our meeting is most likely going to be a waste of time. THANK YOU TFs of BIO101a. I know that it sucks to go over introductory material, but that's what educators do. Thank you for being educators while in the role of Teaching Fellows. 3. The class was not focused on memorizing meaningless numbers or facts. It was clear to us that if we wanted to continue a career in biology, we would have to memorize a lot of terms and definitions. But, this INTRODUCTORY course was what it should be. A survey of fundamental biology concepts, and a look at the frontier of biology. It was exciting. It could prompt students to consider biology as a career, and not scare them away. 4. The grading was not punitive. Yale graduate students often mark exam and homework questions wrong with no explanation that would help students in the learning process. They also take points off for simple mistakes, such as a decimal point being in the wrong place. It is clear that assignments and exams are not learning tools, but instead inconvenient distractions from important graduate student research. The comments I got from BIO101a were helpful to my comprehension and ENCOURAGING in their tone. 5. The active learning component of the class was childish on the surface. But, I think it really helped my learning. It was encouraging to have a safe place to say \"I don't know,\" and realize that I was not the only one. Also, it was clear that our guesses during pair and share were NOT wrong as long as we were using what we had learned so far.",
    "Good class but grading is a little hard. Worth taking.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. It was not too much work and left me with a much greater understanding and appreciation for biochemistry and biophysics. I have not heard good things about the following intro biology module, but I can at least say BIOL 101 is taught very well by very knowledgable and kind people.",
    "This is a large class, and it's difficulty depends on your familiarity with the material coming into the class. If you've taken AP Bio, you know everything already. If you haven't taken an advanced biology course, you're at a serious disadvantage. Enrichment was helpful, but there's still a disparity.",
    "It's really not that bad. People complain about it a lot, but I learned so much in only 6 weeks. The material is stuff everyone should know. Not just pre-meds\/STEM majors.",
    "BIOL 101 is a very straight forward course. If you study in small chunks at a time you will do really well on the weekly quizzes and the final. I would recommend BIOL 101 to another student because it teaches you the skills to begin the BIOL 101-104 sequence. It challenges you to use what you are taught to find the answer to novel problems which I think is an important skill."
