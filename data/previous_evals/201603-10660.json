   "comments": [
    "New and important insights into how institutional investors think. Dave and Dean were the best teachers I have ever had.",
    "I may have learned more in this course than in any other I have taken at Yale. Professor Swensen and Professor Takahashi make the material accessible to students with any background--whether in finance or completely unrelated. It was incredibly cool to gain insight into Yale's investment strategy and also to hear from the fund managers, to learn about investing from both the institutional perspective and manager perspective. This class sparked my interest in investing as a potential career path, which was not something I had seriously considered beforehand. After taking this course, I have a much better high-level understanding of investing, in terms of asset classes, diversification, risk, etc.--and also a much better deep understanding about different types of investing (short selling, venture capital, real estate, etc.).",
    "Having the managers come in and speak to the class definitely helped me develop a much better understanding of investment strategies than I would have from just reading. In addition, the short papers helped me to develop a different, more concise writing style that I think will be useful in the future.",
    "Understanding investing",
    "This class gave me more insight than any other class I have taken at Yale. I learned a lot of concrete information about finance and investments, but the real insight from this course came from listening to the experiences of Dave and Dean.",
    "Great class! I developed a whole different investment philosophy and learned from the best",
    "I learned more in this class than I ever did before. We learned a tom about different investment strategies and what makes a good investor. It was truly inspiring to be in a class taught by David and Dean",
    "I learned about different approaches to investing -- both across and within different asset classes. I also learned a lot about institutional investing and the needs of endowments. Finally, I learned how to write short analytic briefs."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Absolutely tremendous class.",
    "I think the small class size is a major strength of this course. It leads to an intimate class setting where everyone feels comfortable--and is encouraged to--participate. Both class meetings with Professor Swensen and Takahashi, and the managers, were very interactive and engaging. I also think the coursework is set up very well--the papers after each guest speaker really challenged me to reflect upon, and synthesize, what I had learned in each class. Both professors and Sophia were always very clear about what was expected for each assignment and made themselves available for extra help.",
    "The manager visits were definitely a huge strength of the course. In addition the discussions that David and Dean led were always very engaging. The spacing of the assignments was a bit frustrating at times. For example, we had to prepare our ethics presentations while we were also trying to finish up one of the papers, and we didn't get the case information until the last minute. Secondly, it would have been nice to get the papers back more promptly so we could incorporate the feedback into our future work.",
    "Very tough to say, perhaps more interesting homework assignments rather than just summaries of the managers",
    "Slow\/lack of feedback\/grades on writing assignments. Impossible to tell how you're doing in the class.",
    "I thought this course was excellent. I think the only way it could be improved would be to have received feedback sooner. We did not receive grades on the memos until after more had been due, which made improvement throughout the course difficult. I am certain that had I received feedback on the memos sooner, I would have been able to improve the later ones.",
    "Great class but a lot of work was needed to do well",
    "The teachers were amazing and there was really nothing that could have gone better",
    "Strengths: the teaching, the readings, and the incredible guest speakers Weaknesses: Sometimes things are assigned very last minute, which can be frustrating. Also, feedback on papers can be slow, making it difficult to incorporate critiques into future assignments.",
    "I very much enjoyed the guest speakers, particularly those that had us participate in class-wide exercises. I also thought that the short papers were an effective way of teaching us to consolidate our thoughts. That said, I didn't learn all too much about investing that I hadn't already learned. It felt more like a lecture series than a class with actual content. The final paper did not seem to build on any of the previous work on the class. We learned a lot about how others see investments, but did not learn anything about sourcing, modeling, or analysis."

   "comments": [
    "Absolutely, once in a lifetime experience with celebrity teachers who actively engage students.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to any student who has the opportunity to take it. I learned more than I have in any other econ course at Yale, in a collaborative, intimate and engaging class setting, which is very unique. It was incredibly cool to hear from top-tier investors in guest lectures about their strategies and relationships with Yale. Expectations for assignments and presentations were always clear, and each one gave us the opportunity to reflect on and synthesize what we had learned. If you are lucky enough to have the opportunity to take this course, it is a no-brainer!",
    "If you are interesting in investing and have a chance to take this class I would definitely recommend it. Dave and Dean are both incredibly knowledgable and it is really a rare opportunity to be able to interact with them every week. The visits from some of the endowment's investment managers are also an amazing learning experience. The one drawback of the course was that the spacing of the assignments was sometimes frustrating (they were often clustered together pretty inconveniently) and it took a very long time to get feedback on the five short papers.",
    "Absolute take. If you don't get in, don't fret - the private equity class is another great class to learn about investing. The course if wonderful. 5 great investors come in to speak to you - some of whom are legendary. 5 4-5 page papers as well as a final paper and reading. A good amount to learn, but if you're interested in investing, a must take.",
    "Great seminar, amazing teachers (Dave and Dean) as well as great guest speakers. No exams, but lots of participation, readings and writing assignments throughout the class (as well as some classes that require heavy prep, sometimes group work -and 15 page final paper). Definitely take if the class content is interesting to you, as they are Dave and Dean are clearly the best to learn from when it comes to investing. You will definitely learn a great deal, get to interact with pretty awesome people in different realms of investing, and the class is full of amazing students.",
    "I absolutely take this course if you get into it. Dave and Dean are investing legends, and getting to spend a couple of hours a week with them is a privilege. Aside from a lot of technical finance knowledge, the greatest thing to come out of this course is their experiences and insight. The readings took a lot of time, but I tried to do all of them, including the optional readings, because I wanted to get as much as possible out of the course. There are also some last-minute group assignments that were time consuming. Besides class participation, the grades in the class come from five short memos and a final paper, all of which were reasonable. One of the best parts of the class is the outside speakers that come in, all of whom bring lots of stories and advice.",
    "Yes if u can get in",
    "1000%",
    "You must take it if you get in! It is definitely A TON of work, but 100% worth it. I would recommend even if you're not going into finance. It will give you invaluable real world skills and knowledge.",
    "If you've worked in investments before, this class will not teach you all that much. The guests he brings in are super interesting, and you learn a lot about institutional investing, but the class isn't as much of an intellectual challenge as I would have hoped. That said, if you're interested in learning from Swensen\/Takahashi, it's a great forum for asking any questions you want."
