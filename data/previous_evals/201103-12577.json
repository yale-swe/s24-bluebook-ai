   "comments": [
    "DS Literature is a good introduction to some of the most respected literary works of antiquity. That being said, the course moves quickly, and it can be frustrating, especially if you want to explore individual works in greater depth.",
    "Duval is absolutely amazing. Fight tooth and nail to have him as a teacher. He is astoundingly brilliant and perhaps the best grader I have ever had for a class. I have never gotten such a low grade on an essay before, but I deserved and he told me why .... in a three page single spaced comment. As a result, my writing has improved immensely and I am happy every time I enter that class.Fight to have Duval!",
    "If you have your health, a very strong work ethic, a love for analyzing literature and a natural ability to think and write critically about literature, then this course is perfect for you. Taking DS is extremely difficult and painful and at times not at all fun, so if the pros for you don't outweigh these cons, don't take the course.",
    "Directed Studies is just an awesome way to study all the great Greek and Roman Classics, as well as attempts to reconcile them with Christian faith, from a Literary context rather than a Latin class or a religious class context.",
    "DS Literature is my favorite of the three courses in DS. I find the literature most exciting and interesting, and also most cohesive. The majority of texts are very interesting on their own and are actually made more interesting by insight and discussion during section, so try to get a good section! Lit lectures were generally very helpful to aid in understanding the text as well. Professor Duval was amazing, he knew so much about each text and really made the texts even more interesting and fascinating. I was never bored during section. He is great a leading the discussion and also gives very long, detailed, helpful feedback on papers, and is more than willing to meet with you to discuss papers any time.",
    "If you are taking DS, Duval is the lit professor you want. He does not expect outside work besides the papers and the readings and as an expert in French\/Classics\/Everything under the sun, there is no one better to take literature with. He is uniquely devoted to the students and to the discussions which we have. He critiques your papers in depth (very helpful) and will often send long emails about details we couldn't address adequately in class (they're awesome emails). Take this class.",
    "Only take this class if you actually intend on doing a majority of the reading. If you are interested in the material (look at the syllabus beforehand), then you should definitely take this class and take it with Duval. Otherwise, this class is probably going to be miserable. For the texts that I wasn't interested in, going to section was kind of a drag (despite Duval's charm) and I didn't really enjoy it as much.Also, I didn't really have this issue, but I know that he gave some REALLY harsh grades to people. They all still love him, though. If you can handle stricter grading and keep up with your work, then DS might be a good option for you.",
    "DS Literature is beyond any literature class you have take in the past. You will be asked to engage some textually rich and sometimes dense works in a short amount of time. Reading, understanding, and mentally synthesizing the material requires more work than I expected going in. Only take the course if you are truly interested in the material on the syllabus.",
    "I would definitely recommend it, and DS in general! I love it intellectually and appreciate the opportunity to read so many great books, though I understand the frustration that the course moves so quickly and doesn't have time to go as deep as such works really deserve. I also love having a community of people with similar interested and shared experiences. I thought it made the transition into freshman year much easier!",
    "I personally would not recommend Directed Studies (though I would definitely recommend courses with certain professors in it) - I found it wasn't for me, though if you're prepared for breadth of reading rather than depth, it might be for you.",
    "This course moves quickly through terrific works of literature, but I found that the fast pace of the course was worthwhile because what it gave us was a portrait of literary development from Homer to Dante. To be able to read works like the Aeneid and the poetry of Ovid after having read the Iliad and the Odyssey is an amazing experience and gave me a better understanding of each work I read because I was able to have some idea of the literary context in which it which it was written and the earlier literature that it was a product of. This course is driven by class discussion and though it moves quickly, there is an emphasis on close reading of the text. Professor Duval is an amazing professor who will ask you to pay attention to details in the texts you read and will improve your writing by challenging you to push both your ideas and your writing style. He is also very approachable and will make time to meet with students.",
    "I would definitely recommend it; it was the most consistently enjoyable of the three",
    "I would definitely recommend this course--although it is a lot of work, it is a good introduction to works of (mainly classical) literature, read in translation."
