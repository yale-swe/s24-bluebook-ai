    "This is a great class- the class is tailored for the level of each student. That is, don't worry if you think it will be too easy- Seemaji will expect more from you than from others, or don't worry it will be too hard. Also, it is fun, and you learn a decent amount",
    "great course. seemaji rocks. fun discussions.",
    "This is an incredibly well-designed class: you get an insight - through a rigorous study of language - into one of the most beautiful and nuanced cultures of our time, and a very special segment of that culture (the diaspora). The material is very well-selected. It's diverse in terms of theme and form.",
    "I would recommend it. But be prepared to not learn as much Hindi as on a more formal class.",
    "yes, by all means",
    "I would definitely recommend HNDI157 to another student. The class really helps you to practice your conversational Hindi. From day one you immerse yourself in the language, and I don't think there's any better way to learn it.",
    "DO IT! Learning more about the diaspora was so engaging for me as a student from india. It's a topic we should all be familiar with.",
    "Yes!! It's a language that is growing in popularity and will only get more important as India grows on the world's stage. So if you are looking for a great language course that breaks away from the standard Chinese\/Arabic crowd, Hindi is a great option.I've never regretted it and I've made some of my best friends in the course and learned an incredibly fun language I never thought I would take initially.",
    "Yes! Absolutely! Great way to improve Hindi reading, writing,& speaking skills. But, also incredible way to apply knowledge of language into culture - look at topic such as diaspora through various pieces of literature, interact with writers of Hindi literature, interact with members of Indian diaspora! Fantastic class! Lots of fun! You learn a lot! But the work isn't stressful!"
