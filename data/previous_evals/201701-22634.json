   "comments": [
    "Very good class to know advanced immunology and very good discussion on the class.",
    "Strength of the course is the focus on \"big picture\" view of important topics.",
    "Strengths: The focus on unanswered questions in immunology was interesting and useful. Most of the faculty instructors were well prepared and selected papers that were interesting and thought provoking. Weaknesses: I was not interested in some of the topics selected. Some faculty were also better than others in stimulating discussion. Although we received a score from each professor (I believe based on the written response as well as for class discussion), we received virtually no feedback on the specifics of our responses to questions. This is probably my least favorite aspect of graduate school, and my most common criticism for all of the courses I have taken so far. We do spend time writing responses or papers but are almost always only given a score, which really doesn't matter (at least to me). If the faculty took time to make specific comments, criticisms, or suggestions for improvement (even if these comments were only brief, I do understand that the faculty are busy) then I think I would learn more.",
    "Discussion was more lively when there were discussion questions we could refer to rather than going over papers one by one",
    "Good selection and organization of course topics. May have been a little heavy on microbiota, but otherwise good.",
    "Usually engaging discussion. Interesting topics. Most faculty were good at leading discussion, but a few could have been better at fostering discussion (some faculty cut off students)"

   "comments": [
    "Very good class to know advanced immunology and very good discussion on the class.",
    "Nice opportunity to hear from faculty their thought process when approaching these topics.",
    "Yes: I found the discussions (on the whole) to be helpful and informative. The course's focus on unanswered questions was the strongest point of the class, and this type of course seems rare (i.e. most courses focus on learning something that is already known). I also found the discussions which centered around an unexpected immunological finding to be the most interesting and thought provoking. By 'unexpected,' I mean a finding that would not necessarily have been predicted based only on the principles taught in the introductory course. I did enjoy the class and this was probably my favorite class I have taken in graduate school so far, but (as I mentioned above) I do think there should be some feedback other than just a grade.",
    "Yes. It is a great chance to interact with diverse faculty.",
    "Yes",
    "great opportunity to build skills and knowledge base of immuno. interesting subject matter. reading + 1 single-spaced page\/week writing requirement, which required more time than my other classes. overall worth it, feel like a more competent immunobiologist after taking this class."
