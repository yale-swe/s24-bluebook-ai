   "comments": [
    "Readings course in issues of economics, class, race, gender in 20th century American history. Fast paced; intense reading load; outstanding opportunities for class discussion. Highly recommended for anyone with an interest in the subject material; however, everyone should understand that this class though totally worth it is very challenging and demanding.",
    "Take this course knowing that the pace is very fast, the reading assignments are really heavy, and Professor Klein is kind and brilliant yet tough. The course focuses mostly on economic history through political economy and labor. If cultural or social economic history is what you're looking for, those subjects are included in the readings for this course, but they are not the focus of the readings or the discussion."

   "comments": [
    "This was a very helpful class; very important;often issues covered in this class are neglected in others and ignored by historians who are not specifically concerned with economics\/class\/capitalism etc. Very useful in conjunction with other classes this semester; great for future research ideas\/projects.",
    "I learned a great amount about political economy from this class, and about a particular kind of economic history. While the work I intend to do for my dissertation will focus more on social economic history, this course was helpful in guiding me through a good deal of reading on the political economy side of things."
