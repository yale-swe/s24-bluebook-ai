   "comments": [
    "I would recommend it. And if its your first time dealing with graphic design ignore the snob. Everyone else was great and there is always appreciation for everyones work, and an effort to understand your style.",
    "Good course and not too hard.",
    "Yes, take it. The course teaches you the basics of graphic design and it can be time consuming but it's worth it.",
    "ART 132 is a fun and low-key introduction to the graphic arts. Assignments were fun and crits were usually quite benevolent and laid back. Skip to intermediate if you've got some background, however.",
    "Yes, take it. It's fun and informative. People complain about cutting up paper but it's really really really not a big deal. Homework only takes a few hours a week on average. Really not that bad. And the crits are forgiving and constructive, don't worry about \"messing up\".",
    "Yes! This course has encouraged me to concentrate in Graphic Design within the art major. It's quite a bit of work, but I feel you really benefit from all the assignments and it's a wonderful course for people who are daunted by more traditional fine arts like painting.",
    "The course was a great introduction to the foundations of graphic design - composition, form, typography and methods. A number of comprehensive projects and a lot of critiquing, which got a bit tiring toward the end of the semester, but was pretty helpful. I definitely saw improvement after each project re-draft. Prof. Bittiner is knowledgeable and helpful, a bit talkative so you need to plunge in with comments if you want to be of help to your classmates. The final project - a collection catalog - is SO COOL. You work with your hands a lot - computer is toward the end of the year. Overall, yes - I would highly recommend this class to someone looking to get involved in graphic design.",
    "it made me think about design from a different direction and craft my work with purpose. I recommend it. You have something due basically once a week and one overarching project that you work on steadily over the entire course.",
    "Art 132 is an introduction course to graphic design, both physical craft and digital work. I would recommend this class to anyone with an interest in art, but not to someone who is not interested in art history or studio design.",
    "I would summarize the course as an introduction to graphic design that involves learning how to communicate through design elements and working through projects in a multiple step process. It is largely centered around class critique. Most of the class does not involve computer programs until the final project. I would recommend the course to another student because it is a good introduction to graphic design.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS. Even if you're not particularly interested in graphic design, it will change the way you see visual problem-solving. Julian's a fantastic instructor and the projects are fun\/interesting. You won't regret it!",
    "Intro Graphic Design is a very hands on class. Cutting, pasting, arranging and rearranging is the main procedure of the course. If you are a craftier art person the course is really enjoyable and a great change of pace from your other classes. Until this class I had never realized all of the intricacies and dilemmas in the field of graphic design, especially in font design\/choice. If you want to work with computers, this is not the class, but I strongly suggest it for craft enthusiasts and as a required level 100 course all the same. Be warned though, class time is not for working on projects--almost every two hour slot is devoted to critiquing work made at home."
