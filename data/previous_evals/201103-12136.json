    "This is a very interesting class. I just took it for a RoW credit, but I found the lectures very engaging and enjoyed doing the readings. The papers weren't difficult, and the final paper was especially fun to write--it was a narrative about someone or something that passed through the empires. I would definitely recommend this class. The reading can be a lot, but you don't really *have* to do all of it--I would do as much as possible, though, as it really enhances the class. The point being, don't not take this class because of the reading--the reading is so interesting that you won't really mind it, and it isn't a grade-killer if you have to skimp on it sometimes. I would definitely recommend taking this class.",
    "Take it if you're interested in a 16th-century world view, the rise and fall of empires, and Islamic history. Topics related to ethnicity, gender, and movement are also brought up.",
    "Was not my favorite course. I just didn't really find the material very interesting at all.",
    "If you're interested in the subject matter but haven't read a lot about it, this class is perfect for you, because reading a lot about it is just what you'll do. Professor Mikhail is a respectable lecturer, not a great one, but his knowledge is great and he'll happily share anything with you you want to know.This class covers a LOT of ground pretty quickly, and if there's anything in particular that you want to know more about, feel free to become particular interested in and dig through the material for info on that. There are plenty of other sources available that Professor Mikhail will help you find.Turkic warlords, fiery poetry, powerful slaves, and the origin of coffee--lots of cool shit here!",
    "The class is solidly good. There are few better other-world credits available. The professor is very nice and engaging; the work load is very manageable. One class presentation, one midterm paper and one final one which is more like writing a chapter in a good historical fiction book, which makes it very fun."
