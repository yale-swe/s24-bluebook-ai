    "This class sucks",
    "I would not take this class unless you have to take it. You will not learn useful concepts, but rather just do a lot of complicated math.",
    "Just an extension of Microecon but if you can take it with Professor Bergemann definitely do it. Lectures are to the point and grading is very reasonable",
    "Same material as Intro Micro but much more Calculus based. I found it enjoyable but make no mistake, this is a quantitative class.",
    "Econ 121 is just a more mathematically rigorous version of Econ 115, so base your judgments off of that class. If you understood concepts well in econ 115 and have a strong math background, you will be fine.",
    "If you want to go on to study economics after undergrad, this is a good base. otherwise, you probably just have to take this for your major. it's not fun.",
    "Intermediate Microeconomics with Professor Dirk Bergemann is a fabulous, fabulous course. If you liked the pareto efficiency, game theory, and lottery stuff from Introductory Microeconomics, you need to take Intermediate, because you will love it. It's all concepts and math and people and graphs and utility and math and greatness, especially with Professor Bergemann. This class moves at a pretty quick pace, and it covers a lot of material, but it's all really interesting, and there are certain patterns of thinking that make keeping up become somehow more manageable as the semester progresses. The hardest part is seemed to strike at the beginning, so once you get through chapter 2 (mathematical techniques), things will probably get a bit easier. The problem sets can be tough, and the exams can be even a bit tougher, but if you work to really understand the concepts and the goals, you'll be all right. If you liked Intro Micro, I would really recommend this course.",
    "You have to take it for your major, probably. I am EPE and took it Credit\/D which was the best decision ever.",
    "If you get to choose who to take ECON 121 with, don't hesitate for a second and take it with Prof. Bergemann! ECON 121 is said to be the hardest class in the econ major, yet prof. Bergemann made it a pleasant experience. The class itself requires a lot of work and quite a lot of math background. However, in the end of the day it is all worth it. I feel that I learned a lot of useful things and really have a better understanding of microeconomics (which is not how I felt after Intro Micro)",
    "Extremely difficult. Beware of the second exam.",
    "You have to take it some parts are pretty interesting and relevant, others are just annoying and far removed from anything you'll ever do again.",
    "Hard, but rewarding",
    "Only take it if it's required for your major.",
    "I'm sure you have to take this class, and if you do, take it with Dirk. But honestly, I have no idea why EP&E students have to take this--I'll never apply it, and resent having to give up a credit and spend so much time on this course.",
    "Professor Bergemann is great! Lectures are entertaining, and above all, he is a great guy. The material is not particularly fascinating, but if you're taking intermediate micro, it is probably because you have to. Don't worry though, Econ 121 with Dirk is a pretty fun time!",
    "See response to Question 1.",
    "this class is like taking two different classes at once. the first midterm is straightforward, the second midterm and final are completely confusing and barely test the material you go over in class\/section\/problem sets. take it credit\/d and spare yourself the stress if you can.",
    "Mandatory for Econ, EPE, and Global Affairs, but I wouldn't take it unless you were in one of those three majors.",
    "Extremely difficult class. I didn't find the material particularly interesting because it was so theoretical. But if you need it for your major, you have to take it. Don't take it otherwise.",
    "no new concepts, just more math",
    "tough but must take if econ major...take in spring with dirk if have option",
    "Not a particularly interesting or easy class. I would recommend that you take it only if you have to.That being said, Professor Bergemann tries to make the material as interesting as possible and is at times very funny. I would recommend that you take this course with him.",
    "Probably the most challenging course I've taken so far at Yale. But if you're taking it, you probably have to. Psets take a while and although the first midterm wasn't that bad, I thought the second midterm was a nightmare. Even though it's challenging, once you get through it you really feel like you accomplished something. Professor Bergemann is really nice and approachable though. I wish I went to more of his office hours.",
    "If you take it, take it with Prof Bergemann! He teaches well and his lecture notes are awesome! First few psets were really difficult - get a study group! But material got easier as course went on.",
    "If you're going to have to take this class, take it with Dirk. He's very affable, humorous, and makes the material bearable. That being said, his problem sets are incredibly time-consuming, but they really make sure you learn the material. First midterm exam was fine, second exam was ridiculous, final was fine. Intermediate Micro is intense because it's chock full of econ majors, but if you keep up w\/ the textbook and lectures, you'll hold your own.",
    "If you're interested in Economics and enjoy a challenge, absolutely take this course. I struggled through the entire semester, but left the final exam with a huge sense of accomplishment and a feeling that I had learned a lot of interesting material.",
    "Although a math based course, the game theory economics behind the ideas are very interesting. This is definitely a course worth taking.",
    "Reinforces the concepts from intro micro using math. Challenging but fulfilling. Take it with some friends that you can do the problem sets with. Be prepared to work hard. Econ is fun when you can understand it.",
    "This course is quite hard not because of the teaching but because of how difficult the problem sets are in general. The professor does a fine job of teaching the material but the material is difficult any way you look at it. Simply, ECON 121 is a course you don't walk out thinking you came out with a whole lot learned, it's merely a course you have to trudge through. Make sure to go section to get help with the problem sets. Dirk is a great professor and having taken the class w\/ both Samuelson and Dirk,I can say they are about the same in terms of difficulty. The only difference is that Samuelson is able to go through the material seemingly quickly because he uses slides while Dirk goes slower because he writes on the board. That being said, Dirk went at a slower pace and had to catch up at the end, leading him to breeze through a lot of pretty difficult material. So in the end, the teaching styles even out.",
    "If you don't have to takeit, don't take this class. It's not the most interesting and the marginal benefit (ha) of learning more about microeconomics isn't very high. I personally enjoyed the material, but I am an economics major, so I also have to take this class. The problem sets were fine, and lecture was fine. The first midterm was good but the second one seemed to be the worst test ever for a lot of people. Dirk put some very old and also very unfamiliar material on the second midterm.",
    "Intermediate Micro is an interesting course and I feel like I can walk away from it knowing that I've learned a lot. Dirk can be amusing at times, which is nice because sometimes class can get a little dry otherwise. The math's not too bad if you haven't taken multi-variable calc, so don't worry too much about that. The first midterm was great, the second midterm was absolutely horrible as in it didn't reflect what we had learned in the course, and the final was challenging and fell somewhere between the two.",
    "DO NOT TAKE unless it is for the major.",
    "Yes. Great course, very interesting subject matter. Take it w Bergemann if you are an Econ major (although I hear Samuelson is good as well). It's a challenge, but finishing this course gave me a sense of accomplishment.",
    "Intermediate Microeconomics is basically Intro except with more advanced math. I didn't take mutlivariable calculus before this course and was still able to do well. This class is not nearly as bad as people make it out to be! I'd only take it if it's required for your major, but it really wasn't that painful of an experience. The material is definitely difficult to grasp, but some of it is kind of cool. I really like Professor Bergemann and think that he cares about the class a lot. That being said, he often went over proofs in class which didn't really match up with the types of problems we'd see on problem sets and exams. This meant that there were a lot of questions on exams that were different from the things we've seen before. At the same time, these questions were graded pretty leniently, and Professor Bergemann structured a nice curve that took into account the fact that some questions were pretty difficult. A big word of advice would be to do as many practice problems from his problem sets and old exams as possible and to keep in mind that writing anything on parts of a problem can give you partial credit which can go a long way.",
    "Definitely take it with Dirk if you can - he's great, and lecture is actually a lot better with him than some of the other lecturers I've had. He's really entertaining, and he'll ask the class questions to get you involved. Problem sets can be tricky sometimes, but overall, the workload is very doable.",
    "Take this class with Professor Bergemann. You will learn a lot from him. He is a very engaging lecturer, very funny, and cutely awkward! What else could we want from an Econ class? The problem sets took a lot of time (expect to spend from 5 to 10 hours in each one of them). The first midterm was very easy, the second one was BRUTAL, and the final was really fair. So, averaging everything out, I must say that this was the best choice to get Intermediate Micro outof the way. I heard that this class when taught by Larry Samuelson is extremely painful. So, you shouldn't take it. When the class is taught by Professor Faingold, it is also supposed to be painful (but easy). With Bergemann, I felt challenged, but everything was doable. Bergemann is the best choice ever!!!",
    "Would not take it unless it's a requirement.",
    "Take it if you want to understand the theory behind consumer and producer decisions. Also take it if you are quant savvy. By quant savvy I don't mean someone who's good at math, but someone who is very logical and wants to know the why and how behind the basics of micro. PSets can be long if you wait till the last minute to do them -- 5 hours minimum if it's an easy pset, have spent as much as 10-12 hours on the long ones with a buddy.",
    "Decent class that you should really only take if it's mandatory for your major; otherwise, a lot of undue stress with too much theory and not a lot of hands-on guidance.",
    "This is an awesome course. It teaches you a lot of relevant concepts for economic analysis. It basically adds the math into intro micro. This does make things more difficult but it gives you a better understanding of econ and the world as a whole.",
    "I think at this point it is only people who have to take it for their majors who are taking it. But it is actually interesting and well taught. Take.",
    "It's a challenging class in that the concepts are a little more abstract than intro and it involves more and harder math. But I did feel like I learned a lot.",
    "only if you have to",
    "I would not recommend it to anyone, but because it's a prerequisite for econ majors, just get it over with. Don't get bogged down in the understanding process because it's not going to happen.",
    "Take it of you have to. It's really hard.",
    "It was just like introductory micro, only with more difficult mathematics. I can't imagine using any of what I learned in this class outside of the field of academics. Every single example we dealt with in class and on our homework felt contrived and unrewarding, creating stupid obstacles just to get them out of the way. And it wasn't just impractical in a liberal-artsy-teaching-us-how-to-think way, either. I just feel like I wasted my time, and I might actually quit the major.",
    "A difficult class. Take it because it's required.",
    "I would recommend Econ 121 to someone who is interested in a mathematical look at micro. Lectures aren't too difficult to follow, but paying attention and attending section make understanding the material a lot easier. Problem sets can be long especially toward the start of the semester, but they aren't terrible.",
    "you have to take it, it's not as terrible as people make it out to be",
    "As a requirement for several majors, there's no way around this course. I'd recommend taking it with professor Bergemann as I feel he minimizes the difficulty of the course.",
    "ECON or EPE you will have to take it. Its not that terrible, the optimization mathematics are not as arcane as everyone makes them sound and Professor Bergemann knows his stuff.",
    "I would recommend it for someone who is genuinely interested in economics (especially the analytical and math side).",
    "This is an alright course. Take it only if you have to for the econ major. Dirk is a relatively good option, I've heard it's awful with other people.",
    "I would. It is a hard course, the hardest I have take. But, after you are done, you will be very proud of yourself.",
    "It's a more math-heavy version of intro micro. If you're really interested in economics and don't mind long problem sets, it's worth it.",
    "Take it if you're EP&E or econ. You'd be insane otherwise. Be prepared to put in a lot of work. If you put in a lot of work at the beginning (what I didn't do), it will pay off in the end. The problem sets stop taking quite so much time after spring break. (I know of close to 10 people who cried during\/right after the second midterm- so if you cry about this class you're not the only one! Don't worry- you'll get through it! It's kind of fun actually.)",
    "No!!!! do not take this. It is an awful class.",
    "This class is not very good. Too abstract, don't feel like I learned very much. Pretty difficult as well. The midterms didn't cover the materials we covered in lecture or on the psets, and overall the course seemed very poorly structured and fragmented. Dirk seems like a great guy but as a professor he was meh. As I'm sure every other evaluation will say, only take this class if you have to.",
    "It's required for the econ major. Otherwise, I wouldn't take it.",
    "Only take it if you need it for the economics major, otherwise it's a waste of time.",
    "I would only take this if you need to for your major. Otherwise, it's the psets are a pain to do every week and the tests are hard.",
    "I would definitely recommend it. Manageable workload!",
    "Yes, take it with Dirk.",
    "The class is definitely more rigorous, specifically more reliance on math and general proofs and less so on intuition. That means if you are uncomfortable with math symbols and its notations, you would need slightly harder (there was an emphasis on this in the early P-sets). That being said, the tests dealt more on specific questions and less so on general proofs. The professor can be pretty funny and overall pretty engaging. Most people taking it are probably doing it because they need it for their major. That being said, the material is pretty interesting, especially with regards to decision making. Overall, good class, workload is fair (the psets with the general proofs can sometimes be a overkill) and the 2nd midterm was a killer. I am not sure about the fall professor but from my perspective he was engaging and presented the materials clearly. Section was also super useful, so remember to go to them.ps. It's going to be an OYC so there's that as an extra resource.",
    "If you're an Econ major, you must take this class. If this is not a major requirement for you, I can't see many reasons to take this class unless you are looking for a very deep comprehension of microeconomics.",
    "If you're an Econ major, this is the best time to take it. If you aren't, why are you bothering? (unless your EPE or global affairs). Its a tough class, so be prepared.",
    "Don't take it unless you have to. Seriously.",
    "this class is hard. dirk has a german accent. he is a nice and friendly guy, but it seems like the things taught in lecture aren't necessarily the things that are on the psets.",
    "It's a requirement for a few majors and it's a great class. In addition to rehashing some of the material from intro, it uses a lot of math. The math all comes together nicely and you see how a lot of different topics are related. Professor Bergemann is great! I really enjoyed his lectures. If you're going to take an intermediate micro class, I recommend his.",
    "A useful, somewhat difficult,class on economic theory. If you can take a derivative, you know enough math. Very theory based, with occasional practical implications.",
    "Yes! Best option",
    "I only recommend this class if you have to take it or if you are an econ major simply because non-econ majors will probably find it difficult and boring, but people who truly like econ will love this class.",
    "Honestly, if you're interested in Econ or need it for your major, go for it. If you just want an upper level Econ course, I imagine there are more interesting ones, but this seems like it would give a strong Micro foundation for anyone who wanted to take more Econ in the future.",
    "I enjoyed the class for expanding and defining more rigorously the concepts in Introductory Microeconomics, but felt that the class as a whole fell in the middle of being too mathematically rigorous for some people and not rigorous enough to make me feel comfortable with the material. Some of the mathematical concepts were presented in language that some people had difficulty understanding, but they did not advance my knowledge of the scenario to a significant degree.That being said, Professor Bergemann is a great lecturer, and presents the material in a way that makes you feel smart.",
    "I would only recommend this class if it was a requirement. The material is really not very applicable to the real world and it's pretty dry and difficult.",
    "take it",
    "ECON 121 is a necessary requirement for the Economics major (and a number of other majors) which covers very important topics in economics. The material is very difficult and dense, and getting through the problem sets and material takes many hours of effort. However, Professor Bergemann is a very helpful person, and getting help in this class comes in handy. If you are interested in further economic study, this class is absolutely necessary for your growth, even though it is undoubtedly strenuous and often vapid. Taking it with Bergemann is definitely a good idea, and making a study group early on is a necessity.",
    "Tough core course in economics. Good amount of math, but you'll feel great after you finish it.",
    "Horrible class. Only take it if you have to.",
    "Math intensive look at how individual decisions and markets work",
    "This class is probably not worth taking, especially if you have had game theory or financial theory or w\/e. Just redundant and pretty boring. I think it has potential though.",
    "It's a challenge, but it is not impossible. You just have to be ready to put the work into it before midterms and finals--going to office hours, going to section, and reviewing problem sets and midterms. Taking it Credit\/D\/F was definitely a more comfortable way to get through it.",
    "If you are an EPE student, thinking whether to take this class credit\/d or not, I would recommend speaking with some (older) EPE students who have made a similar decision. Many EPE students take it credit\/d, but my advice would be to ask others before automatically taking it for credit.",
    "I would not recommending taking this if it is not a requirement, but taking it with Bergemann is less painful than other teachers (from my understanding.) Otherwise, the curve is good and the material is not interesting.",
    "very good",
    "Typically you take this course as a requirement for a major, and I think it's an appropriate difficulty and workload level for a normal econ course at Yale. Positive experience overall.",
    "Don't take it unless you have to.",
    "Yes, but do the work.",
    "Of course, intermediate micro is a required class for the econ major, and many people say it's the toughest course in the major. They're probably right. It's really math and proof-intensive (especially the problem sets), but I think you learn a lot about the actual theory behind all of the basic concepts you learned about in the introductory classes. It may be boring at times, but I think it's absolutely necessary for future economics work. Problem sets are long and intensive, and midterms can be difficult as well -- but don't worry, the curve is generous as it usually is for economics classes. Professor Bergemann is an engaging instructor but can occasionally become confusing in the middle of long explanations. Overall, Bergemann is a good choice when you're deciding to take the class.",
    "ECON 121 is a good class. If you have to take micro, you should take it with Dirk because he is tough but fair. His tests are a little crazy and the p sets can be annoying, but in the end you learn a lot and the grades turn out ok. It is the least painful intermediate micro experience at Yale as far as I can tell.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS WITH BERGEMANN. This class has been one of the most informative and interesting classes I have take at Yale. The material and problem sets may appear hard at the beginning but anyone who is prepared to work hard and to keep up is definitely able to achieve a good grade. Bergemann is highly effective lecturer and his lecture notes are extremely comprehensive. This course really opened my eyes up to how the field of economics attempts to solve the problem of scarcity and i feel that it has genuinely and permanently changed myperception of the world. Work hard, find yourself a good TA, pay attention in lecturers and you are pretty much set.",
    "Take it if you have to and if you are comfortable with math! It will be painful, especially when you spend your entire sunday working on one 5 pages long (the questions, I don't even wanna mention how long the responses were) pset.",
    "take it if you're an econ major obviously or if u took intro micro and you didn't hate it\/ like math",
    "Very hard class. Very demanding, the lectures were interesting and Dirk is a great prof. but the psets took forever and we weren't taught in any way how to do them in class (but were given some help in section) and the tests, besides the first midterm, were even harder than the psets. The final was totally unrelated to the course.",
    "Ugh. It was rough. I did not enjoy it, but you have to take it. On the plus side, I learned some interesting things about economics, and I definitely feel more prepared to take on higher level economics courses.",
    "Econ 121 is intermediate microeconomics. Only take the course if you want to learn about microeconomics and cannot take the intro course or are an economics major. THe course is too difficult to be taken as a \"fun\" course",
    "I would not recommend ECON 121 as a course to take just for the fun of it, but to meet a requirement, it was not a bad econ course. Unless you're really interested in the material, lectures can be a bit dull at times, but Professor Bergemann clearly cares about his students succeeding and does his best to present the material clearly and clarify when necessary. I found the tests rather difficult, but the curve was fair. The problem sets were also at times challenging, but also very helpful to developing one's understanding of the material (if you do take this course, make sure you have someone to compare problem sets with - it helps to commiserate\/mitigate any frustration, in addition to improving one's grasp of the material)."
