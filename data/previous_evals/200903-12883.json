    "It's a creative writing class that focuses on too many genres at once, but I think if the more frivolous homework were eliminated that it would be okay. Nothing very special, though. You should know if you like creative writing or not already.",
    "I would not recommend this class for people who just want to improve their Spanish. If you are serious about creative writing you will like it.",
    "I would recommend this to a student who is very comfortable writing in spanish - it is a VERY intensive writing course. But, if completed, it is very satisfactory.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class to other students interested in learning how to write better in Spanish."
