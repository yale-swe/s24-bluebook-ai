    "Take it if Kiarie is teaching--otherwise don't.",
    "To be clear: This semester was taught by Professor John Inniss, otherwise known as Mwalimu Mtembezi. Usually introductory Swahili is taught by Mwalimu Kiarie Wa'Njogu, who is a fantastic professor and a wonderful man. Swahili is one of the coolest languages I've come across, the class under Kiarie is a whole lot of fun, the people who take Swahili are all really great, and the African Studies Department is one of the best-kept secrets at Yale, a true gem that should be discovered sooner rather than later in your college career so that you can spend as much time there as possible. If you're considering taking Introductory Swahili with Kiarie, TAKE IT.If, however, you are reading this because Professor Inniss \/ Mwalimu Mtembezi is teaching another class at Yale, I don't care what that class is, DO NOT TAKE IT. This semester of Swahili was unbelievably frustrating and disappointing, and the only reason anyone stayed with the class at all was the beautifulness of the language (and the fact thatyou have to take a full year of an intro language to receive credit). We had no practice speaking, no explanations of grammar, unbelievably random vocabulary with no context, no graded homework assignments, very very strange exams (I *think* I did well in the class, but I really don't know?), no communication with the class about when things were due, and much time wasted when Mwalimu Mtembezi decided to rant to us, in English, about rather bizarre subjects. (For example: African Skit Night. A fantastic tradition that the department takes unbelievably seriously and may just be one of the best nights of your semester. Mwalimu Mtembezi decided to spend more time in class complaining about the skit than actually letting us write\/plan the skit, and he tried to insist that instead of \"embarrassing ourselves\" with a skit we should instead make a movie...a movie that makes fun of disabled people. Not okay.)So if Mwalimu Mtembezi comes back, run in the other direction. If you're considering Swahili with Kiarie, however, TAKE IT TAKE IT TAKE IT, it will be one of the best decisions of your college career.",
    "Take Swahili! It's a fun, laid-back class and you get to learn a really cool language that is not that difficult.",
    "I recommend Swahili to any student with an interest in East African culture. It is a great way to become immersed in a unique and interesting culture.",
    "I would recommend this course if John Kiarie was teaching (or rather id Dr. Inniss was not teaching which I believe will be the case next year). I don't know what to say about the class because i feel like I did not really learn anything from it. There was no structure, no modules, no role plays, no time to practice speaking whatsoever. I was left feeling rather disappointed by the class. But i think this is more of a problem on the administration side. You can't just put a speaker of a language in a class and expect him to be able to teach a class. I wonder if the heads of the program even evaluated him at all, or sat down to see how he taught. He did the best he could and tried to revise the class at some point but he was clearly very uncomfortable. It was as though nobody informed him about the structure of Yale's classes, deadlines, midterms\/finals, how to operate the computer system in the class. Dr. Inniss is a great man but I was frustrated with the class throughout."
