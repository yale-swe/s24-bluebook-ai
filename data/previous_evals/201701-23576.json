    "Instructor: Mario Jr. Alipio Soriano \u00a0My experience with Mario was limited to test review sessions, but he was an excellent leader of those sessions and provided clear direction and insight.",
    "Instructor: Mario Jr. Alipio Soriano \u00a0Mario was great. Though I only attended one study session with Mario, he was very patient, helpful, and explained any course material the group struggled with clearly and thoroughly. Because students have a lot of questions during study sessions, my only suggestion for Mario is to focus on the most important questions and resolve the rest later so that we could touch on all of the material outlined for the session in a timely manner.",
    "Instructor: Mario Jr. Alipio Soriano \u00a0I think he could have been a bit more supportive if you were struggling to understand a concept",
    "Instructor: Mario Jr. Alipio Soriano \u00a0The office hours were offered shortly after the pset was assigned which made them not as useful time-wise. Other than that, I have no recommendations.",
    "Instructor: Mario Jr. Alipio Soriano \u00a0He had a very good understanding of the subject and wide experience",
    "Instructor: Mario Jr. Alipio Soriano \u00a0Mario knew his stuff and was always willing to help.",
    "Instructor: Mario Jr. Alipio Soriano \u00a0I think Mario did a great job! Though I kind of wish that there had been time for more of an open question session for the midterm\/ final review, not just a standard 4 to 5 problem worksheet to complete. I just had other questions I needed answered...and the review sessions didn't allow for free-form question-and-answer.",
    "Instructor: Mario Jr. Alipio Soriano \u00a0He was very patient and thorough and stayed over time with us during test-prep sessions. He's very good at math and I think sometimes his trigonometric explanations of how to solve complicated word problems scared\/off-put some of the class that is a bit weaker in math\/more exam oriented.",
    "Instructor: Mario Jr. Alipio Soriano \u00a0Mario patiently went through and issues I had with course material. The only thing I wish was a bit different were the marks on the problem sets. Could have used a more thorough explanation of what I actually did wrong and what the correct answers were. That or a corrected key posted to Canvas.",
    "Instructor: Mario Jr. Alipio Soriano \u00a0Mario was super helpful and responsive. He was a great TA",
    "Instructor: Mario Jr. Alipio Soriano \u00a0Answers to questions were sometimes vague or unsatisfying. It seemed like better communication between the TA and the professor may be needed since there were some mistakes on the practice problems sometimes that made the review sessions more complicated than necessary.",
    "Instructor: Mario Jr. Alipio Soriano \u00a0Mario is a specialist in hydrology, sometimes forgetting how a non-hydrologist thinks",
    "Instructor: Mario Jr. Alipio Soriano \u00a0Excellent in all fronts!",
    "Instructor: Mario Jr. Alipio Soriano \u00a0Mario was incredibly patient, which was essential for this challenging course. He throughly explained concepts and would follow up with additional information if needed."

    "Jim is a fantastic teacher. The concepts are clear and the lectures are engaging. It is a pleasure to be a part of the class. I appreciate all jokes.",
    "Jim's an excellent instructor--clear and responsive to student questions. Can't speak highly enough of the lectures.",
    "I really enjoyed this course and greatly appreciate all of the time the professor put in outside of class, as well as in class, explaining the course material to make sure that it was understood by all students.",
    "Really enjoyed the class and it's balanced mix of concepts and practical applications.",
    "I didn't mind the quantitative aspects of the course but I would have enjoyed hearing a little more about some case studies using the hydrological equations and concepts to help me retain some of the ideas. As someone who will not be a field hydrologist I wonder how much of the course I will retain or find useful in the future. That is not the fault of the course or instructor it is just impossible to teach to students with so many different post graduation objectives.",
    "It's probably worth mentioning that this course isn't that useful for someone who's already been taking courses in water at FES for a year and a half. I think it might be useful to cross check the curriculum with physical sciences, Science to solutions, biogeochemistry and pollution,water resources management and organic pollutants, only because there's quite a bit of overlap. I know the course isn't built for someone necessarily you has a background in water, but maybe that's something that needs to be considered and perhaps an additional course needs to be developed for people that actually specialize in water issues.",
    "Jim Saiers is great! He explains everything very clearly, works students through the complex math without condescension or assumptions, stops and answers questions as necessary, but also keeps the class moving. Crucial class for any environmental managers who might ever deal with water.",
    "The Professor was always available to answer any questions you had. The textbook was not useful to me at all and eventually I stopped using it. A few of the readings helped but not in a significant way.",
    "The course was math heavy, real world application would have been more helpful. Most people are practioners and would benefit more from seeing these concepts applied",
    "The scope of this class was too broad. I was disappointed that there was not a course offered that explored hydrology's interface with riverine and riparian ecosystems and how to manage for the health of those systems in tandem with meeting human needs."

    "The lectures were engaging and the class was very organizedI had a good sense of what to expect and how to pace my work accordingly. I enjoyed hearing about the professor's own research as well because it provided a very clear application of some of the more abstract concepts covered. Though we did this more toward the end of the course, I found going through practice problems together as a group very helpful to my understanding of the course material. I also appreciated that the professor continually checked in with the entire group to make sure that everyone understood the material covered and spent more time explaining any content the group found confusing.",
    "Very comfortable atmosphere, where everyone was at ease asking questions, and professor was very reactive to student comments\/questions.",
    "Everything was very helpful, clear, and made easy to understand.",
    "Jim's an engaging lecturer who manages to make abstract material engaging.",
    "The teaching was really good and created interest on the subject",
    "The practical cases that were presented by the instructors and other experts in the field.",
    "Jim is an outstanding lecturer especially with quantitative material that could be very challenging to stay engaged with.",
    "I thought the problem sets were an excellent way to practice the problems we discussed in class. In some ways I wish we had more problem sets, or even optional assignments to test our understanding throughout the semester. Like the study assignment for instance was a really great way even though wasn't collected, to really see if we understood the concepts being presented. This is simply because the readings were just not that useful at all and only about 20% of any given chapter was being covered in class.",
    "I think any environmental scientist\/manager should understand the way water moves on the surface and subsurface. This class provided exactly that introduction and I'm glad I took it. Jim Saiers is a dynamic, entertaining professor; an hour and 20 minutes of equations goes surprisingly fast when Jim is leading it!",
    "The in-class process of working through the equations and the concepts behind them. Talking about the broader ecological implications of some of the more technical math.",
    "Good exposure to hydrology concepts without being too quantitative. I liked how Saiers had some classes where we focused on applied hydrology topics such as the everglades or fracking.",
    "Jim's dedication to teaching made this class. He clearly cares about his students and is determined to see them succeed. He took extensive time out to explain the course materials to me when I was stuck, and his door is always wide open -- a model I wish more professors at FES would follow. His jovial presentation style made the class engaging and fun. I genuinely looked forward to class, even if some of the material was over my head at first. It is in large part because of Jim's positivity that I was able to push through and feel good about the final and the course material more broadly. As for the course material itself, I really enjoyed the wetlands lecture and the final fracking lecture. I wish there had been more examples of how the material we were learning in class are applied in the real world. Would've given me some context for the math and concepts we learned more regularly.",
    "Jim is a great teacher. I've never had a teacher that made concepts so clear and easy to understand.",
    "I really enjoyed the guest speaker working on the Florida Everglades project, and hearing about the technicalities of fracking in conjunction with Jim's research. It was important for me to occasionally connect the more dense material we were learning to real life examples. The groundwater problem sets were also helpful in conceptualizing the material.",
    "The professor's clear and reasonable manner",
    "1. Lectures are structured and well delivered. 2. Illustrated how materials can be applied in real-world, e.g. Everglades restoration Skype-in and fracking impacts.",
    "The material was so interesting and very relevant for those working in water resources, even those on the policy side. Jim is also a hoot. He is a very engaging professor and clears cares about offering quality instruction to the students. Very learning centric environment."

    "I feel that more information could have been covered in this course.",
    "It would be great to build the class around a case study of Dr. Saiers' work on hydrofracking. That way, students would learn the science as well as an applied framework that would show how to use specific skills in context with desired goals and outcomes.",
    "No any i thought off..keep up the good work.",
    "None",
    "Only thing I could think of is perhaps a few more case studies to show how some of the concepts are used in practice. When those were provided, I found them very helpful.",
    "I'd say there were certain periods where we spent a long time uncertain topics that didn't need to be so thorough. I wish we had more time to do some more of the modeling that we did towards the end of the semester. Like use more Matlab and such.",
    "There were a few times this semester when I found the class disrespectful to the professor. I hope it was just a fluke of the time\/group\/class dynamic and would never occur in a future teaching of the course. Some of the homework assignments this term were frustrating because they required sophisticated use of software (Excel), which wasn't offered\/covered\/coordinated at the beginning of the course. The most frustrating moments of the semester for me were when I spent hours on homework assignments - not because I didn't understand the hydrological concepts or because I was struggling with equations - but because I couldn't get Excel to log-scale an axis and produce a flow duration curve (H.W. 3). H.W. should test the concepts, not our mastery of the programs! Regarding that, I appreciated Jim walking us through the MatLab assignment; homework 5 was great in exactly that sense: testing the concepts, not proficiency in MatLab, which was cool to use.",
    "I wish there had been another 1-3 classes on water quality and perhaps even management, so that we weren't just talking about quantity and movement. In other words, an overview of the most serious pollutants, where they come from, what effects they have, and how to manage for them based on some of the hydrological principles we'd learned.",
    "none",
    "I wish there had been a field trip associated with this class. I also wish there was a small lab component. Especially in a class and subject area that relies so much math to describe the physical world, seeing that world (or a lab simulation of it!) would have been useful for making the math more tangible and real. The textbook for the course also needs to go. Way too technical, and made things more confusing than clear. Either would like to see a less confusing book, or otherwise supplemental readings that connect the technical material to their application.",
    "Some of the material is really hard to visualize. Some comptuterized models, physical models, or field trips to streams etc. may help supplement the slides. For example dropping dye into a beaker of water to show dispersion. I also felt like the beginning problem sets were tedious and did not contribute to my learning of the material in a significant way.",
    "Application of hydrology to forest systems was missing",
    "1. It would have been better if we had adhered to the schedule of the syllabus and gone through all materials. Almost every class the first 20-30 mins were spent repeating materials from the previous session. As a result we had to drop the last week's topic on watershed analysis. 2. Can we include some Friday field trips, and see how hydrology is actually done on the ground? Could we visit some local reservoirs, groundwater monitoring sites, USGS stream gauge houses, etc.?"

    "Its a very well taught and the professor gives practical experiences of work he is currently doing.It is a good course to take for someone who would like to learn the foundations of hydrology",
    "The course provides a good mix of physics concepts, quantitative analyses and environmental applications.",
    "Definitely don't take this course if you have any background in engineering, because it will be way too easy. But, if you don't have a background in that it's a really great course for everything from stream hydrology to groundwater contamination. If you've already taken biogeochemistry and pollution, it may not be as useful.",
    "Take it!",
    "Do the readings; they're not that hard Ask questions in class Take really good notes",
    "Work in a group for the problem sets\/homework. You don't need to buy the text book unless you learn well from reading it.",
    "Do not be afraid of the math! It is worthwhile, and if you think of equations as stories, it helps. Go to Jim with any and all questions. This is an intimidating class for folks who are not equation inclined, but I found it to be a really rich and wonderful experience.",
    "Even if you are not a technically minded person I would challenge yourself and take the course. Jim is very patient and very accessible to answer questions. For people focusing in water it's important to have some idea of what we can and can't measure or estimate, and how complicated it can be to do so. This class also builds on some of the physical sciences material related to water.",
    "The professor is excellent at explaining things",
    "If you don't have a strong stats background, this class will be a bit challenging, but do not despair! Jim and the TA are so helpful. Never hesitate to ask them for help."
