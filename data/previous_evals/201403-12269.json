    "Just an introductory language course. I was nervous to start a language from scratch, but after the end of this semester, I feel a lot more comfortable speaking and working in Portuguese. I never would have thought that after a few months I would end up giving a ten minute presentation in Portuguese. Take it if you're interested in ever studying in Brazil or are just genuinely interested in the language.",
    "Definitely take this as your foreign language! You won't regret it. Much more chill than Spanish.",
    "Everyone should take Portuguese",
    "TAKE IT!! A super fun, non-stressful language to learn. Stephanie is the best!!"
