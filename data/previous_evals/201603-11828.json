   "comments": [
    "This class is incredibly fast-paced but the textbook and instruction build coherently and feel manageable, most of the time. The course is very carefully structured and students end the semester having learned a lot. A good instructor makes this class a pleasure. A weakness of this class was that the department seems to have very little oversight over the instruction and amount of work assigned. I was lucky to have a fantastic instructor, however, from section to section the amount of homework and in-class experience seemed to vary greatly.",
    "The fact that the course is taught by graduate students (?) makes me feel a little bit uncomfortable. Sometimes the teacher would make very simple errors that are completely contradictory to what the textbook says (I know this because I preview the textbooks but for those who don't they will just take the teacher's words for granted). But other than that the course is really good, and the teacher would sometimes organize interesting games and review sessions that are extremely engaging and helpful.",
    "A tentative syllabus that covers the expected material and potentially assigned homework.",
    "Strength: Small class sizes and regular quizzes hold students accountable for material. It's amazing how much material is learned in a single semester Improvement: I would have liked a few more short readings to see how the syntax looks in sentences in context. Maybe every other week an instructor can take part of the class to go over a short passage to show students what they are working toward."

   "comments": [
    "For someone interested in learning some Latin, this is a great class. Be advised, it moves very quickly and requires at minimum 90 minutes, if not closer to 2 hours, of work outside of the classroom daily in order to succeed.",
    "Yes I would definitely recommend this course to another student. Latin is an interesting language and it's very different from the way many modern languages work. Learning Latin is a great way to expand your perspective and to know some fun linguistics stuff. Although it's L1 this course takes you through a lot of Latin grammar (to an intermediate level, I would say), so by the end of the semester you know the participles, the subjunctives, and all kinds of clauses (which you typically won't learn until after a year or two if you are taking a modern language). The reason is that Latin doesn't require listening and speaking (and not much writing), but reading Latin alone is difficult enough. It feels like a crossword puzzle with all the complex declensions and conjugations that are less pronounced in modern languages. For those who like logical puzzles and linguistics, Latin is there for you! For those who want to learn some classics and read some authentic Roman stuff, Latin is definitely for you!",
    "Yes! But be prepared to work",
    "I would recommend it to undergraduates but not graduate students. The format does not seem conducive to the lifestyle and responsibilities of the latter.",
    "Yes, I would recommend for any student to learn Latin at Yale. The grad students who teach the beginning classes have great insights into how to learn the language and the knowledge of the language is a useful foundation for many purposes. Also, you will feel like you have learned a lot in a short amount of time."
