    "I would recommend this course, just not with Marie Lorenz if you want to actually learn how to draw. If you already know how to draw, then it is a great class to refine your skills, but coming in with no art experience, it was a struggle.",
    "It's great, because you get to draw a ton, and spend enough time that you learn what works better for you and what doesn't. Marie is a little crazy but generally wonderful - she'll always say something she likes about your drawing and sometimes give helpful criticism. The assignments are pretty varied - landscape\/cityscape, Ingalls Rink, at the YUAG, still life, portrait, she had us draw maps, all kinds of things, It took me 6 tries to try and get into basic drawing, and it was totally worth it.",
    "Basic drawing is an excellent class. If you are interested in drawing or want a humanities credit with no essays, definitely check it out. You do have to buy some supplies: newsprint pad, drawing board, charcoal, and pink eraser that comes out to ~$50. That is your main medium - charcoal. There are many \"field trips\" throughout the semester to places like the the roof of the parking garage, roof of the architecture building, ice rink, peabody, etc. where you work on different skills of perspective, curved architecture, detail work with pen, you name it. It was a very enjoyable class which felt like a study break two times a week and you only have one homework assignment per week (usually takes about 3 hours- more or less depending on you efforts).",
    "Dude(tte)...take it. It's awesome.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to any student who is mildly interested in art as a first introduction. This class allows great exploration of a student's own abilities since the focus is very intensive. It is a good class for improving drawing skills by applying and practicing them in a formal environment.",
    "Yes I would recommend this class for people who already love drawing and for those who are just looking to try it. You will improve so much and have so much fun doing it. You have to be prepared, however, that this is a time consuming class.",
    "Yes. It's a straightforward course. I recommend it. Marie Lorenz is the greatest.",
    "This is a wonderful course regardless of your artistic skills.",
    "Take this class if you love to draw. Take this class if you are willing to spend hours per assignment drawing. Take this class if you are willing to lug around a giant drawing board and get really messy working with charcoal. Do not take this class if you are not willing to do those things.",
    "What you would expect of an intro drawing class. Improved a bit and enjoyed many of the assignments. Nice break from the rest of my classes.",
    "'No experience necessary' is truly applicable to this class, though you will find a few people who are from another universe and are ridiculously talented. You mostly draw still life--buildings, random arrangements of cloth, taxidermy--and will have a blast if you have an interest in drawing. Homework does take a long time, though, even when you are using charcoal, and carrying your board around can be a major hassle. But for an introductory class, it overall has a reasonable workload and expectations. For a possible art major, this class would be satisfactory. For those who have a minor interest in art, it can get a little boring.",
    "I would definitely recommend the class to another student. Professor Lorenz is a kind and helpful professor, and her criticism is always constructive. Also, the drawing assignments are a nice break from assignments in other classes. On that note, the drawings do take a lot of time, particularly toward the end of the semester when they are more open to interpretation (eg we had to construct our own still lifes, or use our drawings to represent dreams or stories). Professor Lorenz typically assigned drawings on Thursday, and they were due on Tuesday. We spent about 75% of the classes critiquing assignments, and 25% of the classes were dedicated to in-class drawing assignments. I really appreciated the relaxed and open atmosphere of the class\u00e2\u0080\u0094Professor Lorenz gave us plenty of room to experiment with our own techniques, compositions, and ideas. Also, although we worked mainly with charcoal and newsprint, toward the end of the course she gave us more freedom to use different drawing materials.On that note, I think that it is necessary to have some drawing experience\u00e2\u0080\u0094a basic understanding of shading, highlight\/shadow, composition and perspective is very useful."
