    "Many fundamental concepts concerning enzymatic rates, conformational changes, and enzyme mechanisms.",
    "A more physical chem approach to biochem, thinking about reaction kinetics, nmr",
    "I think the course was well designed and really highlighted a lot of key concepts protein dynamics and kinetics. I think from an organic student perspective I would have liked to see some more of the reaction mechanisms because biomemtic sequences are important in synthesis strategy, but I understand that it was also the case where a good number of organic students just ended up in the class because it was the only biochemistry class we could take in the first year with the chemical biology class matching organometallics and special topis requiring the chemical biology class.",
    "More insight into the thermodynamic, kinetic, and chemical parameters that account for enzyme catalytic efficiency.",
    "I learned a lot of current techniques in studying enzymes and in evaluating current research.",
    "a broad introduction of various enzyme types. More importantly, the class taught me how to analyze kinetics data and come up with an appropriate conclusion."

   "comments": [
    "I believe I touched on this above where I think I would have liked to see some more of the actual enzyme mechanisms when discussing different systems. I think the class was well organized though through the student talks, and I know that my student talk really pushed me to dig a little deeper into the papers than I was when preparing for class",
    "I enjoyed working through the historical chronologies of much of the subject matter, and how the fields developed. However, some of the topics (such as kinetic isotope effects) were covered in great detail, while other topics were given only a cursory treatment. Strive for more balance in coverage of topics.",
    "I like the focus on primary literature, and the format of the exams. I especially liked the presentations as it gave me a chance to read and really think about a paper on a topic I was not comfortable with."
