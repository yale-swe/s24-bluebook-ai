   "comments": [
    "I really enjoyed this class and appreciated how it started from a high level primer on sociology theory and then dove into weekly topics that built on that scholarship in specific cases. Class discussion was a great mix of learning from Prof. Davis herself and discussing the papers with other students. The debates were a good shake-up to the weekly schedule and I thought the questions were really interesting! Professor Davis is an amazing professor in seminar and outside of class time. She is so clearly an expert on many topics that come up in the class, but she also does a great job of stepping back and letting students (especially those with experience on the ground in China) guide the thinking and discussion. I also really appreciate her habit of sending interesting or relevant articles and news updates to the class email list, helping us connect what we're studying to current events.",
    "A great course if you're interested in China! This was my first seminar at Yale, so didn't really know what to expect. I didn't really know what civil society was, and I hadn't read any sociology theory or relevant literature. Still, I got a ton out of this course. It has greatly re shaped my thinking on China and how one should study China. I will definitely apply what I've learned to future study and work.",
    "This class gives you a broad overview of many topics facing modern China. However, it also gives you a framework to go in more depth for papers or debates. I would absolutely recommend this class.",
    "Would recommend; you'll learn a lot about China (and sociology) even if you think you already know a lot."
