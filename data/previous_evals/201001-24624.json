    "There is a discussion of one film a week with two to three extensive readings to support the discussion in class. This class takes you through an extensive history of the development of theatrical tropes and devices used in film and also explores documentary and anti-theatricality in film. Brigitte is expert, enthusiastic, involved and approachable. The reading required is useful outside the class if your interests include psychoanalysis, film and\/or art.",
    "It was alright: we watched some great movies, and I learned some cool things about film. But I can't call it at all exciting... there was a distinctly quiet tenor to the class, encouraged by the subdued eloquence of Prof. Peucker."
