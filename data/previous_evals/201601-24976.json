    "Yes of course! If you are someone who wants to explore climate issues, this course will undoubtedly benefit you a lot, as one of the prime attractions of this seminar is the guests invited by the instructors to speak at the seminar.",
    "G&G 745: Seminary in Climate and Energy is a class that focuses on the intersection of climate and energy. The first week or two is pent covering basic earth and energy science, and then students analyze several publications on energy predictions and forecasts: from the IEA's World Energy Outlook to Shell's New Lens Scenarios and many others, and evaluate these predictions within the context of economic, political, and technological considerations. Guest lecturers with a specialty in a certain realm of energy or climate science come in and share their perspectives as well."

   "comments": [
    "This class gave me a much deeper understanding of how energy forecasts are constructed and of the obstacles facing future energy use and distribution. Through the course's initial focus on the P2015 Paris Agreement, It also gave a glimpse into how international energy regulations are conducted. I am an undergraduate student so this class did not contribute to any largescale research or dissertations, however I do believe that it gave me the skills that landed me my summer internship at the Department of Energy's Office of Energy Policy and Systems Analysis, which I will be doing in the summer of 2016."
