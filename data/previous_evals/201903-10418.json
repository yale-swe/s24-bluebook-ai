   "comments": [
    "I firstly, and most importantly, gained a true appreciation and love for art in general. I learned basic techniques in oil painting and some of history of art.",
    "Basic painting skills and a grasp over tone and composition, with some knowledge about color and line.",
    "In this course, I developed skills in drawing, painting, and perspective. In addition to learning the history and culture of different artists and their pieces, I developed my own perspective on art and style of painting. I learned how to use new materials and explain the meaning of different art pieces in the YUAG.",
    "Throughout this course, I learned about the history of painting in regards to how I can execute it. For instance, there were a lot of readings on the use of monochromatic pieces, which reflected on our beginning works that were all black and white. The professor was helpful in helping students with transitioning into the use of oil paints, how to mix them, and then the use of color in our later works.",
    "Basic oil painting fundamentals and some color theory.",

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths are the positive work environment, professor (super knowledgeable, nice, and understanding, the time allotted for each project, and limited but useful feedback from professor. My number one complaint is the cost to take the course. The materials fee is $175 and you are required to purchase materials outside of that (costing an additional $100. There is no reason as to why Yale should impose these costs on the students-- they should be subsidized.",
    "Strengths: pace was great, later projects were fun, instructors were super great and feedback was thoughtful and personal Weaknesses: personally, did not enjoy the still life projects but understand why they exist",
    "The strength of this course is that it encourages people to work hard for their grades. Rather than grading on initial artistic skill, the teacher grades based on your effort and willingness to improve. Though I came into the class with no background in painting, the teacher encouraged me to push myself artistically and always gave me an acknowledgment of pieces that may not have been as talented as other pieces in the class but was strong for my own personal development.",
    "This course had the strength of being an introductory course, meaning that everyone in my class had as little experience with painting as I had. I also enjoyed that the class was kept small, which made it easier when critiquing each other's work given that we could really pinpoint points of growth. It also helped that there was freedom to execute our own artistic styles, even if we were confined to do still life painting for the most part of the course. One area of improvement could be that the presentation part of an assignment was a little tedious.",
    "I really enjoyed the structure of the course and felt like it is a great introduction to basic painting. It's a mostly hands-off approach that let me spend the time I thought I needed in the studio. Troy did a great job of balancing the work in and out of class and it made it really enjoyable and self-driven, but overall fulfilling. I do wish, however that critiques were a little more structured and there was more constructive criticism. It's nice to hear good things about your work, but you learn much more when there are things mentioned you can improve on. I also think it would have been nice if readings were longer and taken more seriously; it'd be nice if we read more from the color-theory book we pulled chapters from; perhaps even had to buy it for the class.",

   "comments": [
    "Yes! My previous art class before this one was in 8th grade and I was probably barely average in that class. This class is graded on effort so dont worry about GPA. This class is a great way to explore your artistic side (yes, even you have one-- trust me).",
    "Yes! If you enjoy painting or want to start!",
    "no. Paying the 75 dollar class fee in addition to spending 50+ dollars on supplies is actually larceny and I wouldn't recommend anyone take this class unless they fix this issue.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course. In addition to learning painting skills, you learn the history and the culture of numerous pieces of art. You are assessed not on your initial artistic skill, but rather your willingness to improve in the class. You learn patience and attention to detail and it is an extremely rewarding class.",
    "I would recommend this course to any student, artist or not. I think it's helpful to have a background in drawing from life, but really it's more about learning painting techniques than about accuracy to life, so I would encourage anyone to take it. Be warned, though, it should not be taken as an easy course; it's a lot of work.",
    "Yeah if you're self-driven without any prior painting experience, this is an excellent class. I really really enjoyed it.",
    "yes"
