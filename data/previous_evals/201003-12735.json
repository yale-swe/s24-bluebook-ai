   "comments": [
    "Watch great movies. Talk about them. Great if you love documentaries or want to start loving them. It's an inspiring experience.",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend it. The class covers many important documentaries and documentary filmmakers and you come out of it with an understanding of the form and the way documentaries relate to our lives.",
    "absolutely take this course!",
    "Professor Roemer is one of the best professors I've had at Yale. You will learn about films, life in generalm, and yourself. Take this class.",
    "I would definitely take this course if you can get in. The films that you watch are all very interesting documentaries that you probably would never see on your own time. And the workload is very light. Three essays throughout the semester on films of your choosing. You watch all the films in class (so you don't have to watch the films on your own time unless you are going to write about them), and then you talk about them afterward. Roemer always has something interesting to say about the films and about life in general. Sitting through 3 hrs of class was never too bad because the films are great and Roemer always has something insightful to say.",
    "This class involves watching an interesting mix of films, most of which are pretty good and that you wouldn't just watch on your own. The class largely consists of Professor Roemer just talking about the films, so if you like hearing what he has to say, then take this class. He's also pretty open to discussion. The work load is light, but there's no direction on the papers at al.",
    "Yeah, go ahead and take it. But just know two things... 1. Not every documentary is American. And 2. You study pretty much one approach to the documentary, Cinema Verite. I don't feel like I have a solid understanding of all approaches to documentary and there's a lot more that could have been done. That being said, it's not a bad class and you should take it because it's pretty easy and the films are overall pretty good.",
    "If you have free Mondays, enjoy documentaries, light discussions, and no reading enjoy. But don't expect to learn really anything.",
    "You should absolutely take this course. You'll watch amazing documentaries and do very little busy work, and Professor Roemer is a great and laid back teacher. By the end of the course you might not learn anything concrete, but I really feel that I know how to watch documentaries and how to talk about them."
