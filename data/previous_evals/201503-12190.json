    "Professor Freeman is amazing. No question. This class, however, is more about history writing than history. If you want to learn how to write about history, there's probably no better place (she spends hours editing the drafts you hand in and obviously cares a lot about each student's paper). However, if you want to learn about this time period, you'd be better off taking her lecture course.",
    "Definitely take this course! The books are interesting, thought-provoking, and, at times, downright beautiful (Prof. Freeman's, Gordon Wood's, and Joseph Ellis' especially). The semester-long paper assignment makes for a really rewarding experience. Be sure to put as much as work as possible into the draftyou're likely to never again have another professor so willing to line-edit your writing and help you improve your style\/structure.",
    "An incredible course! Professor Freeman brings a unique, passionate energy to the room and the discussion. Many of my (false) assumptions before about how the creation of the American government occurred were dispelled and left a much more complex, interesting picture. She also LINE EDITS the final paper and is there to support you every step of the way. Do NOT miss out on this class!",
    "Freeman is a really wonderful and caring professor, but make sure that you're actually interested in the time period before signing up. The draft comments are helpful, but be prepared to spend a significant amount of time rewriting.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS!!! Prof Freeman is absolutely wonderful and is so dedicated to her students. I absolutely could not wait to go to seminar every week. She did an absolutely wonderful job of guiding us in discussion--making sure that everyone had the chance to talk (and felt comfortable for doing so), no one monopolized the conversation and that you ended up learning a ton from the discussion. The readings are very relevant and interesting. She does a great job of walking you through the big junior seminar paper--which very few other professors will do. A draft of the paper is due very early on, which seems inconvenient at the time, but is so helpful. Not only does the line-edit (I repeat, line edit) your draft, leaving you with enough time to revise it, but she also comments on your prospectus and meets with you at various steps of the paper process. I can't speak from experience, but I would imagine that for someone who has never written a history research paper before, this is a great class to take."
