    "I learned a lot about seeking deeper meaning behind films beyond what is readily apparent.",
    "I have gotten exposure to a broad array of films and film theory from past and present.",
    "Close analysis on films that require close analysis, directors ranging from Bergman, Hitchcock, and Ozu to Lynch, Trier, and Weerasethakul.",
    "Better understanding of obscure films \/ and genres outside of my preferences. Better understanding of how to analyze a film and all of its shots and elements.",
    "Learned about vocabulary necessary to discuss and analyze film. What I really took from the course was how impactful tiny details in a film can make a film so much better.",
    "how to evaluate details in films, characteristics of quality filmmaking, important directors\/time periods\/themes in film, ideas relating to film (ie the uncanny in relation to the shining), film phrases and terminology",
    "A great chance to revisit in detail a particular method for studying film"

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "This course is very good at exploring deep themes in the movies it explores and encouraging this type of viewing for other films.",
    "The format of weekly screening, presentation, and discussion was great. I think the professor needed to ask more pointed questions to the students to facilitate better conversation. Also, a lot of the opening questions were very highbrow and I think that we could have started from a more basic level of analyzing film and then built up from there to get to that place.",
    "Class discussions were always insightful. Readings were enormously informative. High engagement in the course is required for reaping the rewards of close analysis; you give what you get. Essays were flexible in topic and scope. Only complaint would be over-reliance on student presentations of various quality for class time.",
    "lots of cool \/ different films I would never have watched on my own! I enjoyed the class discussions and liked that each student had to present on a different film - that kept it engaging! sometimes it could be a little dull and I didn't love all of the films we watched.",
    "Strengths: Professor is very open and flexible. My specific classmates were very open to other people opinion, fostered discussion well. Weaknesses: it was a rough start for me as a someone who hadnt taken film 150",
    "The films screened are mostly excellent. Oksana is also a wonderful professor. Engagement was pretty low in this class, I think largely because it is a required class for the film major. I don't think the answer to this problem is more homework, but maybe crafting discussions so that they facilitate more participation. For example, when students lead discussion, they should mix questions for the class throughout their presentation. No laptops would help this class a great deal as well. And finally, a room that fits all of the students so everyone is at the table.",
    "strengths: weekly film viewings were very engaging and enjoyable, class discussions were engaging, presentation component brought some new\/individual ideas to each class meeting, readings were interesting weaknesses: readings were sometimes very long\/impenetrable and not the main focus of the class most of the time, so I felt as though I put a lot of work into completing them but then I didn't necessarily reap the full benefit of their content through further discussion in class improvements: incorporate\/explain the readings more during class meetings",
    "Having students present each day was a great to get engaged and learn from each other. I think the syllabus could move further outside the (white Western) canon; it would be interesting to apply 'classical' analytic techniques to non-'classical' work."

   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this course. It was well structured and informative.",
    "I would recommend this course to a student interested in being an academic in the film world, not someone interested in production. The course doesn't relate to film production very much and I think that it has the potential do so in a successful way.",
    "Yes, if you have any inclination towards cinema.",
    "Yes, if they are passionate about film! The workload was not too bad either.",
    "Yes. If youre really interested in film analysis.",
    "I would recommend this pretty easy class. Watch the films and try to do the readings - they can teach you a lot. Oksana is a very wonderful person.",
    "If you want to learn the basic tools for close analysis of film, yes. If you think you already have a handle on this, maybe not."
