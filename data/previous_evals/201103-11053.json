    "This is a survey class on theories of gender and sexuality through the lenses of feminist and queer studies, and works to interrogate its own terms of analysis with particular attention to race and colonialism. I would recommend the course for those interested in such topic and willing to devote the necessary time to sometimes extremely dense but thoroughly engaging readings. I would not recommend it to those who have not done any readings in feminist and queer theory before nor to those who have read extensively in such theoretical frameworks. It is best for those with some preliminary grasp of studies in gender and sexuality but who are looking for a space to read some of the classics or newer works that they haven't had a chance to read much of yet.",
    "I would introduce it as a comprehensive introduction to feminist and queer theory, and recommend it to anyone who would like to either continue in WGSS studies or consider it as a sub-topic of their studies."
