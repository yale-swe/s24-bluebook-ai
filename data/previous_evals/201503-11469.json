   "comments": [
    "If youre an undergrad, this is an excellent opportunity to engage with the research on judgment and decision-making in a no-BS kind of way. You will be forced to evaluate papers in a very critical way but also, at a meta-level, you have to be critical about your critical approach to the research. The discussion is structured as a back and forth on various features of the research from professor to student, entertaining alternatives, boundary conditions, extensions, and the applicability of the stuff to strategies in real life.",
    "I think that we covered a lot of interesting material in the class. That being said, I felt that the classes were a bit too long (3hrs is a long time to be in a seminar). Also I wish that we had another paper in addition to the final one - or perhaps break the final paper into two parts? That way we could have additional grades over the course of the semester. Also, Nathan can be a bit harsh in his response to comments in class - I know he is incredibly smart and has thought a lot about this material, but most of us are just learning and could probably use a bit of encouragement. I liked the fact that the professors began speaking for longer at the beginning of the class - those intros laid a nice foundation and helped shape class discussion.",
    "Psyc 554 is, while not a lot of work, an intense course for an undergrad. You get to discuss cutting-edge research with two of the smartest professors on campus and a class half full of graduate students. I would recommend it, but follow the class very, very closely and do the readings to get the most out of it.",
    "Very helpful if you're looking to go into psych or behavioral research. Each class is long but decently engaging and the readings each week are reasonable in length. Ravi and Nathan are a good pair.",
    "A really wonderful seminar! If you can get it in as an undergrad, it's a good opportunity to dig into reading research papers and think critically about these really interesting research topics. Part of the learning experience is getting to interact with grad students in the seminar. Each week, you read & respond to ~3 papers, and every few weeks, you're assigned a specific paper to summarize and present to the class (so you're technically leading the discussion on this paper). There's also a big research paper at the end of the class, but on the whole, the workload is very manageable, and the class is very enjoyable."

   "comments": [
    "I realized that I really enjoyed studying behavioral decision making as part of cognitive science and will write my senior thesis something in the field, perhaps more about moral decision making. It also made me realize once more that I probably want to pursue a PhD in psychology.",
    "I feel better prepared to write my own research papers now and more critical of others. This is one of the few classes I've taken a Yale where I know I am walking away with a tangible skill.",
    "A lot! I'm very interested in decision making, so this class was right up my alley. I think it will help me a lot in brainstorming for my senior project."
