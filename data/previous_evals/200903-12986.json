   "comments": [
    "the course material was taught in good sequence and the guest lectures were usually really good. I found Dean's lectures to be the least interesting and least inspiring of the course.",
    "Requiring us to keep a notebook was not a reasonable expectation - I'm glad the notebook was never officially collected at the end. Also, he final assignment was very vague. I think a paper (not a presentation or design project) should be mandated.",
    "too much reading, would have been better to focus on main readings from tzonis\/frampton\/mumford etc rather than the more localized readings. maybe the 'regional' readings could be whittled down somewhat",
    "This course has a lot of potential and since it was the first time it was offered, it was a decent start. In the future, it would be helpful to restructure it to allow for more time for class discussions both with guest speakers and individual presentations. Perhaps have the first half of the semester be student run. Each student is responsible for running one class (presentation, reading selection, class discussion). The second half of the semester could be guest speakers and development of individual projects.",
    "I thought the material was somewhat compelling but lacked an overall structure. I do commend the course for involving several guest lecturers whose expertise helped shed light on many different topics. I feel the course material could have better integrated these speakers topics rather than loosley tie them in under the very broad topic of tropical architecture.e"

   "comments": [
    "I had no expectations for the course but i learned a lot about how to think of architecture as it relates to it's environment.",
    "direction was unclear, but this was understood because the class itself was exploratory in nature. however one must admit there was not enough time permitted as a result of the pressures from other classes during the semester overshadowed what could have been a really good class.",
    "I expected this course to be more student driven with more opportunity for discussions about the subject matter. It has the potential to be this way, but in many ways it felt over structured (more like an undergrad course than a graduate seminar).",
    "I had initially taken the course with the intentions to produce a design project which in the beginning was endorsed by the professor. As the course progressed I found the support of the project to wane, I do realize that part of it was my lack of clarity but to a greater extent I feel the course emphasis strongly shifted mid way through the semester. Ultimately I think the research based pedagogy of the course was valuable but lacked any true direction; without the implementation of said research (the production of a design proposal)I think the course will struggle to resonate in a broader discourse of architecture."

   "comments": [
    "this course was OK. I think it felt more like an undergraduate course than anything else. It could have just involved guest lectures and been much more interesting",
    "I had no idea what to expect from this course but I hope to use it to launch future studies about architecture in tropical climates.",
    "The course could have been drastically improved if there were more discussion. I felt that we were constantly rubbing up against interesting areas of exploration, but discussions seemed to be nipped in the bud before they could fully develop. Beginning each class with a run-through of the day's assigned readings was a waste of time. We had all read and came to class ready and eager to discuss the material.Dean's group of invited lectures were excellent, and his real talents as a coordinator and instructor came out in the remarkable group of visitors and the incredibly insightful discussions we had with them. Bravo!",
    "highly valuable, helped to form a stronger personal position on architecture in my country of origin, while situating it in an international context. should be called something more like 'international architecture' rather than 'tropical'.",
    "I thought it was moderately valuable. Again, I wish it would have placed more emphasis on research with intended implementation of said research, as opposed to simply documenting and making observations."

    "Dean is a good teacher but I feel his lectures didn't offer anything more than what was already learned from the readings. The guest lectures were great and some of the students presentations were good too. Some of the students presentations sucked though and made for a boring class at times.",

    "I would perhaps have a more specific goal for the outcome of the course and work throughout the semester to make those projects a reality.",
    "The power-points were lacking. I think Dean should give a brief (20 minute) lecture about the readings using visual examples and then the class should discuss the readings. Also, this class was supposed to end at 5:20. In ended at 6:00 (and beyond) every week.",
    "See comments to question 4",
    "I think the course would benefit from better structuring and synthesizing of the material. Also I feel it is critical that the research culminate in something beyond just book-reporting."
