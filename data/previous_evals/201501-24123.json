    "This class was such an awesome class. We went through the Olympic Games' origins in Ancient Greece, to the modern movement, to many issues that are effecting the games today, Every week is a different topic with interesting readings. You also do not need to be an athlete to take this class because having a class that is composed of both groups allows for much more interesting discussion.",
    "you'll look at a lot of different topics through the lens of the olympics, so youd better want to really think about the olympics instead of just marveling at them, and it'll definitely help if youre interested in talking about race and gender and politics, because that becomes a huge part of the class. but its excellent all the way through.",
    "A really interesting history seminar.",
    "A pretty laid-back seminar. I definitely learned a lot about 20th century history and politics through the lens of various Olympic Games, which I found interesting. Readings are manageable and workload is light. We had one 5 page paper, one in class presentation (which basically meant summarizing the readings and leading class discussion for one class), and one longer final paper. You get to choose your own topic for both. If you're interested in the the history of the Olympics, and 20th century history and are looking for a laid-back seminar, I would recommend this course to you.",
    "I definitely would, I had an extremely enjoyable time in the class and learned a lot. There is not another class at Yale like it.",
    "Really great, solid class. Two 5 pg. papers, final paper 12-15 pages on whatever you want. Much less reading than a typical seminar (though this may change since this was the first year the course was offered) and really interesting discussion. You'll definitely learn a lot about aspects of the Olympics you may have never considered before. Great topics\/syllabus and great professors. Got a history seminar credit for a class where I learned history, but never wrote a history paper (a real steal if you ask me). Take it if you can get in (they don't give preference to upperclassman--everyone had to write a 2-page application about why they should be in the class).",
    "Definitely take this class if you can"
