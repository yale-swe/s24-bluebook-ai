   "comments": [
    "The class really taught me to look at things from all perspectives and think in different ways. As a non-humanities major, I really appreciated gaining that ability. Prof. Camacho is great.",
    "Be prepared to learn about a lot of oppression. A great look at a lot of sad things that have happened to a lot of minorities. Not to say it isn't important and fascinating, just depressing at points.",
    "Yes, there is a lot of reading in this class. The good news is, the reading is mostly enjoyable once you get through it. Professor Camacho's lecture style is not the most exciting, but if you try to pay attention you can get a lot out of it. I learned so much I didn't know before. This isn't a \"white people are evil\" kind of class; it's really a whole new approach to history from the non-dominant groups. Even if you just shop the class or take it Cr\/D, I think you'll enjoy it. It changed my perspective on the world. The logistics: a take home midterm and final, as well as either a short paper or a CBL (Community Based Learning) project. I did the CBL and worked with Junta to create a bilingual info sheet on Secure Communities for the Hispanic Community.",
    "Yes- I think this is a good survey class for a freshman or sophomore.",
    "This is a course that you need to take at some point during your time at Yale! It is an intro course and most of what you learn here would be relevant to the other courses you take concurrently or in the future!",
    "YES!! TAKE IT!",
    "This is a generally interesting history class. At times, a lot of reading is assigned, but not all of it is necessary. If you are the type of person who enjoys analyzing every detail of an event and its racial implications, definitely take it. If not, you may not enjoy it.",
    "More people should take this class. In fact, EVERYONE should take this class (especially people who haven't taken any classes on race or migration before!) Professor Camacho is brilliant, the readings are amazing, and the subject matter is fascinating. TAKE IT NOW.",
    "it's a little bit of everything. You'll learn histories that you wont see in other places, and the other students that take it are also really interested in the course material.",
    "Take this course. The workload is manageable (take home midterm& final, a short paper, section), and the material is incredibly relevant, important, and interesting. The course really values student participation and learning. You will enjoy this course.",
    "This is a survey in a lot of ways but Professor Schmidt-Camacho does focus on several areas of this history while her guest lecturers provide insights on others. The reading is closely related to lectures and the exams are fair.",
    "It was interesting but sometimes the lectures will drag on pretty badly.",
    "Take this class. I promise it will be one of the most eye-opening, memorable, intellectually stimulating experiences in your Yale experience. The readings are all worthwhile and you will never think of the world in the same way. I still catch myself recommending some of the readings I did in this class to friends and family.",
    "Please take this class! It tells you so much about way things are the way they are in our society and plus even though Camacho might be better in seminars she is still a boss. The course is really interesting and section discussion were actually worthwhile and didn't make you wanna shoot yourself. The readings could be a tad intense but I'm sure it's better than a lot of classes. Do it!",
    "Take this course! It's a very eye-opening course that everyone one should take.",
    "There is no denying that the reading list for ER&M 200 is very daunting and intense, but the assessments\/grading are ultimately not that demanding, and thus do not detract whatsoever from how captivating the stories told in this class are. The issues confronted in ER&M 200 have an almost visceral importance in our contemporary context, which makes the extra bit of reading more than worthwhile. Definitely a must-take introductory course at Yale.",
    "It is a good intro class that opens your eyes to something new. Take it.",
    "Take it. Take it. Take it.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. The subject is interesting to any student at Yale because it is the full history of the people of the world.",
    "Ethnicity, Race, and Migration is a course that I would recommend to any student. After taking this course, you truly have a greater appreciation and understanding of your culture and your history, and you come away with a greater desire to invoke changes for a better future. There is a great deal of work that goes into the course, and everything depends on your participation; the more you participate, the more you learn and the better you can organize your ideas. This has been one of the best courses I have taken at Yale so far, and it has been a great experience to take this course.",
    "This is a valuable gateway course to ethnic studies. Much of the class is structured with a focus on case studies with Camacho lecturing on the cases' implicit illustration of racial violence while also commenting on the State's influence in shaping discrimination. There's a range of Native American, African American, Mexican American, Filipino, Chinese American, Caribbean and Middle Eastern case studies. Course examinations were fair but required that the student really reflect their grasp of all course readings. The readings were helpful, extraordinary, and critical.",
    "This class is history that they didn't teach you in AP World. It is the darker, literally and figuratively, side of history and culture, and is really important to have a complete view of the world. The reading is interesting and fascinating, and Professor Camacho is fantastic. In a class that discusses highly polarizing political issues like immigration, security, and education, it's really important for everyone to keep an open mind and listen. It's a good class for people who are interested in racial issues, and an even more important class for people who are not.",
    "What an incredible course \u0096 take it!!! Professor Camacho teaches with care in a way I have never experienced. Her lectures are well-woven, stories with much to convey. Each class opened my mind in a new way, challenging me to think really differently about both history and the present. The course's attention to different kinds of sources, especially visual sources, was particularly eye-opening. All the guest lectures were fantastic, as were the TFs, who took more initiative than TFs for any other class I've taken.",
    "I would not recommend this course until it becomes a seminar and not a lecture.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class because you're exposed to material and ideology (and facts) that are rarely covered in primary and secondary grades that is essential to understanding racial dynamics and stereotypes still very much a part of American society today.",
    "Take it. It's a lecture course: the lectures are beautiful to listen to but rather floofy. The readings are wide-ranging but generally fascinating, well-written, and accessible. It's more or less a short book's worth of reading every week. It's a very, very broad survey course of ethnic studies. You will go over racism, genocides, slavery, land laws, and a million other topics. So sometimes, you might get frustrated that you're gliding past too many things too quickly.But nevertheless, it's a great course. You're not going to learn the history of every ethnically-related event ever; instead, you'll gain a lot of intellectual tools with which you can hopefully understand ethnic studies and the world in general in a deeper way. I think it's a truly amazing complement to any course of study at Yale, especially for those of you reading one too many dead white guys one too many times. It is remarkable how many different histories there are to the history of anything, and this course will get you thinking in those terms.And mostly, take this course because it gives you an excuse to hang out with Alicia Camacho. Of the 19 professors I've had so far, she wins hands-down for being the most approachable, understanding, and generally caring\/motherly towards her students. Yale is lucky to have her.",
    "Absolutely take it. An understanding of the roots of race and racism is important for a liberal education."
