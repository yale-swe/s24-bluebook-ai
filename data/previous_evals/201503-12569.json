   "comments": [
    "An incredible discussion seminar. The readings are fascinating, discussions are engaging, and the professor and TA are approachable and knowledgeable. This is the sort of class that you want to keep talking about after class, and we often did! If you can get in, take it.",
    "A good course that can get overwrought by the seemingly simple.",
    "Recommended for a good intro to Inequality and rigorous look at social scientific research and how it can be well done.",
    "DEFINITELY. I can't recommend it more highly. DEFINITELY TAKE THIS COURSE if you can get into it. It is very hard to get into because it's literally one of the best classes at Yale, but you should give it a shot, and if you can make a good case you might have a chance. Professor Maralani is one of the most inspirational and intelligent people I know. She makes the material come to life, and you will learn more in this class than you can in pretty much any class.",
    "A wonderful class. Prof Maralani is brilliant and leads a spirited class discussion. The readings, while long, are interesting, and while you cover a lot of ground, it never feels like it's spread too thin. Needless to say you get a great sense of what inequality is like in America. ONLY TAKE IT IF YOU ARE PREPARED TO SERIOUSLY DO THE READING. Many professors say you need to do the reading to get something out of a seminar. Most of the time they're wrong, but this is one of the times they're right. Class discussion is almost entirely reading-focused, and there are a lot of small group exercises where you're asked to discuss the reading. If you've done the reading, this is incredible stimulating. If you haven't, it's very awkward and I feel lost. The weeks I was able to do the reading fully were much better than the weeks where other things got in the way and I had to skim, or worse, skip.",
    "Absolutely. I haven't seen the world the same way since.",
    "Do take this if you get in! It's an amazing course that will almost definitely change your views about inequality in America. You will learn what the different dimensions of inequality are -- wealth, income, race\/gender, educational, occupational, etc.-- as well as interesting perspectives on normative frameworks and policy ideas related to these. So eye-opening and so relevant to living life as consumers of media related to inequality.",
    "This is a great class!! Professor Maralani and Todd are amazing. Even though the class will likely keep growing in size due to demand, this class is totally worth taking. The readings are incredible and Professor Maralani puts together a great class to talk about them. It has really changed the way I think about and can engage with inequality. Take this class whether or not you are interested in these issues--it's stuff everyone needs to hear.",
    "A really great class that you should definitely take if you can. This class gives you ways to think about inequality and helps you to understand the mechanisms that produce that inequality both quantitatively and qualitatively (although definitely with an emphasis on the quantitative, which makes sense since Prof. Maralani is a quantitative sociologist). A background in stats is nice but not necessary for some of the readings, and if you don't understand it, Professor Maralani and Todd (the TF) were very helpful in explaining the results of the papers we read. The class was a little big this year, but it was very well managed for a big seminar, and the small group discussions meant that you really engaged with the material.",
    "This class gives you a sociological approach to inequality. Though some readings are dense and graph heavy overall you come away more knowledgeable with a better understanding of what inequality is.",
    "Here's why you should delay taking Inequality in America until as late as possible in your eight semesters at Yale: it will probably ruin you for all other classes. Also, probably don't take Inequality if you don't like violence: throughout the semester, Vida Maralani will frequently and casually drop knowledge bombs that will blow your mind. If the class was on something dull and mundane like classifying types of manure, Vida would still be the best professor at Yale and it would be worth taking just for that. Unluckily for you, since it means you're going to have a really tough time getting into the class, the readings, discussions, and syllabus are necessary topics for Yale students to engage with, presented in a challenging, inspiring way that results in the smartest, bar-raising conversations I've ever seen in a college classroom. Yeah, it's a lot of reading, some of it dense, and the three two-page essays at the start of the semester can be a struggle to produce quality work on. But, let's be real, you shouldn't take this class for any reasons other than having the opportunity to talk about race, gender, SES, education, etc. in a truly nuanced way through an intense sociological (and often quantitative) lens with an absurdly good instructor. Vida is brilliant, clear, and to the point. Not only does she prepare her classes with more diligence, precision, and pedagogical know-how than anyone else, but she also cares about her students so much which is never more evident than in her willingness to push everyone to do legit work and make actually insightful comments. So, would I recommend this class to another student? Uh, yeah.",
    "The title is self explanatory. This is a course that will leave you thinking about the course material for hours and hours after every class. However, it's good because unlike many classes which only create questions and no answers, this class is geared somewhat away from the theoretical and more toward the practical. If you want to only think theoretically, this class is not for you. If you want to combine theoretical thinking with practical questions and answers about how to decrease inequality, this class is for you. Be warned, it will complicate the way you think about the world. If you think inequality is all about systems and structures, this class will challenge you tho consider the choices and characteristics of individuals. If you think inequality is all about individual decisions and behavior this course will challenge you to realize just how much influence societal structures really have. The breadth and depth of this course certainly make it one of the best and most courses at Yale.",
    "Would highly recommend. This class changed my understanding of the different actors in creating and reinforcing different kinds of inequality in America, from gender inequality to wealth and income inequality to educational inequality.",
    "Essential course",
    "Yes definitely this course is incredibly important, especially in the context of how inequality is ballooning across the country. If you are oriented towards domestic social justice but don't know exactly where your interests lie, this course will also help you find direction and a passion for which areas you may want to focus on. The readings are fantastic, the discussions are great, and for better or worse, you will come out of this class feeling that inequality is the biggest social problem in the country today. Also Prof. Maralani is such a sweet, thoughtful, helpful and fantastic teacher.",
    "SOCY 314 is an amazing class and a must-take! Professor Maralani is a wonderful professor who is not only very knowledgeable about inequality but cares deeply about her students. Class always seems to fly by as students become so engaged in the thought-provoking discussions. I also appreciate her sensitivity to people who are on the quiet side. Her small group exercises ensures that these people also have the opportunity to express their views. The readings are quite hefty and dense, and the reading responses take a long time, but Professor Maralani strives to make the material accessible to students from all disciplines. The final literature review requires much work, but Professor Maralani makes sure students start early. If you have the chance, definitely take this course! It will change your perception of inequality!"
