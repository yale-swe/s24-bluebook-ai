    "Do you like to work in lab? If yes, proceed directly to Chem 490. Do not pass Go, do NOT collect $100.",
    "I would recommend Chem490 if you are interested in research. This type of experience is very different from taking academic labs.",
    "If you are looking to take this class, you need to take it. It's independent research, so it's exactly what you expect. If you have a good PI, it's a great class.",
    "If you are looking at 490 then it is pretty much a requirement for you. I would definitely say that if you are planning on doing any sort of work with Chemistry after college that you should do this. Working in a \"real\" lab is a lot different than what you do in a teaching lab \/ lab course, and my CHEM 490 experience was helpful in learning what a real lab is like. You need to get research experience to move forward, so you might as well do it for credit and to complete your senior requirement.",
    "I would recommend it to anyone considering going to graduate school or working in a chem lab",
    "Independent research is fun! Do it.",
    "It's a wonderful experience; I highly recommend gaining research experience as early as possible if you're a science major\/premed. There are no prerequisites, so definitely, one should consider 490.",
    "Research is very different than the labs. You have more freedom to work at your own pace without set guidelines to follow. Chem490 is much better than ordinary labs",
    "Take CHEM 490 if you want to get an idea of research and\/or apply to graduate school in the sciences. It'll be a good experience, hopefully!",
    "Its independent research. You should know what to expect."
