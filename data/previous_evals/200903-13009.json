    "yes. it is an amazing class and you will learn a huge amount about acting and have fun. it is tough and sometimes makes you feel underprepared no matter how much workyou have put in, but connie is an amazing teacher and you will learn to internalize all the thought and preparation that goes into a good performance.",
    "Yes! Much more that just an \"intro\" class. You learn so much and Connie is an amazing teacher.",
    "If you want to be a theater studies major, you have to take this course. However if you do not want to be a theater studies major...still take this course. However know that Connie's style is very different than the other teachers (this is very scene study oriented while other teachers do other sorts of things.) I do not know how they broke students up into sections but if you are interested in a more scene study, pursue your objective, play actions type style then Connie's class is the way to go.",
    "Yes, if you want to learn acting take it with Connie. She just always knows how to improve a scene and is incredible in that way...I have no idea how she does it to be honest!",
    "You should recognize before you take this class that it is instruction, not in performance, but in one specific acting technique. Connie is very into Uta Hagen, and I recommend that you buy her book (Respect for Acting, the book you'll need for the course) and read the first few chapters. If you find that Hagen is not your cup of tea, and there is space in another section, it may be in your interest to transfer. You'll learn more if you're working with the technique and not against it.That said, the department keeps faculty of various schools for a reason: it's good for an actor to at least be versed in multiple styles. The class is still worth taking, even if you're leery about Hagen; Connie is a good instructor, and the real-time onstage relationships that she cultivates are important for any performer.",
    "Take it if you are interested in learning more about acting even if you don't plan on pursuing it.",
    "THST 210 might seem rigorous and confusing for the non-actor. However, if you apply Connie's suggestions (quickly!), you will do well."
