   "comments": [
    "Be prepared to put in a lot of (sometimes frustrating) work for this class, but Yeju is a great teacher. Peer critiques sometimes get a little boring, but they are helpful. Some of the projects took a long time, but the semester-long photography project was interesting. Would recommend if you want formal advising in graphic design.",
    "Fantastic course, but you should know what to expect: the course is theory-based. There's a focus on communicating through form instead of content, which I found really interesting. Basically re-defined the way I think of design. Yeju's section did more work with InDesign, photography and posters, from what I've heard. She's cool and fun, too! But classes are sometimes long and they're basically two-hour critiques, which can be a drag if the other people in the class don't have anything good to say.",
    "Yes, a great introductory class that does not require prior software knowledge",
    "A good class to take but this is NOT a gut. You have to do a lot of work, and be prepared to spend about $200 over the semester (in addition to a $150 materials fee) on printing. Yeju is a good teacher who has really interesting and very helpful insights when she does provide them. She is always happy to offer additional comments if you talk to her after class though. The first 25% of the class will feel like a waste of time because it's just standing around talking about photos your classmates have taken and trying to sound \"artsy\" about them - to a ridiculous extent sometimes - everything I detest about fine art. Quality of class depends hugely on your coursemates, I think. I would recommend starting Cr\/D unless you are really into design and know you'll put effort into it.",
    "Definitely one of the best courses I've taken at Yale. It can be a decent amount of work, but you definitely get out what you put in. Yeju is a great instructor, but she has a low tolerance for people who don't give their best effort. The majority of the work is done using paper, not on a computer, so if you're trying to learn Photoshop or Illustrator, you don't get that here. Very well taught and very well organized. Definitely learned a lot.",
    "This is not just a class for art majors and it's one of the most rewarding you'll take. There's basically no reading, just different types of projects to do outside of class. It doesn't have to take up all of your time, but you are expected to actively consider what you're doing in each of the projects. If you don't have a background in art, it may be more time consuming but you'll be so proud of yourself afterwards. Class time is taken up by discussing everyone's work on the current project. Since everyone is always talking and working together, the class can become very close. Yeju and my classmates made the course a lot of fun. It's a great alternative to classes and professors that take themselves too seriously to have fun. The class was amazing- enjoyable but I also learned more in this than any other class I took this semester. Take this!!",
    "If you want to learn a great deal about InDesign and Photoshop and don't care much for making things with your hands, then you might not be so interested in design and should think long and hard about taking this class. Otherwise, you should try to get in--this year, at least, both sections of Intro to GD required an application of sorts because there were so many people trying to take the course, so keep that in mind.",
    "Full stop: awesome. Be forewarned though: this is the kind of course that you can't get away without doing work, even if you Credit\/D it. Almost every class you present your work or work-in-progress and receive feedback. Because of that, though, I learned a lot about graphic design and how important it is in our daily lives. It's an awesome, relaxing class time (you get what you put into it outside of the class), and Yeju might be the coolest professor out there."
