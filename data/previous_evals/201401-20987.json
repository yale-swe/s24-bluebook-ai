    "This class offers a very unique opportunity to undergraduates. We were able to take a class and experience real science with research techniques and equipment normally not available to undergrads in classes. It was a great chance to work through problems conceptually with partners and I feel as though this class really helped make me more independent in terms of analyzing and presenting data. I've come away from this class with much gained knowledge. This class is awesome! Dr. Wolenski is awesome!! TAKE THIS CLASS if you can",
    "Yes, email in advance and take this course. It's a course focused on cultivating passion and potential for science research and education, and on building a family that is fun, supportive, and educational.",
    "This course is one of a kind at Yale. You learn science in a collaborative manner and the environment is very friendly. Nothing like gen chem or orgo or physics labs. I would say taking this class was a defining experience for me at Yale. Dr. Wolenski will remain a cherished mentor for life! He is the best!!",
    "Take this class, but be ready for the long work week in lab. See comments for 345L.",
    "#YASSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS",
    "MCDB 344L is not a traditional lab course. It is a process that develops over the entire half-semester; during that time, however, you will certainly see growth in your critical thinking skills and in your confidence to discuss biological issues. In addition, you will form great bonds with your lab partners and help each other through the process of trying to solve an overarching problem. If you want to know what it means to be involved in the research field, then this is definitely the course to take.",
    "MCDB 344L is a great class. Definitely take it if you can. It and its companion class of MCDB 345L were my favorite labs at Yale so far for sure.",
    "If you can get in (email Dr. Wolenski really, really early), I recommend this class. It's useful even if you have worked in a real lab before. You really have to understand the theory behind everything you do in this lab, and Dr. Wolenski and the TAs are great at explaining the material. Dr. Wolenski also tries really hard to make sure that everyone can fun; it's not just about bench work. You also get to do a pretty cool project (it's a different one every year), even if it is relatively small in scale due to the time constraints. The only work you need to do outside of class is preparation for two small quizzes, and a 5 minute \"chalk talk\" about a Nature Methods paper.",
    "Overall, you must take this lab if given the opportunity!",
    "ABSOLUTELY take this course. It is the best class I have taken at Yale. The science is so cool and the teaching is so, so, so amazing.",
    "If you can get into the class (which you should try from the end of freshman year onwards) you should definitely take it. Minimal work and one of the best and highlights of the MCDB department. It really teaches you about how research is like, through presentations and going to talks. Wolenski is great and really cares about his students. The projects chosen are also always very interesting. Take it and you won't regret it.",
    "Indubitably.",
    "Take it!",
    "Do whatever it takes to get into this class. It will solidify all you research skills and you will leave feeling confident about your ability to do science. You learn about Medical School as well as PhD programs. Wolenski brings in lecturers and takes the class to see job talks, which are very informative."
