    "This class is really interesting and covers a wide range of topics. It also makes great use of Yale's resources and features interesting guest lectures. The class and the presentation of information seemed disorganized at times, and the range of knowledge we were expected to memorize sometimes seemed unreasonable in comparison to other HSHM classes (partially due to the long time span this class covers and really drastic jumps in time). Review sessions could have also been more productive by focusing on reviewing terms and concepts previously covered."

    "This is a good class 5th class to take if your other classes have high workloads",
    "I think that this class is a really interesting way to learn about the premodern world, and, of all of my Yale classes, it's probably the one that makes the best use of Yale's resources. We went everywhere from the Babylonian collection to the YUAG to the Medical Historical Library and got guest lectures from a few interesting professors. That being said, the class is a little all over the place in terms of subject matter (ranging from ancient Mesopotamia to the Renaissance) and the information isn't always presented in the clearest way, so I found it personally difficult to keep up at times. The professor is nice, and there is not a lot of work due (2 five-page essays, a midterm, and a final when I took it), but the class and topics were so broad that I found that it took me more time to do the essays and to study than in my other classes."
