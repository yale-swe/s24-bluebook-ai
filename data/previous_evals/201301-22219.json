   "comments": [
    "This is a stellar class that anyone with an interest in current affairs, international security, or global governance should take. Workload consists of a midterm exam and a final paper. Class attendance and participation makes up the remainder of the grade. Prof. Krasno is one of the nicest professors I've had and she has a tremendous amount of first-hand knowledge and interactions with the UN. It was especially cool to hear her insights on former UN SecGen Kofi Annan, whom she had worked with.",
    "Professor Krasno is an expert on everything about the UN, so if you are interested in it, you should take it! Very light workload.",
    "It is an overview of the UN. I'm happy I took it since I learned a lot about how the UN works, but it would work better as a lecture. The discussions are less engaging, because the material is a bit more objective.But jean krasno is really nice!",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to a fellow student. Very interesting and highly relevant material.",
    "This is a course that covers many aspects of the UN and gives a very thorough review of all of it. I appreciated how the course was divided and felt that I gained a very clear understanding of how the Security Council works. My only recommendations for the course is that maybe there could be some weeks that would cover more current happenings in the UN, otherwise some of the information seems slightly dated."
