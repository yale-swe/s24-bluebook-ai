    "This class is a must-take class for sociology students especially who are interested in social inequality issues.",
    "I would if they were very interested in the material or thought they might be. It is a lot of work, though, if someone was to take it as simply a class to broaden their horizons. It might be good for that, but it could be a bit difficult to do if a student is taking a number of other demanding courses (as might be expected in the first year). I'm about to write that the work load is heavy for question four, but I think it odd to contrast that with appropriate rather than average. It's a huge field and there are lots of readings to be done, just know that going in and you'll be fine. It isn't at all undoable.",
    "Social Stratification is a challenging course offering a quantitive overview of the literature with an emphasis on macro-modeling. Take it if you are interested in quantitative methods and social research.",
    "Very good course. Provided a good overview of the field."

    "This class was one of the best classes I have taken at Yale personally. The topic is my core interest.",
    "It was very beneficial for me to get an overview of this area. It will help me position some of my future research and enhance my ability to talk about related work.",
    "I definitely learned a lot about social stratification through taking the course. I'm not sure, after taking it, that I want to pursue it further in my own research."
