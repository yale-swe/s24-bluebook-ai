   "comments": [
    "I would not recommend this lab unless it is required for your major. The labs are pretty boring, as the main objectives of the class are just to learn the basics of using the equipment and data analysis. There is no work required outside of class (just a short quiz each week), which is really nice and makes this good to take on top of 4-5 other credits. Probably better than 165-166 also.",
    "Take this lab!",
    "P205 is great. Your only time commitment is three hours a week in lab (there are no lab reports), plus perhaps an hour at most to read over the lab procedure and take the short quizzes online. I would absolutely recommend P205 to any student interested in the sciences at all - not only is it less work than the corresponding chemistry or biology labs, but it also introduces the critical concepts of analysis of uncertainty more effectively than labs in other departments would. The labs are downright _fun_, too - oscilloscopes are awesome.",
    "You get to play with some fun tools, and there's basically no work outside of class. The labs can be long, and time can sometimes be an issue. Not the most inspiring class I've ever taken by a long shot, but I did learn some things so I'm not complaining too loudly.",
    "Generally speaking, I would strongly discourage a prospective student to take this class. By its very nature, it is annoying and not at all interesting. It isn't much work, but that doesn't make up for the boring experiments, and unbearable room. I would encourage prospective physics majors to just take 206L and get out of 205L.",
    "I wouldn't recommend the course generally, but seeing as you're probably a physics major or pre-med, you probably have to take it.",
    "Yes if it's required. No if it's not, the only thing that I found interesting was the gyroscope and the optic lab.",
    "Take it for some exposure to using physics in the real world.",
    "If you're a physics&philosophy major, talk to the DUS about the lab requirements, because it's possible to get out of labs. According to Jill North (physics and philosophy professor), lab work is not useful for the field, and you are better served by taking a higher-level physics theory class.",
    "I wouldn't advise taking it unless you have to. It's not fun, but it's not particularly difficult either. The physics content of the class is covered in much more depth in the actual lecture, so it's not really essential to do the lab to understand what's going on.",
    "I enjoyed 205 Lab and found a lot of the labs fun. That being said, the course may not be for everyone, and I would especially recommend having some knowledge of statistics--I went in with none, and found some aspects of the course difficult, though certainly not impossible. Your enjoyment of the course may depend on your TA. I would recommend taking it at the same time as second semester intro physics, as the concepts covered in class and in lab were nicely parallel. The lack of lab reports meant the workload was pretty light--it is primarily just time-consuming the day of the lab.",
    "You know if you need it or not. It's pretty chill. No lab reports, and the experiments are mostly about basic things and learning how equipment works. Just have to walk up science hill and sit in lab for 3 hours, but honestly for a half credit it's a pretty good deal. The TFs are really helpful.",
    "Take the course because chances are you need to and it isn't that bad.No lab reports, you submit all the data that you take during class at the end of class!",
    "Pretty relaxed lab for the most part; the lack of outside work is very nice, especially when you're taking another lab class and a number of other classes. Definitely recommend this to all engineering majors; take this instead of trying to substitute 165L because the workload here is a lot less, especially if you know any physics.",
    "I would recommend this course.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student because it is a lab course but with a work load that isn't quite as heavy as other lab courses. The information was interesting, and was finally able to aply the physics concepts I had learned in other classes.",
    "If you're interested in majoring physics, I guess you've kind of got to take it. Otherwise it's not the most enjoyable course.",
    "Don't do it for fun.",
    "This class is not fun. Take it only for your major.",
    "It's a good lab to take in conjunction with 201. It goes fast during class. Try to take the quizzes the night before.",
    "Among labs, it's really not that bad. The class is designed well, and the labs are interesting. But with that said, I really don't think i learned anything in 205L, having already taken other physics labs. One semester is enough! The no write ups policy is great!",
    "Physics 205L 01 was a solid intermediate level physics laboratory course. Although the experiments were not the most interesting in themselves, they taught many valuable data analysis and experimentation techniques that I know will prove useful in the future. With the exception of short online pre-lab quizzes and a final, there is no work outside of class. I highly recommend this lab sequence for any prospective physics major with a little lab experience from high school.",
    "I would not recommend students take this class unless they had to for premed or for their major. Don't get me wrong, Physics 205L is a nice class. The environment is very chill, and you do all the lab write-ups in class. However, I often foundmyself just following the procedure of the labs without really understanding the significance of my data or what the lab was trying to teach me.",
    "Not great",
    "205 is not a hard lab course. If you go to class and do the work, you should be fine. There's minimal stuff you have to do outside of class, and though the experiments are kind of old and outdated, the professor and teaching fellows are very nice and make the class worth it.",
    "This is a good lab course, and there's almost no work outside of class. However, each lab feels extremely rushed, so you have to go in every week prepared to work as fast as possible. Also, you pretty much have to teach yourself the error propagation theory.",
    "A rather bland course, but not overly burdensome if you need it for a requirement. Maybe worth it to get to the more interesting labs (based on what I've heard) in PHYS 206; maybe not. If you just happen to be taking an intro physics course as a non-gut science, though, don't feel the need to take the lab course, too.There aren't formal lab reports, which is nice. Two mildly irritating aspects of the course: grading is through a rather opaque \"check\", \"check plus,\" \"check minus\" system, and there were time limits on the labs, kind of. (As in, after 3 1\/2 hours, my professor got increasingly agitated until you finally felt compelled to hand your lab in; might not betrue of all professors, though.)Overall, the course teaches you about basic lab equipment but provides few transferable skills--if you're not a physics major (aka, if you're not required to take this class), it might not be interesting.",
    "I would say it is a good course for any student looking to learn about making electronic measurements.",
    "Physics 205L is a necessary class to take. It is not the best class, and most of the experiments do not teach anybody anything useful to physics. However, students do be come more familiar with many lab tools of physics. It is fairly easy with little outside work (we have small quizzes each week but no written lab reports)."
