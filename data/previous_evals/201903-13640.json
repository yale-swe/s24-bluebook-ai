    "A great introduction and understanding of the scope of social scientific contributions to environmental and natural resource issues.",
    "A lot about society and the environment",
    "I learned to think critically about the ways that human-human and human-environment relationships play out in reality and to dig deeper than the surface of what we often believe about sustainability, environmentalism, and more. I also learned about the troubling history of \"development\" work in other countries, particularly in the Global South. The course's readings were very helpful, and I appreciated getting to engage with books and articles that I otherwise might have missed. Further, I also wrote the longest paper of my academic carer in this class, and while it was difficult, it was a good learning process and helped me understand what it takes to produce a lengthy paper that I can be proud of.",
    "Overview of social science theory and challenges, applications to present day issues, familiarity with landmark anthropological texts that shifted thought and practice in the field, ability to synthesize and critically analyze academic texts, discussion facilitation skills",
    "Critical examination of international development critical examination of relationship between nature and society",
    "Critical evaluation of research. Leading discussion. Learning outside of my specialization helped me see larger relevance of qualitative research\/anthropology.",
    "Great critical readings on development and conservation."

   "comments": [
    "This course fit very well to my expectations of the the knowledge, skills and insights this course offered.",
    "Very well",
    "For the most part, the course aligned with my expectations, though we spent much more time studying international development than I anticipated. For someone who is interested in issues of society and environment in the United States, the course could be seen as lacking, especially because the international development focus wasn't clear in the course description (as I remember it). However, the course exceeded expectations in teaching me how to engage with large amount of reading and to pull out the most important ideas, helping me write a lengthy paper on a topic of my own choosing, and helping me practice leading discussion among peers with varying and diverse interests. Further, Dr. Dove was always happy to talk in office hours, which made the course more helpful.",
    "Better than my expectations. I learned so much in this course. I was frequently able to connect the themes and texts from this class to case studies and applications in other courses.",
    "This class is exactly why I came to Yale, not because I agreed with everything, but because the materials presented sparked learning and dialogue and challenged normative environmental practice.",
    "Well.",
    "I think the knowledge I gained exceeded the expectations I had, I really enjoyed the class and class discussions and feel I learned a lot of important anthropological, ethical, political, and environmental concepts that will help inform all of my future work."

   "comments": [
    "I think that the readings were very important to give context and depth. However, because of the length of reading for each week I felt that some students stopped reading the assignments by the end of the semester - or if it wasn't their turn to lead the discussion. I do not know what the solution is. That being said, I think when the majority of students have done the reading the discussions are a huge strength of the class and we have really interesting conversations. I would said another strength is the paired lecture and discussion. Professor Dove is a great lecturer and I've enjoyed learning and being in the class.",
    "Interesting reads",
    "The course was helpful in encouraging diverse perspectives and challenging students to look beyond the general message that is often put forward by environmental organizations. One of the things I will always remember from Dr. Dove and this course is that there are \"no win-win situations in environmental work.\" While this adage at first sounds dark, it is true, and I didn't realize its accuracy until I took this course. One of the weaknesses of the course is the lack of philosophical readings that were included in the syllabus. While a few readings were included as \"supplemental\" readings that touched on these issues, I would have appreciated a bit more of a focus on the philosophical nature of the relationships between society and environment. The course could handle cutting one of the many international development examples in favor of a discussion that focused on more philosophical issues.",
    "The lecture is long but very engaging. It moves at the right pace, it has funny interjections and brings in present day examples, the slides punctuate the lecture's main points or serve as a guide extremely effectively.",
    "Strengths: Facilitated lots of rich discussions",
    "Strength - international perspective. introspective professor (huge plus) that engaged in dialogue. foundational readings. Discussion that developed. I also enjoyed the wink lecture (I may remember that forever as an example of meaning and understanding being fluid). Weakness - dated readings. lacked connecting domestic US environmental issues and history with international issues. When the course discussed America, it did so through white writers, which played on our sympathy for the white poor in America in a way that the class critiqued internationally. There is a larger narrative that is missed there. I wished that there was at least one Black scholar as a required reading.",
    "S: Well structured sessions with Dove's presentation and then student led discussions. Dove's content is great and presents material in very thoughtful ways. Good selection of readings. W: Could perhaps incorporate more contemporary responses\/readings.",
    "I really enjoyed the lectures, though they were technically long, I never felt they dragged on, I loved listening to Professor Dove's insights. I also loved the class discussion. I honestly wouldn't change much about the course."

   "comments": [
    "There is a lot of reading, which is also critical in order to participate in the course. Plan your time (and your weekends) appropriately.",
    "More work than usual but worth the effort!",
    "The course is interesting, and it draws a cast of students who have diverse perspectives and views. It requires a big time commitment given the readings and assignments, though, so it's worth considering this commitment when choosing your courses. Dr. Dove is helpful, but he expects a lot, and if you aren't putting the effort in, you will not derive much benefit. Be aware of the lengthy paper that is required at the end of the course, too, because it was hard to balance this commitment with other year-end papers and projects in other classes. All in all, I learned a lot from the class and am glad I took it.",
    "Do the reading - -just commit to doing it and start it early. There is A LOT of reading and some of the texts take time and patience to dig into. But doing the reading is essential for getting the most out of the class and the insights you will be able to draw from the combination of reading, lecture, and discussion are worth it. Don't feel left behind by not reading -- not worth it! The critical analysis assignments when you are a discussion leader also take time. As a first year student, transitioning back into the classroom and essay writing after years away from school - -these took a lot of work, so make time and space for that.",
    "This course is reading and discussions intensive. Helps you develop skills to critically analyse conservation and international development from a sociological-anthropological lens.",
    "Sign up early for discussion weeks, you will need the latter part of the semester to prepare for your term paper and to collect sources. Or maybe do the weeks in advance. Prepare.",
    "Speak up during class discussion!"
