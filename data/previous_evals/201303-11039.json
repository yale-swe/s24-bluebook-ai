    "This is not a good class. It is the worst lab I've taken, worse than gen chem and mol bio and worse by far compared to physics and orgo. The grading is completely opaque. There are quizzes and writeups for each lab but the writeups are only handed in in bunches at three times. The writeups are scored out of 5 and make up a vague \"majority\" of your grade. Since there are no guidelines, you aren't likely to do great the first time and it's stressful trying to improve when you only get two chances for feedback.While some of the experiments are cool in theory (and maybe two or three in practice), several of them are tedious, time-consuming (early on, you may skip 7:00 sections), and don't actually work.To be fair, our year had trouble obtaining frogs because of the government shutdown. Nevertheless, as much as I really wanted to love this course, it just wasn't good. It was stressful and I didn't learn much.",
    "First off, it's long. Some weeks you will be there until 7 (the first few weeks when Prof Wyman is teaching), but after that, you'll usually get out around 5:30-6:30 (making it a 4-5 hour lab). But, it's worth it. The experiments are awesome. No, they don't always work. BUT, you get to shock earthworms, cut up frogs and Drosophila, and poke Drosophila in the eyes, just to mention a few of the experiments. On top of that, this lab helped me to understand and remember the concepts taught in class and perform better on many of the midterm questions. Take this lab. I'm a cognitive science major and pre-med who was in the lecture and lab with all of these MCDB pre-meds and I did just fine at keeping up and understanding (although having taken physics and a bio class or two is a must).",
    "I would recommend this class to someone looking for a biology class and is taking the neurobiology lecture. This lab corresponds well with the lecture material and give you a hands on understanding of the concepts. There are around 8 lab reports but none of them are too long or difficult. Most of the experiments were fun although some were long and other were so technically difficult that the professor had to regularly help us record data."
