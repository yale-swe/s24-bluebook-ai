   "comments": [
    "This class is great. The readings are all very interesting, as are the papers. There were many lively discussions about the readings, and the subject of the class is something everyone can relate to - parents and parenting. Professor Saraceni truly knows how to create a lovely environment in the class - she occasionally brought snacks to class, which I felt made the class destress. She is also always available for help - she has never turned us away when we asked for help no matter how many times we asked. She really helps you think about your paper without explicitly telling you what to do, which helps you become a more independent writer.",
    "I would highly recommend Engilsh 114 to another student, because it is structured very well to help each student significantly improve his\/her writing, even those who are already strong writers. This course encourages excessive revision by requiring first drafts and then finals of papers, and this serves to make the workload very manageable.",
    "ENGL 114 21 is a great introductory writing course. There are only four paper to write and you get ample time to write each of them. As long as you start papers before the night before, it is very manageable. There are interesting readings, although several of them are very scientific in nature. The research paper was my favorite part of the class, because it involved a lot of steps to create a final product. I would recommend this course to any first year who wants a low stress introduction to college-level writing.",
    "This class will require work, as any class here does, but it's a very doable class. There are a total of four papers spread out nicely. Each paper has a required draft that is due maybe a week or two before the final version that isn't graded but will receive ample feedback. Between the support you receive from the instructor and the writing resources outside of class, you shouldn't have any problem sailing through this class.",
    "I would recommend this class because it was a welcome challenge and truly taught me how to write a good college essay. Without this class, I may have been lost writing an essay in my other classes. I say it's a must for an underclass man at Yale.",
    "I would recommend this class because it provides great foundations for writing which I think will help any student for the duration of his or her Yale career.",
    "It is a very interesting class that focuses on a specific topic, while also allows you to practice and improve your writing skills. I would definitely recommend it if you would like to improve the mechanics of your writing, but I would not recommend it for advanced writers.",
    "Great class, engaging, interesting reads, relevant information, would definitely recommend.",
    "I would say that you definitely get a decent amount of writing practice, but if I could re-do which writing course I took, I would opt for a more engaging one.",
    "I would definitely recommend English 114 as it is great for learning how to write in the Yale style and strengthens your writing significantly. As for my section, 21, I would recommend it as well. It was very interesting to learn about parenting and especially since it is something everyone can relate to."
