    "The main strength of this course is its breadth. I found it helpful when Prof. Bracken gave contemporary examples of the concepts (e.g. North Korea, China, Russia). The PowerPoints and online dictionary were also good resources. With that said, I was not that impressed with this class. I often found the lectures and the Prof.'s tangents very hard to follow. The topics were also quite spotty, as they jumped across time periods, regions, and economic\/military\/industry\/governmental sectors. Even by paying attention and taking notes the entire class, the lectures were not concise and were quite confusing at times. There is something to be said for having sections with TAs to address the core concepts. Without this attention, many students felt quite lost, even after asking questions and completing the readings. Additionally, it was very stressful after the midterm when Prof. Bracken was unclear about whether there would be a curve. More transparency would be much appreciated, as his approach just led to unnecessary stress.",
    "It could be better organized.",
    "This class was set up to be super interesting and very thought provoking. Unfortunately, the syllabus and class discussions made it very difficult to follow Professor Bracken's arguments and points regarding many different topics. This class also seemed to be pointed towards School of Management students, which made it difficult to follow for an undergrad who doesn't have any experience with many of the topics discussed. Therefore, the midterm and final, which asked for very specific answers, was very difficult because it was very vague and could have referred to many different parts of the course. I wish there was more clarification about how the material all fits together in a bigger picture, or even if the broader themes could have been discussed at all.",
    "Extremely interesting topics and concepts, but course is very disorganized with little communication of requirements.",
    "The course is very interdisciplinary, things you wouldnt learn in other Yale College courses.",
    "Strength is breadth of unique information covered Weakness is it lacks organization",
    "Course seemed a little jumbled. Felt like I didn't have a lot of big takeaways."

    "I do not recommend this course!!! I took it thinking that it would a broad and interesting overview of strategy, technology, and war, yet it was only confusing and stressful. Professor Bracken's lectures are very hard to follow. Even though he has PowerPoints and an online dictionary of his key terms, his class is all over the place and he goes on lots of tangents, especially about his own career. He is an interesting person to have a meal with or attend a lecture for, but I would not recommend taking a course like this with him if you are new to one or several of these topics. Also, the only grades are a midterm and a final. The average grade on the midterm was a D, and he was very unclear about whether or not he would curve the class. Beware.",
    "Yes, it is very interesting and useful.",
    "Highly recommend for any student interested in Strategy technology and war. It was so rewarding listening to Professor Bracken's lectures and I learned so much from class discussions. Sometimes it is difficult to keep up with SOM students but I was so happy to be a part of the class.",
    "This class had a lot of potential to be very interesting and relevant today. But unfortunately, lectures were very difficult to follow and Professor Bracken many times talked about complicated topics without clarifying the point he was trying to make. It was also very difficult to engage with the material as it was directed towards SOM students who have prior experience with many of the models and strategies discussed. Due to this, the midterm and final were difficult because the vague questions looked for specific answers, and there could have been several different answers from different parts of the course. Overall, if you are interested to take this class, I would DEFINITELY recommend starting it Credit\/D\/Fail and then you can change after the midterm.",
    "I would only recommend as a credit\/d class, since it is impossible to gauge how well you are doing in the course and what kind of grade you'll receive.",
    "I would recommend this course if you are interested in a career in defense, or tech. Also, if you have a general interest in world affairs this class is a must-take.",
    "Credit D it"
