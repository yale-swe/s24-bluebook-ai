   "comments": [
    "This is a class that everyone should take! It teaches you theoretic pinnings behind econometric models, and it is really logical and elegant. If you are remotely interested in applying statistical methods to real life or social science studies, this class is a must.Professor Vytlacil is wonderful. He is incredibly friendly, accessible, clear and talented; his lecture notes are so well organized and his lectures are the ones that I looked forward to listening to every week. Too bad he is leaving this school, a huge loss for all of us.I do not hesitate at all to recommend this class to everyone. Seriously one of my favorite classes at Yale!",
    "Definitely take this if you would like to understand the econometric methods applied in economics papers and also to apply them in your own research. Keep in mind that this course assumes that you are comfortable with calculus\/linear algebra.",
    "It's a good course. And you have to take it if you're econ and math. If you're not econ and math, just as a warning, this is not for the light hearted.",
    "No. and Yes for ECON.MATH major only cuz come on...you had to take it...",
    "you don't really have an option if you're an econ-math major. that being said, the professor is one of the best and most lively i've encountered in the econ department.",
    "Yes, if you're a math\/econ major.",
    "ECON 136 is a very intensive, proof-based approach to applied and theoretical econometrics. I am a general economics major and took the class out of a desire to take a more rigorous approach to econometrics. I would not advise someone else do the same. The class is very difficult and without a professor as good as Professor Vytlacil, much more so. Unless you are an economics and mathematics major I would not recommend this course to you.",
    "ECON 136 is in many ways an introduction to graduate economics (and econometrics). It is much more rigorous than most other undergraduate economics classes, as well as numerous undergraduate statistics classes. Completely understanding the material is pretty difficult though you don't need to do that to do well in the course. Professor Vytlacil is overall a very good lecturer and explains things clearly. The homework is moderate, not too heavy and the exams were manageable.",
    "I\u0092d recommend taking this course (especially for more mathematically-oriented people) \u0096 it really helps you understand econometrics at a very fundamental level. You learn how to use Stata software and also get good practical applications to theory. However, I would make sure to get a good professor (too bad Prof. Vytlacil won\u0092t be teaching here next year); otherwise, the course may not be as enjoyable.Problem sets may take anywhere between 5-12 hours a week, but you only have 8 problem sets, and can drop 2. The exams are challenging, but manageable if you really look through your problem sets and understand them. Also, the course becomes easier to understand as the course progresses.",
    "Absolutely!",
    "I recommend ECON136 for students looking to take an econometrics course, especially if professor Vytlacil is the professor. The theoretical material that covers how tests work at the population level help you understand when you should and should not use different tests for samples, and the course was really applicable. I felt I got a lot out of the course, and recommend it highly.",
    "Economics 136was an excellent course and Professor Vytlacil is one of the best professors I have had while at Yale. The course was quite engaging and nicely synthesized all of the statistical knowledge we have learned through a full year of econometrics. I especially appreciated the theoretical focus of the course, which was great to know about when applying the theory to real world scenarios.",
    "This class was structured entirely upon Professor Vytlacil's lecture notes, which I have heard that he hasn't changed in at least 4 years. Professor Vytlacil's lectures are generally enjoyable; he is a better lecturer than most Econ\/Math professors and inserts the occasional joke. There was a textbook assigned, but it was only used for a small portion of our pset problems (1\/8).I would say that my main comment on this course has to do with the fact that the teaching comes entirely from lecture notes. While this would make sense and is comprehendible from the perspective of someone who is already familiar with the material, I prefer to get my first-hand learning from textbooks (which are inevitably more thorough). That being said, Professor Vytlacil was a great lecturer and likes to be engaging with his students. He was also very approachable during office hours.These assessments may be less relevant as Professor Vytlacil is leaving for NYU next year, but the review might still be cogent if he gives his lecture notes to the next professor.As far as grading, the class was straightforward. 25% psets (8 of them, with 2 lowest grades dropped), 25% midterm, 50% final.",
    "This class is strictly for students invested into the Econ and Math major. I do not recommend this class to students outside of this major.",
    "Econ 136 was a hard class that you will learn a lot in. The material is difficult, but it is essential to any math and econ major or anyone hoping to work with statistics and data sets in the future. I would recommend this course to anyone hoping to rigorously learn econometrics.",
    "This course is a great one. It is very challenging, and will require definite effort, but for those who are willing to spend the extra time understanding material it will pay off. The material is so well-taught that your understanding of econometrics at the end of the course will be extremely strong, and the professor is incredibly engaging and makes the material interesting to learn.",
    "A decent course, though be prepared to study a lot of the hard concepts on your own. The professor makes an impression that he is not teaching the concepts, but merely explaining them, which makes them hard to understand and master sometimes. Problem sets and exams are fine, and the curve is said to be nice, though most students in the course are very very strong in math\/econ in general."
