   "comments": [
    "I would not recommend PHIL 429 to a fellow student because of the organization difficulties in the class. The subject matter is interesting, although I consistently found myself confused throughout the semester as to where the class was going and how the arguments were building on each other.",
    "This course was by far one of the best that I have taken at Yale. Professor Della Rocca offers a unique approach to monism, posing hard-hitting questions for each of the philosophers and philosophical stances discussed while maintaining a delightful and entertaining disposition. Other students of the course showed a similar dedication to the material and I was constantly impressed by the level of discussion.",
    "Great class. Interesting material. Think about being and matter and a bunch of important philosophical issues. a lot of contemporary stuff, too, which for me was a new and beneficial experience.",
    "It's a sprawling discussion seminar on the two often distinct topics of priority and existence monism; much reading by Schaffer, Horgan and Portc, Bradley, etc. \u0096\u00a0a contemporary bunch, excepting Bradley. MRD is fully hilarious and amiable. Things can get pretty muddled unless you're one of the six people who is doing the talking, but there's no animosity here, because what would we do without those people!!! Reading is necessary is you want to really follow but not crucial. Two easy essays. Always runs 10 minutes over.",
    "Definitely take a course with Prof. Della Rocca: he is a great teacher and interesting thinker. As he is so popular, his seminars tend to be over-subscribed; it is nevertheless worthwhile to take his class.Monism is becoming an increasingly hot topic in contemporary philosophy at the moment and is interesting to study. In some sense even more interesting, however, was to see how Prof. Della Rocca approaches philosophical inquiry and reflects on our means and way to do philosophy. Take it!",
    "One of my favorite philosophy seminars during my time at Yale. MDR is the ideal discussion leader: so engaging, lively, excited about the material, funny, clear. The material was very accessible, considering that it was metaphysics, and the class really got a handle on the issues as the year developed. Also, one of the central figures on the syllabus actually came and visited to answer questions about his ideas, and he was awesome. If this class is offered again, absolutely take it.",
    "I recommend this class to any relatively serious student of philosophy. At times the papers we read were a bit technical, so a solid grasp of first order and mathematical logic would be helpful.",
    "Monsim is a comprehensive class on a wide variety of topics that fall under the umbrella concept of monism, such as composition, grounding, and various ways of combining different concepts. I would absolutely recommend this class to another student- it challenges the way you think about the world and makes you more humble in your original opinions, something I think it valuable to any student, philosophy or not.",
    "Interesting material (hardcore metaphysics--not something I'd done before) with an engaging professor. Della Rocca managed the classroom well, and was knowledgeable (he's sort of a big deal in the field), entertaining, and highly accessible to answer questions and help with papers.The worst part of the class was how the first half was basically Zeno's paradox of motion. We kept on cutting the distance to the end in half, never reaching the end. Nice that there was a lot to talk about, but we didn't get to all of the syllabus. So the overall strategy needed some work.He got Jonathan Schaffer to come, though, which was sweet.",
    "Monism is an interesting and manageable class. I didn't have much experience with metaphysicsprior to this seminar, and honestly didn't think it was the most interesting branch of philosophy, but taking Monism really changed my mind about it. The readings built well on each other and Professor Della Rocca is a really great Professor who leads a low-key class setting which is still intellectually vigorous."
