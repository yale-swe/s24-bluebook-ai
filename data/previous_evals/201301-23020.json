    "This class works well in conjunction with HIST 255 the experience of war in the 20th century. Also I think it is hard to get a good grade without being a film major.",
    "Yes - especially if you do not like reading, and you enjoy watching movies. Just don't expect any exciting war movies, most of them are really depressing and rarely show battle scenes.",
    "Yes. Good class, low workload, interesting material.",
    "If you really like watching war movies, take this. If not, don't. You have to watch, essentially, over 20 films during the semester, and it can get really, really tedious if this isn't something that you really enjoy.",
    "Keep this in mind if you're thinking about taking this class: watching two movies a week requires a bigger time commitment than you'd think. When I heard that the homework was to watch two movies a week I thought it would be a breeze, but I got really behind really quickly and Biggs's finals are really difficulty. Also there are three 6-7 page papers and it isn't a writing credit, so there's that.All that said it was an interesting class.",
    "Great course, lots of great movies",
    "Not easy, who ever said it was, was lying. Do not take if looking for a gut. Only good thing about is that the final was only worth 25%. A lot of work for a films class and the TAs grade surprisingly hard. Spare yourself the time, don't take it.",
    "I would recommend it as a random interest class. I would nto recommend it to somebody with no film experience or somebody who wants to watch war blockbusters like Saving Private Ryan, because all the movies are lower profile.",
    "You watch a good number of really interesting movies and hear extremely brief lectures on each on (50 min per movie - time spent discussing background and clips). Prof. Biggs is a great lecturer but some of the guest lecturers are strange, boring, or provide little insight into the films.",
    "Do it for a humanities credit. It's three 6-7 page essays each comparing two films. The films themselves are very interesting and I would probably have watched them outside of class.",
    "Two films a week, usually focusing more on the \"off-duty\" aspects of war (soldiers on leave, collateral damage at home, etc). Three papers and a final. I would definitely recommend it! It's not easy (despite promises from past years) but the fact that there is no reading, only films, makes it a good fifth class for humanities students bogged down in thousands of weekly pages and looking for a different kind of work.",
    "I felt the course could have benefited from the inclusion a pro-war movie such as Top Gun or T2: Judgment Day to round out the offerings.",
    "I would recommend this class for anyone interested in film studies and history. Note: not a class about watching action movies, but the focus is on the \"experiences of war\", less violent and more interesting.",
    "Would recommend. 9\/10.",
    "Highly recommend this course. Some gruesome, some uplifting films - all will expand your mind.",
    "It's exactly what it sounds like and it's overall well taught. Very interesting. My biggest qualm is the focus on WWI and WWII. Would've loved to see more variety in the wars that were covered."
