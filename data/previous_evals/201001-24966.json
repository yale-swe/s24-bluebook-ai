    "Better than Cell Biology from what I head, so if you get to choose I would definitely recommend this course. One quiz per week keeps you up to date on knowing your information, and the class was very interesting. No problem sets, no final...heaven.",
    "YES. i learned so much from this course. i didn't like the plant\/developmental stuff learned in intro bio but these professors make it very interesting and applicable! why kill yourself in cell bio when you can take this enjoyable course?",
    "interesting course, but it can be rough staying awake at 9am. Very important to go to class because I felt if I missed a day of class, I would be very lost. Midterms are difficult so study!",
    "",
    "Dev bio is one of the best bio classes I've taken at Yale. The workload is extremely manageable, there was no section (nor was it necessary, there were plenty of review sessions beforeexams), and the material itself is absolutely fascinating. The tests are very fair and the weekly quizzes are very representative of what exam questions will be like.",
    "This is a great class to take. It is a fairly easy bio class that does not have much work.",
    "I would recommend this course if you're interested in Dev Bio. It's not hard and is specific enough to be interesting."
