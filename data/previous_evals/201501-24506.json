    "This was a great course. Really interesting, state-of-the-art material taught in a well-thought-out manner. We managed to touch on a lot of aspects of geometry learning and spectral methods. Coursework includes a couple of open-ended coding exercises which really helped with our understanding of the material, and a student lecture.",
    "This course is an overview of some of the more mathematical aspects of modern machine learning, emphasizing the (Yale-developed) diffusion maps method, and related things. Basically, diffusion maps is a nonlinear dimensionality reduction technique that is backed up by a great deal of mathematics, which says that you can recover the Laplacian of a manifold really well given samples from the manifold. It's quite fun and the professor is very active in the field. The problems are interesting, and you get to implement and test out the methods you learn about. Take it if you can.",
    "I would recommend this class as an effective introduction to this field of machine learning."
