   "comments": [
    "This is a really great course. I wish that all courses at public health were taught this way. You learn to think critically and improve your writing skills. I think that this class is set up exactly how a graduate course should be configured.Also, the class size is perfect. Don't let it get bigger than that or the beauty of the discussions will be lost.",
    "This was an excellent class, covering a broad range of topics in a relevant and meaningful way. Probably what I gained most from the class, above and beyond knowledge of specific parasites, was how to critique a scientific article. By the end of the semester I couldn't read a paper, even for another class, without trying to find holes or flaws in it.",
    "This was an excellent course - it was small which allowed for good discussion of the papers that we reviewed and critiqued. Both instructors were excellent, invited discussion, were very approachable and knowledgeable in the field.",
    "I really liked the way this course was taught. It was helpful in getting exposure not just to different parasites, but other faculty at Yale and the research being done here. Also, being taught to read papers\/think of research critically is really important and I like that the course centered around that.",
    "this class really helped me learn how to write critiques of scientific papers, which is exactly what i wanted to get out of the course. i was also able to learn more about various parasites because of the different types of papers we read. overall, i thought it was a great course. one way it might be improved is to do the review game we did more than once throughout the semester; it served as a fun way to check and make sure we were retaining all that we had learned up until that point.",
    "Strengths-It introduced us to the techniques of scientific reviews-Informed us about the status of scientific investigations of tropical infectious diseases-Inspired us to be creativeWeakness-Reviewing two dense scientific papers per week was too tasking and it affected my effectiveness-It was difficult to gauge the expectations of the instructors",
    "The course did an excellent job of looking at progressive research and applying critical thought and evaluation to these disease. I liked that it did not rehash pathogenesis per se, but more assumed that understanding and looked at modern papers. However, sometimes the papers were too technical and difficult to understand to someone not intimate with that pathogen."

    "Instructor: Christian Tschudi \u00a0Dr. Tschudi is a great teacher because he knows the subject and yet doesn't expect the student to know every detail of his field. The trivia PowerPoints were a fun way to try and remember the facts you had learned.",
    "Instructor: Christian Tschudi \u00a0Dr. Tschudi was very knowledgeable and helpful in class. I think he was somewhat tough on us, especially in our critiques, but I appreciated that and I think it pushed us harder.",
    "Instructor: Christian Tschudi \u00a0Excellent professor. Encouraged us to be critical of the papers and invited discussion and debate amongst students. Was very nice and helpful when asked questions.",
    "Instructor: Christian Tschudi \u00a0Chris was really helpful with comments and ways to improve the critiques. I appreciated his feedback and I think it really improved my writing.",
    "Instructor: Christian Tschudi \u00a0Strength-Adequate background in the subject area-He always gave useful introductory lectures which helped us understand complex techniques and processes-very supportive to studentsWeakness- Did not provide much guidance on how students could improve on their essays",
    "Instructor: Christian Tschudi \u00a0He was amazing and very helpful. He brought an excellent energy to the class and I enjoyed his lectures very much.",
    "Instructor: Diane McMahon-Pratt \u00a0Dr. McMahon-Pratt is so intelligent and down-to-earth. I love talking to her about subjects because there is absolutely nothing condescending about her. She obviously really cares about the students.",
    "Instructor: Diane McMahon-Pratt \u00a0Dr. McMahon-Pratt was extremely knowledgeable on a broad range of topics and was really great to study under this semester. I found that her feedback and criticism was always constructive and helped push me to do better on my critiques and in class.",
    "Instructor: Diane McMahon-Pratt \u00a0Also an excellent professor. She was very kind and helpful for all of the students - Always had great comments to make about critiques and discussion in the classroom. Very knowledgeable and approachable.",
    "Instructor: Diane McMahon-Pratt \u00a0Diane was great at answering any questions I had throughout the course (I had a lot) and if she didn't know the answer would look into it for me, which I appreciated.I think teaching for both instructors could be improved by engaging the class in more of a discussion before the student presentations (i.e. asking for detail\/clarification when students comment on the paper, so it's not just everyone repeating the same thing).",
    "Instructor: Diane McMahon-Pratt \u00a0Strength-Adequate background in the subject area- Always gave useful introductory lectures which helped us understand complex techniques and processes-Gave suggetions on how students could improve on their workWeaknessI found it difficult to tell what her grading standards were like",
    "Instructor: Diane McMahon-Pratt \u00a0She is an extremely intelligent professor that asks key questions that stimulate critical thinking. I enjoyed her lectures and benefited greatly from her knowledge of microbial diseases."

   "comments": [
    "Yes, it is a class that you will learn a lot and really improve your skills in critical thinking and writing, which is, really, what graduate school is all about. I wish there were more classes like this at Yale.",
    "This class focuses on a variety of human parasites, often from a molecular point-of-view. It has 8ish written critiques (each generally of 2 journal articles, ~2 pages each), an individual presentation of an article one week, and a short final presentation. The work load was very consistent over the entire semester and the class did not have large midterm or final projects, which was very nice.I would recommend this class, as it is one of the better high-level EMD classes I have taken.",
    "This course reviews various eukaryotic parasites, their life cycles, drug development, and other efforts being made to control infection. I would highly recommend this course - it is probably one of the best that I have had at EPH.",
    "This course is really helpful in getting you engaged in research in parasitology. It's not theoretical or broad, but more detailed and practical. I found this course really helpful for my future career plans.",
    "i would recommend this class to students who want to learn how to better critique papers and evaluate them with a more critical eye. you learn more about parasites that you may have not been exposed to thus far. but you are also expected to come with prior knowledge as well so some lessons are more of a review than new. the structure of the class was good and i enjoyed going to it every day. i feel like my paper critiquing skills definitely improved throughout the semester.",
    "Yes I would recommend this course, but I would suggest reviewing some biochemistry before taking the course.",
    "An excellent, fun course where you learn an incredible amount!"
