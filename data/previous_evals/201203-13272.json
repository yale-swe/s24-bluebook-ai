    "It was an awesome class. Very relaxing, even though it still has a substantial amount of work. I highly recommend it.",
    "Basic Drawing was very good, but I might caution someone who has lots of drawing experience against taking it. Although a more experienced artist can easily enjoy and get something out of this class, it really caters to people who have never drawn before. We surveyed a lot of drawing themes - still life, interior\/exterior space, abstraction, and the figure - but the emphasis, in terms of materials, was on charcoal and ink (we only used pencil for one assignment). With each new theme, we would take a trip to the Prints, Drawings, and Photographs room in the art gallery, which was really interesting and provided a nice launching pad for our own drawings. Professor Betbeze and our TA Tom were great - super friendly, constructive, and understanding. They weren't too harsh in their critiques of homework, and they always knew how to frame suggestions so that they were constructive. They responded carefully and critically to those who sought help and feedback but kept their distance from others who preferred to just do their own thing.",
    "I would recommend this class to another student only if he or she is serious about improving his or her level of drawing.",
    "Take it if you can get in! Anna is THE BEST. I actually couldn't believe how much I improved over the course of the semester. Homework is not bad - I never spent more than 2 hours a week on drawings. You learn a LOT from your classmates - observation is key to improvement. Don't be daunted though by the abundance of talent in the class. I'm pretty sure you are graded based on your personal improvement.",
    "It's a decent amount of work, so if you like drawing at all, take it. A little annoying to lug the drawing board around but other than that...",
    "Take it! The class allows you to create your own pieces of artwork that you are proud of.",
    "Basic Drawing was a good experience for me as someone who did a fair amount of art in high school but none in my first two years at Yale. Prof. Betbeze is great -- she is really friendly, understanding (she will find something kind to say about even your bad drawings), and good at giving the critiques that will help you improve. Her section is apparently the only one that gets to life drawing at the end of the semester, and I love life drawing, so it's worth it for that alone. I also really enjoyed the three trips to the YUAG to look at master works.It seems like Betbeze's section is one of the lighter Basic Drawing work loads. She asks you to spend 3-5 hours on your homework eachweek, but you have a whole week to do that. I ended up putting a lot of hours into my final drawing and felt really good about that \u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00c2\u00a0it's due before Reading Week so it doesn't interfere with term papers or finals too much.",
    "Everyone should take this class and take it with Anna Betbeze. It's fun and very little work, but your drawing skills will improve no matter what level you start at. Studio time was just a lot of process-driven exercises, and the one assignment each week was a welcome way to procrastinate other classes work.",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone - whether or not they have an interest in art. If you are an art major, take this class: you'll have fun and learn something. If you have never done art, take this class anyways: you'll learn a TON and you might find a new passion.",
    "Definitely recommended - be aware though that you will not be taught how to draw. This class is about learning through experience. Homework is a great break from the typical papers and problem sets.",
    "Yes!",
    "I would definitely recommend taking this class. You don't need to be an art major, and your improvement (or lack thereof) will be noted even if you're not an awesome artist.",
    "Great humanities credit! Take it if you're willing to spend 2-4 hours a week on your weekly assignment (which isn't asking much).This class has a steady, predictable workload, which was exactly what I needed to balance my semester. The only assignments are a drawing each week, which will take between 2-4 hours to complete (dependingon how hard you want to try). Classes are two 1hr50min sessions a week in the art studio. And that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s it. You work almost exclusively with charcoal, which is a pretty cool medium. I had only done uninstructed sketches in high school, but now I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m pretty confident working with large pad and charcoal.While subjective, your grade is largely based on improvement. If you spend around 3 hrs each week on your drawing (it was obvious that several students weren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t), you should do well. I would say that my artwork was around the 60th percentile compared to my classmates, but I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll probably get a top mark. For reference, there were 2 art majors out of a class of ~18 students; the rest were just decent to good drawers, like myself.",
    "Great Class. Homework takes time but worth it."
