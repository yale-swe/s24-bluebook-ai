    "I took this course right after Prof. Emerson's Stat 230 (Introduction to Data Analysis). They have similar names, but are very different. Stat 230, a.k.a. \"A Crash Course in R\", involves cleaning up messy data sets and one-upping your neighbors by figuring out the brainteasers before they do. (Emerson loves analysis projects that are basically just brainteasers.) So you emerge from Stat 230 sort of good at R, but you don't actually have many tools beyond \"here, watch me fit this linear model\" and \"here, watch me be cleverer than you\". Stat 361 goes way beyond Stat 230, in terms of rigor. It spends maybe a day or two introducing you to R, then starts tossing you very sophisticated, detailed methodologies for flashy types of analysis. You emerge with tools like \"here, watch me do this cluster analysis on Boston housing data\" and \"here, watch me predict what types of mushrooms are poisonous with a classification tree\". And while Emerson was always like \"well why don't you guess intuitively what that function in R does?\", Lisha Chen was like \"let me explain very thoroughly what this does because I don't want you to suffer\". I suppose Emerson is building intuition\/character with that teaching style. But I preferred Lisha's forthrightness. It saved me a lot of heartache and time-wasting.So, yeah. Emerson will make you good at dealing with real-life data sets and teach you to be \"clever\". Chen will coddle you in terms of data (everything is pre-cleaned), but she'll teach you all the sophisticated stuff that Emerson glosses over. Both courses were good. If you're serious about data analysis, go ahead and take both. Though if you don't know R very well, you might want to hold off on this one.By the way, this is about the least stressful \"math\" class I've ever taken. Everything was covered in the scripts posted online. Everything. You could always figure out the homework, even if for some reason you missed the lecture.",
    "I would recommend that any student who use data analysis in the future take this class. It may not be the most exciting, but it is not difficult, and will give you cool parametric and non-parametric tools for your future endeavors. If you're applied math definitely take this over STAT 230 any day. Well worth it. Chen's lectures were nearly optional, but the material was great.",
    "If you're interested in gaining a solid set of DA skills, this is a good class to take.",
    "I am a computer science major, and it was really great for me to have STAT 361 as a class to sort of make my own. The projects are mostly self-directed, and you are challenged to find or create a data set and analyze it for the final project. I recommend it to anyone interested in more complex computer science or statistics.",
    "Good class if you like data analysis. Learned alot about programing in r. definetly requires previous stats classes.",
    "Take Stat 361 if you want to learn a bunch of data analysis techniques in R. However, if you already know R, it may not be a great use of your time.",
    "A good class to learn about various R data analysis techniques, but not particularly great or inspiring."
