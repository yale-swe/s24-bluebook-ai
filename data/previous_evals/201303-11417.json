    "I would recommend that you take it, but don't expect to learn much.",
    "Definitely. New language. Do it.",
    "absolutely an interesting language",
    "All in all, I very much enjoyed this semester of Yoruba.This class is intriguing because Yoruba, as a language, is extremely unique - especially for a non-African student. Our professor is energetic and engaged, which is excellent, especially for such a small class. The one drawback, I would say, is that the accountability for the material is inconsistent. We have quizzes every three weeks, but outside of class, there isn't much homework that allows us to practice the material, except on the weekends. The final project - a presentation in Yoruba on our families - was both fun and challenging to put together.It may be more satisfying to take a language class that has study abroad opportunities available because there are currently no Yale programs associated with Yoruba that travel to Nigeria.",
    "Yes, highly recommend. Very straightforward class."
