    "Russian is really fun! It's certainly not an easy language if you have no background, but it's interesting and I really enjoyed it because my family is Russian. Take it! Vika is SO sweet.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student. Russian language and culture are very interesting, and the small class size is great. The class does require almost daily work to stay on top of the assignments, but for 1.5 credits, the workload is definitely manageable.",
    "If you're interested in Russian, take it, if you aren't, don't!",
    "Russian 120 03 is a continuation of the fall semester introductory Russian language course. I would definitely recommend Russian 120 03. However, the course is challenging, so it should be taken only by those students who are serious about the study of Russian. My class, for example, was at 11:35am, Monday through Friday, and I would set aside the morning hours from 8am onwards solely to prepare for the day's lesson."
