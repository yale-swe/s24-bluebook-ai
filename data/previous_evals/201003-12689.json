    "This was the first year this course has been offered, and it certainly could have benefited from a little more focus. That being said, Inderpal and Laura and both awesome instructors and if you enjoy reading theory, you will learn a lot from this class.",
    "The class touches upon various issues in media, gender, and sexuality with a greater emphasis on the latter two roles in popular culture. The readings were sometimes too skewed in one direction, and there could have been more emphasis on the theory of media itself-- what role it plays in society, what different media says and how it changes when we switch to another-and not just of gender and sexuality. There is a hefty amount of reading each week, a reading response, 4 \"Aha\" blog posts (posts in which what we read resonates in real life), and a final digital media in which groups of 2 students create re-create a street outside the US and in a different time period. The course was a bit all over the place. Take it only if you're genuinely interested in gender and sexuality issues.",
    "I have very mixed feelings about this course--the biggest reason being the final project. 70% of your grade is based on this project. Throughout the semester the only other thing you haveto do is lead discussion and post reading responses and comments to the class' blog in response to weekly readings (which are usually theory heavy and sometimes very long).For the final project we had to create a representation of a street. You are probably wondering, what do you mean by that? Most of us felt the exact same way throughout the semester. This was the first time the course was offered, so maybe that is why everyone was usually confused by what the professors expected of us, but generally, there was a sense of frustration that the professors were asking us to do this media project without really defining what the final packet as a whole would look like.The final project is a group project which can be good or bad.In order to complete the final project, you have to learn software that most of us had never used before (photoshop, flash, imovie, sketch etc). This meant that on top of our weekly 2 hr seminar, we would have to meet at night for another 2 hrs to learn how to use this software. Really take this into consideration! The class will take up 4 hrs every week. This was not too fun and got stressful. Also, there is only so much you can learn in these labs, so it meant that by the end, every group was simply meeting with the TA separately to figure out how to use their own particular software that they were using for their project. Most ppl ended up using software that was not even taught in lab. So you have to factor in all the hours you will potentially spend learning how to use the software for your project. The final project ALSO includes a written section (10-12pgs). So on top of completing a media project using confusing software, you have to do research and write it all up. So yes, this class is a lot of work, and you will spend a couple of late nights with your group trying to frantically get it all together.The TA is wonderful. If it weren't for Yianni, this class would have fallen apart. He is the one that will help you get through the project.If you are willing toput in the time, then maybe take this class. The group projects, after MUCH STRESS and complaining, turned out to be really good and interesting. But I am not sure it was worth it in the end. The professors didn't really seem to know what direction they wanted the class to go in. And the students felt lost most of the time.",
    "I would recommend this course because the material is usually interesting, and the discussions are great and sometimes random which I love.",
    "This class is in my focus of study for my senior essay, so there was no way I could not take it. I'm glad to say I did learn a lot from it, but not as much as I could have if it were better organized. It suffered from all the usual problems that come with being a new class, being media-heavy, and having multiple instructors. And the workload and time commitment was HUGE (2-hr media lab every week outside the seminar + lots of reading + blog posts + a huge digital media final project). That said, I do recommend shopping it to see if they've fixed some of these problems in future semesters. It's a really great topic (in what other class would you get to talk about Nicki Minaj and Facebook and LOLcats?), and the class has good potential.",
    "This was the first time that this class was every taught, and despite all the confusion that entailed throughout the course of the semester, is was a great class with a very rewarding end project. We had weekly reading responses to blog posts that we had to post one of throughout the semester. Discussions were great and the professors are great discussion leaders. The end projects were a lot of work and required us to learn different media methods (Photoshop, Google Earth, SketchUp, are examples) but putting everything together was awesome. If you're into pop culture and literature on it, and you enjoy project-based classes, do take this class. This is definitely one of the highlights of my Yale classes.",
    "If you want to spend two hours discussing facebook through gender and media theory, or avatars, or twitter, or any social media, then this is the class for you. The professors are fantastic, but the discussion didn't always match. It all culminates in a final street project, where you have to (vaguely) create a (vaguely) virtual street in some time and place that isn't modern-day America. So there was a video tour through Main Street USA in Tokyo Disney, a google map of Jamaica in the 19th century, a few google sketchup models of 1960s London underground, an elevator installation that recreated the Sputnik media experience. Cool stuff, but only if you're really interested.",
    "So its a really interesting concept. And you learn some cool theory at the beginning and then read some cool application throughout the semester. After a while it got boring. It's just one of those classes that could have been pushed more and wasn't. Take it if you're interested in both theory and application for media and pop culture and don't mind the focus mainly being on gender studies. Also, you HAVE to do the reading if you want to follow in class or participate, and its GREAT when people are excited to talk. It's not when people haven't done the reading.The final project is fascinating but a big time commitment. Be prepared for all of your work in this class to be due at the end of the semester."
