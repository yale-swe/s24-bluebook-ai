   "comments": [
    "This was the first time I was able to read and follow along with readings by Nietzsche, Foucault, and Freud.",
    "This course pushed me to articulate and vocalize my reflections to my colleagues, weekly. This has not always been a part of my seminar experiences. I was grateful that this was encouraged and the space was made for each individual to be listened to and respectfully engaged.",
    "I gained significant knowledge in theory as it related to the confession. I also gained a solid groundwork in the history \/ specificity in context of confessional texts.",
    "This course offered me a great overview of the history of confessional literature, as well as the critical and historical context of confession."

   "question_id": "GS403",
   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I did not really like the one-word headers for each week because I often disagreed with the framing choices. I really liked all of the readings though, as well as the order that they appeared on the syllabus.",
    "The weekly Confessions Playlist reflections were definitely a highlight. This project encouraged students to think critically about the prevalence of the discussed subjects in the most overlooked spaces. I was challenged by and surprised by how each student heard their selected songs and what they took away from them. I enjoyed the two guest lecturers we had as well as the spread of materials we engaged. I wonder if this course could be supplemented by more guest lectures especially from other disciplines.",
    "I loved the readings and particularly enjoyed when Caleb guided us through the readings - especially interconnecting week to week. I wish the course had actually engaged more with the comparisons\/contrasts\/developments between the variety of texts so we could address overarching themes of confession. This happened in the reading responses but less so in class. I was motivated by the class and gained a fuller understanding of the content, which was excellent.",
    "I found the textual variety to be a great strength of the course, and particularly enjoyed delving into conversation about modern writings about confession (for example, I thought our session on \"Confession of the Fox\" was particularly interesting and rewarding). I would have loved even more discussion of modern and contemporary literature."

   "comments": [
    "Yes, because of the really valuable foundational information in the beginning of the semester.",
    "Yes. I would really encourage this course to be promoted at the Divinity School.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to anyone interested in the history of confession, American literature, or theoretically rigorous literature courses.",
    "Yes! I loved the content, Caleb's lectures on the content, and the guests we had. While I wished there had been more feedback on our written work throughout to better set up the final paper, I do think the course was quite useful.",
    "I would recommend this course to anybody interested in learning more about confessional traditions, about the historical understanding of confession, and particularly to anyone interested in the relationship between confession, sexuality, and guilt."
