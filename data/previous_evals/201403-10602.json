    "This is a great class for those interested in the history of agricultural societies. It is a deep look--more lecture than seminar--at agrarian systems in several societies across time with a particular focus on China, India and the United States.",
    "Strongly recommend to anyone doing any program even remotely related to farming",
    "Yes I would recommend the course. I firmly believe in the benefits of collaborating with and learning from scholars in other disciplines, and this course offers students this opportunity. This course requires a lot of reading and time, however, so I would warn students that they will gain from this course only as much as they're willing to put in; ideas and information are in no way spoon-fed (despite the lecture-component).",
    "I would recommend it to anyone interested even vaguely in environmental history and agrarian studies - the course expects not too much prior knowledge of anything. However there's a lot of information to process. For anyone interested in critical theory and intellectual history,this is not"

    "I think this class offered an approach for linking the society on which I will conduct my dissertation research to other world societies. In this sense, I have a more effective standard for judging what is unique and what is representative about my world area. Thanks for a great class!",
    "It really taught me how broad but relevant agrarian studies are.",
    "This course gave me a more global perspective of the topics and themes in which I'm most interested. It also allowed me to research and write about the topic I hope to study for my doctoral research.",
    "I learnt a lot about labor and infrastructure, irrigation. Most things I was unfamiliar with, and are useful to me in many ways."
