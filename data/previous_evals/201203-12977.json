   "comments": [
    "Absolutely loved this course! Fantastic material and even better professor. Professor Howorth was a joy to have in class every Monday. He was so knowledgable and made the class very engaging. He truly cared about all our opinions and pushed us to develop new ideas. It seemed like he was learning with us every class.",
    "You'll learn a lot and if world events are of any interest to you...take it!",
    "Great seminar. The syllabus tells it as it is -- the class provides an introduction to U.S. - European relations since the end of the Cold War. The classes focus primarily on the political relationship (only one or two sessions on economics). Prof. Howorth is great and knows the topic backwards and forwards. The coursework isn't too intensive and the weekly readings take relatively little time. Work for the class is mostly concentrated around the two essays that are required.",
    "Take this class! It will give you a good idea of the state of the relationship between America and the EU, and it is very relevant to current events. Professor Howorth is a great seminar leader and encourages students to think critically about the issues facing the transatlantic alliance. The reading load is manageable, and there are only two papers in the course.",
    "Would recommend.",
    "This course is an interesting overview of transatlantic relations. You cover a lot of topics, from culture to economic to security. Some of the readings are more interesting than others, but class discussions are generally fun.Professor Howorth is a great discussion leader and a very helpful professor.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this class to students who want to have an overview of security relations between America and Europe and also get an interesting bit of the economic, trade and cultural relations of the US and Europe. Professor Howorth is very intelligent, friendly, knowledgeable and approachable. The seminar has a few student presentations in the beginning half an hour (which I personally did not particularly liked) and is sometimes more of a conversation than a critical assessment of the readings. It is a nice class to attend, except for the frustrating times when students say things that make no sense and they are not called out about it.",
    "The perfect class for someone who is interested in 20th century history as well as current international events (US and European foreign policy more specifically). It offers a new analytical lens on these events and allows us to study them more critically. Extremely interesting stuff, and Professor Howorth is truly the greatest.",
    "Yes, I would, one of the most interesting seminars at Yale. Like one of the most interesting lunch discussions you would have with your classmates and professors, but formalized in a class. You learn a lot, and come out of it thinking differently.",
    "A great course! If you're interested in the future of US-European relations, then you can't do better than this seminar. Professor Howorth not only really knows his stuff, but is great to work with too. The workload is on the lower end of average for a higher GA or Poli Sci seminar. I'd recommend. it.",
    "Great class if you're interested in US-EU relations in the 21st century. Howorth is a great professor (and person!) and you will enjoy taking a seminar with him."
