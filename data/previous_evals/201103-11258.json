    "I would love more time with Mark, Marlyse, and Richard out in the field--but I realize they were stretched thin as it was.",
    "The work is back-loaded--the class starts up slowly and then you will get slammed at the end. Even though my group kept up with the scheduled work, crunch time was extremely unpleasant. I recommend that the instructor's get students going more immediately on data collection and tell them RIGHT AWAY that it's one line per tree when you're entering data in excel. We asked several times for advice on how to organize a spreadsheet, and we were told to wait until the lecture on the topic, when all someone had to say to us was \"one line per tree.\" students should get to see a sample spreadsheet from years past before starting. if you haven't been on forest crew or done timber cruises before, it's doubtful you'd know what to do without that kind of support.",
    "This is the best class I have taken ever.",
    "Marlyse was a fantastic TF--super knowledgeable and dedicated, and always gave us a huge amount of her time.",
    "4. The workload was heavier, but this is to be expected because it is a 6 credit course. But, I did do more than your average 6-credits worth of work.",
    "Spending a lot of time in the field is valuable, but spending a lot of time in the car is not. There are good reasons why the work was done up near Yale Myers, but the class would have been less of a burden time-wise if a less distant site was involved.Field trips were good, worthwhile, and enjoyable, but the amount of time blocked out was often much greater than the content. I would suggest combining more than one of them into one day, which would be easy) to free up another Friday, or having another overnight to Yale Myers etc to free up multiple Fridays\/Saturdays. This would be just as effective and be more mindful of students' time.",
    "A whole weekend is dedicated in the beginning to touring all of the properties, as a class. This was a HUGE waste of time. We could easily have made it a day trip, with the teams splitting up and later reporting to others what the other properties were like"

    "Time in the forest and the requirements to analyze all sorts of things--including soils and hydrology, for example, which I'm not particularly interested in. Demanding GIS. Though thank God we had a GIS guru on our team--without that, it would have been challenging to deliver all of the maps needed.I loved my larger team, and I think that future courses should really evaluate the strength\/weakness of having large teams (ours was a five-person team) versus small teams (2-3 people). I do fear that the smaller teams had a huge burden especially given that they may not have had expertise in all of the areas.",
    "The ability to take what we are learning in class and apply it in a real situation, working with a real client.",
    "great field trips. great sense of accomplishment. great to get out into the field with my group and sample. i learned a lot about the forest by being in it for ~8 hours a week (and often more) during sampling season.",
    "Everything",
    "Its practical nature.",
    "Synthesizing a lot of my work experience and coursework so far into a large project. Learning about Connecticut. Understanding the steps of a management plan from start to finish. Mark, Marlyse, and Richard's help and encouragement.",
    "1. Dr. Ashton is a demanding and yet wonderful teacher.2. This course forces you to truly synthesize- physical sciences, GIS, social assessments, presentation skills, team work and desktop publishing. You finish by producing a professional-grade product.3. The mix of classroom time and field time is perfect.4. Professor Ashton does a nice job of blending demanding deadlines with an understanding that grad school life is hectic.",
    "The set of skills we learned.",
    "Seeing a large and complex project through -- from start to finish -- was very rewarding. Mark Ashton is a terrific teacher. Beyond his knowledge of applied ecology, he clearly cares deeply about students. He worked harder than any of us to ensure we were equipped for success. Richard and Marlyse were a great resource and always available to answer questions, head into the field, or read through drafts.",
    "I had the opportunity to work with a client to develop a management plan from scratch. I learnt a lot of valuable skills which will go a long way in helping me in my future career. I also got the chance to in a team of 4 students integrate other courses, such as Stand Dynamics, Silviculture and Sampling I had taken at the school in previous semesters to actually apply them to a real life problem. I got the chance to learn a bit about soils, hydrology, social assessments and GIS which I had very little knowledge about.",
    "The breadth of subject matter it covered, and the real world application of the work and analysis.",
    "Hard choice. The professor - but the TA and Richard, forest manager, were also really important to the success of the class. We were really happy with our projects this year. My teammate was fantastic.",
    "we learned a lot in the end, and were forced to get better at GIS and excel, which are necessary evils"

   "comments": [
    "Ashton's lectures were a bit loose this semester. I would recommend taking out the stakeholder assessment, or really just condensing it to a 60-minute lecture. Most of it was common sense. There were one or two other lectures that felt the same--I didn't get most of the value this semester from the lectures, but rather field trips, our biophysical inventory, my internet and academic research, and time analyzing our data.I think that Mark and the TA need to do a MUCH BETTER job on the lecture on crunching data. We had asked for guidance, received none, and then already started inputting data into our own forms, only to discover weeks later that we'd done it incorrectly, an Excel file that was a template already existed (and hadn't been pointed out to us). Furthermore, I think there are some tools that we might be able to use to simplify data crunching. These templates should be updated in advance of the course, any kinks should be worked out, and they should be presented to the course in advance of the first day of data collection done by independent teams. Furthermore, the lecture Marlyse gave on the side about crunching data in the Excel and on Pivot tables was heavily attended by nearly every member of the class, on a Sunday. Rather than make it an add-on, and the TA's responsibility, Mark should simply do this as one of his lectures.",
    "the timeline (discussed above).",
    "Nothing",
    "Nothing--it is well organized and a great course.",
    "Communication between instructor and students. E-mailing one day prior can be a little nerve-racking.",
    "We should get pizza like the 5 oclock class.....jk",
    "1. The workshop on forest inventory analysis needs improvement and it would be nice to explicitly state the best way to enter forest data and to do so early on in the course.2. Many landowners like wildlife and birds- it would be nice to have a guest lecture\/field tour by a wildlife biologist who could also explain an effective way to talk\/analyze more coherently about wildlife.",
    "A budget should be set aside for this class like for other classes to aid students with things like transportation, food etc. as there are a lot of back and forth traveling involved.Oh",
    "There's a good reason why we cover such a breadth of material, but it often felt like we got only a cursory overview of it, and then we were expected to produce a competent product with little to go on. I'm not sure how to fix this - I understand and support the need to be a self-starter in this regard, but we too often felt like we had no idea which was to go with something, necessitating perhaps too many or unnecesessary questions for the prof and TAs.",
    "The GIS lecture could be improved (maybe have it in a computer lab?).The deadlines could be a little bit tighter at the beginning of the semester (basic introduction to property, location, history, without the deed survey, could all be due after week 1 or 2 - to get teams started?)",
    "mark is overworked, and the lectures seemed to suffer a bit. it didn't really seem like we learned too much in class, although the classes are generally fun. rather, he would touch on what we were supposed to learn, then it would be a bit of \"trial by fire\" out in the field. i suppose he intends it to be that way a bit. mark shines out in the field, not on power-point."
