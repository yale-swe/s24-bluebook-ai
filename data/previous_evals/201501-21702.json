    "If you want an overview of what a general chemistry lab is like, then you should take it.",
    "it is an atrocity that this is a half-credit when it should be a full credit.",
    "Absolutely terrible class take only if you have to",
    "Time intensive but manageable course.",
    "If have to take it, take it. It is enjoyable in a weird way. Although the labs are long, they are worthwhile.",
    "I thought Chemistry 116 Lab was a really great class that taught me the foundations of laboratory technique and experimental procedures. The experiments were interesting and fun to do. I think I learned some useful and practical skills. I thought my lecturer and TA were both very insightful and helpful.",
    "Classic advice: Don't take it if you don't have to. It can be fun, but not that fun. It's more work than a full credit class. Pray you have a great TA. Lab reports will be the absolute bane of your existence. They take forever and are graded harshly. You come to lab. You get a pre-lab lecture. You take a quiz based on the the lab reading that week. You do the lab and take notes. You turn in the notes. You go home, write the lab report, repeat.",
    "Only if it's necessary.",
    "This course can seem like a lot as there are quizzes each week and lab reports almost every week. However, the actual lab is agreeable and the lab reports are good practice.",
    "Only take it if it's required for your major.",
    "I took this lab a few years after taking gen chem, and it was just as I expected - straight-forward and rather simple. I think having taken chem before instead of concurrently helped me a bit. The lab reports take time, but less and less as the semester goes on. As with all chem courses, take it if you need to, otherwise use your half credit somewhere more interesting."
