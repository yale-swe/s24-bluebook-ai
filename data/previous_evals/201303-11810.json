    "I shopped this class on a whim, and it became the only stable course during my shopping period. I adored this class. From day one it was the class for which I looked forward to doing my homework. I found the way Egyptians looked at their language to be fascinating - both in it's actual structure and the way they felt about it. Tasha did a wonderful job at reading what we as a class needed to spend more time on to cement the grammar. It was a great class! Just make sure you read the grammar and put time into studying it so that you have a good foundation and understanding when verbal structures come up!",
    "A great class! It's very well-taught, and hieroglyphs are quite sexy. It only meets three times a week if you count section, so it's a relatively chill L1 language option. However, the language is fairly difficult, and the homework is time-consuming and tedious at first (it gets better later in the semester though). Overall definitely recommended if you're interested in hieroglyphs and Egyptian culture -- I'm taking the class purely for fun and it's been a blast.",
    "The best way to fulfill your language requirement is hieroglyphs.",
    "If you've ever felt curious about ancient Egyptian culture and don't mind investing a bit of time and energy in that interest, you should definitely take this course! This is a chance toread authentic hieroglyphs proficiently - what more could you want, and where else could you do this? Tasha is amazing and serves as a great support system. I'd definitely recommend this course to anyone interested in pursuing a language credit off the beaten path.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. Even if you are not intending to pursue Egyptology. Hieroglyphs are really good fun to learn, they remind me a lot of a logic puzzle. However don't enter this class expecting a simple picture language. This is a serious language with grammar and syntax to learn and understand. There are vocab and grammar tests each week, and home works and reading need to be done if you want to understand. The teacher is really great, she is very approachable and understanding if you have heavy work loads in other classes. The homework is not a lot, but be prepared becauseit can take a few hours sometimes. I really enjoyed this class, and am looking forward to continuing it next semester."
