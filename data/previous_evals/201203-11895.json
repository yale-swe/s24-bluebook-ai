    "Without a doubt, take this class. If you think that this level is going to be too advanced for you, don't worry about it at all. That was my worry coming in, but Professor Lee-Smith was completely understanding and helpful, even when I wasn't the best student in the class. By the end, my proficiency rose and I am definitely more confident in my Korean skills. Take it!",
    "This is a great class. Ee seonsengnim is the best and makes the class really fun, enjoyable, and comfortable. My Korean got much better and I looked forward to this class everyday more than any other.",
    "Yes yes yes, why not? Prof. Angela Lee-Smith is amazing and you get to improve your Korean a lot.",
    "There's really nothing I could write that would summarize the amazingness and awesomeness of Korean at Yale. It is probably the best thing ever, let alone just at the university. You learn a lot through the class and practice your speaking in particular, but taking Korean at Yale is a lot more than just that. It is becoming part of the beautiful cult of i seonsaengnim, who is a god in disguise as a human. Take Korean at Yale to find out, and definitely take L5.Some info you might find helpful: Most people in this class are students who returned from Light over the summer. On the other hand I had studied Korean previously not at Yale and placed into L5, so it was a bit strange intruding on the very tightly knit group of friends who were taking the class together. However I quickly got to know them and it was great. The level of the course isn't that high despite it being L5 (you still use the third Sogang book), but most people already know a lot of what we cover formally, so discussion is very fun and helpful. The TA sessions are also great speaking practice; sign up for two or for a longer one.",
    "KREN 150 is a good continuation of Korean classes at Yale. Although it varies year to year, it seems like overall the class size is fairly small (7 students this semester). This small class size is definitely a strength, as it allows each student to receive a lot of individual attention from the professor, and each student gets a lot of time to practice his\/her speaking skills. However, the class atmosphere and rules can be a bit too lax at times, and it can often feel like it's okay to miss classes\/turn in work late. Although there are certainly repercussions for this kind of behavior, it's hard to see them because Professor Lee-Smith makes it seem like it's not a big deal, and thus it's easy to keep repeating this pattern of behavior. However, KREN 150 is still a strong language class and I would recommend it."
