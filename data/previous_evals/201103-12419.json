    "Learn to develop a new product. Yes. Learning is fun.",
    "Gut class.",
    "It's an interesting class where you get a chance to actually design and create your own product. I definitely recommend it.",
    "Yes! take it; it's a great 4th or 5th class, low time commitment, but enjoyable and useful, I think.",
    "This course is disorganized. Do not take this course if you want to learn something serious about the design process.",
    "yes i would. great real-world functional class that teaches business skills.",
    "This course is a joke---something that you will be able to discern very quickly by the number of football players taking this course. If you need the So requirement, or another credit, and don't want to do any work then by all means take this course. If you have some respect for your education and actually want to learn something, then don't. (On a side note if you do want to take this course, be sure to preregister)."
