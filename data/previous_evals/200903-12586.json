   "comments": [
    "This is definitely an introduction to political economy. You've probably seen a lot of the material covered in the first half of the course, but the second half of the course does begin to cover more specific material. The readings aren't overwhelming at all, and there are discussions sheets that help focus readings that go further in depth than you're expected to know. There is a fair amount of mathematical content in the course, so be prepared to compute things.",
    "Yes. Great survey of political economy. Relevant to many classes at Yale. Has a wide range of applications to various courses including intermediate macro and micro. So it is one of the better survey and introduction courses at Yale because it builds a more useful foundation for continued studies in economics and political science courses. Also by reading every author under the sun it is a very important for students generally uneducated in economics matters to introduce themselves to the theory at least of economic forces. There is not so much math so it is very friendly to non-math\/econ majors. Pretty informative class and a great resource for future studies.",
    "To anyone with a serious interest in macroeconomics and the time to take a course or two in it, I would not recommend this course. If one has only a fleeting interest and wants kind of a broad, disconnected overview, then this might be appropriate. As for political science majors, I think they would probably be better served by taking an economics class or two. Economists should probably avoid this class.",
    "I would not recommend unless you already have an economics background. If you do, it's a very fun and engaging course."
