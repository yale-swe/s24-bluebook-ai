   "comments": [
    "I think that the labs could be much more useful. If the goal is to learn to interpret the data, we did not accomplish that in lab. Our TF would quickly race through the slides at the beginning of lab and then treat the rest of the time as office hours. Most people did not even go to the lab sessions.",
    "okay",
    "Professor Zelterman reminded me of my glaringly incompetent high school teachers. He was impossible to follow and spent to much time rambling about random things like his shoe size. I expect more from a graduate school. Also, this course is entitled Biostatistics, but there was very little tie-in to biology or public health.",
    "I really enjoyed the lab\/lecture format. I also enjoyed being given the SAS code and focusing more on the interpretation.",
    "Great course. I appreciated the professor being on time ALWAYS (even though it was an early morning course).",
    "The course was ok. It didn't keep my attention much. But I liked how he tried to make the content relevant to the real world.",
    "strengths: textbook is clear, objective is clearweakness: I feel the lecture is not useful. I prefer to read the book instead. Also, the class is too slow paced. He can definitely fit in more topics and it would be more worth it to learn more topics.",
    "There needs to be more examples. The midterm had a question about SAS what was never shown in class.",
    "I really enjoyed this course. Dr. Zelterman did a wonderful job explaining the material and providing useful examples to reinforce important concepts.",
    "I liked how Professor Zelterman explained biostatistics in logical and theoretical terms instead of relying solely on complicated math. The second half of the semester included topics that were not included in the first biostatistics course, but some of the material covered in the first half overlapped. I wonder if the two semesters could be combined into one for those who are not going to use biostatistics on a daily basis but do want to understand its basics.",
    "This is a very low-pressure class, and I like Dr. Zelterman's approach to teaching. However, post-midterm I don't really feel like I learned much. What we need to know wasn't very clear. The labs were useful for reiterating material. The discussions of the news in the beginning of class were interesting but not always very relevant to course material.",
    "This course is really great, and a refreshing format compared to more traditionally-taught courses. Zelterman is hilarious, and goal-oriented: he teaches to the skills you will actually need to apply, covering the theoretical background but only to the extent that is necessary for practical use. The workload is minimal, but you will get more out of the class if you devote some time to it.",
    "The lectures were clear. The grading of the tests was less than clear and the wording was confusing and difficult to understand what was being asked.",
    "strengths: the book is great - very readable and understandableweaknesses: the lectures are sort of like a script of the book, which is useful sometimes, and difficult at others. At times you need something to be explained in a different way.",
    "I felt like get lost in the mid of the course. But after final, the structure becomes clear in mind. At the same time, my epi2 and data management class also shed light on my studying in this course.",
    "This class is a complete waste of time- I don't feel that I learned a semester's worth of material in this course. While I attended every lecture, most students chose not to attend. There were approximately 20 students in the lecture at most on a given day.The only part of this course that was worthwhile is the labs.",
    "The lecture was exactly like the book. It would be helpful to have additional information, or alternate ways of explaining things in class. While it was helpful to have a broad theoretical idea of things, I don't necessarily feel like I could perform any of the tests I learned about.",
    "I feel that Dr. Zelterman did the best that he could. It is very hard to teach a \"statistical thinking\" class where one has to actually know why and how to use certain statistical methods. A lot of us were initially struggling with this course because biostats last semester was a mere, mindless \"plug and chug\" into the equation type of class. I felt that because I put effort into this course, I learned so much from it. I know the meaning and purpose of jack-knife diagnostics. I know when and how to use logistic regression versus linear regression. Regardless of my grade in this course, my knowledge has expanded, and I owe it all to Dr. Zelterman.",
    "class is a little slow in pace, it would be better if it was ahead of the material covered by labs.",
    "Strengths: It was nice to get the non-mathematical statistics perspective, and to understand what things mean and why you might do them. It has been beneficial to understand how people misuse statistics in the news.Weaknesses: Considering this is a core course critical to all of our professions, it should be a more rigorous course where you gain a stronger skill set. I am disappointed that this course has not given me many of time skills I need to work in epidemiology.Overall, I was really disappointed that this course is not a more solid foundation. If it is going to be taught as a statistics course without theory or math, that's fine. But then there should be more emphasis on SAS (a skill), and the execution should be smoother. I just wanted more out of my core statistics training.",
    "Lectures followed the sequence of the textbook. The instructor was very willing to answer students questions.Lectures often went on tangents. Lab presentations provided more concrete information. Exams were simple and not challenging.",
    "I believe that it is a strength that this statistics course is not mathematics-based, but instead attempts, and succeeds, in introducing students to statistical situations that we will encounter as public health professionals. At the beginning of this course, I could not name when and why to use a specific statistical method for data analysis. At the end of this course, I could do so with ease.",
    "Strength: Useful",
    "I thought the course was ok.",
    "I found the course vague and did not like the way the lecture material was presented. Powerpoints would have been beneficial. I disliked the examinations. Although open book, the questions again were vague. I do not feel that this course greatly enhanced my statistical knowledge. I thought the lab sessions were good and the TA was excellent.",
    "strengths: taught a variety of analyses and when to use themweaknesses: was taught in way too theoretical of a manner to really understand what you are learning. I felt like class was a complete waste of time, and despite going every day I really don't think I gained more from it than the students who did not attend. I was very disappointed at the quality of this course as compared to Biostat 1. The exams were not representative of what we had learned, and were often vague or completely unclear as to what was being asked.",
    "weakness--i feel like i still dont really know much about statistics...despite having completed an entire year's worth of classes in it...",
    "The textbook and labs were really beneficial.",
    "great",
    "- Great overview of statistical methods- Labs are a good way to practice a scientific method of writing. Liked them.- Did not like the final evaluation. I didn't find it to be fair, because there are multiple ways that you can analyze a problem. I found that my grade in the final exam did not reflect how much I actually knew, which is frustrating",
    "I have no strong feelings either way about this course. It's required, we all have to take it, not too painful to just get it over with.",
    "I thought it did not teach me biostatistics and was not very useful. I learned more from my epi classes",
    "Strengths- Application of biostatistics to currents events and so helps students understand and remember better.Weakness- I feel more information needs to be given in class. I feel information that I gained and concepts that I learnt in biostats from this class were not adequate.",
    "I really didn't get a lot out of labs the way they were formatted. The lab component of this course could basically be done away with or should be structured differently.",
    "I appreciated this course for focusing on the big picture understanding - for those of us not destined to actually do biostatistics day to day, I think this is the right emphasis. We need to know what tools are out there and what do they do, rather gain an in-depth knowledge of the math that underlies the tools as most of us won't actually be involved using the mathematics.I did feel that we could have done a little homework on going with the kinds of problems that were on the tests. Just 3-4 questions each week like are on the tests and maybe go over them quickly in the lab with the discussion of the lab (there is time to do this). Maybe we just get credit for trying them and turning our work in (not on whether right\/wrong) - but having the regular practice on similar questions would have helped and generated questions and helped with the understanding.",
    "I really liked the idea of this class, as it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s important to understand how to use statistical analyses in public health research. However, this class was poorly executed.Examples that were used in lecture& lab were very rarely related to public health. I find it really unhelpful that we were doing labs on beanie babies, cloth run-up, and lottery winners (among many other irrelevant subjects) in a BIOSTATISTICS class at the school of PUBLIC HEALTH. It would have been much easier to understand how to use specific statistical analyses if we had been working with relevant data.The worst parts about this class were the exams. Exams did not fairly assess the content that we learned in class and lab. Lab emphasized interpretations, while the exams assessed how well we could interpret 4 vague, poorly worded questions written by Zelterman. Grading was arbitrary and explanations were not given as to why points were taken off.I am incredibly disappointed that I spent like $3440 on this class, and feel that Yale should be embarrassed that this is actually a class offered through YSPH. This class is of poor quality and would likely benefit from a both a re-structuring and a different instructor.",
    "Would be nice to practice with questions relating to when to use which study design in which setting or discuss this more in class.",
    "I feel there is a gap between the materials presented in the lectures and the final exam. The lectures were really easy to understand, but I felt it was not really applicable to the final. Although I understood the lecture materials and did all the past finals, I still felt somewhat unprepared for the exam.",
    "good",
    "Strengths: Course alignment with book was helpful. Liked that previous midterm and finals tests were posted.Weaknesses: Would have preferred more theory and formulas similar to Biostats505a. Grading of midterm and final questions could have been more explicit and not left so much to interpretation.",
    "Lecture is no more helpful than the textbook, so it was hard to remain focused in lecture on the days when I have already read the assigned chapters.",
    "I like the approach of the course to really make us think about the statistical methods for various research questions, but there needs to be a greater emphasis on public-health related research questions. I learned a lot during our lab sessions, but found both the midterm and final exams to be written in a confusing manner and not largely reflective of what we have learned.",
    "One strength is that the course did not focus on SAS but the actual theory behind modeling. It is easy to get lost in the SAS and I appreciated that the course did not focus on this. This gave the opportunity for the labs to focus on interpreting SAS and consequently understanding the modeling but unfortunately this did not translate as smoothly as it could have.",
    "the course lectures need more structure",
    "Very mixed messaging about being able to do true statistics (instead of just knowing a vague framework and having warm fuzzy feelings about the subject) and learning SAS.",
    "a lot of overlap with the Biostat 1 in the fall semester",
    "Good course - provided an excellent overview of the diversity of statistical methods that may be employed in the field.Loved the format of course being taught from the ALM book.Enjoyed the practical application of course topics to newspaper clippings.Would recommend not to just let the Midterms and Finals be accessible to everyone on that table outside of the Dr. Zelterman's office, where anyone who may be interested in reading them is able to do so. People who like privacy surrounding grades find this degree of exposure to be invasive.Labs took a very long time to complete, though SAS code was helpful.",
    "I exempted out of this course.",
    "The structure of the course is predictable- I knew exactly what was being asked of me on the exam, and what was needed for the lab. The instructor gave us a chance at the beginning of the year to get our feet wet, and that was appreciated.",
    "I like the fact that the professor made this course easy to understand and the weekly lab exercise is very helpful for me to learn the content.Areas to improve maybe move the lecture time from 8:30am to a little bit later, since it can be challenging for students living off-campus to attend during bad weather.",
    "class moves slow and material could be presented in a more succinct fashion",
    "I exempted out of this course.",
    "This was a great course. It would be great if we had more homework assignments so we could better understand the concepts being taught in class.",
    "The lectures are no difference at all from reading the instructor's textbook, which is not very helpful as well in understanding the concepts supposed to be covered in this course.",
    "The class was too abstract and the professor explained everything in an impractical way. The tests were also NOT indicative of my knowledge in biostatistics.",
    "Strengths- really helps with the analytical sideWeaknesses- not matched well with methods",
    "Strengths: The labs provided a really good review of important concepts discussed during the lectures and also provided an opportunity to test my understanding of the material on an ongoing basis, which I really appreciated. I really liked the format of the final exam. Rather than focusing on unimportant details, it provided a chance for students to really test their overall understanding of the material learned throughout the semester by having to determine which statistical method suited hypothetical situations best. Weaknesses\/Possible Improvements: I felt like the course dragged a little bit. Too much time was spent on some topics. Perhaps if there were more coordination between this course and courses such as Principles of Epidemiology II, which covers similar concepts, parts of this course could be shortened. However, I believe that the repetition of concepts to really drive home the main points was also a strength of the class, so the courseshould not be \"sped up\" at the expense of this important repetition.",
    "This class was a bit ridiculous. I think I mainly just learned the different kinds of analysis: Survival, Poisson, Logistic. I also learned these in Epi and Data Management. My learning was very basic. I didn't find going to class very helpful either.The final exam was super ridiculous. The answer to one of the questions was something we didn't even cover in class. Also, I don't think going to class and reading the book would help one really do well on the test. It was an absurd test that was looking for one specific way to solve a problem that is really solvable in multiple ways. I was very frustrated by it and expected more from a Yale statistics class.",
    "The main structure is extremely knowledgeable and students can learn a lot from him. The main issue is that many people do not take this class seriously because of how easy it is to pass by just doing the minimum amount of work for it. Sadly, the material and the textbook is very conducive to learning but the way in which it is presented to the students is not. For instance, the midterms and finals were not directly correlated to the essential subjects that needed to be covered. The instructor follows the book page by page which gives a lot of students the impression that they do not need to go to class if they have the book.Greater coordination between this course and Mayur Desai's Methods course is badly needed since both teach similar concepts around the same time. The main difference is that students are truly challenged intellectually in one while they are allowed to slack off in Dr. Seltzerman's class.",
    "Strengths--although doing a weekly write-up was highly repetitive and tiresome, I think it is the best way to get students more familiarized with writing a research document. It was also a more practical approach to the different statistical methods.Weaknesses--the class could get somewhat repetitive (same jokes for one thing) and difficult to get through. The \"in the news\" portion did not seem to have anything to do with the topic for the day. Also, we were never taught how to criticize a graph and yet a big chunk of the test was devoted to this.Room for improvement--The textbook was helpful, but it provided the same information than the lecture precisely because our professor wrote the book. Having an additional book or other suggested readings that explain the material differently might allow people to get a clearer picture of the material. Provide more feedback on the tests. We only knew what aspects we got wrong, but not why and the answer key did not explain this thoroughly.",
    "I felt I did not gain much from going to class and overall from the course. Although the instructor seems like a kind and caring professor I was very disappointed with the course. I think biostatistics is a fundamental part of public health. The problem for me was not the subject itself but how it was delivered.",
    "I understand trying to make biostatistics approachable and non-threatening, but I don't feel this course was successful. I liked the book, but would have appreciated additional examples in class that were different from those in the book. Often did not understand the \"stats in the news\" at the beginning of class. Found lecture to be very similar to the book. Labs were not that helpful in mastering the material. Would appreciate more guidance on actual interpretation of output, etc. Tests did not seem representative of the course material. Grading seemed pretty subjective and was not helpful in understanding mistakes.",
    "Disappointing. I had high expectations for this class, given my great experience with Biostats I (505a). But, I can honestly say I walked away from this class a little confused and not knowing that much more than what I learned in first semester biostatistics.Professor Zelterman spends at least a month reviewing linear regression, which we covered in 505a, Epidemiology, and Applied Analytic Methods (aka Data Management). So now I feel like I know the topic backwards and forwards. Given how much the professor dwelled on this topic, I expected him to do the same when it came to non-parametric, Logistic, and Poisson regression. But he didn't. And I had to do quite a bit of outside reading to try to begin to understand what he was talking about. This might be a bit harsh, but I think Wikipedia gives a better overview of when to use these statistical approaches than he did.What is even more frustrating is that the material taught in class does not really prepare you for the exams. They are both open-note\/open-book... but your notes don't really help at all. And the book says exactly what your notes say because the Professor wrote the book and he basically recites it foryou in class. Your best study resource is the previous exams that he posts on ClassesV2.Because of the way the course is structured, there is no incentive to go to class. People who go to class do just as well as people who do not go to class. There was probably about 10-15 of us in Winslow auditorium by the end of the semester.",
    "I did not attend the course because I did not gain anything from going. The lectures should be about 20 minutes. The rest of the time, the instructor was going off on tangents. The textbook was quite useful.",
    "Not very quantitative.",
    "I thought the final was great in that it was big-picture oriented (what test would you use given this data?), but I felt a little unprepared for it.It would be great if we were trained along the way to think like that. For example, the midterm or homework assignments could have questions asking which statistical tests to use. Or, the first half of the class could be spent going through the stats tests quicker, the the second half learning to apply them to different situations.I enjoyed the real life examples and news articles, but couldn't always figure out how they tied into lecture. Perhaps more direct ties could be drawn."

    "Instructor: Daniel Zelterman \u00a0he could lecture faster or plan the course a little better to coordinate learning.",
    "Instructor: Daniel Zelterman \u00a0He kept lecture engaging! But, everything that we learned could have fit in a couple of weeks, instead of being drug out over the entire semester. Each class was 30 min of a news article (too long!), 30 min or more of repetition of the previous class (WAY too long), and then a couple of minutes of new material. I also felt like he was not always receptive to student questions, particularly if they interfered with his lecture flow.His test questions are VERY unclear -- the previous test answer keys often had 1-3 word answers for some of the questions, and then he expected paragraphs to receive full credit on our questions. MANY times I was VERY frustrated by the grading or the style of the questions, simply because I just didn't understand what he was asking or what was expected of us. Honestly, I really believe that style of test is not teaching me statistics -- it is an exercise in reading the textbook and flipping through old tests, but not a measure of my understanding of statistics.",

    "Instructor: Daniel Zelterman \u00a0Zelterman is an extremely weak professor. His lectures are not clear and at the same time, excruciatingly slow-moving.",
    "Instructor: Daniel Zelterman \u00a0Dr Zelterman is a very pleasant man. I would have liked to have had the material explained in a more direct manner with distinct learning points.",
    "Instructor: Daniel Zelterman \u00a0He was a very nice and compassionate man, but I did not respond well to his method of teaching or attitude towards the class. He talked in circles around his main points, and you were never quite sure what you were supposed to be retaining. His words spoken in class and the words in the textbook were nearly identical- so what is the point of attending class when you can read the exact same thing on your own? I felt that when people asked questions he got very flustered and would talk about ten other things that were what he wanted to say but did not answer the question directly.",
    "Instructor: Daniel Zelterman \u00a0arbitrary grading scheme. are we really supposed to read his mind about those graphs???",
    "Instructor: Daniel Zelterman \u00a0Dr. Zelterman is a very nice man and brought humor into the classroom which was appreciated considering the early time of the class. However, the lectures were very vague, particularly after the midterm. Most of my learning was from his textbook (which is great) as well as the labs. It would be helpful if he could prepare powerpoint slides with the information in a structured easy to follow way.",
    "Instructor: Daniel Zelterman \u00a0great instructor",
    "Instructor: Daniel Zelterman \u00a0- He can be rude at times. Needs flexibility in being able to roll with student questions and answer them as they arise.- Clearly passionate about the material and students' learning.- Repetitive in the way he explains things. So it moves a little slow.",
    "Instructor: Daniel Zelterman \u00a0I didn't always learn in class, but I was often amused.",
    "Instructor: Daniel Zelterman \u00a0Could not understand him",
    "Instructor: Daniel Zelterman \u00a0Instructor puts in lot of time and effort in making this course interesting.Weakness-Spends too much time on same concepts",
    "Instructor: Daniel Zelterman \u00a0The first question on every the midterm and final exam is completely unfair. To ask students to interpret a graph or chart for a news article and then DEDUCT points if they don't come up with the same subjective conclusions as you do is completely UNREASONABLE.Either give everyone ten points for making a logical conclusion about the chart or do away with these questions. There is no way to study for them.WE ARE NOT MIND READER'S!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Very frustrating.",
    "Instructor: Daniel Zelterman \u00a0I appreciated Dr. Zelterman's ability to explain complicated biostatistics in a way that facilitated understanding of the big picture - what each tool is used for and it's strengths and weaknesses. I think this is the right emphasis in this course for most of the MPH students.",
    "Instructor: Daniel Zelterman \u00a0Dr. Zelterman is the worst professor that I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve had at YSPH. His lectures were difficult to understand, and extremely repetitive. It was not necessary to go to lecture, as they were word-for-word from his textbook. He was sometimes very rude to students in class when one of us asked a question that he thought was not intelligent. Due to this, I did not feel comfortable approaching him after class to ask questions.Additionally, during \"review\" classes for the midterm and final, he took ~20 minutes to answer a single question, as he would go off on a tangent without directly addressing the question. As a result, these classes were not useful in reviewing any of the course material prior to the exams that would determine 2\/3rds of our grade.",
    "Instructor: Daniel Zelterman \u00a0The professor was very good at explaining course materials in a way that was easy to understand. I enjoyed his lectures.",
    "Instructor: Daniel Zelterman \u00a0Very helpful and considerate of students",
    "Instructor: Daniel Zelterman \u00a0interesting",
    "Instructor: Daniel Zelterman \u00a0Instructor was obviously very knowledgable, friendly and approached course differently that previous statistical course. Enjoyed link between applied and theoretical statistics, but could have benefitted from more discussion of theoretical statistics as derived from formulas. Would also have liked it lectures and book chapters were similar but not exactly the same so we could have two sources of info.",
    "Instructor: Daniel Zelterman \u00a0Beast mode",
    "Instructor: Daniel Zelterman \u00a0I liked Professor Zelterman's enthusiasm in class as well as his emphasis on really understanding the concepts behind statistics. However, he often repeated himself during lectures which I found frustrating. He was also unresponsive to email.",
    "Instructor: Daniel Zelterman \u00a0Dr. Zelterman's enthusiasm is very much appreciated and it was clear that he enjoys teaching the class which is very important for such a large, early morning class. While the lectures were somewhat organized there was a general lack of organization overall. One lecture topic seemed discordant from the next and by the end of the course Dr. Zelterman did not tie the topics back together. The lectures could benefit greatly from one or two lectures at the end that focus on how each of the lectures fights into a 'big' picture. Also, the lectures could be more engaging with more student participation.",
    "Instructor: Daniel Zelterman \u00a0He isn't very clear and concise in his lectures - he could be a lot clearer when answering questions.",
    "Instructor: Daniel Zelterman \u00a0Amazing. Clear and engaging.",
    "Instructor: Daniel Zelterman \u00a0Average",
    "Instructor: Daniel Zelterman \u00a0Excellent - should win an award for his inspired teaching method.Exams were challenging, but fair.",

    "Instructor: Daniel Zelterman \u00a0the instructor was not very good at explaining the concepts and methods that were supposed to be taught in this course. As a result, this course was not as enriching as other courses.",
    "Instructor: Daniel Zelterman \u00a0Instructor was too abstract and into \"story telling\". As a quantitative course, I wished he would be more concrete with his explanation of concepts. I felt like I learned nothing in this course and do not feel like this semester was well-spent in his classroom.",
    "Instructor: Daniel Zelterman \u00a0Strengths: Dr. Zelterman presented the material in a very logical order. I also liked that he often \"previewed\" material that was going to be discussed in future lectures to give students a clear picture of \"where we were and where we were going\" in the course. He also did his best to answer all questions in a way that made sense to the students. I also liked that he made use of repetition of key concepts to drive home the main points. This served as a constant review of the course material! Great! Weaknesses: My only comment is that perhaps Dr. Zelterman might be able to work in more public health examples, rather than relying mostly on the examples from the book, which are good but limited.",
    "Instructor: Daniel Zelterman \u00a0Like I stated above, the final exam was not an accurate reflection of what we learned from the class. I don't think it was fair at all to except us to decipher what he wanted from there. I will never have to do something like that.",
    "Instructor: Daniel Zelterman \u00a0Very nice engaging man who means well for his students. However, the way in which the course is conducted allows students to not take the course seriously and defeat the learning objectives.",
    "Instructor: Daniel Zelterman \u00a0He cares about his students and is an overall nice guy. However, his lectures could be more neatly organized. Perhaps indicating an outline with the lecture's main points for the day would be helpful.",
    "Instructor: Daniel Zelterman \u00a0Understanding him is difficult, class is slow and the hour does not help. I feel like I did not learn from going to class.",
    "Instructor: Daniel Zelterman \u00a0I don't understand his teaching philosophy.FIrst, I find it very frustrating that he didn't require people us to do any math all semester--it's a statistics class for God's sake! I think he thinks all of us are math-phobic, which I find a little insulting.Second, he just goes into long-winded explanations about how SAS calculates things for us...and we're never ever held responsible for any of it. Cant' he just tell us what is really important instead?Third, I think he would be much better if he restructured the course a bit. Maybe spend less time beating us over the head with linear regression and take the time to expand on logistic and Poisson regression a bit more so we're not left confused?Finally, his \"in the news\" business. Half the time the newspaper articles he discusses at the beginning of class are not even statistics-related. Why bother? ....and why make us responsible for interpreting newspaper clippings but not for anything else that you say in lecture?",
    "Instructor: Daniel Zelterman \u00a0He seems like a nice guy. However, the few times I did attend lecture, I found that he did not utilize the course time effectively. I would rather be instructed for the full 80 minutes than hear stories.",
    "Instructor: Daniel Zelterman \u00a0Strengths: Dr. Zelterman is engaging and uses real-life examples. His text is great (an excellent reference) and very well written!Weaknesses: Asking questions in the course can be somewhat intimidating, as some of his responses seemed a little abrasive."

She was very difficult to get in touch with.",

Was not understanding the question, was just spoon fed answers.She was very difficult to understand not because of the language barrier but just because she is not good at describing statistical concepts in a way that will make you learn.",
    "Instructor: Zhixuan Fu \u00a0Evie was a terrible TA. She literally read off of the slides, word-for-word, and did not answer questions in a clear or easy to understand manner. It was unclear as to what she expected us to include in our lab write-ups. I very rarely received any sort of constructive feedback on my reports. I ultimately had to attend other TA's lab sessions in order to understand how to interpret the data from lab.",
    "Instructor: Zhixuan Fu \u00a0Because I was in the first lab of the week, a lot of the materials were not yet covered in class. I really wish the TA can provide more explanations and be more patient with the students. Sometimes, I feel she has a hard time answer the questions that we are asking, and she often leaves very early despite some of us may still be struggling with the lab materials.",

I even overheard her talking to someone else about how pointless office hours were and how she hated going to them. I once tried to go to her office hours but found the office empty. She makes no efforts to clarify concepts to her students, even when they are visibly confused. During short labs, she leaves right away even before the hourends.",

    "I really enjoyed this course. I felt the instructor and TA did a wonderful job presenting the material and reinforcing important concepts. I feel that I have learned a great deal from this course, all of which is crucial to my future work in the field of public health.",
    "This course reviews many of the concepts learned in biostat 1 and then introduces a few new concepts. It is taught at a slow pace, and without much math so that non-math students can understand it.",
    "Just as the name of the course implies, it's an introduction to statistical thinking!",
    "I would not recommend it because I really don't feel like I learned much. I have a hard time articulating what I learned, and I was just not able to get into the subject. I found the first semester of biostats more useful.",
    "I think it is a useful course. Definitely learned how to evaluate when to use certain stat tests.",
    "I realized I benefit from it after I finished.",
    "Only take this if it is required.",
    "This class takes a lot of work. I have been advised from second years that I do not need to attend this class because his lectures are straight from the book. However, I think this is a biased opinion. It really depends on how one learns. I went to every class, and I really enjoyed hearing and seeing the material. He also does his \"news\" segment before every class that really demonstrates the statistical thinking that should occur each time we encounter a graph, picture, or anything statistically related.",
    "it is good, may overlap with some other classes, and labs can be confusing because they are not covered in lecture first and the code is written so you won't get as much help on interpreting it for the TAs because they don't really know as much about it.",
    "It's sort of layman's statistics (not much math). It's not too much work, but I also don't think you get as much out of it as you could. It is good for learning the different types of models and when to use them. I do hope the course will improve in the future as it is a required core course and should be part of the foundation for our degree.",

    "This course provides an overview of the main biostatistics methods used for much research done in public health. It teaches how to evaluate what kind of data is being used and how to choose which biostatistics method is appropriate for that kind of data and what are the strengths and weaknesses of the method chosen. This course does not provide an in-depth understanding of the mathematics behind the biostatistics methods.",
    "Unfortunately, this is a required class for most 1st years. If you do not have to take it, I would advise not taking it or looking for a stats class in the graduate school. This was a waste of time and money, and Epi II and AAMIE taught me more statistics than this course.",
    "yes",
    "Very general coverage of second semester statistical concepts. Taught straight from the book. Found lectures from Applied Analytic Methods more useful for certain subject material.",

    "The course integrated well with my other coursework at YSPH, but overall I found this class to be less inspiring than I had anticipated. I would suggest improvements related to the exams as well as an increased emphasis on public health-related statistics.",
    "The course itself is very important and I was very eager to learn it but by the end I do not feel that I have a clear understanding of the material. I am not sure if I would recommend it; especially given that while the labs could have been more productive instead they were vague and did not add significantly to the lectures.",

    "This class is a continuation of BIOS 505a in the fall. It teaches you how to apply concepts in biostatistics to solve real-world problems using SAS.",
    "I exempted out of this course.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to another student",
    "no",
    "No, but since it's mandatory for all MPH students, I will tell them good luck and be prepared for a lot of frustration.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student. This course provides a good overview of commonly used statistical methods, such as logistic regression, Poisson regression, and survival analysis, and it presents the application of SAS in carrying out statistical analyses, helping to further develop one's SAS skills. However, I believe this course is most effective when taken in conjunction with Principles of Epidemiology II and Applied Analytic Methods in Epidemiology, as these three courses all essentially cover the same statistical methods and taking all three at the same time allows for a VERY thorough understanding of the concepts. Also, if a concept is difficult to grasp in one course, it is possible that the presentation of that concept is more clear in one of the other courses (i.e. different teaching styles, different examples, etc.).",
    "Only take it if there is no possible way you can get out of it and need it for a requirement. Do not take it just to learn stats. You won't learn anything and will just get frustrated by the tedious labs and tests.",
    "You have to take it so make the best of it. If you take the labs and write-ups seriously, you could very well learning something from this class.",
    "I would not recommend the course (if it was optional). I felt like it was not helpful and that what I believe I should have learned in this class Imanaged to understand due to other classes.",
    "I would not recommend it. But it is a required course, so you don't really have a choice. Still, if you could for some reason exempt it, DO IT.",
    "I would not recommend attending the course. It was quite a waste of time. I did however, learn a lot about statistical tests by reading the book and completing the lab assignments. They were very useful. It would have been nice to go over the lab interpretations in class or lab. That would have been very helpful in understanding the statistical tests.",
    "I would not recommend it. The instruction was vague and I got very little out of the course.",
