    "And excellent class, but be ready for lots of theory. It really isn't a \"let's talk about fossils\" class, so expect coverage of a great deal of evolutionary theory... But it is wonderful.",
    "Paleontology& Evolutionary Theory could be a great course -- the subject matter is inherently interesting and still not totally worked out. As far as I've understood the topic from other classes, there's still a lot of controversy in the field and questions to be resolved. This class could have been a great exploration of what is known, what isn't known, and what is disagreed upon. And to be fair, Prof. Vrba had a lot of information on African mammals and how they related to her favorite theories.I ended up being wary, though, of any information she gave outside of antelopes, wildebeests, etc.. It wasn't that the professor seemed actively interested in leading us on or straw-manning every theory except her favorite, it just seemed like she'd already chosen her \"correct\" ideas a really long time ago. In giving us a lite version of the arguments, she ended up leaving (at least) me wondering if that's really all there was to the story. Maybe this is just a problem with trying to fit all of this material into a semester, or maybe it's just too big a topic for any one person to get the entire story across without a strong bias, but I'm not sure that this course was my favorite way to learn the material in it.On the plus side, it's not a difficult course. Two tests, all based on facts given in handouts, and the TAs are very helpful and friendly. Plus, as a first introduction to the topic, it's a good place to start and Prof. Vrba is a big name in the field with a lot of experience. And if nothing else, itgave me a lot to think about in the future.",
    "This class is definitely a serious science credit - it assumes interest and dedication to the material, and makes no apologies about tackling complexities and conceptual nuances. As mentioned above, it's far more about evolutionary theory than paleontology, but if delving past Darwinian simplicity sounds intriguing to you, this is the course to try."
