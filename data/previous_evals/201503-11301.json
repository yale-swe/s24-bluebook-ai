    "I would recommend it for someone with in depth knowledge of one genocide and is looking for frames of comparison or to put it in a wider context.",
    "I would definitely recommend the course. I would describe it as a healthy mix of seminar discussions and guest lectures that covers a lot of ground but also allows students to go in depth into topics they are interested in. It is also great that the topic of the final paper is very flexible and can be tailored to one's interests.",
    "Take it if you have any interest in the subject or study something that intersects with political violence. It's a good mix of history and theory."

    "I really enjoyed the emphasis on identifying the patterns behind genocides and war crimes, and the links between current and past events. It is helpful as a professional to better understand root causes behind conflicts and to be focused on prevention.",
    "This course introduced me to a lot of comparative material and theoretical concepts I can use going forward with my research."
