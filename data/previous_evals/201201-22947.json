   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend English 121 04 to anyone who enjoys writing as well as art. If you are not interested in art, this class may not be for you. However if you are interested in art, I could not have imagined a better English class than this one. I can truly say I learned a ton and came out a much better writer with a much larger knowledge of the art world (having not even taken art history before).",
    "Definitely take this class! I loved it and would recommend it for anyone interested in English and art. A proficiency in art history is by no means required, although it does help. I loved the writing style of this class and the fun activities we did.",
    "You read and analyze art reviews from a variety of sources, watch documentaries on featured figure painters, and write 6 papers with a different focus (exhibit review, comparison between two paintings, artist in focus, acquisition proposal, narrative, etc). You submit writing each week, alternating between first and second drafts. Everyday you respond to a slide show of applicable contemporary figure paintings. You also think about the relationship between the naked and the nude.",
    "I recommend it if you are interested in art and want to learn more about it\/ how to write about art. It may be very boring to someone with no interest in the subject-- it's a great class anyway though!",
    "Course involves reading a short newspaper article ever class and write a short paper every 2 weeks. Amazing class to sharpen your writting and explore the art world."
