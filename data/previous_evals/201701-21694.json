    "This was one of the best classes I've taken at Yale, and I honestly think that it should be made a requirement in the WGSS department. It in many ways picks up where Bodies and Pleasures and Feminist and Queer Theory courses leave off, and traces the turns that queer theory and studies has taken in the last 15 years. I loved the reading for this course, and it really has influenced the way I think and my own research interests."

    "LOVED the syllabus for the most part! I feel like at Yale, writers like Sedgwick or Bersani gets seriously overlooked, because they're too \"theoretical\" or whatever, or because they write about gay men, instead of the most marginalized subject position every, but that's me being a little salty. I also feel like we went on tangents a lot, which were fun! And productive in some ways! But still tangents?",
    "I thought this course was wonderful. The reading list was incredible, the examples that Joey brought were always engaging and great. The only thing I would push for is more writing by trans writer, as this was a queer and trans performance class, and I felt that it was a lot more \"queer\" than trans.",
    "The reading list was wonderfully selected, with breadth in inquiry and depth in approach. However, I felt that some conversations could have been a bit more substantive and gone farther."

    "Absolutely, especially if they are at all interested in lgbt and queer studies.",
    "note: your mileage may vary this class is terrific. like, I had so many (personal) issues going in, but now I'm like: affect norms! trauma archives! rage! alternate temporalities! the syllabus is like therapy in theory form. It's just a wonderful feeling to have your innermost self be recognized and affirmed and articulated. the intersections with performance studies and affect theory really aligned with my own personal interests as well. I love how interdisciplinary this class is while still providing a solid foundation in queer theory.",
    "Queer theory seminar with room to breathe. Discussions are loosely structured mostly student-led and assignments are amenable to different means of engagement. At times this pedagogical approach meant that our conversations weren't as philosophically dense as they could have been (cough cough Butler), but for the most part I found that AMST 381 offered refreshing and productive degrees of freedom. Take it if you like queer theory and coming to your own conclusions!"
