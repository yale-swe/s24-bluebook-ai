    "The course takes students through roughly 12 plays. They are analyzed from an English and Theater Studies perspective. Discussion responses are used to help students prepare their arguments prior to class. The professor asked for quite a bit of feedback every third of the course. This was a helpful technique.",
    "Great class. We got to read a lot of great drama, and having the focus of the class be on a genre like the drama of reconciliation was unique and really fun--it helped focus our discussion and expanded the ways in which I approached the reading. Professor Hagens is wonderful, super smart, and led discussion really well--we struck a perfect balance between student discussion and Professor Hagens talking about the texts. The structure of the workload (a play a week, a two-page graded reading response every week) was fantastic, and manageable."
