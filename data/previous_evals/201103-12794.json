    "I would definitely recommend it! It's fascinating material that will change how you think of the course of human history and its relationship with infectious diseases.",
    "YES YES YES! This has been my favorite class so far at Yale. Lectures are amazingly engaging and interesting. Snowden is such a smart guy, and he really outlines each disease carefully, making sure we get a well rounded view of the biology of the disease as well as the social, political, and public health impacts. We have to read about a book a week and write one reading response a week. This can sometimes be a lot of work in the weeks where you have other exams etc, but for the most part it is really manageable and fair. He is also super flexible and wants what is best for the students, so if something seems unfair, he will quickly rectify the problem. Professor Snowden is incredible. He really cares about the students, and he really wants to get to know each and every student. He holds weekly optional breakfasts where he just wants to get to know you, without the pressure of a classroom. I can't say enough about how great this class is. I wish I could take it again!",
    "This class is way more interesting and applicable than you might think. Professor Snowden does a great job of showing how epidemics shape society, and why they matter in larger historical context. We learned a lot about a lot: Italian political history, the development of modern medicine, changing religious culture, precursors to modern public health, etc. There's a lot of reading, but Snowden keeps you on track with relatively easy but helpful writing assignments each week. I would definitely recommend to anyone in the social sciences or humanities.",
    "An excellent course, well-worth taking for the professor alone. Engaging lectures, interesting assignments and fairly easy all around.",
    "A survey course of the entire history of epidemics around the world since 1600. You really want to know this stuff. A must take.",
    "Yes, it is a wonderful course! Professor Snowden is amazing. The material is really interesting, and I loved that I came away with so much knowledge, and not just of epidemic diseases but of society and how it has changed in throughout the past 400 years. Definitely worth taking, but there is a TON of work. Take it credit\/D if you can. I did, and it definitely allowed me to enjoy it a lot more without stressing about memorizing every little detail.",
    "Great course, but really heavy on reading. Do not take it if you are already in a lot of reading-intensive courses.",
    "This class is an absolutely wonderful summary of some of the most interesting epidemics in the history of science. As a pre-medical student I found this class stimulating and a great companion to my biology classes, where I learn about the science behind contagion. I would certainly recommend this class.",
    "Definitely. My favorite class at Yale. No matter what discipline you come from, you'll never want to miss a class.",
    "Great class with good books and awesome lectures. You'll be an epidemic pro by the end, and so will your suitemates, whether or not they want to be.",
    "I would recommend it. You learn a lot of useful info and most of the reading is pretty interesting though impossible to finish.",
    "This course examines the affect that epidemic diseases in the west - ranging from Bubonic Plague, polio, syphilis, and smallpox to AIDS, Spanish influenza, and cholera - had an society and public health.The extensive readings on each disease and the information from Snowden's lectures combine to answer questions of the public and institutional reactions to the disease: which diseases inspired terror and why? How did intellectual history shape the public health measures used to address disease? How did patient experience vary based on the disease's particular symptoms? This course views history through the lens of epidemics and offers a unique and interesting way to see how the reactions to various epidemics reflected greater trends of the time. The course also addresses the issue of how TO study history in the first place, criticizing the use of Presentism to analyze history.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to others. It was a lot of work but the material is interesting enough that you don't really mind doing it. The class explored both the scientific and social effects of the diseases which gave them better grounding, in my opinion.",
    "Epidemics is tough but rewarding. It was probably my only final that I truly enjoyed studying for, just because the material was so interesting. It is a lot of work (a book a week with a 500 word reading response, along with a midterm, final paper and final exam) but if you dedicate yourself to it it is worth it. I didn't finish most of the books during the semester, so I'm reading them over break. It's JUST THAT INTERESTING.",
    "This course has better reviews than it deserves. Lecture is quite boring and the TAs are extremely difficult. I loved the information we learned and the books we read, but I would say they way in which information was presented could be improved.",
    "Yes. Take it. If you think maybe you might want to take it, then you absolutely should. I'm not a history or HSHM major and I loved every second.",
    "This isn't a biology class, it's very much about the history of disease. If you like reading about epidemiology and public health (and about a book per week on these subjects, or more), you'll get a TON out of the class!",
    "It is an excellent history of science and medicine course that covers every major epidemic from plague to AIDS. If you are interested in epidemic diseases, medicine, public health, or a combination of all three, this is the course for you. In addition to learning about epidemic disease you learn a lot about the history of medicine, covering everything from the humoralists of Ancient Greece to the scientist-doctors of the modern biomedical era, doctors' relationships with patients, and the different treatments used. I loved this course, and it made me more interested in medicine and epidemic disease. This is one of those courses that reminds you why people get into medicine and is a nice counterbalance to the draining intro science courses here. I would recommend it absolutely, but that person needs to make sure that this course is their only reading heavy course because the reading is murder sometimes. This is definitely one of those courses where reading the readings is strongly recommended, only so you don't look like a fool in section, which moves fast and is heavily based on the readings.",
    "Yes, if they were careful about picking a TA",
    "I would definitely recommend this to another student. You learn a ton about the history of the epidemics that are covered, but you leave the class wanting to learn even more. (Not that the material is not presented well -- it's really just very interesting and you'll want to know more.) Looking back, there is a lot of reading to do throughout the semester, but the books complement the lecture material very well and most of them are enjoyable. Professor Snowden is also very likable. This is a good course to take even you haven't taken any other history classes at Yale. No outside knowledge about history is expected, and it's interesting to learn about the discoveries that scientists made and how they were received in society.",
    "This class discusses major epidemics in the West since 1600, including plague, smallpox, cholera, malaria, Spanish influenza, tuberculosis, polio, and AIDS. Itexamines their social and scientific histories, and shows how understanding of and attitudes towards diseases changed over time and in different contexts. Students read one book weekly and write a two-page reading response on it, and write a final paper discussing the book at the end of the semester. I would definitely recommend this course as it is a great course to introduce students to History of Science, History of Medicine. People of all disciplines\u0097people going both into medicine and history\u0097will find this course engaging and interesting.",
    "Epidemics in the West Since 1600 is an amazing class! I loved going to class and really learned a lot! Professor Snowden is amazing and obviously is passionate about the topic! I would totally recommend it to everyone!",
    "I'm a junior and it's my favorite class at Yale so far. It's a must for HSHM majors, but I would even say it's a must for premed\/public health students. Professor Snowden is an excellent lecturer, and you learn so much from his class. He covers each disease in depth, and I really understood both the epidemiological and the social side of the disease. There is a lot of reading - 1 book a week, but it's good practice for skimming and knowing what's important. Plus, all of the books were excellent. The workload is manageable - weekly reading responses, 1 midterm short paper, 1 final paper, 1 final exam. All of them were actually very enjoyable. You are given freedom to choose what prompt, what book, etc. you wanted to choose to answer. The TAs for the class are also excellent, at least for my year you couldn't have gone wrong with either of the choices. I would absolutely recommend this class!!",
    "It is a fun class as you become an expert in several major diseases and their consequences. It is, however, a survey course, so most of the epidemics were covered quickly. Be prepared to read 1 book every 4-5 days.",
    "Highly recommended. This is far from an easy lecture but it is remarkably worthwhile; the readings are sound, the lectures are great, and Professor Snowden is a lovely man. Take it!",
    "Take this class! It's fun and interesting and not a whole lot of work - but by no means a GUT. Read the books every week and attend lecture and you'll do great.",
    "Yes, I definitely would recommend this class to another student, but would say be willing to take on a heavy course load and a lot of reading each week. Also, be prepared to memorize a lot for the final.",
    "Epidemics is by far one of my favorite courses at Yale! Snowden is a fantastic lecturer. He may seem like he talks pedantically, but he truly just wants to show as much information in each lecture as possible. The material was really interesting. While there was a lot of reading - a book a week - it's manageable, in that you can work with a study group to get the gist of them without fully finishing them. Additionally, the class is on OpenCourses, so you can actually watch a lecture in case you have to miss class one day."
