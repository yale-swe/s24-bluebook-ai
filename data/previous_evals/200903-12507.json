   "comments": [
    "This is an amazing course. The material is interesting and Professor Demos is an extraordinary lecturer. Some of the readings are a bit technical and dense but Professor Demos brings it alive by describing the daily lives of colonists, telling stories, and bringing in artifacts. One of the best courses I've taken at Yale.",
    "Yes. It is a must for any student at Yale.",
    "yes I would recommend it",
    "This is an interesting class to take as a history major because it is also American Studies...it seems less history and more themes and discussion of culture and change so it is hard to study for exam essays, but I enjoyed it and it is not as much work as some other histories I have taken.",
    "This class is a great survey of colonial history, from the discovery of the New World to around 1750. It is focused on understanding the everyday life of colonists, not the greater political events. By the end of the course, I feel I have a fairly good understanding of an average colonist's worldview and daily life. I highly recommend the class. John Demos is an incredible lecturer, though I am afraid he might be retiring.",
    "This is a true Yale Classic, although it hasn't been as popular as others because, in Demos' own words, colonial American history is not as \"sexy\" as, say, the Cold War. I'd recommend it even if you aren't a history or American Studies major. It's a lot of work if you actually do all the reading, which is recommended for doing well in the class. But it's definitely worth it, it's so interesting. The professor, John Demos, is a prominent figure in the field, and he's a great teacher. He brought in lots of cool artifacts from the colonial period, including an Indian weapon and a bloodletting device (complete with a bowl to catch the blood). He also took home our term papers after he wasdone with them and commented on them himself. He officially \"retired\" last year but no one knows when he'll stop teaching.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to anyone with any interest in colonial history, majors and non-majors. The structure of the class really lends itself to the teaching of historical research methods, which is extremely interesting and helpful for any student of history. Prof. Demos is wonderful, engaging and passionate about the subject, often bringing colonial artifacts from his own collection to bring various topics to life. Definitely take a class with him if you have the chance, though he may be retiring from teaching after this semester.",
    "The course covers unique subject matter that is either barely touched upon or not discussed at all in most history classes. The lectures were very interesting and engaging and many of the topics interesting, but it is sometimes hard to identity greater connections for the entire course material (chronology and geography are not discussed in detail and it is kind of assumed that the students are already supposed to know that information.)",
    "This course is not that hard. Take it if you want a good grade and some interesting reading. However, be warned that it delves not into event based history but thematic history. It looks at what it was like to be a colonial american from the ground up-- how they lived, what they ate, how they thought about life and death, etc. If you do not like individual based, everyman type history do not take this class.",
    "It's impossible to judge how this class will be after Demos leaves, but I had a great time with it. There's a fair amount of reading, some of it unnecessary, but most of it good. Lots about historical method and not just the facts themselves. Make sure you have some remote interest in colonial history or social history before you take it -- there's not much memorizing of facts or learning about major events and people about the period, but more about everyday life in colonial America. Demos was great.",
    "If you're an AMST major, I recommend the class. It's an interesting subject, a great professor, and a great background for all the other classes you'll take for your major.",
    "I would recommend it. Its not that difficult, though the lectures can get a little tedious sometimes because they are completely overloaded with specific personal\/social\/cultural history with basically no political history to tie it together. But the midterm and final were pretty straightforward. Readings were interesting. Paper was engaging and the assignment is pretty interesting.",
    "When I first signed up for this course, I thought it would be a relatively conventional history course. However, the course is actually much more of a social history course, and as such spends much more time discussing broad social trends than specific chronological details of the colonial period. If you are looking for a traditional chronological history class, this course is not for you. If you are looking to better understand the social trends of colonial America, you will definitely find this class interesting.",
    "An extremely interesting class! I did not expect to like this nearly as much as i did.",
    "Not your average pilgrims-and-Indians colonial history, you learn to live with the colonists. The paper assignment is legitimately exciting and Professor Demos is fantastic. I hope he keeps teaching. I would recommend this class, though I can't say what it would be like without Demos - he is the class's essence.",
    "Definitely take HIST 115 if you can with Professor Demos. I entered this course hoping to obtain by term's end a formative understanding of early American history that would be useful for future study. I ended hoping to explore more of colonial America in my time at Yale. Professor Demos was so knowledgeable -- literally 7 or 8 pages of notes sometimes per lecture. He would always bring in various artifacts from the era and separate 10 or 15 minutes for discussion. It was nice to have a lecture professor make such a concerted effort to get to know his students. The syllabus was well integrated, and although the reading was a lot at times, it was all worth doing to establish an understanding of colonial America in its entirety. The research paper was a lot of fun -- in this class, although you will be completing a lot of work, you encounter less of the stress that you may find in other history courses. A fantastic course overall, highly recommended.",
    "This class was a wonderful, general take on colonial American history. It is not one of those classes that goes chronologically and makes you memorize people, places, dates, and events. This course allows you to get into the motives behind colonists' actions, the factors affecting the development of colonial America, and what life was like for colonists. If you want a straightforward, memorization-based, black-and-white history class, then this isn't the class for you. If, however, you want a colorful, interesting, and exciting class that just happens to be centered around history, then I recommend this class to you.",
    "This class was one of the best classes I have ever taken at Yale. The lectures and reading were always very interesting, and Professor Demos always made the lectures extremely engaging. Professor Demos is not expected to teach this class anymore since he is retired, so I don't know how this class will be with a different professor. The material itself is very interesting, though, so based on that I would recommend this class.",
    "Good if you are interested in the social history of the Colonial Period - no names or dates.",
    "I wouldn't recommend this class without Demos.",
    "The name of this course should be Colonial History Themes or How to Write Colonial History. This course is less about the straight facts and examining how different writers engage with source materials and the historical time period. Demos is passionate about what he does and it shows in his class. This is much more of a cultural history.",
    "I recommend it, but make sure to sit down with your TA and understand her\/his expectations.",
    "A wonderful course for those at all interested in any kind of history. Highly recommended if Mr. Demos stays to teach it for another year. A lot of reading.",
    "An almost atemporal account of American history before the Revolutionary War. Dates, leaders, and events are eschewed in favor of a more holistic approach to colonial society and psychology. Very interesting - but know what you're getting into.",
    "This was a very interesting course on the cultural history of Colonial America. It has a lot of assigned reading but not a ton of written assignments. A lot of this course's strength comes from professor Demos, who is retiring after this year. I don't know how the course will be withsomeone else.",
    "I really enjoyed the class, but it is important to understand that this class is a social history above all else. If you want to learn about the leading figures and major events of the colonial period, this is not the class for you."
