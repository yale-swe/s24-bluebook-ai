    "Chinese 110 is a fast paced& intensive introduction to the Chinese language. Only take the class if you are genuinely interested in the language and committed to reviewing\/studying every night. The teachers are fantastic and you will learn a lot for just one semester. You must be prepared, however, to complete all daily homework assignments in addition to studying the characters on your own. I definitely recommend it if you're interested in Chinese.",
    "The chinese class here at Yale is a very good one - I loved how organized it was and how we practice speaking so much in class that we see huge improvements. The teachers are rotated, which is nice, and they're all really good. Definitely recommend it. Pretty big time commitment though.",
    "This course is not for the weak-hearted. Be prepare to work in abundance. It's definitely worth it though."
