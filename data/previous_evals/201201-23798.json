    "This course provides some enlightening insight on a variety of sources of health disparities. That said, after taking \"Psychosocial Epidemiology\" the previous year, I did not learn too much new information.",
    "A good course for anyone interested in learning about health disparities; however, may be more helpful for first-year students who have less exposure to this concept than for second-year students who have already covered much of this material in other classes",
    "Great course, good content. Covered lots of material - perhaps a little more focused material would be nice.",
    "This course was very interesting. I thought the topics we covered were interesting and the readings were helpful in understanding each topic.The class format was difficult however. I don't think people felt comfortable about opening up and talking about race in such a way that would make for a more fruitful discussion. I really appreciated Dr. Jones's honesty and her willingness to be open and forthright about her views. I think that helped a lot.I wonder if the first couple of the semester should start off with some kind of ice breaker activity that gets people comfortable to share their opinions.There was a tremendous amount of reading in this class that was at times difficult to keep up with.",
    "Fair",
    "This class was great, I enjoyed the discussion. The book club was great!",
    "The course encourages great exchange among the students and instructor, however the readings were at times extensive.",
    "Very good course with interesting readings. I enjoyed the life course perspective of the class.",
    "The course consists of a wide range of topics related to health disparities, and the seminar model allows for interesting conversations.",
    "I think Health Disparities was a very good class. I would have liked more discussion on the topics but I think that was more of an issue with the class being somewhat quiet."

    "Instructor: Beth Jones \u00a0Dr. Jones is a great instructor. I really liked the spectrum of topics covered in the course and really loved the book club assignment. I would like to see this assignment earlier on in the class. I think it made the class a bit more talkative."
