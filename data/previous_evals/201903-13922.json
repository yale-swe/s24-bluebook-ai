    "Loved the class, but I wish we had more class discussions rather than presentations. The information was so interesting and our discussions were engaging, and I wish there was more time for that!",
    "Strengths: study questions force students to be engaged with the reading; periodical deadlines for the paper keep students in check Weaknesses: could have provided more resources for students struggling with R or Stata",
    "The material was very interesting in this course and Professor Altonji is very engaged in the course and is well prepared for each class. Weaknesses would include a lack of feedback on presentations and weekly responses, so you didnt really know how to improve each week. In addition, doing the empirical analysis was very difficult and many of us didnt feel prepared to do this.",

    "This class is a good introduction to labor economics. The readings are the best part of this course.",
    "I would recommend this course to a student who has a mastery of R or Stata so that they wont feel overwhelmed by the final project. Even with Econometrics (Econ 117) the final project proved to be the most time consuming project Ive done- but it was rewarding, nonetheless.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to another student, especially if you are interested in labor economics and the impact of gender on labor force participation and wages.",
    "Absolutely, highly engaging"
