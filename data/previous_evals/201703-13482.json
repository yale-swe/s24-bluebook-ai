   "comments": [
    "Professor Kumar did a poor job of teaching this class. The content was unclear and he was completely disorganized. His take-home exams were often not written in coherent English and needed to be revised several times after he sent them out, and questions still lacked clarity. I did not take a lot away from this course.",
    "this was the worst class i've taken at yale",
    "It is a fascinating topic. We learned a lot about a relatively obscure but growing area in public health, with strong quantitative techniques. The course itself was a failure, due to the lack of preparation and teaching knowledge from the instructor.",
    "This could have been a useful course, but the material was undermined by objectively awful instruction. The one improvement would be to have Paltiel come back, because there is no way anyone can defend Sanjeev's class.",
    "The material in the course is important to understand and useful to know.",
    "I went into this class with high hopes because I had heard from some second years that Professor Paltiel did a great job with it last year. Now that I know he's coming back from his sabbatical next year, I wish I had waited to take it my second year. The course material is very interesting (I liked the supplemental video\/news articles a lot). I just found that Professor Kumar isn't very good at explaining calculations or concepts, so I spent much of the lecture time being confused or bored. I I learned more on my own reading or from Professor Paltiel's PowerPoint slides. Professor Kumar is well-intentioned and knowledgable, and I believe he is a good person but his way of explaining problems\/models is very repetitive and not easily followed.",
    "I have been in classes in some form for nearly 25 years, and this is by far the worst course I have ever taken. The fact that I had to pay thousands of dollars for this course is absurd. This was an embarrassment on multiple levels.",
    "as",
    "Class notes and materials are disorganized on canvas site. The slides are scattered here and there. Sometimes it took the whole class for the professor to talk through the quiz questions and the homework for last class and did not talk about the new materials at all. The problems on the tests were barely touched upon during classes. The professor sometimes just scrolled over the content and made a few comments and hoped for the students to solve the problems on their own without any informative instruction. The overall pace for the class was very slow. It took the professor a lot of time to click on here and there, open this folder and that folder to find his files. However maybe it is also wrong to say that the class was overall very slow because the professor sometimes would skip the whole new things and move on. He hoped us to figure out the answers by ourselves and be ready for doing the assignments. Then, wait until next class with the hope of him explaining the answers explicitly, sometimes he would just scroll the answers over and say, \"here, look, the answers, this is what you should do to obtain this, this, that number.\" I don't think I get anything out of this class.",
    "There is a lot to be improved. Students with a heavy math\/econ background seem to sail through (but more because they already knew it). Those with more humanities were incredibly frustrated because of assumptions of background knowledge. Consider using a real textbook that progresses in a connected way. The homework actually needs to be looked at by the TA's and specific errors pointed out. Several of us made the same errors in our exams that we had in our homework (because we were told in class that there was more than one way of reaching the answer!) The solutions posted need to have explanations rather than just the answers, especially as the instructor often did not finish the solution in class. Reduce the generalized reading- or give a overview of what one is supposed to have noted. Just giving me a reading that is barely connected to the math is insufficient to make me \"see\" what you need me to. TA's and instructor need to work together. There were too many communications where the TA's felt that they were being asked to work more than they were supposed to and one did not feel one could understand the instructor. We were left to our own devices. The TA's changed the meet-times far too often. In addition to course meeting times, the TA scheduled hours should be posted with the course schedule. I was not able to attend TA hours because of a consistent conflict. Extra TA's should be allocated to new instructors, to make sure that there is bandwidth to compensate for unpredictable inefficiencies",
    "this is the worst class i've taken at yale. quality of instruction was very bad",
    "Course seemed very disorganized but good material.",
    "I think the concepts taught in the course were good, but I think the method of their delivery wasn't always the best. The structure of having homework and then learning the concepts in the homework in class was useful because it got us to really think about them before we knew how to apply them well.",
    "Cost-effectiveness analysis is a crucial but challenging skill to learn. Strengths -Covers important subject matter -Exposure to current trends\/issues in the field Weaknesses -Presentation of material was confusing -Lack of TA section made it hard to learn material",
    "Class felt disjointed, was not given feedback from exams in a timely manner, homework wasn't really graded.",
    "The course is very interesting and the subject matter discussed is very important, with ramifications in health care, public health, health policy. I definitely feel more comfortable with the subject matter and what a cost effectiveness analysis entails than I was before the course but overall, mostly due to the quality of the teaching, this course left a lot to be desired. It was the worst taught course I have taken in 12 years of schooling. The materials used as explanatory texts left to be desired, as they were much more detailed and contained more difficult concepts than what was described in class. There were a lot of readings for this class, but very few were useful in the way of explaining concepts that we discussed in class in more detail in order to make them comprehensible. For the most part, the readings delved into even greater detail or on a tangent to some concept we were discussing and most times, students didn't understand how they were related to the contents discussed in class.",
    "The lecture can be more clear and organized.",
    "Horrible teaching!!! Did not learn anything from Prof Kumar's lectures. He does not know how to present material in a logical flow so students can learn. Spent too much time presenting random articles that had nothing to do with the course. Really wanted to learn and felt like I gained absolutely nothing. This course really should have had a discussion section (like Epi 1 or Microecon (HPM 586)) in which students met with a TA each week and went over practice problems and could ask questions. Really disappointing experience.",
    "Great materials. Poorly taught. Get rid of all that philosophical stuff.",
    "Overall it's a useful class, but instructor should improve a bit on making sense of basic concepts and calculation rationales during the class.",
    "This course has interesting material, however, the instruction is pretty unclear and not always relevant to the assignments. The tests were difficult and lengthy.",
    "Contents are interesting and up-to-date",
    "The course material followed a logical flow. One challenge is perhaps the assumption that I know more than I do (basic economics, terms definitions)- resulting in confusion and much ancillary work to define basic terms. Another challenge is organization of course materials- readings, homework and examination solutions, and slides could have been organized better on canvas to facilitate learning. I think having real-life examples is useful.",
    "good but almost self-studied",
    "The review stuff for statistics is good. In the same way, considering that some students are taking the course with limited economic background, I would recommend the instructor to provide reading materials or practice on economics as well. The instructor should make his lecture more clearly in its logistics, and teach with more clear logistics.",
    "It seems that the topic is rather difficult to teach but I love how applicable the material is!",
    "The content is really interesting, a lot of the calculations are intense and sometimes difficult to follow with class only didactics. A lot might be helpful but obviously takes more time.",
    "Strengths: I enjoyed our weekly homework. It taught me quite a bit this semester and was a nice challenging course. Weaknesses: I felt that the time in class was not always well spent and often confused me more. I wish we had had a textbook or something to help us along the way.",
    "Strengths: The teaching fellows were able to teach us a few quantitative skills, the case studies due every week were on a pass fail basis so you did not have to stress so much about doing the homework correctly. Weaknesses: Lectures were incredibly poorly constructed, instructor's wording in class was very confusing, questions on exams were very unclear and unpolished and required multiple clarifications as well as clarifications of the clarifications, learned very few tangible skills (from the TFs, not from the instructor) at a shallow level, a lot of lecture time spent on unrelated stories Future improvements: Structure the lectures so that the related case study comes after rather than before that lecture, practice lecture content before class, especially methods heavy content, feed back on the case studies would be very helpful .",
    "The class material was very interesting, but I was very unsatisfied with the structure of the course.",
    "The strength is its topic and the subject of study. The way it's being taught could be more direct and better explanation of topics",
    "Oy vey, where to begin... This class was a disaster from the beginning. The class was incredibly disorganized and material was not presented in any sort of easy way to understand. The first 30 minutes of each section was spent doing useless quizzes followed by unrelated tangents by the instructor. It was made worse by disrespectful students who were openly rude when the instructor struggled to respond to questions. I'm not sure I learned anything in this class. The class was in dire need of structure and organization.",
    "CEA is an interesting subject, and I wish I was able to get more out of the course, but I feel as if I had difficulty learning during the lectures, and had to look to the readings and outside resources to really understand the material.",
    "In all of the courses I have taken in undergrad and grad school combined, this was by far the worst class I have ever taken. I felt like I came out with less knowledge and more confusion than before, which is unfortunate because I was very much looking forward to taking this course. The topics meant to be taught in this class are ones that are useful and marketable, yet after an entire semester, I don't feel that I have learned any of them. Every class was started with a Qualtrics \"quiz\" that asked different mind-teaser questions that were apparently relevant. However, we were told that the lessons taught by these questions were important that we needed to understand, but the class never got the questions right and the answers were never explained, even when people specifically asked for explanations. It left me feeling lost right when the class started. For most of the class, the instructor used the projector to put up notebook paper with illegible handwriting, making it difficult to follow anything. When powerpoints were used, they were all over the place and difficult to follow because the instructor would switch between screens so often. Questions were not adequately answered by the professor, and often several students would step in and answer questions for other students. There was even an instance in which the instructor did not remember how to complete an example problem. The exams were difficult to understand and could never actually be completed without hours of frustration for each question. For every exam, the questions had to be clarified by the instructor, leading to more confusion. I spent 20+ hours on each exam because I had to teach myself the concepts and somehow interpret the questions to turn in an answer. I have never been so frustrated by a class, let alone one that I actually wanted to learn the material in. Everything about it needs work.",
    "This course improved over the course of the semester, but it would have been much improved by spending less time talking about the relevance of the subject material and more time teaching the quantitative skills. It would be helpful to spend more time on examples in class to drive home the quantitative skills.",
    "This class was poorly organized. The instructor often failed to teach important components of the lecture needed for the assignments and the exams so we often found ourselves trying to figure out hw rubrics. Lectures were useless.",
    "I strongly feel that we needed a more structured approach to the course content. A proper textbook, and more organized lectures and supplemental readings would have been beneficial.",
    "This class is so well reviewed when taught by the original instructor. It was a bit of a trainwreck as taught by Prof. Kumar (nice guy, but...). Very disappointing.",
    "I like the course contents and how overall the course is structured.",
    "The strength is in the material. The greatest weaknesses are: The lack of a central textbook, of which there are a number to choose from. The lack of feedback on assignments.",
    "After hearing such good things about this course from previous students, I decided to take this class in hopes of learning a new skill. However, this class was so poorly taught by Paltiel's replacement that I feel like I was cheated out of my tuition money by taking it instead of something else this semester. It was not only a waste of time, it was an incredibly frustrating experience because the instructor did not listen and improve on our suggestions. Organization was lacking, answers were inconsistent, and the midterm was unlike any of the assignments. I felt like by the end I was just combing through Paltiel's old slides to teach myself how to do CEA for the homeworks\/exams.",
    "I think a major strength of this course was the interesting nature of the topic and the problem sets and readings. Doing the problem sets was when I felt like I really started to understand the material and its practical applications, and the readings were a very helpful guide when completing them. On the other hand, I think a weakness of the class was the lectures, because they always felt a bit disorganized and I never felt like I learned 2 hours worth of material. I think this course could be drastically improved by making the lectures more streamlined and focused.",
    "This class was an extreme disappointment. I wish YSPH had a refund policy. Strengths: you will learn very interesting and useful skills through the weekly assignments and readings weaknesses: this class is 99% self-learning, thus, your learning will be mediocre, time-consuming and unguided.",
    "This was a good introduction to cost-effectiveness analysis. I enjoyed the weekly cases\/assignments. However, I wish there were more assignments with real-world scenarios in public health. Also, I would recommend providing more feedback on the weekly assignments. I had to teach myself much of the material. Overall, you will learn useful skills!",
    "Worst course I have taken at YSPH. The professor was poorly prepared and disorganized.",
    "This is a tough course and the instruction was okay. Prof Kumar is a brilliant academic and answers questions thoroughly in person. I did find it difficult to follow his lectures, however. The teaching assistants are great one-on-one. What would have improved office hours would have been a thorough coverage of the material from beginning to end, with deconstructed explanations of cost-effectiveness methodologies.",
    "unless you know econ and have taken econ courses before, don't take it. you learn nothing from the actual course but you'll ace it if you know it already. &if all exams are problem sets, please let us practice with more problem sets. the extra practice problems are not similar to the actual exams and the homework doesn't encompass all the exam questions.",
    "The course was difficult, but manageable. In general the course was mostly difficult due to the situation - the previous professor was on sabbatical and the professor who taught in his stead had a bit of difficulty adjusting. Overall, I still think I did learn a lot about CE analysis.",
    "The course was a complete waste of my tuition, as I was not taught at all. I had to rely on previous knowledge. The information was nonsensical and did not follow any type of schedule.",
    "More example problems and homework feedback would be useful to gain understanding of the course material.",
    "I liked that the weekly cases were P\/F. However much I would have liked some direct feedback, I certainly appreciated the \"safe zone\" to explore the cases without feeling anxious to get everything right more. The exams were a bit too long, and the final exam was unexpectedly more difficult than the midterms. It would have been better if the students had been prepared more efficiently.",
    "Interesting and important content but not presented in an easy learnable format. Tests were focused on theory and articles he required did not in my eyes apply much to the theories he wanted to teach. It was a good attempt at it to present the material in a more interesting way than just defining, but it was a failure. I stopped going after the first few weeks because I realized my time was better spent looking at previous class notes. Could have put more work into the course but grew frustrated early and decided to invest my time in other work. It could be improved by providing feedback on homeworks. What we were missing relating to the topics and if more review sessions were provided to us students. Maybe a drill period like Epi 1.",

   "comments": [
    "Instructor: Sanjeev Kumar \u00a0While he has good intentions, he was the most ineffective professor I have ever had. He spent about half of each class going on random tangents about an article he'd read recently or whatever was on his mind. He lacked coherence and basic organization, and was not able to procure answer keys for his for weeks, nor upload files effectively or grade students on time. It felt very lazy. He absolutely should not teach this course again - we learned very little due to his poor communication and organization skills.",
    "Instructor: Sanjeev Kumar \u00a0He is a very nice person but this was the worst instructor I have ever had (including undergrad). I distinctly remember a student asking a question about the homework and he did not know how to do it. Lectures were so unnecessarily long and went on about topics no one seemed to be interested in. I cannot believe this person was allowed to teach a Yale graduate course. He makes the infuriating mistake of forgetting to include crucial information for take-home exams he created. This happened for both the midterms and the final. I spent hours on an impossible problem that he later emailed us about with new information DAYS after the exam was given. His english grammar on the exams is incorrect and sometimes incoherent. I will be disappointed if this person is given another chance to teach at Yale.",
    "Instructor: Sanjeev Kumar \u00a0Terrible, did not ever convey one single thought clearly. It seemed like the lecture was a vague stream of consciousness that was never relevant to teaching of cost-effectiveness analysis methods, and really is a shameful excuse for what is usually the most popular course at YSPH under Paltiel. Sanjeev lost control of the class very quickly, and for good reason. He did nothing to convince anyone he knew what he was talking about, and this occurred every single week. Homework and exams were painfully unclear, and the examples typically had no relevance to public health. Yale administration really needs to reconsider this man's position in the faculty. Sanjeev needs to feel embarrassed for such low quality work this semester, such a non-effort in instruction. I genuinely feel as thought I am owed an apology for wasting my time in this class. Sanjeev, you should feel ashamed. I would be surprised if you are ever offered another opportunity to teach at Yale, but if you do stumble upon such luck, do everyone a favor and decline the offer.",

    "Instructor: Sanjeev Kumar \u00a0This was a terribly taught course. He was unprepared, would get confused during his examples, and used a projection system he could never get to work properly. He would spend more than half of each session going over homework rather than trying to teach concepts. His tests were gigantic wastes of time, requiring us to watch videos that were literally hours long that were only tangentially related to the material.",
    "Instructor: Sanjeev Kumar \u00a0afd",
    "Instructor: Sanjeev Kumar \u00a0Professor Kumar has an extremely bad accent. I barely understood what he was trying to say. I don't feel that he was well prepared for classes. It is ridiculous that he would say \"oh, this totally went off my mind\" when he was scrolling over the answers for last assignment and did not know how to actually answer the questions on the assignment. He was basically scrolling down the document and was saying \"look, this is the answer\" and not talking about the strategy of developing the answer. Until one student raised the question and ask professor Kumar how he developed the particular answer, he would say \"oh this totally went off my mind\" and then start clicking on here and there to try to find previous notes. However, he sometimes failed to find the notes and would conclude the whole talk with, \"sorry, this totally went off my mind.\"",
    "Instructor: Sanjeev Kumar \u00a0Warm, decent but impossibly frustrating. I felt I was wasting my money. I feel that I failed this class (in spite of what my score and transcript says). Please, please teach to the entire class, not just those who have math\/ economics \/computer backgrounds. Include a basic excel training session Post solutions\/exam results with explanations. The calculations were incorrect several times. When a substitute teacher is assigned a course, the main teachers' recordings of the same classes should be made available to the students so that they can get what they need to from the class. The instructor should be evaluated for teaching skills by advisors 1-2 sessions into class. It seemed as if the instructor was assigned to teach this class on the day of the class, which put him in the situation of teaching somewhat unfamiliar stuff and not having the comfort of rearranging material to match their own preferred flow process (even if knowledgeable about the material). I am sorry for this evaluation, as the instructor tried really hard. This was poorly structured by the institution to the extreme frustration of TA's, students and instructor.",
    "Instructor: Sanjeev Kumar \u00a0Dr. Kumar was good individually but got flustered at questions during lecture. Due to the nature of the material in the course, it seemed very disorganized.",
    "Instructor: Sanjeev Kumar \u00a0I think Professor Kumar has a passion for the subject and truly tried his hardest to teach us, but did not always succeed. I think he drastically improved as the semester progressed, but I think it would have been useful if he had explained things step-by-step from the beginning and more carefully and descriptively explained concepts.",
    "Instructor: Sanjeev Kumar \u00a0Strengths -Passion for subject matter (infectious!) -Kind, friendly, curious personality -Knowledge of subject matter Weaknesses -Attention to detail on written exams (confusing wording and typos) -Translation of his own expertise to people who have never seen material before",
    "Instructor: Sanjeev Kumar \u00a0A bit more structure would have been helpful! The instructor had good intentions but very poor execution.",
    "Instructor: Sanjeev Kumar \u00a0Very nice and knows a lot on the subject, was not as well organized and the material seemed a bit disjointed",
    "Instructor: Sanjeev Kumar \u00a0His strength is definitely his enthusiasm for this subject matter and the fact that he does care about teaching the students and improving the course as much as possible. That being said, it seems the professor underestimated the amount of preparation it took to, for lack of a better word, prepare the course. His major weakness is the inability to teach. His explanations on the subject matter in class were too concise, because he spent most of the class explaining why a concept was important instead on explaining the concept itself. He also gave us few readings that clearly explained the concepts discussed in class. In the future the class could be greatly improved if the professor actually takes time to explain the concepts themselves, give more practice problems with solutions separate from the homework, and select cost effectiveness texts which are easy to read and to the point rather than specialty texts (where out of 20 pages only 2 are pertinent, there is no reason why I should have to read 20 pages of a phd level thesis for an introductory course). Frankly , unless I specialize in that topic, it will confuse me even more. Throughout the class there were several times when he tried to explain a homework assignment involving excel and he himself was confused as to what he was explaining. The class pre-requisites state that one does not need to know economics to take this class, but in at least one class the professor used economics formulas to teach without explaining them well enough. The presentations for the class were powerpoint presentations from previous years, and for the rest of the classes he professor used a projector for showing hand-written problem solutions. I would suggest making and using powerpoint presentations, even if this more time consuming to prepare given that the professor does have quite poor handwriting so the notes were very hard to read. His exams were confusing, poorly worded, and filled with errors of spelling. For the second test, no one in the class got an answer to an essay question right to the disappointment of the professor. IF however, no one out of 100 students or so gets an answer right, it is likely because the question is worded poorly which illustrates my point above. All in all, this was one of the worst courses I have taken. This is regrettable because I do feel that the professor cared, but he does need to significantly improve the way he teaches the class.",
    "Instructor: Sanjeev Kumar \u00a0He is responsible and introduced many interesting readings.",
    "Instructor: Sanjeev Kumar \u00a0The worst professor I have had at Yale. Does not know how to teach things with a logical progression that help student learning. Should have just lectured from slides, at least that would have forced some organization. Really a disappointing experience and impeded my learning substantially. Also, numerous typos in exams was discouraging.",
    "Instructor: Sanjeev Kumar \u00a0Sanjeev tried hard. He even had us evaluate the course in the middle of the semester to improve his teaching. Not many professors do that.",
    "Instructor: Sanjeev Kumar \u00a0Overall Dr. Kumar is not doing a good job making sense of many concepts and calculations. But he's a very nice instructor who takes the course seriously and response really timely. Maybe he needs some more encouragement and experience.",
    "Instructor: Sanjeev Kumar \u00a0Obviously an extremely kind person and professor, who is passionate about the material. However, as he is not the regular instructor of this course, his instruction often seemed to be unplanned and scattered. The material taught in class did not really flow and was not always very relevant to the homework assignments or exams. Great instructor, but the wrong course for him.",

    "Instructor: Sanjeev Kumar \u00a0The quality of instruction was incredibly poor. Given the complexity of the topic, the course needs to be taught in a structured manner, and student feedback should be prioritized. The instructor was inattentive overall, frequently ignoring students' emails, and was inflexible setting up time to meet outside of class.",
    "Instructor: Sanjeev Kumar \u00a0good",
    "Instructor: Sanjeev Kumar \u00a0The weekly homework problems help me learn more about the course content. However, due to some degree of difficulty in HWs, I would recommend a weekly discussion session led by TA to discuss about the HW. During the lecture time, the instructor should focus more on the lecture stuff rather than making half of the lecture a HW problem-solving session.",
    "Instructor: Sanjeev Kumar \u00a0Pro: Great and caring professor, is genuinely very interested and excited about it",
    "Instructor: Sanjeev Kumar \u00a0The instructor assumes a solid economics background, which most of the students do not have. Also, the instructor does not seem to respond to students' questions very well. When students have questions, he seemed to be inpatient and did not provide direct and clear answer.",
    "Instructor: Sanjeev Kumar \u00a0First year teaching the class, and I give him a lot of credit for putting in the time and effort. He is passionate about the content and very receptive to emails.",
    "Instructor: Sanjeev Kumar \u00a0It was clear Dr. Kumar loves this course and overall topics covered in the course. It was his first time teaching this course, and it was bery evident. His efforts and dedication were very clear. He was also always trying to improve.",
    "Instructor: Sanjeev Kumar \u00a0This class was one of the most frustrating experiences I've had in my entire academic career because of the instructor. Fairly simple concepts were explained in a very convoluted manner, and requests for clarification often led to even more confusion. The methods behind concrete skills in cost effective analysis were never well explained, and students often had to go home to teach themselves the material from the past professor's powerpoints, rely too heavily on the TFs, or resort to the internet to learn the content. At the beginning of each class, the instructor began lecture by insulting students, saying that the majority of us do not understand basic economic and cost effective concepts, yet failed to teach us any of those concepts. He spent much of the lecture going off on tangents. It was frustrating that the homeworks and the exams hardly covered what was \"taught\" in class: the homeworks and exams tested us on very concrete skills, but we were never taught those concepts properly in class. The instructor would be a great motivational speaker but not an instructor for a class where students are trying to learn concrete skills.",
    "Instructor: Sanjeev Kumar \u00a0Very kind and intelligent, but his lectures were tough to follow. Dr. Kumar did improve as the semester developed and he tried really hard to help us which I truly appreciated.",
    "Instructor: Sanjeev Kumar \u00a0Dr. Kumar clearly has an excellent knowledge however, it would be great if he could explain topics without much distractions or deviation just to facilitate students' understanding of the topic first, and if there is time left, he could go over other concepts. Also it would be great if he could go over the math slowly and from the very beginning one by one instead of just going over things very quickly or assuming that we would know.",
    "Instructor: Sanjeev Kumar \u00a0Sanjeev clearly has a lot of passion and knowledge about this subject, but unfortunately this was not reflected in the quality of the class. He needs to do better to respond to students questions and concerns about the class, with less long-winded ramblings and class questions.",
    "Instructor: Sanjeev Kumar \u00a0Professor Kumar got more comfortable with teaching throughout the courses, but I generally had difficulty learning from his teaching style. I think it may have helped if there was a clearer lecture format: technical material we should learn, an option to apply those skills, and repeat. Instead, I felt as if there were too many extraneous comments that didn't contribute much to our understanding of the topics. Overall, CEA is a difficult course to teach, and he has great potential for improvement throughout his academic career.",
    "Instructor: Sanjeev Kumar \u00a0Very confusing lecturer, always said that certain topics were \"very important\" but neglected to actually explain what they were. I regretted going to lecture and found myself being more confused each class.",
    "Instructor: Sanjeev Kumar \u00a0Although Prof. Kumar is clearly very passionate, he had some difficulty structuring the course material around the quantitative skills and spent too much time talking about why the general subject was relevant to current affairs.",
    "Instructor: Sanjeev Kumar \u00a0Worst instructor and class I have ever taken at Yale",
    "Instructor: Sanjeev Kumar \u00a0Prof. Kumar seems like a smart, interesting, and nice person, but he has a long way to go before being a gifted professor. He does not seem able to tell when his students are following his instruction or when we are lost, nor does he seem able to convey which parts of his discussion are core and which are simply asides. It was impossible to determine the arc of the course or precisely what he was aiming to impart from week to week. Any learning was mainly self-taught by reading some of the homework. Several students simply stopped showing up. A shame, because the content is very interesting.",
    "Instructor: Sanjeev Kumar \u00a0At first, he seemed not so familiar with teaching this course, but he improved over time with our recommendations. He may try not to make too many comments over contents that is not related to the lecture.",
    "Instructor: Sanjeev Kumar \u00a0He is very passionate about the material and enjoys sharing his passion. That said, he would benefit from getting some guidance and support from the department on teaching in the classroom.",
    "Instructor: Sanjeev Kumar \u00a0I don't feel that the basics of cost effectiveness analysis were ever effectively explained. I think it would be more effective to go over the these skills than asking open-ended questions about why people think a certain way. People would pay attention more if you started with the solutions to the last homework, rather than opening with a questionnaire. I felt that toward the end of the course you were getting better at explaining these concepts, but that doesn't erase the building blocks were missing.",
    "Instructor: Sanjeev Kumar \u00a0I think the major strength of Dr. Kumar is that he cared so much about his students and making sure that we all understood the material. On the other hand, I think his major weakness is that he sometimes struggled to articulate the material during lectures, especially in response to student questions, and this took away from the clarity and quality of the course.",
    "Instructor: Sanjeev Kumar \u00a0Strengths: professor Kumar is very passionate Weaknesses: Unfortunately he is not a good lecturer (very disorganized, it is very hard to gather what is that he is trying to convey, he is often disoriented and unprepared, etc)",
    "Instructor: Sanjeev Kumar \u00a0I think Professor Kumar is an engaging lecturer. Although this is his first time teaching this course at Yale, I thought he did a great job of incorporating feedback from students and modifying the lectures based on students' needs.",
    "Instructor: Sanjeev Kumar \u00a0Extremely disorganized, spent most of the class on random tangents. Tests were not written in coherent English and required many test updates to be sent during the week. Unclear and ineffective at best.",
    "Instructor: Sanjeev Kumar \u00a0As above",
    "Instructor: Sanjeev Kumar \u00a0I can't understand what he's saying. He speeds through the review and his lectures doesn't really match the homework. I feel like he's just bad at communicating. We get a lot of questions about aspects of the review and how he got there, but his response doesn't really answer our questions. a lot of us end up just giving up making him understand our question or understanding his answer. The lecture is also not very effective in teaching us anything. it's unfortunate because you practically have to learn from the readings but the readings aren't really comprehensive. As a student without any econ background, you're always left feeling like you don't know enough to answer the question in full.",
    "Instructor: Sanjeev Kumar \u00a0The professor definitely knew the material, but the course was designed for a different teaching style. The professor would benefit from teaching a more theory oriented course than the emphasis on the quantitative. I would definitely encourage him to do so as his knowledge of the field was incredible. However, the course as it is designed now is definitely not compatible with his teaching and may be a reason why so many students were dissatisfied with the course as expectations were different.",
    "Instructor: Sanjeev Kumar \u00a0Although Prof. Kumar was a very nice person, he did not teach me at all. I felt lost and completely frustrated, as he didn't answer any questions, he didn't make any sense. I came to every class and I still was confused. His required readings did not have anything to do with the class. Grading made no sense.",
    "Instructor: Sanjeev Kumar \u00a0Excellent",
    "Instructor: Sanjeev Kumar \u00a0Very enthused teacher but was very disorganized. Can't imagine the difficulty trying to teach Paltiels course. Lectures very often got off topic or presented the information in a more confusing way and from the lectures I went to I left having learned very little. I grew frustrated at the teaching style. Tests were continually reworked after having been sent out because he made mistakes or it confused too many students. Im really not sure what i learned from the course.",
    "Instructor: Sanjeev Kumar \u00a0The professor was noticeably new to teaching, but tried hard and made the course succeed."

   "comments": [
    "Do not take this course if Prof Kumar is teaching it. You are better off just buying a book or waiting for David to come back.",
    "Do not take it with this professor. You will have to figure out everything on your own. If there is a better instructor, I will recommend the class because the content is fascinating and quantitatively useful.",
    "If it is taught by Sanjeev, run as fast as you can in the other direction. If it is taught by Paltiel, embrace the opportunity to take one of the best taught courses at YSPH.",
    "While the material was useful and worth learning, the course was not as effective as I had heard from previous years. I regretted not taking the course with David and sometimes wished I had not taken it this year.",
    "Only take it if a good\/experienced professor is teaching it",
    "Avoid this course at all costs. The fact that this is a required course is a shame. A waste of a credit, and a waste of time.",
    "I would not recommend taking this course with professor Kumar.",
    "If this instructor is teaching the course, make sure you budget extra time for self- study and group study.",
    "Recommend next year. Challenging but learn a lot about cost-effectiveness and the right ways to make a decision.",
    "Yes, I'd recommend this course to other students because it is a very important topic for public health. That said, we missed David this year and hope he teaches it again for future students!",
    "Absolutely disappointing ....",
    "necessary subject to understand, could have been done better",
    "I would say that the subject matter covered by the course is important but the course itself was a disappointment and if taking this class I would advise you to be prepared to teach yourself the subject matter. The teaching fellows were great and outside of reading on my own, they were the only source of teaching I received in the course. The professor, though well intentioned did not manage to get his points across or add much value to the course.",
    "Probably recommend",
    "I guess the material could be good, but not with this professor. If it's taught again with Kumar, 100% do not take.",
    "This course is probably one of the most important courses for all public health students. That said, the school should require taking some Excel lessons beforehand. If you don't even know how to write if-then statements on Excel, you will struggle in this course. If you know Solver, you'll get the idea much more efficiently, for example. Learn Excel before you take this course!",
    "Would still recommend it, given David is coming back for the next course. I was told this is a great class that could change your attitude toward life.",
    "good to know this kind of knowledge",
    "Interesting content and clinically useful. I would recommend this class.",
    "It was a great introduction to cost-effectiveness analysis and decision-making. It will be useful to take albeit challenging if one if interested in pursuing a career in health care management in particular.",
    "I heard positive things about this class under the previous instructor. I was wildly disappointed with this class this semester and would 100% not recommend this class to a fellow student under the current instructor. However, Dr. David Paltiel is teaching, perhaps the fellow student would learn useful and applicable cost effective skills.",
    "It is a tough course and it was poorly organized.",
    "I recommend this class. You get to learn some of the most important things as a student in the public health.",
    "From what I've heard, if Paltiel is teaching the class -- take it. Otherwise, a complete waste of time.",
    "I regretted taking this course and wish I would have taken anything else.",
    "The subject material is interesting and very useful, and you can get a good amount out of the course from doing the readings and talking with the TAs, but the lectures are frustrating to sit through.",
    "The TAs had no idea what they were doing and neither did the instructor. This class taught me nothing and it was an absolute disservice to my education.",
    "This was a disappointment, but the course is likely stronger when taught by David.",
    "This is a great course and may provide practical methods in cost-effectiveness analysis.",
    "Introductory course to decision thinking and cost-effectiveness analysis.",
    "No. I would not wish the collective stress and frustration on any person.",
    "I really enjoyed the course topic and think that cost-effectiveness in healthcare is an extremely relevant topic that all public health students should understand. I would recommend it to another student interested in this topic, but it takes a lot of self-motivation to teach yourself the material and get meaningful skills from the course.",
    "I will not recommend this class. It is not worth your money, unless you are taking extremely overwhelming classes and you wish to have a class that looks good on your transcript but you can manage to pass without having to go to class. Unfortunately I believe this class if taught by Professor Paltiel, is a very good one. But this is certainly NOT my experience with this class.",
    "I recommend it! Good class.",
    "This is a tough course - it really is like learning a new language. You'll wrack your brain to no end but will emerge a sharper thinker. Reach out for help a soon as you can or you'll find yourself overwhelmed and stumped when exams arrive. Good luck.",
    "don't take it with Dr. Kumar. Take it with the original professor. He has really good reviews.",
    "Overall the course was definitely challenging, but not impossible. The course will definitely take a significant amount of time and I would encourage those who take it to ask questions early on. The material at the beginning is essential to the understanding of the rest of the course. However, I definitely have come out of this course learning a lot about CE Analysis. However, i did not have any prior exposure to the subject prior to taking the course which may also influence how I felt about the amount of knowledge i gained coming out of it.",
    "Do not take it. It will be a waste of your tuition, unless it is required, then wait until some other professor teaches it, because you will only be left frustrated and you won't learn anything!",
    "An excellent introduction to the topic of quantifying and evaluating risk, very useful for making decisions on the micro and macro levels of public health.",
    "I wish I had taken it last year with David Paltiel.",
    "not good, can't tell you what i learned. And no, not with the current professor.",
    "Would definitely recommend this course"
