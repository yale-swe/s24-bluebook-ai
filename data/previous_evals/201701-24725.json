   "comments": [
    "I was able to be experiment with the digital humanities, which was a fun and different way of learning from other courses I've taken. I also enjoyed the many diverse out of class experiences we had, like visiting the Yale Art Gallery to see prints and paintings, and visiting the Peabody Museum. I gained a really new perspective on the national parks and the role of art history in relation to them.",
    "Critical reading and understanding of visual culture that shaped and continues to shape public imaginary of the National Public Parks",
    "Art history, bridging academic\/historic research and visual representstuon",
    "I learned a lot about the National Parks Service. I also learned, more generally, how to apply a wide variety of backgrounds to an image. I learned a lot about the history, science, and traditional imagery of the National Parks.",
    "This class really made me think about the national parks in a different way-- I learned a lot about analyzing from historical\/specifically art history viewpoints. The material was really interesting and it was great to be in a seminar with a mix of art history majors as well as people who had never taken an art history class before.",
    "I learned how to think about privilege in spaces we traditionally believe to be open to all. I also learned a lot about how to reconcile tricky organizational histories with current agendas. I think I understand much better how to analyze the function of objects in the imaginations of the people they were presented to.",
    "Art historical skills centered around object analysis in the first half of the course mainly. Writing and discussions in the second half of the course mainly focused more on social, political, historical, and environmental connections, drawing implications for land use from visual culture."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The creativity offered with assignments for the course website, the chance to get to know and interact with my peers, and the trips\/guest lecturers we had made this course one of the best I've ever taken at Yale. It was unique, challenging, eye-opening, and the most balanced course I've had in the narratives and opinions it offered.",
    "The course was very strong in its activities and varied learning opportunities. I perhaps would have liked better readings, as they weren't amazing every week. I also would have liked to be able to spend more time talking about certain topics rather than switching themes each week.",
    "The course took on an interdisciplinary approach at understanding notions of visual culture, and everyone coming in with different backgrounds was able to find their own niche and voice in the class, but in my opinion, the first half of the semester was truncated with dense factual history.",
    "Professor was strength. And resources",
    "The strength of this class is Monica Bravo. Her enthusiasm and knowledge for the subject matter propelled us through some dense readings and difficult concept. Every day in class felt fresh and exciting, a testament to her creative approach to collaborative learning. Though the diversity of approaches we considered was exciting and had its own merits, I think this class could be improved as an art history class by a more narrow approach. Sometimes, I felt that the art got lost in the shuffle of the immense amount of history, policy, and scientific inquiry that we considered as well. Again: these materials were in their own right very exciting and academically relevant, but meant that we didn't spend as much time on the art.",
    "The best part of this course was the hands-on parts of the class! Visits to the art gallery and the museum makes things so much more fun and enjoyable in the learning process.",
    "The only weakness was at times the organization of the course, because it only met once a week sometimes it felt like there were massive jumps in what content was covered week to week (not as much continuity).",
    "Strengths are that you read a lot of academic papers from a bunch of different fields under the common subject of National Parks. It's really interesting to see a history from a bunch of different perspectives art history, ethnographies, primary sources, historical analysis and then have a discussion about them. I also think that going to the YUAG and Peabody really enhances the course by allowing more direct engagement with the periods and objects we covered in the course. I thought weaknesses were mainly that we seemed less and less focused on the art-historical perspective later in the course, and that was something I really enjoyed in the first half of the course.",
    "Great variety of media and sources. Enjoyed the trips to YUAG."

   "comments": [
    "Yes, the subject material is incredibly interesting and manageable",
    "HECK YES. This course will open your mind to things about the parks and this country that you may have never even thought about it. The parks offer such a rich history, but they are also tied up in some extremely complex and extremely relevant contemporary issues that this course tries to address head-on. This course has made me want to pursue some of the work I've done for the class beyond my time here at Yale.",
    "I definitely would!",
    "Incredibly rewarding course!",
    "Yep.",
    "Yes, I would. This was a great seminar for many reasons. The subject matter was exciting and could appeal to students from all majors. The discussions were active, the workload was not overwhelming, and the things we learned were cool.",
    "Absolutely take this course. I have a feeling it will be always be filled with passionate people who love National Parks, art, environmental studies, etc. -- which makes for amazing conversations. Also, Professor Bravo is wonderful -- extremely attentive and invested in her students. This was one of the best classes I have ever taken at Yale!",
    "100%. I really enjoyed this class!",
    "Yes! Whether or not you have visited the National Parks, this course will teach you to interrogate seemingly innocent places like the NPs and connect their present day status to their history. You learn a lot about how to \"see\" artwork through the eyes of another person, or another period and connect how this vision evolved to an imagination of the national landscape. Monica gives detailed and helpful feedback on the written assignments and is very engaged in leading discussion and creating an active, enthusiastic classroom environment. This course totally changed how I think about the outdoors and my place in it.",
    "Yes!! This class is amazing! A fascinating topic, taught by a wonderful and exciting professor.",
    "This is a good and fun course for anyone interested in National Parks, art, and nature."
