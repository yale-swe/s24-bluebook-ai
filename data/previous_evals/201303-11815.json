   "comments": [
    "Yes. Be prepared for a large workload. If you are like me and had minimal painting experience before the class, expect to spend an even larger amount every week, otherwise be lost in mediocrity.",
    "such a satisfying class. a really different way of learning. such a valuable part of my yale education, so glad i took it",
    "Take this class! Although each painting often takes a lot of time, the projects are fun and eye-opening.",
    "Take it! It's fun, relaxing, and very rewarding.",
    "Art 130 is an introduction to painting for students not in the art major, and it essentially works like a survey of all major types of painting. We spent the first few weeks drawing, then introduced ink, then progressed to using acrylic paints and color--after which we moved through each of the following units: still life, interior, landscape, portrait, abstract. In looking ahead to the end of the course, I was incredibly daunted by the abstract unit, but by the end I was basically itching for it; the course gets you to where you need to be to begin approaching that kind of painting. It was also a crash course in art history; for each unit, our professors took us on a tour of the major paintings in that discipline in the art gallery or the British museum. This was a really incredible (and unexpected) perk. I've never studied art history, but I can't imagine a better way to do than in a course like this. Our class developed a rich and intimate dynamic for evaluating and understanding paintings (after many long crits) and it was incredible to get to reproduce that process of organic discussion while in the gallery discussing, say, Picasso. Our professors never approached a painting from the perspective of \"this is what this painting is, and means;\" rather, they would give us a sense of the context of the work and the concerns of the painter and then let us loose to do that analytical work ourselves, as a group. In sum, this class was incredible--if you're interested in painting and can see yourself being invested in this course, then I would absolutely recommend it. The workload was manageable. Generally our biggest assignments (one or two or a series of paintings) were assigned over a weekend, though occasionally we did have paintings assigned Tuesday and due Thursday. This class does get expensive, though; you pay a materials fee in the beginning that, for my class, ran out about halfway through, at which point we were responsible for buying our own materials. But I loved the class, and having a studio to which you have 24\/7 access is an amazing perk!",
    "The class is divided into several discrete projects that grow in complexity. We started with grayscale still lifes, then progressed to color landscapes, then color portraits, and then incorporated new materials in abstract paintings. Overall, the assignments are enjoyable, relaxing, but also fairly time-consuming. Might be a good class to take Credit\/D.",
    "Take it as a way of relaxing but expect to spend time, both frustrating and rewarding, working.",
    "A decent art class if you want one, but be warned that it is a decent amount of work. Since the class met on Tuesdays and Thursdays, I often found myself rushing to finish some paintings assigned on Tuesday that were due for Thursday. I would say it's a great experience to have (as this was technically my first art class at Yale) but I would suggest taking it when you have a lighter workload. I often found myself wishing I could have more time to spend on the paintings or drawings. But, overall, it was nice to have some work that was different from psets, or papers, or studying. Munro and James are both helpful and are generallywilling to talk with you about any issues you're having. Just know that crits (critiques of artwork you have produced) can become a little harsh, but generally if you show improvement over time, you'll be fine.",
    "Absolutely. You can't skate by in this course - it requires you to spend at least 4 hours per week outside of class producing artwork, sometimes MUCH more, but it's worth it. A fantastic way to access a different part of your brain as a fifth class.",
    "Very good introductory course. Ultimately, I would have preferred if the class had focused more on learning basic skills, rather than doing innovative projects: I wanted a class on how to paint, rather than how to be an artist. Good class to take credit\/d. Definitely a lot of work.",
    "Art 130 is a great class for non-art majors--and a great introduction to art in general. Everyone at Yale should take an art class at some point and this is a great alternative or addition to basic drawing.",
    "Great!",
    "I would. It's an extremely helpful class. It helps you to gain basic painting skills and helps you release yourself from a rigid way of painting. Doesn't need any experience.",
    "Yes wholeheartedly- assignments did not take out too much time and critiques were very productive.",
    "Great class! You gain a hobby that you'll have for life while learning a lot about art analysis. The studio is accessible at all hours of the day, so it's easy to find comfortable times to complete assignments, which do require a lot of effort and attention. Critiques can be boring and class time is often unproductive, but overall the course is definitively worthwhile, if you're willing to put in the effort. Be warned- the \"Materials Fee of $75\" is a joke. You often have to go to Hulls yourself and purchase paints, canvases, etc., easily reaching a total of $200 by the end of the semester, if you're thrifty.",
    "This was one of the best classes I've ever taken at Yale. As it is non-art majors only, there is no pressure as to how \"good\" your projects turn out - it's truly all based on personal improvement and growth.Munro is also an amazing professor, always patient, helpful, and insightful."
