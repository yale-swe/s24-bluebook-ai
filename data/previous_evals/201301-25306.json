    "Much better than L3. Hw is not graded as harshly but exams can be tricky. Basically the same thing but with more emphasis on orals and oral activites. If you did fine in L3, you'll be fine in L4 even if your speaking is sub par.",
    "Its okay, take it if you need to",
    "Most people take this to satisfy a language requirement. If you aren't, then you have already invested a fair amount of time into this language and want to do this instead of needing to do it.",
    "This course is a lot of busy work.",
    "I would recommend this class, as it solidifies knowledge of Spanish grammar; however it is not much different from Spanish 130. Spanish 130 and Spanish 140 have a very similar, if not the same structure. I would recommend really making an effort speak during class as verbal skills are very important skills to develop before advancing to Spanish 150.",
    "Yes. Definitely improves your spanish and the workload is reasonable besides exams every friday"
