    "GMAN 160 is an advanced german class for anyone, who would like to look into some real texts. Instead of worrying too much about grammar this class really forces the students to use and become comfortable with German. On top of that the classroom material is incredibly interesting.",
    "I definitely recommend GMAN160! I'm not a German Studies major, but I wanted to keep up my German skills. This class was a fun and interesting way to do that. Theresa is a great professor and she makes the class engaging and manageable for students. Just be warned that the Final Project is very time consuming and that you probably will procrastinate and not work on it until two weeks before the deadline. Try to do as much research throughout the semester as possible and get feedback from Theresa whenever possible.",
    "Although I did not take any German courses at Yale prior to this one, I believe that this course can be a great transition from a classical language course to an experience that puts more emphasis on practicing conversation skills, while learning how to analyze and discuss both everyday and complex academic topics. This course is a very good way to learn a lot about an important part of German history and culture in an enjoyable way, while gaining more experience in expressing more complex thoughts and arguments than is required in L1 to L5 courses. I would highly recommend this course to another student."
