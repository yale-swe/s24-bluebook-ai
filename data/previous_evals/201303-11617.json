   "comments": [
    "This is a great way to immerse yourself in evolutionary history and learn the tools needed for evolutionary problem solving. It is fun and manageable.",
    "This is not by any measure a gut science credit. Professor Vrba is a well-known figure in her field and is immensely knowledgeable, and will expect you to absorb a wealth of evolutionary theory concepts that can go quite in-depth. She says that you don't need to take notes in class, but the midterm and final (which are the only two grades in this class) are based mostly on the slides that she shows in class. If you're interested in the subject, then I would definitely recommend this class; otherwise, it's probably not worth the trek up to the top of Science Hill twice a week.",
    "This is a class for those who are interested in evolution and different aspects of it. Take really good notes on the slides and study a lot for the tests. Overall it's an interesting course.",
    "This class is a lot more \"evolutionary theory\" than \"paleontology.\" I really enjoyed it, but if you're looking for any hands-on experience or applied knowledge, this is not the class for you. Very theoretical, but very interesting.",
    "Paleontology is a fun class. You'll learn a lot about many different subjects - we covered dating, speciation, and the tree of life, to name a few. There's also a surprising amount of philosophy, ex. in terms of what it means for a species to evolve\/become a new species. Professor Vrba likes to talk about those issues, and I found it really interesting. There is a LOT of material, though, and it's hard to tell whether or not you really understand it because there's just a midterm and a final (no other assignments except reading, so it's good if you like that type of thing)."
