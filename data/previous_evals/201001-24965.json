    "Take it only if you are VERY interested in cells, and if you are ready to make this class your priority.",
    "The course had a lot of material covered in a short amount of time. But overall, it was a good course in that I learned a ton! The weekly quizzes as painful as they sound I feel were much better than a midterm. They helped to loads of material seem more manageable.",
    "This class covers a lot of content in fine detail. Studying for the final is going to be hell. It's a lot of material, but you don't actually have to know much of the specific details to do well on the quizzes. Grading is pretty generous, i think. And i learned things about the cell that i didn't know, even after completing most of the MCDB major.",
    "Hard, lots of work, but totally worth taking. I learned a ton of material",
    "If you are already interested in the material yes. If you are pre-med and need a bio, no. Take something easier",
    "Main tip: don't read the textbook. Just cold-call the lecture handouts (which are wonderful) and you'll be fine. Lack of a midterm makes up for the weekly quizzes. By the end of the class, you will have learned a LOT. Great!",
    "I would recommend Cell Bio if you're either very interested in biology or are required to take this course. There is a vast amount of information covered at a quick rate, with much reading to keep up with. The weekly quizzes make it necessary to keep up with the material. However, the provided lecture notes are helpful.",
    "I would recommend this class. It is a good bio course (probably one of the best I've taken at Yale) and it covers a wide range of topics in great detail, but it's surprising how much information you retain at the end. Some people hate the weekly quizzes, but they are great because they force you to review the material each week, and so by the time the final exam comes around, you already have a good knowledge of all of the material.",
    "I would definitely not take this class if you can avoid it. I liked Biochemistry a lot better than this class actually. Just way too much information. The quizzes keep you up to date with the material, and were generally easy, but they got to be a huge pain to study for every single week. The final is cumulative (40+ chapters in the book) so it's going to be painful. Just too much information",
    "quiz format is nice (no midterms.. but studying for a quiz each week is a lot of work).. but overall, i would not recommend this class unless you're actually interested in the biology of cells",
    "Absolutely! It is a ton of work, but the material is everything you ever might want to know: how we see, smell, how the heart beats, how memories are made, how muscles contract... a very worthwhile class.",
    "Take this class if you want to learn bio and learn it well. It's a lot of work but definitely worth it.",
    "12 weekly quizzes (drop the bottom 3) and a final. Quizzes are graded hard. Lectures are boring and pretty much a waste of time. The class is fine, and you learn a lot of material.",
    "Cell bio is definitely a challenging class. I took it just to get a taste of something that was taught by a Sterling Professor and I was not disappointed. I would recommend this class to other students, but be prepared to give up a large chunk of every weekend to this class if you don't want to pull all-nighters every Monday night.",
    "Good course, it's required for the biology major. It's just you have to keep up with the work all the time for the weekly quizzes (the final's a pain since it covers everything)",
    "Intense amounts of work with somewhat stressful weekly quizzes each week, but definitely worth it. Pollard and Crews are excellent lectures, and Horsley was okay, but a decent way to cover a surprisingly large amount of course material. It's only as I'm studying for the final that I realize how much I learned. This class definitely renewed my love for biology, and is well-taught and solid. Covers a good scope of cell bio, although makes AP Bio look like a joke, although I wish I could take it again just because it took me a while to figure out how to best study. The class atmosphere isn't the best -- a lot of really intense premeds -- but definitely worth the work and effort.",
    "Yes, especially if you're pre med",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. Pretty much work, but you learn a lot, and it's really interesting material. Easily my favorite this semester.",
    "MCDB 205 is a good course if you are considering being premed. You learn so much, which can feel overwhelming at times with all the material being covered. Instead of midterms, however, there are weekly quizzes, which help to break all the material into smaller chunks. The hardest part is getting up early and making it up science hill to take a 9am quiz every Tuesday, but I do think it's better than having midterms. In the end you take a final which is pretty much just composed of 6-7 quizzes stapled to each other. Pollard and a couple of other professors divide the lectures up amongst themselves so teaching style changes up a bit throughout. Pollard is very knowledgeable about the material (he wrote the book!) and is shows in lecture.",
    "i would recommend this class if you are at all interested in cell biology. i didn't really think i was coming into it, but i shopped the class and ended up really liking it. the workload is not very difficult, you basically spend the day before the quiz studying and then do nothing else for the class. you really do learn a lot though.",
    "This class is required for the MCDB major so you may not have a choice of whether to take it or not. There are quizzes every Tuesday so Monday nights are always rough. But it's nice because it forces you to learn everything over the semester instead of right before the final. Overall, this was an interesting class. You really end up learning a ton of information.",
    "A great course. It's hard sometimes to get up for an hour and 15 minute lecture at 9 AM, but for anybody interested in bio it covers a lot of really important information. Craig Crews and Tom Pollard are great lecturers, although I understand that Tom Pollard will not be doing the class after this year.",
    "You should take this class. If you are looking to take this or Molecular Biology, this class will be a lot more work, but totally worth it. Your knowledge of biology increases significantly and all the time you spent studying for the Tuesday quizzes will make you a better scientist. If you are premed, this course isn't required but you should still take it.",
    "Take MCDB if you have any interest in Cell Biology. The course is not easy, but it is not the hardest thing you will ever do in your life. If you put in consistent effort, you will have decently consistent results. I really loved the course, and would take it again.",
    "This is really great class, and I definitely recommend it. You learn an incredible amount of interesting material, Pollard is wonderful, and the format of the class is not at all overwhelming.",
    "Yes",
    "Only take it if you need to, it's not an easy course but you do learn a lot.",
    "This was a great class where you learn an incredible amount of material. However take this advice: DO NOT BOTHER READING THE TEXTBOOK unless there are topics you don't understand from the notes. Otherwise, the class hand-outs are all you need to read\/study for this class.",
    "take it if you need it, it was a pretty dull class, just straight up bio reading and memorizing",
    "You will learn a LOT, and it's really interesting material, but the quizzes WILL CONSUME YOUR MONDAY NIGHTS. Start early in studying, like over the weekend. The final isn't too bad; I just wish I did better on the quizzes. The curve is HIGH \u0097\u00a0you need 9's and 10's on the quizzes to get an A.",
    "MCDB 205 is a very rewarding and worthwhile course to take. Students will find the material to be at once familiar, new, and challenging. Students must dedicate a lot of time to Cell Bio every week, especially for the weekly quizzes. The quizzes are the key to making sure you study to keep up with the material.",
    "A great class! Very useful, organized ideally, I learned a lot of information that will be highly applicable in my future!",
    "I would recommend this class highly. Cell biology is very interesting, and the professors are excited to teach you about the subject. It's a lot of work--especially Monday nights spent studying for the weekly Tuesday quizes that last for 15 minutes. It's difficult material, but the TAs and fellow students are there to help you through it. It's amazing how much biology you learn when you look back at the end of the semester. Definitely worth it!",
    "Great class, once you take this class, you can actually understand most current biology research papers. too many pre-meds there though, which made for a killer curve.",
    "This was one of my favorite classes at Yale thus far (I just finished freshman year). The cell biological material is so interesting and engaging, and the class really deepened my appreciation of biology and taught me how to think intuitively about biology. My impression of biology was that it was all about boring rote memorization. But the questions asked on the quizzes we had each week really forced me to think about the information in new ways. The questions were challenging, in a nice and fun sort of way. The quizzes were definitely necessary, too, or else I definitely would not have kept up with the course material and would have suffered...horribly. At first, the quizzes were difficult for me, but then I got to be very good at them. The fact that three quizzes are dropped is very helpful, because it does take time to get adjusted to the course.The TAs are all awesome. And, though most people say otherwise, Valerie Horsley was my favorite lecturer of the three. She made the material very easy to master by reducing them to certain general themes, and pointing out big picture ideas so that we could conceptualize the information, rather than simply memorizing it.The material of the course is just so interesting and wonderful. I hope other MCDB courses at Yale measure up to Cell Biology.",
    "This class is a good comprehensive introduction to cell biology. It's a steady stream of work because of the weekly quizzes, but is actually a good system because you have to keep up with the reading. I really enjoyed this class.",
    "a very rigorous course, very fast paced.probably not a good idea to take with a heavy course load.a lot of reading, quiz every week.but you learn a lot and the professors (especially Professor Pollard) makes you really love the subject. they really want you to learn as much as you can, enjoy the course, and not worry about your grade so much.overall, a great course. one of the best i have taken.",
    "Take it if you want to acquire the vocabulary for further biology study. It is rough and you gotta keep up with the material and memorize to the point that your brain hurts. Otherwise, if you're not pre-med, don't really like science, hate memorization, don't take it.",
    "Very interesting cell class. Very recommended. The curve is not really there since a lot of premeds take it but it's worth it.TAs are very good too :)",
    "Yes, be prepared to study a lot and stay on top of things. Do the readings in advance to really understand, not (just) memorize the materials. Questions on the quizzes and especially the final exam are conceptual and require understanding beyond memorizing details, and linking multiple concepts together.",
    "MCDB 205 goes through every major system in the cell (45 chapters worth of material) in one semester. Take this course if you're really interested incell biology and if you're willing to spend a lot of time reading and studying for weekly quizzes.",
    "Pretty difficult class, moves very fast and a ton of material - keeps you focused entire time. Need to keep up otherwise you will be left behind. You learn a lot, though, so it's more or less worth it.",
    "Cell Bio is a great course. You cover a lot of material very quickly, but because the lectures, handouts, book, and section are all pretty helpful, it's definitely manageable - and it's very worth it, because at the end you have learned so much useful, interesting material. We don't go into a whole lot of depth, but I think that's necessary given the breadth of the material - you basically get a fairly rigorous overview of cell biology.In terms of the organization of the course, it's basically a quiz once a week (12 quizzes, with the 3 lowest grades dropped - the 9 leftover quizzes count for 60% of your grade) plus a final at the end (40% of your grade). It's really not bad at all, and you learn so much material - it's definitely worth your time.",
    "I would not recommend this class. I did well on the quizzes, so my issue is not with the grading. Before I took this class, all I heard were great things and how it was an amazing class and you learned so much. It is true that you learn a lot, but that is because you have weekly quizzes on a ton of material, so you go home and learn it because you don't want to fail. Other than Crews' lectures, when i looked back at the powerpoints I really couldn't remember what went on in class that day. The lectures were boring and not well taught. only about half the class even came on thursdays and a good number of people would leave after the quiz on tuesdays. The book is very detailed, and adds an understanding only if you already have a basic grasp of the information. If you are looking at this, then you probably need cell bio for your major\/premed, so you can take it. It isn't a killer class, but it just wasn't what I was expecting given what I had heard.",
    "This class is time consuming. Taking this class meant doing less work for organic chemistry (cell bio took precedence over it because of how much time it takes). Your other classes will be sacrificed.",
    "This course teaches a lot of biology in a short period of time.",
    "Cell biology was a terrific course with a thorough treatment of all of the most important topics in understanding the functioning of the cell. There's a ton of material that must be learned, but the professors understand this and due a lot to facilitate student learning and maintain parity in the testing. Weekly quizzes are a great strategy to prevent burnout of the material and really prepare you for the final (no midterms). Pollard is a terrific professor and knows the material incredibly well as he wrote the textbook for the course. Crews was alright, but Horsley was awful. Hopefully they'll get someone else to teach those lectures. In summary, if you have any interest in biology at the cellular level, take this course. It's really enjoyable and you learn a ton, with many interesting directions for your own outside research.",
    "Overall, this class was a good introductory course to cell biology; I will take all of this knowledge for the MCAT and later on in medical school; studying for the final was PAINFUL...even though I studied a crazy amount every week for each quiz...it is easy to forget details. But study from the packets for the final and read along with the book every week.",
    "Be prepared to learn about cells, for that is what you do in Cell bio. Great class. Probably most fantastic one I've taken here at Yale. You learn so much about cells. go through 1000 pages of material. There're weekly quizzes (Tuesday morning), be prepared to spend 3 hours each Monday night studying in prep (3 hours is sufficient to go over and comprehend your notes). So much material, but it's doable, especially how the course is structured--you're forced to keep up with the material. The profs are good--Horsley, Crews, and Pollard (who wrote the book, so he's like an encyclopedia of knowledge). Take it if you like cells, and why wouldn't you like cells? They're cool. If you have no interest in cells or connecting cellular processes to multicellular organismal function, then don't take this course, obviously.",
    "Strongly recommended. It takes some time to get adjusted to the format of the course. It will certainly keep you busy. Strengths include: the diversity and depth of material covered, the knowledgeable professors, the stimulating review questions, and section. Weaknesses include: spelling and basic grammar mistakes in the course packet, the extraordinarily fast-pace of the first three lectures of the course (try not to get discouraged). I believe this course is \"do-able\" for keen freshman, and it will put them one year ahead in the major",
    "Excellent introduction to cell bio. Introduces biological concepts along with the research methods used to discover them. This class will revolutionize the way you think about biology and science in general. Be prepared to put two solid nights of studying per week for the quizzes and brace for incredible amount of material on the final, though.",
    "As a freshman with only an AP Biology background, MCDB 205 was an intense but very rewarding experience. The beginning of the semester was a little tough as we flew through the \"background\" information that we were assumed to already know. It felt almost like being placed in an immersion language class. At the beginning of the semester there were so many terms flying all over the place that I had never heard before, but by the end of the semester, they were all second nature. In studying for the final, it was really nice to see how all of the information I had learned during the course came together. Concepts that made little sense at the beginning of the semester finally seemed so clear. The weekly quizzes can be tough and a bit of a pain to study for, but they are definitely a good thing. They force you to stay on top of the information. In the beginning they seemed tough, but as the semester goes on and you get used to them and figure out the best way to study, they get a lot easier. The lectures are generally very interesting and engaging. If you're willing to put in the work, then MCDB 205 will be a great experience.",
    "This class is a very fast-paced, reading-heavy lecture course that covers everything you could ever want to know about the cell. Each lecture covered 2 chapters, on average, and that means by the end of the semester the class has gone through 45 out of 46 of the chapters in the textbook. There are weekly quizzes that cover the material of the past two lectures. I really liked the set-up because it ensures that you don't get too behind on your studying and there is no huge midterm to stress over. You'll put in a lot of work, but you'll come out knowing an amazing amount about cell bio.",
    "Take it if you need it (includes Premed)!",
    "The course is probably one of the better biology lecture courses. The weekly quiz system allows all the information to be processed in smaller more easily digestible pieces, and is a much better system than the midterm exams used by most other lecture courses. The material can feel overwhelming near the beginning, but over time the course becomes much easier because previous material makes later material more understandable and easier to handle. I highly recommend this course.",
    "This is the best taught course in the MCDB department. There are no midterms or no problem sets but there are weekly quizes and a final. It's a lot of information to learn but it is well taught and I feel like I've retained most of it after the class. I absolutely recommend this class.",
    "Great course!! I went in thinking 'I'm going to DIE with Cell Bio and Orgo' but it worked out fine. ALOT of material, but the weekly quizzes were a blessing: the material builds on itself, and constant review cemented it into my mind so studying for the final wasn't too bad. You grow to love the material.",
    "Definitely take this class! The professors are great lecturers, and you will really attain understanding of how the cell functions. Lots of detail, but you become immersed in it.",
    "Cell Bio is a fast paced survey of major topics in cellular biology. As an MB&B major I was frustrated by our sometimes shallow investigation of many topics, but when you're covering this much ground in a semester you just can't learn everything on a molecular detail. At any rate, I definitely suggest this course to any biology major. It gives you the basis you need to put scientific papers and many concepts that you will investigate in other classes into proper context. But be prepared to work hard to keep up!",
    "I would recommend MCDB205 to another student because you learn a lot. However, the weekly exams covering several chapters and some hundreds of pages is time-consuming and the exams are hard so be wary of taking multiple hard courses.",
    "A LOT OF WORK. so much to cover in very little time. the weekly quizzes were challenging but helpful in the end to learn the material.",
    "I would recommend this class. You learn a lot and is very interesting and the material is tied together very well. It is a lot of work.",
    "Don't take this class unless you want to kill yourself with work. It's way more work than you expect. Your entire week will be consumed with reading the textbook and preparing for the weekly quizzes - you can forget about any social life. And the amount of material you need to memorize for the final is nervous breakdown-worthy. AND DO NOT, UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES, TAKE THIS CLASS CONCURRENTLY WITH ORGANIC CHEMISTRY. You will hate your life beyond belief; I guarantee it will be your worst semester at Yale. It was for me.",
    "It's a lot of workkkkkk but you get a lot out of the class at the end of it. Work hard.",
    "I initially only took this course to prove to myself that I was smart. If you are like me, then you are probably a freshman who feels really confident in biology and wants to challenge yourself. My simple answer is to absolutely do it. This course was not nearly as difficult as many people made it out to be, and completing the course without simultaneously having to do orgo is--in my opinion--a huge plus. Take the course your freshman year that way you can devote the requisite time to this course without having it disproportionately affect your grades.Cell biology is not difficult at all. Do not be intimidated because the course lectures are easy to understand once you get into the full swing of things. Also, be sure that you pay attention to the objectives. Those--much more so than the review questions at the end of each lecture packet--are the most indicative of the quiz questions.A fun thing to do is to read some research papers at the beginning and at the end of this course. If you learned the material sufficiently, you will find that things that previously were esoteric are simple to you.",
    "It is a good course. If you have the time to commit to the class take it. If you don't have the time, it will be hard to get a lot from the class.",
    "It's a lot of work, but the weekly quizzes are manageable and you end up learning a lot about cell biology and really lay the foundation for further study in biology. Don't be discouraged by the workload and take this course!",
    "Great for non-MCDB students interested in human physiology.",
    "This class is excellent. The weekly Tuesday morning quizzes are 60% of your final grade, easy, and you can drop three of them. This takes a lot of stress off for the final, but commits you to Monday night studying. There are lots of pre-meds, but I really wasn't that impressed with them.",
    "Great course! The quizzes are surprisingly manageable and way better than having midterms. The material and lectures are fascinating. The book is a little overly detailed. I would suggest going to class then just using the book as a reference.",
    "YOU WILL LEARN SO MUCH IN THIS CLASS!!! It's incredible and I enjoyed it so much because of this. As a potential pre-med biology major, it was absolutely fascinating to learn about processes that are essential to how we smell, see, recover from wounds, etc. It's not just a cell biology class but a mix of biology and physiology as well.This course covered a range of topics, which I truly appreciated since it was nice to get an overview of all the different fields. I also really liked how we learned about ways that biological processes can go wrong and lead to diseases\/cancer. Finally, the handouts were a great resource that helped make the material manageable. You will love this class if you want to go into medicine.That being said, watch out for the quizzes - they happen on Tuesdays every week (plan your schedule accordingly). They are great since they allow you to keep up on the material, and you can drop 3. At the same time, though they are 60% of your grade. Try to be as clear as possible in your answers, and mention a process if you think its relevant. Sometimes I would stay too close to the question and have points taken off even though I had been thinking about the connected process but hadn't actually written it down.",
    "Very intense class, but you'll learn a lot. You really have to keep up with the course, because it moves extremely fast and you learn a great deal of information each week. Probably more intense than orgo! (although some people might argue otherwise). But if you are an MCDB major you have to take it, this or Dev bio, and I heard not so great things about dev bio. But if you put the work into this class, you'll come out knowing a lot and feel good about yourself. The course is well taught and well organized. Class handouts are most useful so make sure to learn the information they contain.",
    "I would recommend this course to a student very interested in MCDB. However, one should recognize that this course isvery intense and covers a lot of information.",
    "Cell Bio is an excellent course. It covers so much and really requires application, dedication, and perseverance from the aspiring bio student--arguably too much so, sometimes, but so be it. It is the trial by fire for the MCDB major, and it's really quite fine. The format of the class, with a quiz every Tuesday, is very demanding but also ideal in view of the breadth and often depth of the course material. It is daunting to study for the final, but it would be even more so if the class had three traditional midterms. The scores would definitely be terrible if the class had midterms. For the most part, the lecturers were good, although Tom Pollard was clearly the most enthusiastic--the kind of contagious enthusiasm that tends to spread to students and make them excited and willing to study a not easy subject. The handouts he made were extremely helpful and succinct as well. Be ready to work hard, but you will be able to understand basically any bio journal article once you have taken this course.",
    "Great course, but stay on top of it from the BEGINNING! Be prepared to spend Monday night preparing for the quiz, and to put in 6-8 hours studying for each one if you want to do really well. Also, don't worry about studying lectures, worksheet, and book for the quizzes. I just studied the worksheets and supplemented with the book when I didn't understand something. Eventually, I stopped going to every single lecture, as I found it better to study. Also, make sure to leave enough time to study for the final. It takes days. Overall, though, a fantastic foundation in cell bio. Good Luck!!!",
    "I would recommend cell bio. I feel like I really learned a lot. It was a really fast paced course, but there is no other way to cover all that material.",
    "Cell bio is awesome. It's so well organized - you are quizzed on two lectures worth of material at a time, so you only really need to ever have two lectures worth of things memorized. Also, you are actually more tested on your ability to understand and think about the information, not just memorize it. All the lectures were great. As an MBB major, I found the information to be extremely interesting. Awesome course.",
    "This is a great course, but it is a lot of information in very little time. A very fast paced course, but if you're willing to keep up, it's fascinating and you learn an incredible amount.",
    "I'd definitely recommend this class. Cell Bio is a really important class for anyone considering a major in Bio or even anyone interested in science. We learn so much over the course of the semester and it's all taught in a very well-organized and logical way. Despite the large size of the class, the handouts provide a lot of help as do the TA sessions so it doesn't feel too impersonal. Also, the textbook reading isn't too bad as long as you learn to skim.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student and would even recommend to just get it over freshman year. Yes, it's a ton of work, but at the end of the day, it's extremely manageable. The material really isn't extremely challenging in itself; it's just the amount of it that can get overwhelming. It seems daunting, but when you get through it, it's definitely worth it. If you stay on top of the material, the quizzes really aren't too bad at all \u0097 and by the end of the course, you really do come out with such a great understanding of biology.",
    "Don't take this class if you don't have to or if the subject matter does not appeal to you. It is cell biology. That's really all that can be said.",
    "Cell Bio is a class that overviews all topics relevant to cells and biology generally. It is a demanding, but very forgiving class that will reward hard work and appropriate determination. Weekly quizzes are a bit stressful but are much better than midterms. Additionally, the ability to drop the three lowest grades was greatly appreciated. I took this class as a junior, but I regret that I had not taken it sooner. I highly recommend the class before Biochemistry.",
    "The material is really interesting, and I highly recommend taking it! You control how much work you do: some people do all the readings while others study from the packets, but one thing is for certain - you will learn a lot from this course. Also, don't be intimidated by the weekly quizzes; as I was told in the first few weeks of the class, \"the hardest part about the quizzes is waking up to take them.\"",
    "Cell Bio is a great course for anyone interested in biology. I came in with only MBB 300 as my biology experience (I never took the AP, MCDB 120 or 200), and did not find it too difficult. You cover pretty much everything in the cell, and it gives a good background for any other biology courses you might take. I did not find the work to be any more than other courses, but it is very important to have a good study group. Instead of problem sets, you prepare for a weekly quiz, but the quizzes themselves aren't too hard.",
    "Take it. You will get a great preparation in cell biology.",
    "I would recommend that you take it because you would learn so much (and you wouldn't realize it at the time) by the end of the term.",
    "The material covered, good professors (Professor Pollard in particular), and style of the course (weekly quizzes) make for an interesting class that stands out and pedagogically works well for most people. If you are looking for an easy Sc, this may not be your best choice as it is filled with Bio majors as a required class, but if you're into biology and want something interesting as a Credit-D, I would recommend the course - you may also just want to sit in on the lectures and listen to Professor Pollard if you have time.",
    "Take it. It's a lot of work but it's definitely worth it.",
    "MCDB 205 is an extremely well-taught, well-structured, thorough, and comprehensive introduction to cell biology. Pollard, Crews, and Horsley are all capable and effective lecturers, and the content in each lecture is provided both as a PowerPoint and as a handout for every lecture, listing objectives and review questions as well as all the main points from the lecture, in outline form. The method of grading is superb; every Tuesday there is a 10-minute quiz, in which you select one of two free-response questions covering the material from the previous Tuesday's lecture and the Thursday before that. At the end of the semester, your three lowest quizzes are dropped, and the remaining quizzes together count for 60 percent of your final grade; the final exam (composed of the same type of free-response questions) comprises the other 40 percent. The quiz format ensures that you stay on top of the reading and the material, which is critical. The lectures are extremely thorough and comprehensive, but it can be difficult to pay attention, in which case you must do the reading and study the handouts in order to do well on each quiz. Because of the lack of problem sets or midterms, your time outside class is primarily spent doing the reading and reviewing the lectures. Be prepared to devote a significant amount of time to the reading and the handouts, however: the course covers 44 of the 45 chapters in the textbook (which Pollard wrote), and if you want to do well on the quizzes, you should expect to dedicate every Monday afternoon and evening throughout the semester to cramming for the following morning's quiz. That said, the grading scheme is pretty fair, and the ability to choose one of two questions and drop your three lowest grades gives you a lot of nice flexibility.",
    "I think Cell Bio is a great class, and I would definitely recommend it to students that are looking to learn a lot, but also put in a lot of time and effort to do so. It reminded my why I love science.",
    "This class was great, really tough but great!",
    "This class was very difficult. I took it as a BME pre-req and I prbly should have taken another bio class before it.",
    "Cell Bio is a thorough and interesting class and I would definitely recommend it to all bio majors",
    "Definitely take this course if you're at all interested in biology! I saw on an evaluation from last year that after taking this course, you'll be able to understand most biology papers, and I think that's a good way to describe what you'll learn. This course goes in depth on a lot of topics, but the way it's set up, with a quiz every week, makes it manageable - much better than it would be to have to cram all that information into a couple exams throughout the semester. It's clear what you need to know from the lecture handouts, but reading the book is helpful.",
    "I would recommend this course if you are ready to learn and study a lot.",
    "It's pretty much as everyone says it is. Weekly quizzes and a final. Do well on the quizzes early on, it will pay off later in the semester.",
    "A great biology course which really gets into the heart of all that makes us run. It provides an extremely solid foundation for the science courses we'll be taking in the future as science majors and throws just enough at you so as to make you realize how much you must know, but is run by Professors and TAs who understand the overwhelming nature of the material and are there to guide you along the way. The weekly quizzes were the most stressful 10 minutes of every week, but you'll survive.",
    "I would say if you don't have to take it for a major, you probably shouldnt take it. If you are looking for a biology credit for premed, only take this one if you are SERIOUSLY into this stuff. I was only somewhat into it, and it was a struggle for me to get through.",
    "Probably if you are looking at this class you are either a bio major or pre-med and thus will take it regardless of what I tell you. I'm neither so taking this class was probably a dumb idea: be warned. The weekly quizzes are helpful because otherwise there's no way I'd've ever learned the material during the semester, but you still have to take a quiz every Tuesday at NINE AM which kind of makes the rest of your week suck. And then trying to learn all of the information again for the final is a pain. BUT if you must take cell bio, this is probably a good cell bio class to take, because it is the only one.",
    "I feel like I've learned a lot about the cell and all the materials we've covered neatly come together by the end of the class. Definitely take the class if you are going on to study in biology-related areas. The class may seem overwhelming at the beginning but as long as you plan your time wisely and study well for each quiz, you can surely succeed in the class. Backgrounds in biochemistry will also help a lot.",
    "Unless you have a broad biology background, you may get lost in the material. It is a lot to process in ashort time and you are not given a lot of help. Be prepared to be an independent learner. That being said, it really is important information and can be interesting if you are able to enjoy it because you are prepared for it.",
    "The pace was intense, the 9:00 a.m. lectures dry, the atmosphere competitive, and you end up learning a lot. I don\u0092t know how long I\u0092ll remember all those numbers and letters of the sometimes arbitrarily named molecules, but I certainly will retain my greater understanding and appreciation for the fundamental processes of the cell and greater literacy for reading dense science papers as well.",
    "Lots of work! That said, it's not difficult in the sense that if u study the material, you will do well in the course. Also, it takes a while to get a sense of the quizzes - figure out which study method works best for you etc. - so don't panic if the first few quizzes are sort of all over the place in terms of grades. You will settle into pattern soon!For me personally, this is what I did to study for quizzes: looked over packet outline with my lecture notes (added info from lec notes into outline). then looked in txtbook to clarify anything in the packet outline that I didn't get (I did NOT read the whole txt book). Then I sat and wrote out answers to objectives& review qs. This is tedious, but really helped me remember the info& was a great resource to review while studying for the final. But everyone has a different method!",
    "Take it. Cell Biology is a great course. You'll learn so much. I really enjoyed taking it this year. The material is fascinating- I'm pre-med, and not only did I learn about cell biology, I learned about how it relates to so many different diseases, which made the material so much more interesting for me. The professors, especially Professor Pollard and Professor Crews, are great. Don't be scared away by the weekly quizes. Yes, they keep you on your toes, but they also help to make sure you don't fall behind. Also, weekly quizes mean no midterms.",
    "Take it if you're genuinely interested in biology - you'll get a ton out of it! Also, be patient and know that it will take time to learn how you best study for the quizzes and learn the information. Don't spend an inordinate amount of time studying - if you know the class notes well, you will do well on the quizzes.",
    "I would recommend this course for any bio major or premed student. In order to completely digest the lectures, you need to keep up with the readings though.",
    "A 10 minute quiz every tuesday; lot's of memorizing; fun if you love biology, but difficult nonetheless, no sugarcoating it.",
    "YES! Great course! The weekly quizzes were really a great way to learn the information! I get very nervous on long tests and I felt very relaxed every week coming into the quizzes because I felt they could show what I really knew. The information was fascinating and interesting and the quizzes really allowed you, for the most part, to retain theinformation for the final exam! Overall, it was great! I really enjoyed the course!!!!",
    "ABSOLUTELY TAKE THIS CLASS. I loved it. It is difficult, and requires that you put forth a steady amount of effort. I'm not a superb student at Yale, but I think I got a lot out of this class and probably made a fairly good grade. There is no curve. So if you know your stuff, then you'll do well. I like the weekly quiz format. Much easier than cramming for a midterm. The final though, will be difficult if you don't have a good long term memory.",
    "Definitely take this course if you are considering a future in any field of biological science. Be prepared for the massive work load.",
    "Cell bio was a good overall review of the topic; some people say it overlaps a lot with MBB biochemistry, but I found it helpful in learning pathways and looking at the structure and functions of the eukaryotic cell overall. Case in point: Soon after the final I was talking with a professor at the med school and I was able to have a dialogue with him about several important pathways covered in this course. All the material thrown at you is actually the essential, basic knowledge one needs to know in a cell biology lab. I'd recommend this class just for that. Otherwise the quizzes are a bit annoying but better than cramming for a midterm (though you still cram for the final).Also don't read the book unless you want further clarification of the material. The handouts and powerpoints are enough.",
    "Good class overall"
