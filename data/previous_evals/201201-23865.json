    "Failed to fill a gap in our education",
    "I think that this course could really be improved in the future. This class was really a psychology methods course, which is not relevant for all SBS students. The purpose of the class readings was not entirely clear, since we spend so much time in other classes (especially Epi II) reading articles and discussing methodologies. Also, many of the articles assigned - especially at the beginning of the semester - were quite old and I found this frustrating because I think we should be reading up-to-date studies. The class project was not helpful, because the professor really did all of the work for us (HSC application, writing the survey, doing the analysis). A small group project may have been more useful so that we could have the experience of actually doing some of these things, without letting the project take over the whole semester. I would have liked to have spent more time doing SPSS analysis, however, it wasn't helpful to spend such a short amount of time on this. In order to really feel comfortable with SPSS we would need more exposure. Finally, it would have been helpful if there had been a midterm evaluation for the course so that student could give feedback in an anonymousway before the end of the semester.",
    "Because this class is a first both for Joan and in this format I'm going to list mostly weaknesses and give constructive feedback.-The website is poorly organized. It should be organized into topics with sub folders (main topics: group readings\/homework, prospectus, lecture notes, class research project, etc)-There is too much busy work in this class, it feels as though there are far too many objectives and the class is going in too many directions. With the group readings, the random homework assignments, the final prospectus, the group research project there are far too many things happening. This might be improved by refining the focus of the class perhaps focusing just on the class research project and using that to learn about various research methods. The research project could even be done in small groups (3-4 students) who design their own project and do their own write up and data analysis.-The syllabus was changed far too frequently, I think this was simply a result of inexperience but it is incredibly confusing to figure out when things are due when there are 10 different versions of the syllabus.-The class was really focused on psychological research and methods. Most of the examples used in class and frequently the papers had psychological implications rather than public health implications. I would like to see a larger focus on public health.-Joan needed to add a midterm evaluation so she could learn more about what the class likes and doesn't like. Students can be very helpful but I'm not willing to give suggestions unsolicited.-Nearly all of the graded items were graded right at the end of the semester (prospectus, final, participation grade, and the last of the short writing assignments), I was only sure of about 20% of my overall grade before that. It would be good to let students know how they're doing before the last two or three weeks of the class. Let students know what their participation grade is going to be, have students turn in the short writing assignments earlier in the semester (if possible).-The grading system isn't listed on the syllabus, I'm assuming that it is the same as most of the rest of public health (90+ H, 80-89 HP, etc), but it should be listed on the syllabus.-This class required a lot of printing and that means a lot of money spent on printing. Sometimes this was necessary, but other times it really wasn't. When we went over the group readings in class I felt it was unnecessary to have a printed copy of each article. It might be easier for us to all post them on the website and then we can each access them from the website, if individuals want to print them out they can, but forcing all of the student to print out papers that most students throw away seems wasteful.-The way this semester was set up there was very little information covered in the second half of the semester. I think when I counted there were maybe 2 or 3 lectures after the midterm. I am not sure that was enough to have a full final exam, especially when there was a final and a paper due at the end of the semester. Either split the information up better between the first and second half of the semester or don't have a final exam.-Both the midterm and thefinal didn't seem directly related to the course or to what the majority of the time spent in and out of class was spent on.-There didn't seem to be any themes in the course, it felt very random and the topics are very disconnected to one another.I think this class has the potential to fill a hole in the curriculum, however, in its current format there wasn't very much new information, it was too focused on psychology and not public health and there is a lot of room for improvement.",
    "Strengths:- Very comprehensive overview of basic research methods- Nice variety in terms of class sessions - lots of different opportunities to speak, and a good combination of discussion and lectureWeaknesses:- Too many assignments - seemed like some of them were just busy work; there were lots of different threads of projects going on, and I think the class could be strengthened with a more direct focus on one project (e.g. the group project, the final project), with the content focused on developing the project- The class \"timeline\" wasn't always clear - at times, it was difficult to understand exactly what the expectations were, and the constant changing\/updating was a little off-putting- Seemed quite psychology focused - although this is not necessarily terribly, given that the class does focus on SBS, I'm not sure I understand the \"interdisciplinary\" label",
    "The class went well.",
    "reviewed in dept on some topics that are not covered in the other foundation courses; however much of the material was repetitive from other classes.the syllabus was kind of all over the place-- we had weekly assignments, a class project, and our own project all going on at once. the class project of going through the processes of developing a research project was a good idea, but the way it was executed was not in a way that helped the student troubleshoot issues and develop new skills.the weekly readings and discussions were interesting topics but the presentations in class were a waste of time (reading off paper)",
    "The largest weakness of this course was the organization. I know this was Dr. Monin's first time teaching the course, but I will admit both the syllabus and the different assignments were frustrating. I could tell that she wanted to touch on a lot of subjects during the semester but I would have rather delved more deeply into a few than trying to cover a wide range of topics. For instance, the survey of psychological research could have been better weaved into the class project, with perhaps a final research paper due at the end instead of due throughout the semester. I'm not exactly sure how the syllabus would look but I would imagine greater fusion. I personally felt like my brain was scattered all over the place during this course, and I was just going through the motions to get it done.",
    "This class was alright. Gave a good overview of research methods that could be used. Good to have us do the prospectus. but doing an entire other research project, i do not know how beneficial it was. most students by this time have already written one. Using spss was valuable.",
    "The course definitely helped us see a new perspective on research. Analyzing and discussing articles was a good way to examine research methods in the context of pertinent health\/psychology issues.",
    "I wasn't sure what the purpose of the course was since it did not fill in any gaps that weren't already covered by Epi. The course was very much Psychology focused and I have no interest in Psychology so it made it difficult for me to see the applicability of the course. In addition it was poorly organized. The syllabus was changed about four times throughout the semester, and there were too many assignments due. I wish there would have been a midterm evaluation too. I think it would be nice if the course focused more on qualitative research since we cover a ton of quantitative research and analysis in Epi and biostats and data management. I think it is necessary for SBS people to have a better background in qualitative research\/analysis since no course that I know of covers this so far.",
    "Strengths: Comprehensive.Weaknesses: I don't think that the assignments& work involved in this course were appropriate for a graduate level research methods course. Most (if not all) students have taken psychology courses in college& understood the basic principles of research. The exams were not appropriate for a 500 level graduate course. I believe that this course had too many components (group readings& critiques, class project w\/paper, individual prospectus, written midterm& final exam, and lectures) to make any one really helpful in understanding interdisciplinary research methods. I think that the class should include either a more developed prospectus OR one small (not the entire class) group project that actually involves more thorough development of the research plan and learning SPSS instead of simply following the instructions of the professor. Dr. Monin was always very thorough, but she did far too much of the work because of limited time. I wasn't able to really synthesize the methodology of our \"class project\" because I ended up just following the instructions that she outlined. During the first half of the course the readings were primarily focused on psychology research and did not have a public health focus. This was very frustrating to me& other students. I think that it is an easy (and necessary) fix. The readings did get better as the semester progressed, but overall instead of interdisciplinary research methods this course seemed more like a collection of individual research methods modules. This may actually be the intention of the course, but I didn't find it particularly useful in an MPH program.",
    "I enjoyed this class, discussions, and the course material. Sometimes, however, the class seemed more like an experimental psych class and needed to be applied more to public health. Additionally, the course website needs to be better organized."

It was a pleasure to be introduced to her work and her interests.I did feel like she took some things personally. I really like her, the course was just poorly organized. I believe some of my classmates were a little hurtful in showing their displeasure with it.",

    "Instructor: Joan Monin \u00a0Dr. Monin was very receptive to feedback and facilitated good class discussions.",
    "Instructor: Joan Monin \u00a0The professor is approachable, but is a bit too friendly with students at times. She had a lot of interesting information and background work.",
    "Instructor: Joan Monin \u00a0Dr. Monin was very thorough in the course, however, this was sometimes to a fault. The short nature of the semester long course resulted in Dr. Monin completing a lot of the work so that we could replicate her findings. I think that eliminating some of the course components, like the exams, could enable students to concentrate on learning more about the intricacies of survey development and SPSS analysis (useful skills that we don't get in other YSPH classes).Dr. Monin was very knowledgeable about her field and the research. Her lectures were clear& helpful. She will be a great professor, but that development will only come if she is able to challenge students in a graduate program. Good start to the class, but the course needs to be tweaked a bit.",
    "Instructor: Joan Monin \u00a0Dr. Monin is very easy to talk to and responds quickly to emails. Her lectures were clearly organized and interesting."
