    "Strengths: really helpful information, goes over a lot of material Weaknesses: A TF would've been helpful to answer some of the homework questions",
    "Interesting and clear lecturers",
    "Strength: walk through all the aspects one need to know for intro Stata, well structured lecture No weakness",
    "No weakness. Best class to learn about data management and STATA skills.",
    "Justin is a fantastic lecturer. He is incredibly engaging, clear, patient, and thoughtful about how he structures the class. I learned so much in every class period, and Justin is also very generous with his time and helpful over email and in office hours. I have never actively looked forward to a statistics course in my life but I was always happy to go to class. The course also felt very practical. All of the data management skills we learned were very applied and will translate to a variety of situations. I also generally learned a lot about structuring a research project and how to go about using data to answer a policy question.",
    "Prof. Thomas is a very engaging teacher and makes students able to pay attention and learn what would otherwise be very dry material. The material learned in class felt very applicable. This class desperately needed a TA! Prof. Thomas tried to respond to all student questions about the problem sets, but it would have been helpful to have someone else to go to for help.",
    "I would prefer to continue having problem sets because I learn so much from them. I wish they had not stopped so early, because it means I didn't get to practice several classes' worth of material"

   "comments": [
    "Yes if the student is interested in STATA. I had previous experience using STATA but still learned a lot. The class is also unbelievably fun, given the technical matter it teaches.",
    "Yes, very helpful course if you are looking to learn Stata!",
    "Yes. Very useful if you want work as an RA or data analyst after graduation.",
    "Yes. Very helpful for someone who want to use stata to deal with the data",
    "Yes. If you have learned STATA in the past, this class will solidify your knowledge for job use.",
    "I would recommend this class to another student without hesitation. Anyone who is interested in working with data to answer research questions, whether in a government or corporate setting, would benefit from this course. I feel well equipped to learn more sophisticated statistics and other statistics software packages after taking this class. I am so grateful that I was able to take it.",
    "Yes - you get out of it what you put in. The opportunity to work on a big self-directed project is great, but it's important to figure out what you're going to do early in the semester",
    "Yes, most useful course I've ever taken"
