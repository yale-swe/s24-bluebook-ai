   "comments": [
    "I would recommend if you are willing to go to every lecture and spend a lot of time in class and in section. Its a course were the work load is very chopped up, good in some ways bad in others.",
    "This class was decent. I ONLY took it because I had to fulfill a science credit and thought this might be he least painful way to do it, and at least 90% of the class were (like me) upperclassmen and non-science majors who had to get that pesky science out of the way somehow.This course is pretty easy. There are readings, but as long as you go to lecture, you don't have to do them. The tests are surprisingly hard, considering how easy the rest of the class is; they focus much more heavily on the nitty-gritty molecular science than the rest of the class does, and they were actually pretty difficult. In terms of actual classwork\/time commitment, though, it's a joke.Overall, probably the least painful way to fulfill a science credit. If you like science, do NOT take this, it's all humanities majors looking for a gut.Sections are a complete waste of time, too. You just discuss articles that have nothing to do with the lectures.",
    "I really disliked this course. The fact that it is an \"Issues Approach\" is extremely misleading because the vast majority ofthe subject material is strictly scientific. The theoretical issues aspect only seems to comprise a smaller portion of the course and a VERY minimal part of the exams. The exams were all straight biology. Paper at the end of the term is really simple.",
    "Decent science credit for the non-science major, but as someone who has a genuine interest in bio-ethics, I found that the lack of engaging lectures prevented the fascinating material from reaching its exciting potential.",
    "It is a good class.",
    "I didn't love it. I also didn't give it much attention.",
    "A class in which you don't learn too much until you get interested in the material. Getting interested in it is a bit tough given the fact that it is covered so superficially.",
    "Easy. Low work load. Not really as much of a \"controversial issues\" course as the course listing makes it seem.",
    "An accessible biology course that highlights controversial social and ethical issues. I would definitely recommend the course without reservation.",
    "If you're willing to actually study and learn some real science, this is as interesting a science course as a non-major can take. It's not easy, but it's also not too hard if you go to class (there are no required readings, just lecture), pay attention, and study before the tests. If you found high school science anything less than painful, you'll findthis class interesting, since it's science connected to interesting real-world issues (climate change, cloning, agriculture and genetically modified foods, brain diseases and disorders, among others). And if you study, you'll do alright.",
    "interesting class and a good way to satisfy your science requirement. the only problem is that the test averages are too high because most kids in the class have already covered the material. it is assumed that no biology has been taken but many students have in fact taken it to a pretty high level",
    "Take it but don't expect to enjoy all the material and don't expect it to be about issues\/bioethics. It is basically all about science - which is cool nonetheless.",
    "A good science credit. Not hard, nor particularly rigorous. I did learn some interesting things.",
    "Great class for non-science majors. The work is manageable, the topics are very interesting, and the professorsdo a good job explaining the underlying science without dumbing things down. We talked about green agriculture, nutrition and food production, microbes, diseases, the brain, and addiction. Exams weren't too bad, and it was nice to have a final paper rather than an exam.",
    "Good course for non-science majors...don't let the tests sneak up on you there is a large amount of material for all three. Start a week in advance. Writeabout something that interests you for the essay...it then becomes very easy.",
    "Definitely take this course if you want a low-commitment science credit. The professors are great and the topics are interesting.",
    "I would recommend this class. It is interesting and not a lot of work. The reading is all pretty much optional. There is a lot of class time, but you have almost no work to do outside of class so it is worth it.",
    "This class is a good mix of fairly easy science and fairly engaging issues for humanities majors looking for a distributional requirement. If you were good at science in high school it will be easy--I took AP Bio, and this class was comparatively a breeze."
