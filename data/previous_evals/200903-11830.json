   "comments": [
    "Spanish L4 is more difficult than Spanish L3. It's manageable, but the tests and grammar are markedly harder.",
    "Take it with Sebastian Diaz. He's the best.",
    "This class is a REPEAT of L2 and L3. I started at L2, and in all honesty, I couldn't tell you the difference between all three. The class is horrible. Its work intensive. the online home works are grade unfairly, and in all honesty, I was bored in class. I could teach it myself. I've had so many problems with the Spanish department in terms of class scheduling, transfer of summer credits, meetings, and frankly, they are the most inefficient people I have worked with. They NEVER respond to my emails and they are slow to return papers, essays, grades, or tests.Sonia Valle is unfit for her position.Sebastian is ok. He is a fun professor. He is flexible but he needs to learn peoples names. He called me a different name halfway through the semester. I took his L3 class last year, he wrote me a letter of recommendation for some study abroad I did over the summer, and took his L4 class. And he STILL had trouble remembering my name. He should also try to return papers back as fast as possible. He picks favorites which is also not a good thing, so get on his good side if you can.",
    "Spanish 140 is a great class. The professor is fantastic, and the work load is not that intense. By taking this class, I have increased my oral proficiency in Spanish as well as my grammar skills. For the beginning part of the year, the grammar was basically a review of what I had learned in AP spanish in high school, but a couple weeks into the second half of the year, we did more advanced grammatical structures. So, this class is a good mix of review and new stuff. Despite the fact that it meets five days a week, this is a great class.",
    "If you want to improve your Spanish, this is probably a good class to take. It is probably more like a high school Spanish class than the Level 5 courses.",
    "I would recomment this course if you want to have a really good background in Spanish grammer before taking L5.",
    "Take it if you want to continue with Spanish. Not much else to say.",
    "It is a solid spanish class. i would recommend it to other students.",
    "Span 140 really helps develop your writing and speaking abilities in Spanish. I would definitely recommend this course to another student as it helped me become a better Spanish speaker.",
    "I thought this was a good class that helped me learn a lot of important Spanish grammar that I didnt realize I didnt know. All of the students in the class are around the same level of Spanish so it creates a good environment for conversations and learning. I would recommend it.",
    "This class is a lot of work, but it will really improve your spanish. There is homework every day, and it's oftentimes busy work. Normally, the level of difficulty of the homework is far below the level of difficulty of exam questions. However, I did see my spanish improve greatly. If you're planning on taking this course, take it with Professor Sebastian Diaz. He's wonderful."
