    "It's required. Take it if you have to.",
    "A broad overview of main methodologies in art historical practice. You learn a lot about art history as a field of study rather than any one piece or time period in particular, but then you use those ideas to apply to whatever type of art you're interested in. It's really engaging, but there is a lot of work.",
    "Well you have to take it if you're a HSAR major, but it was not nearly as bad as I thought it would be. The readings were quite dense, but the discussion and jaunts to the museum were very fun.",
    "I would probably recommend taking it with Rizvi because I love her as a professor and her semester has a smaller work load.",
    "It is required for the major - I wouldn't take it if you aren't an art history major.",
    "Important for Art History majors, possibly taxing but definitely beneficial to Art majors...if you're anyone else who isn't or doesn't plan on being involved in those fields, this won't really be a relevant course for you.",
    "This is a great seminar! It is a lot more philosophical than other art history courses at Yale, but it is a foundational class for anyone interested in pursuing art history. Even though this is a required course for majors, it was quite interesting and very well-taught. Professor Sears was great! The readings were often dense but very necessary and insightful. You will see them pop up everywhere after this class! Don't be afraid to take this class if you aren't an art history major! Everyone had a unique perspective to add to the class, and it was only better because of everyone's different backgrounds. It also progresses quite logically so that no one is ever really behind, no matter how much art history experience that person has."
