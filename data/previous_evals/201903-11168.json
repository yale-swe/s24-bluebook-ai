    "A rapid introduction to some of the greatest literature of all time. We began with the origins of Italian poetry and the poets of the Duecento and Trecento (1200s and 1300s), working our way through the \"Three Crowns\" of Italian literature (Dante, Petrarca, and Boccaccio), the Humanism and Renaissance periods (with authors like Poliziano, Ariosto, and Machiavelli), and ending in the 1500s with Renaissance visual art and the study of female poets. There was also plenty of historical context given for each of these authors and time periods, which I found to be very interesting. I got (a bit) better at digesting and comprehending antiquated written Italian and considerably better at analyzing literature as a whole. My spoken and written Italian also improved with this course.",
    "Through Duecento to the Renaissance I was able to improve my understanding of various masterpieces in Italian literature while also learning how to contextualize and deeply analyze Italian prose and poetry. This not only helped in refining my use of Italian but it was instrumental in the discovery of a new appreciation for the intellectual tradition of this time period.",
    "We learned about a variety of the great literature works and overarching themes in Italian literary history.",
    "I got a lot better at writing in Italian and talking about literature and more complex topics in Italian. I also learned a lot about the historical development of Italian Literature.",
    "Italian literature from its beginning with St. Francis of Assisi to the Renaissance.",
    "Learned so much about Italian authors like Dante, Petrarch, and Boccaccio which I knew a bit about, but also got the chance to learn so much about other authors and engage with new Italian poetry and prose.",
    "Io ho imparato tanto della letteratura italiana, in addizione al migliorare della abilita' italiana. Prima che ho seguito il corso, avevo studiato solo le opere di Dante, e' un poco di Boccaccio e Petrarca. Ma in questo corso mi sono familiarizato con molto di piu', dall'inizio della lingua italiana. Questo era bellissimo."

   "comments": [
    "This is a standard Italian department course in that it is full of strengths. I did not think I would enjoy this course at all coming into the semester, but after four months with such beautiful written works, I now have a great appreciation for classic Italian literature and would like to continue to study it. The assignments are structured perfectly, the assessments are fair, and expectations are always made very clear. My only complaint is that there's just not enough time to adequately cover every author, but that's to be expected from a course that tries to teach in a week what other courses spend an entire semester on.",
    "The course was incredibly strong in building a comprehension of the various intellectual and poetic movements of the 1200s to the Renaissance. The focus on textual analysis guided by our great professor, presentation, and class discussion enabled me to develop a keen understanding of the authors of this period.",
    "This course was fantastic, maybe a little dry at some points unless you're very passionate about Italian history\/literature. We touched on just the right number of authors\/ works. The main strength of this course is Simona - simply the best!",
    "Simona is definitely an amazing teacher who is really passionate about making sure her students learn. The course offers a lot of opportunities for learning and has good writing assignments, both analytical and creative. Sometimes it did feel like we were not going very deep into the texts we were reading, but that makes sense given that they are older Italian texts that take so much effort just to understand.",
    "This class was wonderful!",
    "I really liked the variety of authors we discussed, and the trip to the Beinecke.",
    "I thoroughly enjoyed the course, and I thought it was great that we had a relatively consistent stream of moderately involved homework every week, but no enormous assignments. This was very helpful especially during exam seasons."

   "comments": [
    "Absolutely. This course is fantastic, as is any course you can take with Simona. It is incredible how beautiful the works of early Italian literature are, and even more incredible how foundational they are to so many art forms today. You also get to keep improving your Italian, which is always a good thing.",
    "I would recommend this course to any student who is interested in this time period or who simply wants to be exposed to great Italian literature and the historical, cultural, and social contexts in which it was written.",
    "This course was very interesting and fun, I looked forward to going to it each day. I think my Italian greatly improved, and everything about the course was fair. Simona is the best!!",
    "Yes, absolutely! Simona is lovely. She really cares about her students -- not just about their learning but also their wellbeing. Assignments are very fair and spaced out throughout the semester, so the workload is engaging but not overwhelming.",
    "Simona is a great teacher and the class is definitely structured well. You will definitely come away with a lot of content learned. It isn't the most in-depth class, and you make a lot of shallow dives into texts, but that is to be expected from any survey class.",
    "Yes! It is a very interesting class and the professor is amazing.",
    "Yes!!",
    "I would definitely recommend the course. It's a great way to stay up on your Italian skills, the teacher is a wonderful person, and the workload is not too bad. You pretty much have a few hundred words to write in Italian and maybe 12 or so pages to read each week, but there are no exams at all (though there are some relatively painless quizzes). This constant stream of work is really nice, because it means you have no huge stressful spikes of work."
