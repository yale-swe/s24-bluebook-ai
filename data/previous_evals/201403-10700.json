    "This course was very useful, it really discussed many relevant processes and technologies used in the field.",
    "This is a class for people who want to understand the chemistry behind methods used in biochemistry and chemical biology research. I will definitely recommend this course to my classmates and incoming students.",
    "I would recommend the course. It gave a good overview of the field of chemical biology and provided enough information on each topic to get started with further investigation.",
    "If you haven't had chembio before, go for it. It's very nearly a repetition of my undergrad course though. Wasnt' worth the time for me personally.",
    "interesting class, easy workload, you get out what you put in",
    "This course is a fantastic introduction to Chemical Biology. It provides an excellent overview of the field and the specific tools used. The workload was appropriate and was very helping for learning the concepts. I would enthusiastically recommend this course for anyone in the field of chemistry.",
    "It is a great class, and I would definitely recommend the class to any student.",
    "This is a great class. I offers you a good overview of biochemical techniques. Besides, the load of the course is very flexible. The scope of the exams are well defined.",
    "CHEM 521 is a survey of the field of chemical biology. It covered a wide array of topics, but lacked covering any one in great detail. Current methodology utilized in the field were also covered, and examples from the primary literature were highlighted. A great course for the first- or second-year graduate student or a student new to the field and interested in gaining an overview of topics and methods in chemical biology.",
    "I recommend CHEM 521 to other students, both graduates and undergraduates. The material was interesting and engaging. Testing was reasonable, as well as readings.",
    "Take this course if you are unfamiliar with the applications of chemistry to biology and need a broad exposure to the field."

   "comments": [
    "This course deepen my knowledge of novel technologies that are being used to study chemistry of biological systems.",
    "In this course I learned the mechanisms for a lot of useful experiments. For example, I generally knew what click chemistry was before this class but not how it works. After taking this class, I will be able to design experiments more effectively and be able to troubleshoot because I know these details.",
    "It did not particularly deepen my knowledge of the field of I am interested in, but it did give me a good portrait of what chemical biology is all about.",
    "nature is crazy! this class made me appreciate it. in a way I could understand, without all the crazy enzymatic pathways that made bio unapproachable",
    "I learned an incredible amount from this course. It provided a very solid background for the subject that will be useful as I encounter it throughout my graduate career. While the subject area may not relate directly to my research, this background was essential for my larger chemistry education.",
    "Various topics on chemistry\/biology interface deepened my appreciation of the field chemical biology, and they will be extremely helpful for my graduate career.",
    "This course offers me basic knowledge on a spectrum of biochemical techniques and help train the logic of experimental design. It is a very helpful course for research.",
    "As a first-year graduate student interested in the field of chemical biology this was a great survey course. The coverage of topics central to the field, introduction to primary research, and coverage of methods utilized in the field was perfect for helping me to gain an understanding of the discipline and whether I might be interested in joining a lab that investigates these topics.",
    "Allowed me to see more potential applications of the chemistry that I expect to do."
