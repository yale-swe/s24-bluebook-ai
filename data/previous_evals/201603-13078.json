I also learned how to engage with sociological texts in verbal and written discussion, and to begin formulating my own sociological theories.",

   "comments": [
    "inspiring discussions; high-quality student presentations; a well-selected book list",
    "Meeting in Calhoun made a huge difference, in a positive way. It was a place that made me want to think.",
    "The texts were expertly chosen for this course, as they both built off and refuted each other in ways that were fascinating and elucidated the fundamental tensions and goals of the discipline. They were thus canonical without going unchallenged, furnishing a fundamental knowledge of sociology and an ability to handle this knowledge critically. The writing assignments were also well-spaced and thought out - they led me to reflect deeply on the texts and my own emerging ideas throughout the course in ways that a single final essay wouldn't have allowed. I also appreciated the highly interactive nature of the course. I found it a bit hard personally to engage though in part because I didn't feel well enough in command of the texts and their arguments. This was partly my fault - I could have been more efficient in studying them - but I would suggest that the instructor alerts the students well in advance of the sessions specific parts of the text to become intimately familiar with, and then guide the thrust of the discussion towards unpacking the fundaments of the arguments. As most students were new to the field, our contributions tended to be a bit too aimless and easily critical, and we could probably have used some more focus.",
    "It is quite easy to free ride in this class since it is discussion based. You kind of get out of it whatever you want to get out of it. If you thoughtfully read the texts you will get a lot out of it otherwise you probably won't. As well given that this course is discussion based, if you don't feel comfortable speaking in class others will not benefit as much from your insight. The presentations do some to encourage engagement, but there is probably more that can be done. As well please try to post the recommended sections of texts further in advance, without that the readings can get quite out of hand."
