   "comments": [
    "Cultural and political history surrounding Christianity. Decent lecture. Two papers graded decently fairly. Reading can be selectively completed according to the questions to prepare for section. But staring down the final if you have been barely paying attention could be frightening.",
    "This class looks at the spread of Christianity through the Roman Empire and its encounters. This class focuses more on the history rather than the theology of Christianity.",
    "Not a lot of work until the final when you're slammed with memorization.",
    "I wouldn't recommend it. I really thought I'd find this material interesting and I didn't. So if you're already on the fence about whether you'd find it interesting, save yourself the trouble and don't take it. It's not a bad class by any means, it's just not the most exciting.",
    "nah. just not very interesting.",
    "Yes. This class was good. I really liked the material. Its greatest weakness was that it spent so much time on facts and didn't try to draw nearly any big-picture conclusions. However, I enjoyed learning the facts. If you're not interested in early Christianity, you might not like it that much.",
    "Great! Take it! Well taught and organized and made a subject I knew nothing about very interesting and personal. Davis is one of the best lecturers I've had at Yale. Funny, engaging and made everything very easy to follow and understand. Readings were all primary source documents (except for optional context readings) which complemented lecture material perfectly.",
    "It's one of the most interesting classes I've taken at Yale. If you are interested in Christianity at all, you should take the course.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student if they were very interested in ancient Christianity and ok with some ambiguities in the historical narrative. It's more of a collection of different ideas and controversies and groups that existed in the first centuries CE than an exact narrative.",
    "This is a really good class if you're interested in the subject matter! Sometimes the readings get dense and tangential, and the section sometimes seems unrelated. The course isn't too much work though, and the beginning of the class is really, truly fascinating. Professor Davis is also AWESOME. Totally take it with him!!",
    "The course outlines the beginnings of Christianity and it's rise to dominate the Roman world. Lectures are supplemented by secondary sources and primary readings beginning with different texts from the New Testament. Although the course incorporates a great deal of information, and at times one can definitely feel overwhelmed, I would say the class is really interesting in how it redefines Christianity in showing it's roots. I really recommend this class regardless of your background in history. The class leaves you with a great understanding of a complex religion and it's influence on the ancient world as well as the present.",
    "This was an excellent survey of Ancient Christianity and has been one of the few courses that I looked forward to attending each lecture. Professor Davis made them very engaging and insightful, and he provided excellent organization both in powerpoints and in the course as a whole. The workload was very manageable: a total of two 6-page papers, a final, and about 30 or so pages of reading per week. (I found the primary sources always more interesting than the supplementary commentaries.) I absolutely recommend it to anyone at all interested in the subject matter.",
    "An okay course on the history of Christianity. Definitely learned a lot about the formation of the early church, but the material got a little dry at times. Pretty hard to feel motivated to go to lecture, and section was pretty pointless.",
    "I would recommend it to someone who was interested in the subject. The class was pretty good and covered much of the basic history of the time period. It probably won't blow your mind though.",
    "Lectures are well prepared but papers were frustrating to write as it was unclear what the instructor was looking for.",
    "i think that i ultimately liked this class. it was kind of a strange class-- not what i thought it was going to be at the beginning. we talk about a lot of minor figures in the early church, and so the class has a tendency to feel sort of all over the place and not totally cohesive (as you might imagine from a history class). the lectures also don't really go into depth and the readings are pretty dense (and in my section almost no one had read them). i thought i hadn't really learned anything but then i started to think about it and i actually did learn quite a bit.",
    "This course helped me to gain a new methods of understanding the religion history.",
    "Overall, Christianity from Jesus to Muhammad was not all I was hoping for it to be. This is very much a history class in the sense that you learn about a lot of individual figures and events and read a lot of primary documents, but I didn't come away from the course feeling like I actually understood how the overall movement of Christianity grew and spread and prospered, or what themes led to its success. Be aware that the course is really rooted in history -- there is very little theology involved. Professor Davis is just a really awesome person so I mostly took the class for him, although occasionally lectures could be a little dry. The course consists of two 6-page papers (with fairly critical grading), and one final exam that has IDs and two essays, one of which is pulled word-for-word from weekly reading questions that are discussed in section. Dan was not a good TA but I heard that people liked Sara a lot. There is a fairly substantial amount of weekly reading, but something I wish I'd known before the end of the semester is that you only have to do the reading that relates to the specific questions provided on the syllabus each week -- you won't be tested on the rest of the material. So overall fine class, but not what I was hoping for.",
    "Very fact-rich, hard to distinguish between which info has value and which is just a proper noun. Not a huge emphasis on the ideas at stake, but the 2 papers are good for that purpose."
