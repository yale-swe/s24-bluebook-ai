   "comments": [
    "This is an interesting course that will definitely challenge some of your preconceptions about the Renaissance and the Scientific Revolution. We learned about cool things like magic and alchemy, Wunderkammern, astronomy, and anatomical textbooks, but also about the theoretical epistemological debates about science and knowledge in this period\u0097the changes in how knowledge was produced and acquired and how various scientific disciplines developed. The course also makes great use of the collections at the Beinecke and other libraries. At times I would have liked to have more primary source material for the readings. Courtney was a great TA and ran discussion section beautifully.",
    "I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS CLASS! It wasn't too much work but I learned SO MUCH! It has changed how I think of the sciencesand it has really been such a pleasure.",
    "I loved this class! Professor Bertucci is a very engaging and informative lecturer who, according to the TAs, prepared this class unlike any other HSHM class they've seen before. It was definitely a very special experience, especially since at Yale we have so many primary sources and artifacts to see during our trips to the Beinecke and the Cushing Medical School Library. The TAs, if Heidi and Courtney are still around, were both really great.",
    "If you're struggling to find another Humanities credit, take this course. If you're interested in science or medicine at all, I strongly suggest this course. If you're interested in history, definitely take this course. I was very pleasantly surprised by how good and fun this course was. It's a bit of reading, but nothing more than what to expect from a history course, and probably less. Also, if you take this course, GO TO EVERY LECTURE. The exams are based mostly on lecture material, so you're going to have a hard time if you don't go.",
    "Definitely take it. Fascinating class that really teaches you about how modern science came about. However, unless they change the format next year, beware that it's a lot of work -- dense weekly readings plus 500-word reading responses. But Paola is a kind, amazing teacher, so her instruction alone makes it worth it! Exams were very fair.",
    "I would most definitely recommend the class. Especially if you love history of scienec, its a very fun class.",
    "This is a great course for students of any discipline who want to learn a little bit about the foundations of the Scientific Revolution, and a lot about how knowledge and ways of attaining it have evolved over thecenturies. It is really enjoyable.",
    "Yes, it is a great class but you have to read a lot."
