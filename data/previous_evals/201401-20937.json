    "Current Issues in Biological Science is probably the best science credit at Yale--largely unstructured, self-directed, and if you want to, you can avoid any substantive work at all until the last week of class. You'll have a better experience with the class if you pace yourself and organize your time, though. Also, try to choose a topic which genuinely interests you and allows you to write a reasonably rigorous final paper, but without struggling with complicated scientific concepts beyond your ken.(This happened to a few people writing on topics in neuroscience, for instance.)",
    "Very laid back way to get a science credit if you like doing research and writing a paper, which is what this class is.",
    "If you need a science credit, absolutely take this class! The work load is very light, and the conversation is delightful.",
    "Yes! This is a fantastic science credit for non-science majors. The workload is not backbreaking; you will have informal in-class presentations, one final presentation, and a paper. The seminar style format fosters interesting discussion. What you get out of the course really depends on what you put in. This is a chance to design your own course of study on a topic you like, which is a great opportunity if you're motivated. I suggest that you pick a topic you REALLY care about or find interesting, and do a little bit of research every week. Steady research and an outline made the final paper extremely manageable and rewarding for me. I can say with certainty that the final paper was not something I could have written before taking this class.",
    "You get to pick a science project and then do it",
    "This course is a seminar, and every week students are expected to bring in research that they are working on in view of their final paper. Though not everyone presents each week, it is important to do the research because Professor Summers might call on you. I think this was an amazing way to fulfill my Sc requirement, because there was no work outside the paper I was working on, which was a topic of interest to me. Further, there are no tests (the bane of my academic life) and no outside assignments. It feels like a real and mature way to fulfill the requirement. That said, I could have maybe benefitted from more deadlines earlier in the semester. Also, as others have said, I have no idea what I'm getting I'm this class, and that's a little nerve-racking.",
    "Great opportunity to explore something you're interested in, but haven't had the chance to yet. Again, intensity is really up to you.",
    "This course was fine, it was great to be able to focus on an issue of interest. Very little work - just one paper. However, the lack of any feedback or guidance over the course of the semester made it very difficult to know how I was doing in the course, especially as there is only one paper and Prof Summers wouldn't look at drafts.",
    "A gem of a science credit.",
    "Sure, just be prepared for grading uncertainty.",
