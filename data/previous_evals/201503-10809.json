    "It helps me to know the functions of AAS and NASA, which I otherwise know very little. It has little to do with my dissertation research though.",
    "This seminar showed me a wide range of things to learn as an \"apprentice\" astronomer, ranging from how to get the most out of the resources available to astronomers, to how NASA operates and how to write effective proposals, to even how one's astronomy skills could be applied to working in other industries, should one choose to do so. A pretty comprehensive set of tools for my toolbox!"
