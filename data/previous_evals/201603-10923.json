    "Basic german grammar skills. This class was designed to impart foundational knowledge and in this it was successful.",
    "Having taken this course, I feel that I have a passable grasp of German grammar -- not enough to speak it myself, but enough to recognize grammatical constructions when I see them. A good foundation for future study.",
    "I learned German grammar, gained a vocabulary, and learned many tips on how to effectively translate.",
    "- improved my grammar - significantly bettered my German reading skills, I can read fairly advanced texts now. - developed vocabulary."

   "comments": [
    "Strengths: - Concise teaching of German grammatical concepts - Good practice readings Weaknesses: - More built-in reinforcement for vocabulary and idioms would be good.",
    "The course is very flexible, which I appreciated. The professor makes the course applicable to students who have diverse interests, allowing them to assemble vocabulary lists and translations relevant to each student's field. I think it might be helpful to have vocabulary worksheets to help students solidify certain core vocabulary.",
    "The class text was well designed, and the modules proceeded at a doable rate. There was insufficient emphasis on mastering vocabulary, which lead to some degree of uneven development.",
    "I found in-class practice sentences and the group translation project to be particularly useful. More concentrated exercises in memorizing vocabulary might have been useful, as would more extended translation projects.",
    "Building more vocabulary would be helpful.",
    "The pace of the course was very good, steadily getting more advanced. It is designed so that one gets out of as much as one wants. There is plenty of opportunity to do extra work."

    "Yes. It is useful for those who need to be able to comprehend secondary literature in German.",
    "Absolutely. The course was extremely helpful in learning German grammar and translation skills. It was also fun, and I really enjoyed the class and it inspired me to continue to learn German.",
    "Good, basic intro to German grammar. You'll learn very little vocabulary, but with the help of a dictionary, you'll be able to slowly pick through most German texts. Low workload -- good 5th class.",
    "Yes. For anyone looking to advance their German reading skills, this is an excellent course. It is particularly designed for people with little to no background."
