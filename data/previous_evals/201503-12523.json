    "Profesora Adorno is amazing! She really goes out of her way to get to know everyone in the class. Great course, great readings, great discussions. It almost feels like a seminar. That being said, the readings could be a bit complex\/deep at times, but Profesora Adorno made sure we got the most important parts out of everything. There are reading guides for every lecture so you more or less know what to be prepared to discuss and what the major take-aways from each reading are. As a native speaker, however, the class could seem a bit slow at times. This was my first Spanish class at Yale and I wasn't sure if I was ready for significantly higher upper level classes. Overall, I do think this class was a great way to ease myself into other upper level courses in the department. Most students in the course were not native speakers though, so do not let not being a native speaker stop you from taking it.",
    "It is a good course to fulfill your L5 requirement if you are more interested in discussions of cultural motifs than polishing your upper level language skills. It is a very manageable course if you stay on top of readings and participate in lecture.",
    "Only take this class if you are looking for an easy, but boring, L5 credit. The readings aren't great, lectures are incredibly dry, and I came away from this class feeling as though my knowledge of Latin American cultures increased only slightly and my knowledge of the Spanish language did not improve (and even decreased). Overall, I would not recommend this course.",
    "A very interesting class for people interesting in Latin American studies, culture, history, economics, and politics during the course of the 20th century. Overall, I absolutely loved it.",
    "The class was a bit boring at times, but overall not too difficult if you are trying to fulfill the language requirement. The class provides good general knowledge of Latin American scholarship.",
    "A great class. I took it for my foreign language credit and enjoyed it more rhan I thought I would. Didn't really improve my speaking though.",
    "I would recommend this class to my peers, and indeed I have. It was an engaging class, and I found the material, i.e. cultures of Latin America, to be much more interesting personally than other possible Spanish L5 classes.",
    "It's a great class in which you'll learn about Latin American cultures. The majority of the class will be centered around active participation and interpretation of read texts and assignmentsexpect to be expected to speak up and contribute in class. You'll have a great teacher who's nice and friendly and funny!",
    "Great class. Adorno is awesome. Recommended for kids looking for an L5 Spanish course with a tradeoff of grammar\/vocab for reading\/discussion.",
    "SPAN 247 is a literature course, you'll read a lot of famous texts and learn a lot about all types of latin-american culture. The class size is big, so participating is hard, and many people are very familiar and fluent in Spanish (since it is an L5 course), however it's designed to not be an intimidating course so even if you aren't very comfortable speaking in Spanish, you can still participate and learn to be more comfortable.",
    "This Spanish class covers the fundamentals of Latin American culture, exposing you academically to the distinct societies that span three continents.",
    "This class was very interesting with a manageable amount of work. I would suggest it to any student looking for a way to finish their L5 requirement, or take a manageable 5th class on Latin American Cultures.",
    "The class is a great one to take as an introduction to Spanish at Yale. The knowledge gained and discourse had is exciting, and one can learn a lot. Obviously, it's the kind of class one only gets out what they put in. One needs to keep up with readings and be diligent in work in with the professor and TA to get full benefit of the material. Hat being said, I would highly recommend this class.",
    "I highly recommend this course to anyone who does not know much about Latin America and would like to learn more. The reading material is interesting and Prof. Adorno is a very sweet and engaging professor. The course is also a good way to practice speaking Spanish, as participation is a key component. The workload is also very manageable: readings are never too long and the tests and essays are very fair.",
    "This class is incredible! The reading load is never too much, the lectures are always clear, the exams are fair, and the two paper topics are very workable. Prof. Adorno and Stephanie are wonderful teachers and very accessible. Overall, take this course if you have any interest in learning about Latin America. If you have any background knowledge, however, you will be one giant step ahead of other students.",
    "In this class you read many texts that give various types of insight into the Latin American culture. I would definitely recommend the class. Speaking spanish is very important to me andI have learned that knowing about the culture comes hand in hand with that. The material is interesting and the work is very manageable.",
    "Yes if you want an L5 Spanish course to keep up the language that isn't too difficult; good credit D.",
    "Take this as your first L5 course. Awesome reading list, especially if you're a prospective major in something to do with Latin America and you need a gentle introduction to the most important texts to come from that region. Professor Adorno is a wonderful, caring academic mentor \/ spiritual god-mother figure who any Yale student would benefit from getting to know.",
    "I would definitely recommend it to anyone who feels proficient in Spanish.",
    "I would recommend SPAN 247 to any student that has an L5 level of Spanish or wants to learn more about Latin America. The course is great because you learn Spanish through practice, not simply memorizing rules and words. The course has the right amount of coursework and has a lot of resources at your disposal to understand the course work. The class was overall great and I feel like most students would enjoy the course.",
    "I would recommend this class. I would summarize it as a lecture style course that's still very interactive and a lively introduction to the culture of Latin America from perspectives you would not expect.",
    "Yes! excellent course if you want to improve your spanish or learn more about the subject. Adorno creates a positive environment for students to feel comfortable to practice their spanish. She loves class participation and is passionate and lively about the subjects she teaches. the course focuses on Spanish literature from different cultures and gives historical and other artistic information to deepen student understanding of the culture."
