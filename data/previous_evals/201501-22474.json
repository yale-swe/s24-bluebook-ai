   "comments": [
    "MCDB 200 is a bread and butter course on the central dogma and its various permutations. Professor Pyle is listed as both a chemistry and MCDB professor and this is reflected in her emphasis of the relationship between chemical structure\/mechanism and function. Professor Pyle is a wonderful lecture, clear explainer, and incredible scientist! It's a great class for filling in any gaps left by BIOL 101\/10. Problem sets are pretty straightforward and take probably 3 hours at first, but as you improve at reading primary literature start to take around 90 minutes.",
    "A great summary course. Exams are very challenging and require a lot of studying, but really make sure you understand the material. Pyle is a really wonderful lecturer.",
    "Difficult but not too much work",
    "Absolutely. If you're an MCDB major, I recommend this course. Fantastic class. Cool material. NOTE: This semester, ONLY Professor Pyle taught [She is AMAZING]. I can't speak to Farren Isaacs' teaching abilities.",
    "Take it! learn a lot! its awesome",
    "This is a pretty standard MCDB class. Some topics are more challenging than others. The professor is a big fan of structure, so expect to draw on exams. But all of the structures and topics were in the slides she would upload after class which helped when reviewing.",
    "A pretty good overview of the central dogma. I would compare it to Bio 101 on steroids. There's a lot of material to learn, however the tests aren't cumulative so they are very manageable. Professor Pyle is a very good lecturer and provides various supplementary materials for those of you who don't mind a little extra reading. The class featured more knowledge of chemical mechanisms than I expected, but nothing out of control.",
    "I would only recommend this course to someone who is very interested in molecular and specifically structural biology. There is little focus on much aside from molecular structure and function, so be aware of this going in.",
    "A class in which you learn exclusively about RNA and the various roles it plays int he body. Overall wonderfully taught. The information can be overwhelming and there are definitely more drawings than expected on the exams so be sure to look through all mechanisms carefully",
    "If you like memorizing things and know you'll put the time in, then you will do well in this class. If you like a more concept-based approach to biology, this class will be really annoying because you will find yourself having to study the parts of molecular biology you find least interesting. I've taken better MCDB courses. I also have no clue whether or not they're curving exam scores. Grade is 25% each three non-cumulative midterms (including one during finals period) and weekly primary literature-based homework assignments. If you see yourself succeeding with this format, I'd say go for it.",
    "You should absolutely take this course! I know it's at 9 a.m. and that may sound like the worst thing ever, but it's been the best MCDB class I've taken at Yale. If you're deciding between this and another MCDB core to fulfill major requirements, take this one! Not only is the material applicable to almost every biological science, but the class is extremely well taught. I took it with only Professor Pyle, so I can't comment on Professor Isaacs teaching style. If Professor Pyle is the only person teaching, I wouldn't hesitate on taking it. The exams are extremely fair if you give yourself enough time to study all the material. Also, there's a curve so don't worry!",
    "A lot of work! You learn a lot of valuable fundamental bio information that would be helpful to know before taking other upper level bio courses.",
    "AMAZING CLASS! Take it. Prof. Pyle is a great lecturer, and while the tests are difficult, all the material is in the powerpoints and your class notes. I learned so much!",
    "Overall a great course in Molecular Biology. Anna Pyle is enthusiastic and extremely knowledgable in the subject. Lectures, although painfully early in the morning, were interesting and easy to follow. Attending lecture was not necessary for succeeding in the course, since lecture notes and the textbook covers most of the material, but was a great introduction to the material. Having taken Cell Biology concurrently with this class, I would prefer this class over Cell Biology (the two have very similar material coverage). Exams were also fair and covered only material in the lecture notes (despite what Professor Pyle says and that material in the textbook is also covered), and exams are not cumulative (including the final). The amount of material covered throughout the course was also fair and not overbearing unlike Cell Bio. My main criticism of this class is the section. Sections involve a discussion on the week's problem set, which were a few questions on a research paper relevant to the week's lecture material. I did not find section useful since it was essentially a regurgitation of the questions that everyone already knows the answer to. I would have preferred a short summary of the main points of the research paper and then an extensive review of the week's lectures (sections are on Friday).",
    "Molecular biology was an overall extremely interesting, well-taught, and organized course. Professor Pyle is very knowledgable in a range of topics, and provides foundational concepts as well as more recent findings in the field. The weekly assignments involved answering questions about a scientific paper, which ranged in how easy they were to understand, but overall gave you an insight into current research. The exams are non cumulative, which really gives you the chance to understand a few topics really well at a time. The lectures are well-taught, and the only downside was that they sometimes tried to cover too much information in one lecture.",
    "If you are a biology major, this should be one of your core classes. TAKE IT!!!!",
    "If you like to get into the biochemistry of biology without getting into too many details, take this class. It's a relatively small class so you feel comfortable asking questions in lecture and can also talk with the professor. Take this course especially if you're interested in both biochemistry and biology. Regardless, this is a great way to gain an understanding of what goes on in the cell at a molecular level. It's not too much work, definitely a lot less work than a lot of other MCDB courses. Also, not having a final is a big plus. I would recommend this course.",
    "This is my first upper level biology class, but I thought it was better than most of the Bio101-104 modules. It was taught better and I learned more and more in depth. Anna Pyle is pretty good, although she sort of intimidated me at times. The exams are sort of bitches, but if you read the slides along with the book and memorize things, its ok. The section policy is pretty strict though, and I ended up having some problems, but the TAs were great it making it work. No real psets, just scientific papers to read and answer questions about every week.",
    "I would recommend MCDB 200 to any student interested in pursuing biology research. The course gives a new perspective of the specific mechanisms that govern genetic control, which is vital understanding for all medical and MCDB research.",
    "I can't imagine that there's a huge difference between this class and cell bio in terms of difficulty. You move through quite a bit of material in lectures, and much of it involves knowing a lot of particular mechanisms in detail. There's a lot of material to learn. The upside is that there is no end-of-year final (that would have been a real struggle), however the midterms are long and comprehensive and require a lot of studying. Medians on the midterms are usually low (in the 70s). Unlike in cell bio, there are no weekly quizzes. Instead you have to read and answer questions about a primary research paper -- which in my opinion makes things harder because you have extra work in addition to learning all of the material in lecture. Overall tho, its a good course and you'll definitely learn a lot of important material.",
    "This course is not easy. The exams are very thorough so make sure you learn everything in the slides. Make sure you know how to draw processes and mechanisms. It's a lot of hard work. I suggest you make study guides and start a week and a half in advance: make one little essential guide a day for each lecture and then review these guides before the exam.",
    "This class is very difficult, and very hard to get through. i recommend a background in Organic Chemistry just to help better understand the molecular makeup of most of the things we look at."
