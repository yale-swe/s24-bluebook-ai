    "If you're taking 320 and have time, you should also take this. Overall it's a fair amount of work and a good complement to the lecture. Brett Berke is a great instructor. Most labs last until after 6 PM, especially early in the semester.",
    "It's a good lab, one of the better ones I have taken and I have taken upwards of ten labs. Besides for it going extremely late most weeks, Brett Berke is fantastic and makes the class worth going to. The class itself is not too over demanding like most labs. I enjoyed it more than I enjoyed lecture.",
    "This is far and away the best lab I have taken at Yale. Students get to perform electrophysiological experiments that are rarely done at the undergraduate level. It was a small class with many TAs so students got a lot of personal attention. The course is integrated with the lecture, so there is a real connection between the experiments performed and the lecture material. The experiments improved understanding and appreciation of the lectures and readings. Though the lab was quite long (usually more than 5 hours), it was never boring. I would especially recommend it if Brett Berke is running it.",
    "Yes. I REALLY liked this lab. We got to work with so many different model organisms in interesting ways. The work supplemented what we learned in class in helpful ways also.",
    "Lab course is great. Brett Burke is awesome. Taking the lab helps you understand (or at least helps you remember) some important concepts from the lecture. Some things you get to do:*Shock your lab partner*Dissect out a muscle from the leg of a frog and directly stimulate the nerve to activate the muscle*Poke Drosophila larvae in the eye with a glass electrode tip and be amazed as they stop themselves from crying*Rush down science hill to catch the end of residential college dinnersWe had weekly quizzes, but most of your grade came from the lab notebook. While you don't do theformal lab write ups you do in other lab courses, you summarize your results and try to explain why they were observed, and this process can still be time consuming (although not soul crushing). It really depends on how well you understood the experiment as you were doing it and how organized your notes\/observations are.",
    "This is a great lab but it is really long. It goes until at least 6 or 630 every week. The labs aren't too hard though and they are pretty interesting.",
    "The lab is really interesting, but be prepared for a lot of work during the sessions. The sessions, which may be listed in the registrar as only being three hours long, tend to last almost five hours (unless they change it), so be prepared for a long and grueling session of trial and error. The preparations might not work and things may go wrong, so you may sit there and try to work things out for a few hours. Nonetheless, data sharing is allowed and encouraged.The work outside of class consists of three sets of lab reports to be handed in, which are pretty much weekly reports that get handed in all at once. It is advised that you start early, or you'll be bogged down like most of us were.Still, the lab is one of the more interesting ones, with a lot more hands-on work than most labs, in my opinion. You learn a lot of electrophysiology that includes working with earthworms, grasshoppers, fruit flies, and cockroaches.",
    "neurobio lab, much oscilloscope work, much wires, some dissection, a lot of fiddling around and troubleshooting electrical signals. reasonable workload. instruction is geared towards learning. really. I know, quite surprising for a lab.take it, if you don't mind wires and old oscilloscopes for hours on end.",
    "Recommend, very interesting material; professors are good.",
    "The Yale OCI listed the schedule as 1:30-4:30, but usually the lab ran until 6 or after. The experiments can be long and frustrating at times, but they are also interestingand you to do hands-on recordings of neurons within live specimens. The lab also helped with my understanding of the Neurobiology course.",
    "The lab was long, but it went well with the course. The experiments were fun, and the course was relaxed, which was nice.",
    "If you're willing to dedicate an entire afternoon (and some dinners) for the course, then yes. It was not all too relevant to the lecture course. But you get to do some interesting dissections.",
    "This is a very interesting lab, with a great balance of structured and unstructured labs. You do really interesting activities and record from many different set ups. Helps a lot with understanding concepts in the lecture course. Some dissection involved. Runs longer than the listed time."
