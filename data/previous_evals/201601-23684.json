    "Yes, highly recommended.",
    "This was an interesting course to take. It involves a lot of readings on health intervention efforts on donor and country levels with a particular focus on fiscal analysis, creation of fiscal space, and using cost effectiveness analysis and modeling to select amongst different courses of action. It' strengths were an experienced professor. It could have benefited from more tutorials and hands on experience with modeling software.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class. It is a great combination of modeling and what is possible to be implemented in the real world. It is definitely a class that is relevant for more people than just those interested in global health."

    "Yes this class was directly applicable to my program and goals after school. Pr. Hecht does a great job of teaching a class that is on the cutting edge of the discipline."
