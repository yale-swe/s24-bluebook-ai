   "comments": [
    "This is a course about \"consciousness\" in the novel, meaning the way minds are represented in the novel: the way characters interact with each other or access each other's minds, the way the narrator has access to character's thoughts, a character's own consciousness of his or her thoughts. This is a tough theme but incredibly rewarding as it gets to some crucial issues within these novels and most novels you'll ever read.",
    "I would love to recommend this class, but I have serious restraints after taking it. Prof Yeazell is great, but the context of the course work can be stifling if you're not into it. I thought the books we read were great, but I really wanted to delve into other topics than just Theory of Mind. If you think the topic sounds interesting, take it! If you're really into studying other aspects of literature (for instance, I like to trace gender roles), it might not be your cup of tea. Coursework: One 2-3 page paper. Two 12 page papers. TONS of reading.",
    "Neither a cognitive science approach to mind nor a thorough analysis of mind from an English perspective, expect to read great novels and discuss them in reference to consciousness along with some theory (that on occasion seems a little tenuous).",
    "If you like the books you should definitely take the class.",
    "Professor Yeazell is the best seminar leader Ive ever had. She knows so much, and shes not afraid to be honest about the things she might not be sure on or admitting her mistakes. She also has the incredible ability of taking any comments or questions we ask, and interpret them in a way that deepens it and opens up so many more possibilities. She somehow always gets to the heart of the questions or comments. This is one of the first seminars where I felt like we were really all thinking together,",
    "Ruth Yeazell is simply delightful. ENGL 303 requires a great deal of reading, but Prof Yeazell made it very digestible, even for a non-major like me. Most importantly, this class made me a better reader of literature, more able to see nuance and difference than I had before. I can't recommend this class enough.",
    "This is a great course. Every novel on the syllabus is worth reading, and many of them (Middlemarch, Emma) are books you might not read otherwise. Ruth Yeazell is extremely knowledgeable about all of the texts and authors; she always guided discussion with great ease and gave great input for papers. This course is more work than most: about a novel a week (except in the case of longer novels, which are spread out across two or three weeks). Youll want to do all of the reading so make sure to take this course with the ability and desire to do so. It is convenient but not at all necessary to have read some of the texts in advance, just in case you need to skip out on readings on one week.",
    "This class is wonderful! Professor Yeazell is an absolutely phenomenal seminar leader. She allows for conversational digressions and creative thought while keeping the discussion grounded in a couple passages and through the guidelines for discussion she posits early each class. She doesn't let students run away with the discussion; she intersperses her own extremely incisive and helpful commentary throughout class and makes the seminar the best combination of a collaborative effort and a lecture experience (for lack of a better term). Among many other things, this helped me clarify my own ideas and structure arguments, in class and in papers, in a way I hadn't been able to before.",
    "Definitely take if you are interested in consciousness and narratology! Discussion is fantastic and you discuss the most interesting questions about novels, in my opinion.",
    "ENGL 303 has a lot to offer: a brilliant professor and a stellar reading list. I would certainly recommend the course, with one caveat: it is a class that is focused on reading novels with an extremely tight focus on the portrayal of consciousness, as the title and syllabus suggest. If that's not your cup of tea, you will be frustrated with the course, even if you love the novels more broadly. The reading load and the two papers are substantial, but the work is quite manageable with a bit of planning. In short, if the topic intrigues you, take it!",
    "The texts covered in this class are phenomenal, and \"Consciousness\" is a marvelous lens through which to study them. I would recommend it even or maybe especially if you already have some familiarity with the reading list. Professor Yeazell is wonderful."
