    "should do fewer techniques and more time with each, specifically stone litho and screen printing",
    "I was not enough time for a home work.",
    "The course tried to cover too many printmaking techniques in too short a time. It could be improved by cover fewer techniques in more depth. The print shop could benefit hugely from hiring a full-time technician to keep things organized and provide problem-solving assistance for students trying to work on assignments when the TAs and professor are not present. The shop aides were not successful in this regard."

    "Take this class if you want to learn the techniques!",
    "yeah, especially as a credit\/d",
    "I would recommend this course to another student who is able to work independently and has a strong interest in printmaking. It is not as directed as a course like Basic Drawing, so would not provide as good an introduction to students with little art experience. The techniques (wax transfer, toner transfer, photolithography, stone lithography, collography, screen printing) were all really interesting, but there is not enough time to really go into any of them in great depth. Pedro is a great professor and just a nice guy in general, and the few crits are really relaxed."
