   "comments": [
    "Incredibly well taught course that provided me wonderful skills in ensemble making, nuances in the performance of early music and a great survey of early music history in the US and in Europe.",
    "I developed the ability to perform early music, such as those from the Renaissance time period well. I also was able to learn early notations for music, the basis for the current diatonic scales, and a bit about all of the relevant history to these monuments in music history.",
    "Early repertoire and common themes, quite a bit of history, self-motivation, communication and teamwork.",
    "I learned so much from this class! I learned about a variety of early styles of music (as well as how to sing in those styles); I learned about the instruments used to accompany singers; and I learned an interesting factoid or two about American Puritans and European politics from the 14th-18th centuries. I also improved my choral singing and sight-reading skills, as well as my ability to pronounce Latin, French, German, and Italian in song.",
    "I definitely improved my sight reading through taking this course, and i learned a lot of interesting historical information about composition in the olden days!",
    "You not only learn about the intricacies of performing 16th century to 19th century music, but also learn about the fascinating history that transpired to make all the performed music come to life. Such a blast, and rewarding, challenging, and stimulating as well.",
    "I learned alot more about early music.",
    "I really developed as a musician in this class. My singing improved and my sight-reading developed greatly. I was thrilled to learn about the historical context of our pieces, and Grant did a fantastic job in making them interesting.",
    "good sight-reading skills! Ans some music theory",
    "Very interesting class, learned many knowledge about historical performance practices and cultural\/political background of 14th-17th century music."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "This course has no weaknesses. Fro the experienced musician, this class is a wonderful exposure to music throughout a time period many people do not study.",
    "Caters to the level of the students in the course - because it's an audition-only class, the level is rather high. This applies on both a group and individual basis, as the small class size allows for very individualized instruction. A bit more of a focus on history than the name of the course implies, especially as reflected on exams.",
    "The strengths of this class include the low time commitment\/stress level, the sheer FUN of the class, the quality of the singers and instrumentalists alike, Grant's teaching and wonderful musical arrangements, and performing in the Beinecke (such a beautiful space with such good acoustics!). There aren't too many weaknesses. Perhaps some would appreciate more of a workload or more opportunities to solo, but I truly enjoyed the structure of the class as-is.",
    "This class is a lot of cool historical info and nice music! Fun old instruments too! My favorite was the sackbut",
    "The strengths of this course is that Grant cares so much for his students. There are no weaknesses!!",
    "The course's timing is rough, because mid-afternoon is just when I doze off, so a two hour course right then was really brutal. I love Grant and his teaching-- he gets really excited and just loves his students.",
    "Grant is excellent, and this is a fantastic class for musicians of all levels.",
    "I love the fact that we have access to many wonderful historical instruments! Being able to play and hear them in person and even perform them taught me so many things already."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "YES!",
    "If you are confident but would like to improve your sight-singing skills even more, this is the course you should CERTAINLY take. You should also be confident about performing solos or duets or quartets or trios at the speed you can sight-read them. These are all points from the singer's perspective, but these same skills are also vital for the instrumentalists that are interested in this course. I really can't recommend this class enough (you can also repeat it for credit each semester..)",
    "Absolutely - if you can sight sing and carry a tune, are interested in the historical side of music (but not enough that you want to take a music history class), and enjoy a fun class in which you'll learn a lot and get to perform and eat pizza, this is the place to be.",
    "I would absolutely recommend the class! It is a fun study break, plus you get a credit out of it.",
    "Yes! If you like music you'll LOVE early music",
    "Absolutely take this class! I loved every minute of it! (If you know how to play a musical instrument, that is...!)",
    "I would highly recommend this course to anyone who can carry a pitch or whack a string. Basically this course is like one of the only ensembles you can get credit for at Yale and its a pretty sweet gig, complete with catered concerts and all.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class to any musician. Grant is wonderful and engaging, and for musicians hoping to work on sight-reading, this class is for you! There is a lot of material and the class moves quickly. The music itself was beautiful and dynamic, and Grant loves the historical context and the story the music tells as much as the music itself, which makes the whole experience really worthwhile.",
    "Absolutely!",
    "Yes I would. Many students think this is just old-fashion but don't ever forget that those masters used those instruments and practiced music in certain way when they produce all the masterworks. We definitely need to know all these information and knowledge."
