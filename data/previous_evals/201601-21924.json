    ". With zgen Turkish is definitely not the easy gut class anymore, which it was when Etem was still teaching. If you're looking for a really low-work language class in order to fulfill your requirement or to get some more credits, then don't take it. If you're actually excited about Turkish and are sufficiently motivated to put in the work, taking Turkish with her will be perfect for you. She's incredibly excited about teaching the Turkish language and culture. She puts a lot of work into teaching this class, but she also expects lots of stuff from her students, such as weekly meetings with language tutors, watching Turkish telenovelas, keeping your own Turkish journal, and at least weekly quizzes. Since we changed textbooks after L1 and zgen didn't really know what exactly Etem has covered in the first semester, the class was a little unstructured, but that should be better when taking the full class with zgen. yi anslar!",
    "This course was super chill. At first, following the distress of not having a Turkish teacher anymore due to the passing away of Etem, the class was incredibly based on reviewing, which got a bit boring as time passed. However, it only took Ozgen a couple of weeks to turn out the syllabus and construct a Turkish class that was completely hers. She is really good at incorporating different aspects of Turkish culture into class by requiring us to watch the zesty Turkish Dramas, translating Turkish music, and telling us about her life. She is so sweet yet has an edge to her that makes her very fun to be around. She even invited us to her house to have a traditional Turkish meal! Overall, I feel the instability affected us a lot in the beginning but Ozgen was the best person who could've handled us.",
    "Excellent course, good content, the right amount of work, wonderful introduction to Turkish. Etem was an excellent teacher, and zgen has filled the gap left by his passing superbly. Would recommend to anyone interested in Turkish culture, language, food, or simply anyone looking to start a new and interesting language."
