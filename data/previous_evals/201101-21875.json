    "A great opportunity!",
    "Research for credit, not really a class. There is a paper at the end. Everything depends on your principal investigator and area of research.",
    "475 is what you'd expect. You're probably better off doing 485 so you don't have to present twice or 495 because you're going to spend 20 hours\/week in the lab anyway. The research presentations are not hard but they are miserable and nearly useless for their poor management and oversight.",
    "I would highly recommend this class. It truly gives you the experience of working in the lab. This class would help show what life would be like as a career researcher which I found beneficial.",
    "This is the best \"course\" anyone could ever take! I love research. Although sometimes the number of hours you put into lab work can affect your performance in other classes.",
    "good reasearch experience, do it",
    "You can do research at whatever time is convenient.",
    "It's useful for gaining some laboratory techniques and it would also greatly enhance your knowledge in a certain specific subject.",
    "A great option. Definitely use all your 3 allowed semesters of independent research. Pick your lab well so that it's something that you're interested in. If you're invested in your research, this credit can definitely be fun to earn.",
    "This is a great course to take as a junior to lead into the senior research. I loved it because I have an amazing PI and a very promising project. It generally is pretty time consuming, and I often spent more than 10 hours per week in lab, but I love my lab so it was an overall enjoyable process. The only work you have to submit is a proposal in the beginning and a paper at the end of the semester; the paper part is intense but it's about what you have been doing all semester, so it's nice to see all your work come together."
