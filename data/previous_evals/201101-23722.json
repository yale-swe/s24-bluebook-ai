    "Definitely doable if you just learning Spanish. Just stay on top of your work and you can do well.",
    "Its tough, but helpful",
    "Yes! Take it with Oscar! He's the man.Plus, it's a nice break from other classes of p-sets or papers. You'll definitely learn Spanish if you take this.",
    "Yes.",
    "Even though most people who take the course have to take it, I would still recommend it to fellow students. I am still amazed by how far I've progressed with Spanish after never having taken Spanish before, taking L1, and then taking L2. Spanish 120 is great at giving you a much higher level of Spanish ability even if it is not fluency. Having class everyday does get old, but the homework for Spanish 120 was not very heavy."
