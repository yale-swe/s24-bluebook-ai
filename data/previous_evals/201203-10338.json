    "It's a creative, stimulating, and challenging course, taught by someone whose way of thinking about these questions or really about anything is extraordinary. The course might be intimidating to someone with no background in Caribbean Studies, but Professor Carby is very willing to meet with students during office hours and the blog posts provide a means by which to explore ideas and make the reading dialogue with your interests."
