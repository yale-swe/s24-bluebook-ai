    "Yes - if you want to learn the italian language and become more proficient",
    "Good review of 101\/102. The fact that there is little new grammar material makes it a fun and straightforward class in which you can focus on culture and improving your speaking abilities rather than learning technical things. Definitely take it if you want to continue Italian!",
    "While Italian L3 is a great course, I dont feel it dramatically revolutionized my language speaking ability. Grammatical (and even vocabulary) material covered was mostly, if not entirely, covered in L1 and L2. Furthermore, a greater emphasis on vocabulary would have been helpful, if new grammatical material is not to be covered. If you are going to take the class\/ have to take it, Karen Raizen is definitely your instructor. She has a lot of enthusiasm and creativity and maintains great relationships with her students!",
    "Italian 130 is a great intermediate Italian class. You go into some of the hard grammar a little more than previous years but each tense can always be used in a conversation. We learned a lot about Italian culture too. I would totally recommend this class to another student.",
    "Good class.",
    "This is a great course. It's fun and easy. You do learn a lot of Italian, the class time is much more fun than a regular course because there are speaking and writing exercises and a lot of group work. Karen is also wonderful and super nice, so take it with her if you have a chance. The homework is minimal, and the exams are not very difficult."
