   "comments": [
    "If you have to take it, then do it. I took it because I need Calc for Econ.",
    "If you need to take Math 115, you'd better take it with Casson. He's very organized and presents material very clearly. He's a native English speaker, too, which is always nice. Prof. Casson has made Math 115 my favorite class this semester, and considering how many people complain about the course, that's saying a lot. A word of warning: I think most of the people in my section took calc BC in high school and did well. If you took calc AB in high school, be prepared to compete against people who already learned the material.",
    "it is a hard math course, but with a good TA or professor, a tutor and lot's of help it is do-able.",
    "I would recommend Mathematics 115 with Prof. Casson. He is clear, concise, and patient!",
    "It's your general math class. Pretty dry lectures but that is only to be expected. Casson covers all the material you need to know, so I'd recommend him as a professor.",
    "If you've taken AP Calc BC, go ahead and take this course. If not, be prepared to learn new concepts and do more outside work than others. Though the workload itself is not much (a problem set a week), in order to fully understand the concepts for the exam, you have to get practice outside of the classroom.",
    "this course involves several areas of integration calculus including basic integration techniques and application of these techniques to sequences and series. i would recommend this course because it is more detailed than what i learned in high school. instead of learning shortcuts and equations, i learned the reasoning behind the theories which i found very valuable.",
    "Math 115 is the equivalent of AP Calc BC. The first half of the semester is spent on integrals while the second half is all new material, namely sequences and series. It is a good course to choose after AP Calc AB, but beware, no calculators!",
    "If one is looking to do something that involves math in any way, shape, or form, absolutely.",
    "Math 115 is easy if you have taken AP Calc BC before and understood it. The midterms are a joke and the final is a little harder but you should be able to do well if you do some practice problems. There is only one short problem set a week so the workload is totally manageable. But, only take this class if you absolutely have to. It is boring (really boring) and you could probably read the book and do fine without going to class.",
    "Math 115 is a decent course. At times it was challenging to keep up because a good portion of the class usually has already taken AP Calc BC whereas I only had AB; however, it was manageable. Professor Casson was great--he has a dry but amusing teaching style. Don't be afraid to approach him during office hours--he's easy to contact and patient.",
    "Take it for a QR credit, but if you haven't taken BC, just know 90% of your class already has.",
    "This class is your standard math class- so you'll be doing a lot of brainless integral solving. If you took some form of calculus in high school, you should be okay, but if you're completely new to the subject you'll have to be prepared for fast-paced learning.I wouldn't recommend this course as a fun or interesting course to take, but if you have to take it for your major, there really isn't a choice.",
    "Math 115 essentially covers most, if not all, of the concepts covered in AP Calculus BC (infinite series, polar\/parametric equations, etc.) and reviews some of the basic techniques introduced in Calculus AB (integration, differentiation). Actual problems, however, are more rigorous than those in high school calculus. I would only recommend this course for anyone who needs to take Math 115 for their major\/a pre-professional program. If you are seriously considering taking this course, however, I would highly recommend taking the course with Andrew Casson. While lectures can be quite dry, his lectures are very organized and he is very easy to follow. He also is very helpful one-on-one.",
    "I would say that for an introductory calculus class, it is a little unnecessarily difficult. I had heard that Math120 was incredibly difficult, but from the feedback I got from my friends in 120 versus 115, the testing material in 120 was much less painful than that of 115, and it might have just been in my best interest to have taken 120 instead. If a fellow student really felt that their basic knowledge of calculus isn\u0092t good, then take 115- you will definitely be forced to know the material.",
    "Take this class with Andrew Casson. He taught the material clearly and slowly and other TAs were incoherent and scrambled to cover the material at the end of the semester.",
    "115 is a solid course covering Calc BC. If you take it, definitely try to have Prof. Casson; he's not dynamic, but very sweet and his notes are very clear. Problem sets aren't too bad, and the tests never cover anything that Casson didn't do in class. I would recommend it for your math pre-reqs.",
    "It is a good class to take even if you have taken Calculus BC, because the concepts will be fresh in your mind before taking multivariable, and Math 115 also goes into more depth and looks at more difficult problems than an average Calc BC class would.",
    "If you slacked off in BC, you'll definitely learn what you missed in Math 115. But most of that will be through your own effort, not through lecture.The grading in this class is not easy. I think the average from our first two tests was somewhere around a B\/B- and Professor Casson was fine with that. Partial credit is not awarded generously on tests, to put it lightly.Also, if you're thorough, the weekly assignments can take a surprisingly long time (one of them I think took me like 6 or 7 hours), so be aware of that.It's an okay class, but only take it if you want to learn the material. If you just want an easy review of BC, this is not the class for you. Man up and take 120. Your GPA will probably thank you for it.",
    "It would depend on what kind of math she enjoys. Personally I don't like calculations and application of formulas as much as proofs. But the knowledge of Math 115 is necessary in order to do harder math afterwards.",
    "Only take this class if you have to. It is NOT an easy QR credit.",
    "The course is very difficult if you did not take BC Calculus last year. You also need to work very hard outside class on not using your calculator and recognizing the right methods to use right away in order to save time on exams. The course overall is very difficult. However, if you want to take this course the professor speaks clearly and he is the head of Math 115 so he gives help that other instructors do not.",
    "If you would like a review of the second of BC Calc, I would recommend this course. If you have never taken Calc II, I think you will have to work a little harder than some of your peers b\/c many people are generally familiar with the course. But, if you have already taken Calc II, I would not expect this course to challenge you in any way. Choose the section carefully - I strongly recommend Casson!!!! And then, the class is pretty much what you would expect.",
    "the grading in this class was harsh, as was the curve",
    "The course was difficult for me because I haven't really looked at Math in a while, but it was pretty good."
