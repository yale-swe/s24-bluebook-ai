    "Sometimes the class discussions were diverted by Professor Ashton, so it was hard to stay on topic. The course structure, and key takeaways from each class, were sometimes unclear, especially during the first half.",
    "I very much enjoyed the format of the course, though it heavily relied on the diligence and verbosity of the attending students. When discussions heated up, the class proved great stage for some of the more thoughtful discourse I've been apart of at FES. At other times, for one reason or another, the class dragged a bit. I thought the number of field trips to be appropriate, learning quite a bit on each one. I believe the order could be adjusted a bit, maybe with the taxonomy lessons moved up earlier in the course. Lastly, a quick mention about the guest speakers. I know it's hard to have guests craft a custom deck for where we are in the curriculum, but we might find more meaningful interaction with a roundtable discussion with our guests, rather than the powerpoint presentation of organization intros and high level slides."

    "Structure --I think we should start with an overview of entomology and current forest health issues, and then work our way into the literature analysis. Students need a foundation before moving forward into critical discussion.",
    "It needs to be organized better",
    "Field trips need to be more concise and more closely tied to course material. Student group projects should be done in depth on a topic. A more cohesive syllabus is needed to situate this course among the other forest health disciplines (i.e. this course covers insects\/pathogens, acid deposition, etc. and not invasive plants). Three teachers was a bit excessive since most of the course was student-based discussion. The system, so fondly practiced at F&ES, of reading scientific papers and then awkwardly discussing them for 3 hours can be a waste of time. Instead, reading papers before class, then conducting a field trip or lab or something applied would be much better.",
