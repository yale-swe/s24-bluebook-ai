    "I'd definitely recommend it, but as many other commenters have doubtless said it is hard when the class is very large. We had 20 students, half of whom were graduate students and didn't take the class seriously at all. I think that with a more enthusiastic class (and perhaps smaller?) it would be much better.",
    "If you want to learn anything about conducting, then take it!",
    "Copied and pasted from earlier answers:Strengths: Choice of repertoire, good way to get started conducting.Weaknesses: I could NOT BELIEVE how many classes were cancelled. I know Toshi was sick part of the time and had engagements other times. It frankly doesn't matter. He only offered to meet with us for two half-hour sessions in exchange for missing SIX class sessions, and one of those sessions consisted of just conducting through a piece and getting shooed out the door in fifteen minutes without discussing anything. My parents are paying a ton of money for this education, and Toshi did not take that seriously.Also, it isn't right that School of Music students and seniors should be given top priority in admission to this class. There were plenty of students in the class with a ton of previous conducting experience, who did not need the kind of introductory help that beginners needed, and who frankly stole spots in the class away from the large group of kids who really wanted a spot and have no other way to begin learning conducting. You should not let people into an \"Introduction to Conducting Class\" who already know how to conduct. This class is a waste of their time and of yours if you do. You should prioritize admission for those who really want to learn and need help the most.Finally, there was surprisingly little conducting content in this course. We learned three pieces, and spent a large amount of time going over the interesting musical particulars of each of them, but we missed SO much class time which we could have used to learn SO much more. If you think about it, 6 class sessions is enough to actually add an entire fourth piece to the in class repertoire, or at least to talk about details like ritardando or left hand technique.It is still worth taking this class as a way to get started with conducting, if you have no alternative. Just be aware of how shallow and frustrating Toshi's approach is."
