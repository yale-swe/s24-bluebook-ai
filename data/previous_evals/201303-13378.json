    "I would absolutely recommend this class to other students.",
    "I would strongly recommend this course to other students.",
    "I would recommend the course for grad students early in their career, because of its central concern to identify sociological topics in areas that are neglected by institutionalized sociology. This course touches on a core concern of the social sciences, namely to \"think outside the box\" of institutional boundaries when approaching the social world."

    "Great introduction to iconic materiality! Has laid the foundation for future reading and research on the topic.",
    "This was a wonderfully stimulating course which appeals not only to sociologists but to students from other departments which deal with material culture.",
    "As argued above, I think that this course helps grad students to ask questions and to broaden their interest towards subjects and methods of the humanities, which I think is crucial for sociology in general, not only for cultural sociology."
