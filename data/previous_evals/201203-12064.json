    "I was intimidated by this class at first due to the thorough length of the syllabus, but I shouldn't have been! It's a very interesting course on a topic everyone should study at some point in their college career. Professor Brisman makes each class fascinating by giving you these fascinating critical insights into the text. He has so much knowledge that the class seems like a hybrid between a lecture and a seminar--you do get the opportunity to present your opinions, but he has so much to show you in the text he ends up lecturing most of the time. That format worked well for me. Take it!",
    "You should take this course. Professor Brisman has been teaching it for over 30 years, and you will miss out if he decides to stop teaching it!People often assume that this course is a secular approach to the Bible due to its title as \"The Bible as Literature.\" A more accurate title would perhaps be \"The Bible as A Literature.\" The course focuses on the multivocality in the Bible-- how for any one issue you can find many opposing perspectives. Not a necessarily secular approach.Be aware that this is not a standard seminar. Prof. Brisman leads it in a way that is more like a lecture in that he has a certain vision for the arc of each discussion and leads students through it. If you might find this frustrating, perhaps you shouldn't take the course. I never found it an issue, since Brisman is just a straight up genius. He has a certainly whimsy in his approach that is lovely. And he cares so much about the text, and is very willing to discuss with students outside of class.",
    "Yes! Yes iff you want a backround in the bible, yes if you want to think in a different way, yes if you are looking for a good seminar.",
    "I'm really glad I took this class. It taught me to really examine the motives of the writers of the Bible. It changed the way I view the Bible. Prof. Brisman is a really good discussion leader.",
    "I would definitely recommend the Bible as Lit to other students. I think the size of the seminar was ideal and the way that classes were run (a mixture of lecture and discussion) was conducive to learning a lot while being able to contribute to meaningful discussion. I think that the workload and the distribution for grades was completely fair. Even if you have minimal exposure to the Bible, as long as you put in the time you will get so much from this course.",
    "Yes! I would recommend this course to anybody, regardless of major. The coursework is so unlike anything else you will do at Yale, and Professor Brisman makes the class an amazing experience."
