    "I do think it has deepened my knowledge of sociology. Certainly the divide between quantitative and qualitative research isn't so deep--I think it's just a matter of shifting thinking and being flexible enough to still see the sociology in a more numbers-based approach. I likely won't be doing any statistical analysis in my own dissertation research, but I appreciate learning these skills.",
    "I knew very little of stats prior to entering this class. I still know very little, but I know a lot more than I did. It will certainly help me with my research."
