    "I would recommend this class as John Tully is great and the only Chemistry Sterling professor. However, this class is not a gut. The difficulty ramps up quickly and the class moves fast, covering a lot of material. I have a strong mathematical background but I wasn't able to succeed academically in this class because I tried to treat it as a gut. Thus, if you are looking for a class with zero homework, this is not it, but if you put in the effort, you will likely enjoy it.",
    "Take this class if you're looking for an easy Sc credit and definitely take it if have a high school background in Chemistry.",
    "It provides a good overview of environmental chemistry.",
    "This is a decently easy science credit that also gives you good perspective on energy policy and environmental issues.",
    "It's a great science credit, because you learn& it's not so complicated that you don't understand what's going on.",
    "If you want to know some chem, have NO chem background, and like the current-events\/policy-ey side of environmental stuff, definitely.",
    "Definitely not a gut class, but a fair science credit for non-science majors. If you do the readings and keep up with the slides, you will do well.",
    "This is a course that covers basic chemistry topics about alternative energy. The lecture is a little dry, but the material is intrinsically interesting. Not a bad way to get yourself a SC.",
    "Would not recommend the class. Even if you're interested in the subject material, it's difficult to learn since what's taught doesn't always map to what's tested.For those interested in policy, the basic background in science doesn't help as much as you think it will (although I did learn some useful background material regarding areas I wanted to know more about, particularly electric vehicles, hydrogen fuel cells, and solar cells). But the background is so basic that it just leaves you frustrated and wanting more exploration of the connections to policy.",
    "Good course: relevant topics, cool demos. Tully has a great sense of humor. Often it seems like a good high school chem course, however; likely because it's for non-science majors. If you're looking for science credit that isn't too terribly demanding or in depth, and you have a solid background in high school chem, I'd recommend the course."
