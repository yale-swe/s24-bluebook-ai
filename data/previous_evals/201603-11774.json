   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I think one of the strengths of the course is that it has some of the best minds in Theatre Studies to help solve production problems etc. I think one of the weakness are that the days we have critiques need to be more structured so that executive producers receive more constructive feedback about the production itself rather than the research and theory involved.",
    "There are a number of weaknesses in the course that students have pointed out over several years. In my view, the main one is the fact that, while its main purpose is to supply the academic research and serve as a \"brain trust\", it sometimes becomes an obstacle from achieving that very goal. It detracts from the time seniors could spend (the way the playwrights spend it) on developing the work and putting the research together. The class really doesn't need to be that long, especially during the non-critique sessions. The main strength of the class are the students -- hearing about their experience making the work and reflecting on it is its most valuable asset.",
    "Strengths: Creating a space where seniors can solicit feedback\/thoughts about their senior projects. Weaknesses: I think one of the difficult things about this course is the balance between having it be about the senior projects and having it be about the \"portfolio\" and other things meant to prepare seniors for working in theater beyond Yale. At times, it felt frustrating to have to be focusing so much time and energy on the \"theater beyond Yale\" elements of the course, when our senior projects require most of our attention for the semester. I also wonder how effective it is for seniors to write their paper at the same time that they are carrying out their senior project. It seems like the intellectual inquiry should happen prior to the project's execution, but the current schedule makes the paper (and supposed intellectual inquiry contained within) feel like an afterthought. What if the senior paper had to be completed in the spring of junior year as a precursor to the project? Or in the summer before senior year? Or what if there were 2 stages of the paper - one prior to the project's execution and a shorter one after to discuss the effectiveness of the project in carrying out the research goals, etc.? In any case, I think some thinking could go into how to more effectively integrate the paper and the project (without taking much-needed time and energy away from the execution of the project)."

   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend this class to students doing senior thesis production, even if you are just writing a play. The course really is good for creating those first portfolios that you will eventually have to send to grad schools.",
    "This seminar is actually very valuable for senior THST majors carrying out senior production projects. It's nice to have a group of people to talk to\/commiserate with throughout the process."
