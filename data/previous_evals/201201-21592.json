    "Yes, for the material, no for the course layout. Although there's no homework, so that's fun.",
    "Social Psych is a good, basic course that's pretty interesting. As a Psych major, I found it repeated a lot of the concepts I have already learned in other courses. You're graded equally on 3 non-cumulative exams, but they are very specific and somewhat hard to do well on. All in all, I enjoyed this course, but I'm not sure that someone not interested in psychology would.",
    "Interesting class. However, Bargh is difficult to follow and he jumps around from study to study; there's not a whole lot of organization in the class. Three exams weighted equally.",
    "Bargh reminds me of a dilapidated cow.Lectures were immensely slow and dull.Tests were odd. I guessed most of them (multiple choice + short answer).There are better courses out there. Don't take this if you don't have to.",
    "Great class for any major, very useful information and applicable to really anyone",
    "Easy - no work, just 3 exams.",
    "This class is pretty straightforward. The lectures follow an established order with corresponding powerpoints and the reading is assigned that connects to that topic. There is hardly any variation from the routine, but that can be a good or bad thing depending on what you like and what other classes you're taking.",
    "Beware the curve",
    "Social Psych is a course about people in relationship (with other people, with themselves in how they conceptualize \"self\" etc.) It is explores how people act and why they act that way.",
    "Yes, I would recommend it, but only if you are a psychology major. If not, the materials may be too dry for you. But if you are pursuing a psychology major, then I suggest you definitely take this class to build a solid foundation for future social psychology classes.",
    "If you are interested in how people interact and think and whatnot, take this course! It's actually really interesting once you see how complicated social interactions are!",
    "GREAT CLASS. You learn a very large amount of (interesting) material in a stress-free way!",
    "This is an interesting class, though it is not the most engaging class. The entire grade is based on three tests, and the tests are not cumulative, though they are more difficult than they appear. The material on the tests is often obscure to the class and it is possible to do poorly on the tests while having a perfectly good grasp of the material.",
    "This is an easy and very interesting class as long as you pay attention in class and do the readings. I would recommend it, but be careful studying for the tests. The short answers are graded pretty harshly so you better know your stuff.",
    "I really enjoyed this class. Prof. Bargh has done so many incredibly interesting experiments in this field. It's great to hear him talk about them. After taking this class, I feel like I understand how the information that I've learned in other psychology classes fits together and how we function as social creatures. I found myself visibly nodding to what he said in lecture because of how true it all is on a fundamental level. If you like psychology at all, you will like this class.",
    "Take it with Professor Bargh if you want an easy class with information that is interesting should you take the time to learn it. Class was always a bit of a struggle to pay attention in, but that's the price you pay for taking what is essentially a gut psych class.",
    "The grade is based on three non-cumulative tests, no final. Class is interesting but the curve is tough. Great class to Credit\/D, because it is easy to get a credit by just going to class and not reading the book. All the topics are good and relevant to how we live our lives today.",
    "PSYC 150 is a relatively easy class. The information is interesting and has important implications in human nature, and why and how people think rationally and irrationally. However, I felt that much of the information could be learned from the text book. Prof. Bargh is an important figure in the field of psychology, and I just wish that the class had offered something that reflected this.",
    "I'd recommend it -- interesting material, very low stress. Great class to take Cr\/D if you're interested in the material.",
    "Very similar to intro psych. If you are a psychology major and have taken intro to psych, do not take this class, as you will not learn anything new.",
    "The class is a broad overview of the current state of social psychology.With my comments above in question 1, I would strongly recommend the course to a student interested in psychology or sociology.",
    "Good intro. Straight up lecture",
    "If you enjoy learning about experiments that involve social encounters, you will like this course",
    "Take this course if you are even remotely interested in Social Psychology - the class is very much based on topics \/ theories backed up by studies so if you enjoy classes like that definitely take this one. It's a more focused version of Intro to Psychology with a lot of interesting studies that get you thinking about further research.",
    "Basic Psych class.",
    "Definitely take it! If you need a List A core or if you just want to learn more about how people perceive each other or make judgments this is a good class to take. The format of the lecture is three non-cumulative exams which makes the workload manageable, but you should definitely keep up with the reading which doesn't necessarily overlap with the slides. There's a lot of information to know but it's also really interesting and applicable.",
    "This is a good, solid course. Very much like other psych lectures. Bargh is interesting enough and is very nice, and the tests are manageable.",
    "Great if you are interested in social psychology but don't take it for exciting lectures (because they aren't at all).",
    "Decent intro-ey class. A lot of this material I found I'd already encountered in other classes, so I never really payed attention. Chill 5th class, with some fun concepts.",
    "It's a great class. Not a lot of work at all--3 exams, no section, no final. The three exams are pretty difficult though so you have to actually read the book and take good notes during lecture. Professor Bargh is really clear and the material is incredibly interesting so it's a great class.",
    "Yes, this is a very interesting and useful class, and you need it for the psych major anyway. Prof Bargh is a great prof to take it with.",
    "Interesting and very manageable course. Good 5th course - just 3 tests the entire semester, all of which were MC and short answer. Prof. Bargh is engaging and the subjects covered reveal a lot about human nature... only time you really have to do work for this course is reviewing for the tests.",
    "Really interesting class, with a completely manageable workload. Bargh is a really great lecturer and really cares about whether or not you understand.",
    "A little dry, but it sheds new light on studies you may already know about. Also, the workload isn't bad at all -- three exams based pretty much on lecture.",
    "Ayo yo so dis prof bargh brotha herr is a nice guy n all but his lectures be borin as feces. dis brotha act like someone put crazy glue on his stool and he gotta act like everythang cool by sippin on his coke. In other words, he aint never leave his stool and he just be sipping on this coke like he a boss, but nah he put me to sleep just bout every lecture. dis brothas slides also usually dont got nothin to do with the content nah mean. like he'll have \"attitudes and persuasion\" as a slide and have pics of mountains and feces. but dis brotha is a nice man, nah mean. He cool and all but he need to take some courses about teachin and feces. And ayo them tests are deceivingly hard nah mean. like most of it be multiple choice, and you think you got this feces, but nah yo, you get your test back and be like based god where were you at when i was takin this test. in other words, this brotha be testin you on some random feces, makin the test hard in a weird way nah mean. yea so this aint no gut nah mean.",
    "There are no tricks, and it is very straight-forward, so I would suggest it to anyone interested in the field.",
    "Boring, tests are harder than expected, wouldn't recommend",
    "Take it! John Bargh is a big deal in social psych, so his lectures are a lot of the time like \"So we did this study...\". It's great! Social psych is also fascinating and super relevant to everyone's every day life. I'm very glad I took this class.",
    "Take it! Social psychology is amazing on itself, but Professor Bargh is amazing teaching it, so if you have a chance to take it with him, do so!",
    "Very interesting class with relatively little workload. definitely take!",
    "Yes, but if you already took Modern Unconscious, it's basically the same class.",
    "I took this course so I would have a nice background, even though I'm more interested in the neuroscience side of psych. It's an ok course - pretty straightforward, but not spectacular.",
    "Great class for those who want to better understand how humans interact and function in social settings. I took it having only taken Intro CogSci and was totally fine.",
    "Yes, it's a great survey to social psychology",
    "I would recommend it if they need the credit. It's not a lot of work, however, it is not the most satisfying psychology course.",
    "This class was a good overview of social psychology with extremely interesting topics.",
    "This is a very interesting class that provides much insight into how we act and interact with others. It is a very light workload and the topics are interesting to listen to and read about.",
    "I would recommend this class. Having 3 multiple choice tests may make it difficult to get an A.",
    "No. I got very little out of the class.",
    "Continuation from Intro Psych, focusing more on the way humans are expected to behave in certain social situations. I would recommend this class. Even though the material does get repetitive, it's interesting.",
    "As previously mentioned:PSYC 150 is a fairly introductory level psychology course that discusses really fascinating topics. If you haven't taken too many other psych courses, I think you'll love it. If you have, but like me, you are fascinated by thinking about how we behave especially in the context of other people, I think you'll find the course really interesting. I took Modern Unconscious before this course but still enjoyed it.",
    "A good overview of social psychology--much of it will be familiar from Intro to Pysch, especially at the beginning, though it does go deeper into the field's subject matter after the first exam. Grading is done on three exams, non-cumulative, multiple choice and short answer. Not too difficult, pretty interesting, I'd recommend if you need a List A requirement for the psych major or have a general interest in the field of social psych.",
    "Yes, great senior class, or 5th class. Read the book!",
    "Yes, I strongly recommend PSYC 150.",
    "Straight forward lecture, textbook readings, and three exams. There are also assigned articles, but luckily they're not mandatory, just there if you want to see them. Prof Bargh is (of course) extremely well versed in all of the literature so you'll greatly benefit from his expertise. No section, so not an overwhelming time commitment.",
    "A good intro to topics in Social Psychology. Topics are pretty interesting and relatable even if you're not a psych major. However, there's a ton of info, especially experimental studies, and the lectures aren't that well organized in that it's easy to get the concepts and experiments cluttered up. The tests aren't exactly easy either; you have to understand the concepts he talks about in class and also read the textbook because there's not that much overlap.",
    "It was a decent class. I honestly think you could learn all the material just by reading the book, but Bargh was a good lecturer nonetheless. I'm not a psych major and found that most of the interesting material in the course I had already learned in intro psych. The curve was kind of rough too so keep that in mind.",
    "Really interesting material. Not too much work either. The most important thing is to go to class and pay attention.",
    "I would recommend it. Learning about Social Psychology is very helpful for understanding people.",
    "Decent class. Multiple choice + short answer exams, no final, some tricky questions though",
    "Great lecture. You will hear about some jaw-dropping studies and if you let it, this will change the way you think. Professor Bargh is a giant in the field and knows everything. He's very earnest. However, you should be okay with learning from Powerpoint and a stationary, seated lecturer.",
    "Psych 150 was awesome! It was a very interesting class and the tests were totally fair. Prof. Bargh is such a Psychology superstar and it was great having a class with him. This course is definitely right for anyone at all interested in psychology as a major or just looking for a class with a moderate workload and fascinating lectures.",
    "I would recommend it as a good List A core class. The material is not conceptually difficult to understand but you must put in the time to understand all of it. If you do not need a List A core class, I would recommend taking something else because I think there are other more interesting classes offered in the psych department.",
    "The materials covered are interesting. There's not much beside the lecture and studying for exams, which contained multiple choice questions. The curves are thus quite high. There are three TA's for the class, but no section.",
    "A good 5th class- interesting material, pretty intuitive, clear lectures, not much reading. But do study for the tests- the first one we had was deceptively easy, then the second two got harder.",
    "I found this class to be pretty interesting, and I would recommend it to students who are interested in the subject.",
    "One of the best Cr\/D\/Fails in the Bluebook.",
    "Interesting lecture! but he repeated himself a lot lolI wish he could've posted PPT files before class - I just want my notes to be with my slides, but they ended up being a long word file.Reading the book didn't enhance my understanding a worthwhile amount, but it was essential to pick up the right terms for the exam. The exam was term-based even though terms weren't always defined in class.",
    "Great CR\/D class for those curious about psych.",
    "Good class in terms of material; covers really valuable topics that everyone should learn about humans. Make sure to read the terms in the book, since the exam is about 20% based on terms from the book; and he tells you what chapters are on the 3 tests (non-cumulative yayy).Definitely attend class, since he tells you what's the most important information to remember from the class, really helpful in that (but doesn't tell you what terms from the book).Lecture slides are really good to study when preparing for exam, but are sometimes just outlines with not much description, so attend class!",
    "Yes, but don't expect it to teach you the secrets of human interaction. Great course on how we don't know or control much about what we do.",
    "Interesting material, knowledgeable lecturer. Just a ton of material to try to study for the exams. Bargh is a somewhat dry lecturer, but I ended up actually enjoying his style - other students might find it a little boring though.",
    "I would recommend PSYC 150 to any student genuinely interested in the material. Bargh is an excellent lecturer, and his presentation of the material made it seem both interesting in its novelty and important to one's understanding of human behavior. However, don't be fooled by the light work load into thinking this class is a good gut (unless you're taking it CR\/D). While it's certainly nice to only have three non-cumulative tests making up your grade, the curve for these tests is not that generous - Professor Bargh curved the median final grade to the top of the B range. As such if you do take this class for a grade, be sure to take each test seriously."
