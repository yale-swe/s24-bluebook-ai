   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this course to anyone who is interested in philosophy, and in particular to students without a strong background in philosophy. This is not to say that it is a facile course, but rather that it presumes little and builds up a solid knowledge base quickly. The course covers existentialist thinkers, which are some of the most immediately exciting philosophers, including Sartre, Arendt, Heidegger, and others. In particular, it focuses on the intersection between philosophy and the 20th century historical context (World War II, Nazism, the Soviet Union) and subsequently contemporary Russia. Shore's scholarship largely focuses on recent developments in Eastern Europe through the lens of intellectual history, and she weaves these into the course in a very effective and interesting way.",
    "I do not recommend this class to a fellow student, under any circumstance. The strength of the class was only in the writers we read. Its weaknesses are too many to list, but I will name a few. Class discussions were pure pandemonium; I do not exaggerate: there would usually be six unanswered or unexplored questions with no formal structure just floating around the class; Professor Shore did nothing to guide us through these. In fact she usually wrote down the names of students who want to speak, creating a toxic environment where people chose to speak while they have nothing to say. This led to aimless wanderings, and we even had to take the role of Therapist when it came to how some students \"feel\" about death. There was usually no historical coverage of the change in ideas across the philosophers and writers, when the class is supposed to be all about that. Generally, the readings were too long; one ordinary week (there was no break anywhere before it) we were asked to read 600 pages; this is an absurd expectation, and you would think the professor would be kind enough to situate it near spring break or something, but no; like most of the arrangements of the readings, it was poorly placed...I am surprised that this course, which is one of the worst I have taken at Yale, has existed in this form for many semesters. Take at your own risk!"
