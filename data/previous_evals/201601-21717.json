   "comments": [
    "Yes! Although it must be said that a writing workshop is a very simple class, and entirely dependent on the instructor and the students in it. Professor Choi is amazing, and my class was full of truly wonderful people. So, regardless to say, this was awesome. It could've been terrible if the professor was not as great and the students were not as great, but I suppose there's not much to be done about that. If you want to write some short stories this semester, definitely apply and go for it!!",
    "I loved this class, especially with Prof. Choi. The workload is very reasonable, as long as you don't lose track of when your workshops are, and I think that you really gain a lot from taking the class. Prof. Choi gave brilliant feedback, but the other people in the class will also provide great feedback, and everyone has different writing styles and preferred genres, so it's a wonderful experience altogether.",
    "Take this class if you want to write fiction... Professor Choi is kind, conscientious, and very on-the-nose when it comes to articulating both strengths & weaknesses of your workshop pieces. (Your class may not be nearly so helpful, but I found that the dynamic of mine really improved over the course of the semester.)",
    "I would recommend this class.",
    "Totally fantastic. 10\/10, would recommend.",
    "A pretty easy, fun creative writing class that's heavily workshop-based.",
    "There's no real magic formula to writing a good story. Mostly you need to love creating stories, and that's a joy that can't be taught. But writing can be encouraged and directed and turned into a craft, and that's what ENGL 245 excels at. If you know you like writing but aren't sure if you qualify as a writer yet, I definitely recommend this course. You'll be a writer by the time you're done.",
    "DEFINITELY. Take this course. Prof. Choi is fantastic. The course will change the way you look at literature and life in general. You will become a better reader and writer."
