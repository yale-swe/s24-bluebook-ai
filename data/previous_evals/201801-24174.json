    "Very nice insight and nuance into diplomacy and foreign policy making at the envoy level.",

    "This was one of the best seminars I've ever attended. The course had the perfect balance of discussion, group activity, lecture, and outside speaker presentation\/interview.",
    "It was tperfect",
    "The student led sections were great and brought fun and diverse ways of understanding content to the class. Feingold's comments were also a good addition. However, the course should try to go through the assigned readings and discuss them more. So that they feel useful to the discussion and even for reading them"
