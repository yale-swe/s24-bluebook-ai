    "Journalism with Bob Woodward is an absolutely wonderful course. If you are lucky enough to get in through the application process, you have to take it. The pieces that we talk about in the class are one of a kind - from profiles to exposes to pieces about the war in Iraq and the digital age. You get to read his All the President's Men and get to ask him questions about it - a once in a lifetime experience. You also read other works he's published, like Obama's Wars, and discuss them with him. Bob's wife Elsa also adds to the class; she teaches one of the seminars and shares books that she's read and we get to read New Yorker pieces that she's written. It is a wonderful wonderful class. I should also mention that being in this class allows you to become a part of the Yale Journalism Initiative, and Mark Oppenheimer can really help you get into journalism internships over the summer. He said at one point, \"If one of you doesn't have a job come April, I'll make a few phone calls to people I know and get you a job.\" There's a ten-page profile assignment, where you are assigned a random person in the class to write a profile of, and you interview them and their friends and family to help you write it. There's a final project of 3500-4000 words. The topic has to do with New Haven or Yale and it basically involves you conducting some sort of investigation and writing a piece about it. Bob really wants to help you along the way with this, he's a wonderful professor. And finally there are one page papers that are due about every other week based on the weekly reading. He grades harder on these than he does the profile and the final I would say, and it's hard to get solid As on the one-pagers. Luckily, he believes in doing rewrites, so you can rewrite a paper to get a higher grade (but he probably won't let you rewrite an A-). Bob Woodward is also the kindest, most caring professor I've had at Yale. He's the best professor I've had here too. He lives in Washington, but flies out to New Haven (or takes the train) every Monday to attend seminar. He gets here early in the morning to hold Office Hours, and leaves late on Monday because every so often he'll take out seminar kids to dinner at The Study, where you get to talk with him about current events, foreign policy, and writing. It's a wonderful experience with a genuine professor. Woodward leads discussions beautifully, and introduces smart points to a discussion that's already sharpened by great students. He is also a wonderful professor in that he'll always offer to help on your project. If you have a source that you can't get to talk, he'll say, give me his or her name. I'll try to help. He'll also try to get you into internships, calling any connections he has or people you're interviewing with and putting down a good word for you. He doesn't have to, but he does, and it's incredibly kind and a mark of a very caring, devoted professor. Bob is very self-critical, and he always thinks he could have done something better, which makes him care about the course so much more. At the end of every Office Hours, he'll always ask what he could have, or could still do, to make the course better.",
    "I have distinctly mixed feelings about Journalism as taught by Bob Woodward. First, the plus side. Woodward is a legend, and it's constantly humbling to be in his presence. He speaks to us with a wealth of knowledge about journalism and its practices. With such a high profile teacher, the seminar attracts some of the best journalism students at Yale (there were about 80 applicants for 16 spots). Many of the assignments are also excellent. Profiling another student in the class is eye opening, and having an entire semester to work on a project is an amazing opportunity to drive deeply into a subject. Finally, Woodward is open about the fact that he is not a teacher by design, and asks us for advice about how to improve. I would say my biggest criticism is that Woodward often conducts the seminar like one in political science as opposed to journalism. Well do a reading of journalistic significance, and he will obsess on the content of the piece as opposed to its connection to journalism. For that reason, I feel like I got more out of the class when I was NOT in class (ie working on our projects). The projects are a serious time commitment, and I would not take the class unless you have a lot of time to devote to it. A final criticism was that Woodward's grading system was pretty arbitrary. He would give assignments less than an A and basically fail to say how they could be better. But Bob is a sweet man, and if you can get into the class, I'd probably take it.",
    "This course does a terrific job of providing insight into specific techniques and practices of journalism, while also focusing on the craft's broader implications. Professor Woodward does an excellent job at guiding the conversation while still allowing students to come to their own conclusions about the texts and authors. It goes without saying that he is a master within this field, and yet, he approaches each class with great humility, eager to give specific feedback on each student's work. I've almost never had a professor arrive so prepared and eager to discuss specific idea-- quoted directly from student papers-- and to encourage students to challenge each other. A fantastic and rigorous academic experience.",
    "It honestly isn't the best writing or journalism course I've taken at Yale, but you should do it to learn from Bob Woodward. He is so passionate about the topic and the job that you can't help but catch the bug. Plus, he's very invested in ensuring that all his students are happy and successful in the class.",
    "If you're interested in journalism, I would absolutely recommend taking this course. Be forewarned, though, that the class is not writing focused per se. You will do a lot of writing, but the emphasis is on content rather than structure and style. Class time was typically evenly split between talking about salient political issues and talking about how journalists ought to cover them. The class is quite a lot of work, but the opportunity to learn from someone like Bob Woodward is unique.",
    "I would recommend the course, with hesitation. If you're not comfortable with unguided, somewhat meandering seminar sessions, don't take it. Don't take it if you don't want to talk about politics, the judiciary, and policy the cross-listing with Political Science is, unfortunately for non-PoliSci majors, no joke. Also, if you're someone who cares about grades, I don't know if I would recommend taking it. Woodward's grading is hard to predict, and even when you feel like you've submitted your best piece of work, he may think it's less than.",
    "It is obviously an honor to study with Prof. Woodward, but you should know that he is a newspaper professional and not a trained academic. You're signing up for time with a kindly, gifted mentor with great insight into American politics, but you're not going to get particularly thorough feedback on the projects you turn in, mainly a profile of a classmate and a final feature on a topic of your choosing. Prof. Woodward is a valuable resource, but he's going to let you make as much use of the class - and of him - as you want. If you want to learn how to be a strong writer, look elsewhere in the English Department; Fred Strebeigh, Anne Fadiman, Verlyn Klinkenborg, Cynthia Zarin, and Carl Zimmer will probably do far more for you as people who teach you craft. If you want to go be a reporter in Washington D.C., Woodward is for you. All that said, the class can be worthwhile if you make an effort to get to know him.",
    "It's great to get the opportunity to write a feature while getting credit for it, and it's also fun to write the profile--I ended up being really good friends with my profilee :) I also liked hearing from people who had a lot of different kinds of media experience--daily, magazine, TV, speechwriting, etc. I would just have realistic expectations about what you will actually get out of the seminar itself."
