   "comments": [
    "It is such an interesting course! If you are passionate about politics it will be even a more amazing course. TAKE IT!",
    "Its an excellent way to keep up your Spanish and learn about a few important issues facing Latin America. I would recommend it.",
    "This is a great course for people who are strong in spanish conversation and writing and look to improve these skills as well as learn about one of the most interesting regions in the world.",
    "Political science class taught in spanish.",
    "Yes, it's a great way to learn both history, politics, and Spanish. It revealed to me my own stereotypes about the region and provoked me to approach political systems in a new light.",
    "Take this course! Carballal is a great professor who does a wonderful job of leading class discussions. The readings are all extremely interesting, and they have to do with current events. Ex of topics we read about and discussed: Venezuela and Chavez, drugs and violence in Colombia, US relations with Cuba and Latin America etc. While the workload is manageable, you do have to do the readings because Carballal expects everyone to participate and talk about the readings in class. There are two essays throughout the semester which were manageable but did require you to put in the time (each 5-7 pages). This is a great class because it lets you practice your spanish while reading and learning about current events that everyone should know about. And discussions were always interesting!",
    "The class goes over the elements of Latin American politics as well as current issues. We talked about Peronism, US relations with Cuba, Hugo Chavez, Evo Morales and Bolivia, Colombia, globalization, the media in Latin America and how it reflects on US media, and many other interesting subjects. We never really spent more than a few class periods on one subject, but you do have an opportunity to study a subject deeply through the 2 research papers that we do.This is not a bridge class and is harder\/more work than other L5 Spanish classes. I took this class first semester freshman year, after getting a 5 on the AP Spanish test my junior year of high school. I struggled at the beginning, getting low Bs on my assignments, but eventually got an A- on one my first paper. Initially I regretted taking the class, feeling it was too hard for me, but I eventually adjusted and it was fine. You should be very mindful of your level of Spanish when taking this class though. If you feel like it may be too difficult during shopping period, I'd suggest you take Advanced Conversational Spanish or Spanish Grammar first. If you are willing to work hard though, it's an awesome class and was my favorite class of the semester.",
    "Spanish 224 is a great way to improve your fluency in the language, specifically with regard improving your vocab related to international relations and Latin American politics. It also is great to give you a survey of Latin American politics - it familiarizes you with key events and leaders from the 20th century to today, and I would certainly recommend it to anyone willing to put in the time to read the articles and get the most out of this class.",
    "Overall the course was very interesting. I learned a lot, although I do not feel like my Spanish improved very much. Its strengths lie in the content and in the immense knowledge of the profesora. She asked interesting, thought provoking questions and never made her own opinion clear (a rare feat). More help with the mechanics of Spanish would have been nice, and the order was a bit random. Very discussion based which was great.",
    "I would recommend it as I improved my Spanish and learned a lot about Latin American history.",
    "This class is a great introduction to Latin American politics and history. If this is something you are interested in, definitely take this course! You don't need a lot of background knowledge, but you should definitely be comfortable speaking because a lot of the course is discussion-based. Professor Carballal is great and really helpful, and I think the course really helped with my reading and writing skills as well. I would definitely recommend it!"
