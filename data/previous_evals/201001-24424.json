    "Fairly interesting but hard class. Too many students take it and the curve is very hard.",
    "Solid introduction to both ordinary and partial differential equations with a strong focus on practical applications. Definitely recommended, especially for those for whom it's important to visualize the physical meaning of the problems they're solving.",
    "This was a very difficult math course that needs previous knowledge of calculus, matrices, and much more. I would recommend the class for those who plan on majoring in some type of engineering but if not I would stay away from the class. The problem sets were long and will take up large amounts of time.",
    "One of the better taught intro math courses. Smooke is a good teacher and brings in humorous anecdotes about the famous mathematicians whose equations we study. He uses funny extra credit problems like: \"In which state is the #1-rated golf course located?\" and \"On what street does Sponge Bob Squarepants live on?\" and \"What is Lagrange's first name?\"The class is REALLY early in the morning - 9-10:15 on Tuesdays and Thursdays. I was late to class 90% of the class; it's sooo hard to wake up for a 9 am class.Homeworks are due on Tuesdays, but there is a one-day grace period for every assignment, so you can turn them in on Thursdays with no penalty. This was really useful for me because I had a pset due on Tuesdays for another class, so I pushed diffy-q back to Thursday.I think Smooke explains things pretty clearly, so if you do all your homework on time and come to every class, you should be able to follow his lectures without doing too much textbook reading ahead of time. However, I skipped\/came late to a lot of classes, so I quickly fell behind and found myself teaching myself the material out of the textbook and was lost during class.Smooke warns each class about follies students from previous years have made. For example, he tells us about cheating incidents at midterms in the past. He tells us about how students forget to plug in initial conditions or how often a student will forget to take the Laplace Transform of both sides of an equation or confuse the inverse Laplace Transform with the forwards Laplace Transform and other things that are easy to make mistakes on. He clearly cares about his class and wants his students to do well. He also shares interesting stories about his children, who are in HS\/college (?) now.We skip numerical methods and don't do very many proofs. The goal of this class is to teach the analytical methods of solving differential equations and to expose you to as many different types of differential equations and solving methods as possible in one semester. Nonlinear differential equations are NOT covered.I never went to office hours or review sessions, so I have no idea what they are like. However, my impression of Luca Tosatto is he is a good guy. I remember he went over my second midterm with me and gave me three points back.",
    "Great coarse.",
    "A necessity for engineering majors. I would recommend it, especially with Smooke.",
    "ENAS 194 is a good way of getting practice in using techniques for solving ordinary and some elementary partial differential equations. For practical reasons the class is useful as a compliment to some physics classes that often implicitly use techniques for solving differential equations without requiring students to know all of the details.",
    "It's a hard class, but it's worth it -- you learn a lot. If you're required to take this class, go in with an open mind because if you treat this class as a chore, you'll suffer.",
    "Most people will take this class because it's required for the major. Definitely take it with Smooke! Tse Tse",
    "If you are required to take it for your major, take it. There's no way around that. If not, don't take it. It's a difficult math class with a lot of different concepts and a lot of work, so if you don't need to put yourself through it, don't.",
    "The class is very well-designed and well-taught for what it's intended for: learning how to solve a lot of types of differential equations. Take it with Smooke if you can--he's a very clear lecturer (especially by Yale math course standards). It's a ton of work if you actually do all the homework: problem sets often take 10-12 hours to do, and that's if you know what you're doing. But by the time you're done doing all the homework, you've done every kind of problem so many times that you don't need to spend as much time studying for the exams as you would have otherwise. I highly recommend going to class as often as possible, and doing all the homework even if it's a huge sacrifice as far as time is concerned. I wouldn't take it if it's not required, unless you have a real reason to learn differential equations or you're just looking for a challenge.",
    "If this class is not absolutely necessary, do not take it. If it is absolutely necessary, see if you can take it with a different professor, or take the one in the math department. I really feel like taking this class is one of the worst ideas ever. Not only are the problem sets for this class extremely long, but they are also mind-numbingly boring. The problems do not require any kind of thinking, but you just have to learn to do something and then do the same thing over and over again. Oh and you better hope you can do 20 minutes of messy algebra, taking derivatives, and integration by parts without making any mistakes, because thats what the problems on the final are like. Save yourself the headache and skip this class.",
    "Good class. Much, much better than multi-variable, practical and great if you liked to solve problems.",
    "This was, by far, the worst math class I have ever taken. Do not take it unless you are an Mech E, in which case I implore you to see if the Math version can be counted as equivalent.I am not a Mech E major, and so I took this class to get a well-rounded math education. Boy, do I regret it.The homeworks are extremely long and tedious, and worse,valued terribly. They are just enough to mess up your grade, but not big enough to actually help. Big class sizes also make grading (exams, HW) extremely stingy, and the TA's are truly unforgiving.The exams are generally very easy conceptually, it is very easy to make silly errors and lose a ton of points. As a result, you get a fifth of the class getting over 100% while the rest flounder below 80 (read: Average grade is high)This might all be worth it if the material was interesting and gratifying, but after about 5 weeks it turns into the biggest Plug-N-Chug class ever. Smooke is a nice man, but an awful professor. Anybody can regurgitate the book chapter by chapter.Seriously, don't take this class. At least not with Smooke. I've heard nice things about the Fall 2009 semester (due to a mistake on Yale Course Listings, the wrong fall professor was listed online.)",
    "Yes, if you like math, you will love this class.",
    "This class was difficult and the exams made me want to cry. The material wasn't that interesting either. I learned a lot, but be prepared to work hours on the problem sets.",
    "Take it. Even if you're not too interested in Math - this is a good course.",
    "The most useful and straightforward math class I have taken at Yale. I highly recommend it.",
    "Take this class if you want to learn the most useful and practical math out there. if you aren't a algebra\/series\/arithmetic God though, don't expect to do that well on the tests, something will always trip you up and cost you that A since there will be a ton of kids getting 100s consistently.",
    "Good solid class, though homework can be quite tedious and complicated at times. But essential for engineering majors.",
    "This is a good, solid class. It is more intuitive than many math courses, and certainly useful for sciences.",
    "I highly recommend ENAS 194! The class gave a good overview of the most common types of differential equations, including partial differential equations. I feel like I learned a tremendous amount. Smooke was a wonderful lecturer, so try to take this class with him if you can. He teaches directly from the book, which makes the material easy to follow. The tests were mostly plug-and-chug, and applications were limited, but neither of these detracted from the course. Take it!",
    "ENAS 194 is a great alternative to the math dept sequence from what i hear. Really interesting, and a hard course that will challenge you. I would recommend it with smooke!",
    "ENAS 194 is a weird class, because you can take it and do very well or you can be right at the average and its luck separating the two. Some of the exam questions can just kill you because of bad grading. On multiple occasions the grader would take off 18 points off a 20 point question, a blow that you can't survive. These would be on exams that you would actually really know the material but just wouldn't understand the wording or application of that one question. You have to take this class for any engineering so yea take it, but if youre like man should I take this for fun - don't.",
    "Only take it if you need it for your major.",
    "Focused on practice instead of theory. The class did a good job of teaching and testing the useful material. I never felt like anyone was trying to trick me, which is how I felt taking calc in the math department.",
    "Yes. A great class, even if you don't have to take it for a requirement.",
    "Starts off easy but increases in difficulty. Do extra problems and read additional sections in the textbook to help prepare for the test. Problem sets take a while.",
    "Great class for the engineering and applied mathematics student. Lots of applications and professor makes sure you see these concepts in physical problems ranging from a variety of fields. Very rewarding upon completion of the class, as you begin to understand that almost all (significant) physical laws are essentially differential equations.",
    "It's good. Don't be fooled by how easy the beginning of the semester is; it gets tough--make sure you get together with a group and hammer out those PDEs. And you don't need any linear algebra.",
    "ENAS 194 is a fast-paced but extremely interesting, comprehensive differential equations course. Professor Smooke is amazing. I think this class can stand alone simply because the subject material is very interesting and the methods of differential equations are elegant, but it's also applicable to virtually any science major. I think a lot of the class would say it's very challenging, but don't let that scare you away! It's worth the challenge. I would definitely recommend the class to anybody who likes math or applied math.",
    "ENAS 194 is a good class to take if you want to learn how to solve a bunch of dif eqs. I sort of see the class as learning a bunch of tricks that can be helpful. There is practically no theory at all, which might sound good to some, but I personally felt that it would be nice to have at least some theoretical framework to organize the concepts we learned. Other than that, Professor Smooke is a good professor, and I enjoyed the class. We covered a good amount of material and made some headway into partial differential equations and fourier series, which was neat. Practically no linear algebra is required. I didn't have any linear algebra background, and I didn't see that as a problem in taking the course. I think Professor Smooke scaled down the linear algebra in the course based on the number of people who had taken linear algebra (which was maybe 10-20 out of 120). The grading was a bit annoying, though, as partial credit is given in a sort of random and weird way.",
    "It's mostly people who are required to take it for their majors, but if you can, take it with Smooke.",
    "There is a LOT of material that's covered in this class. If you are able to keep up with the pace it shouldn't be too bad, especially since the midterms aren't too bad. problem sets take forever and are very tedious.",
    "Differential equations. You'll learn the techniques. There's not much theory. Homework is tedious. Classes are early in the morning.",
    "If you need to take Differential, take it with Smooke. If you like math, take this class.",
    "While most take this course because it is required, if you are any science major (especially physics, chemistry) this is a worthwhile accompaniment to a quantum or physical chemistry class. Although lectures aren't particularly inspiring, you will learn the mechanics of solving differential equations, which is not generally required by science classes but is very useful. A word of warning: although tests aren't too difficult, the problem sets are ridiculously long and time-consuming.",
    "Yes, take it. But go to class.",
    "I would recommend this course to any student interested in science, math, or engineering. It is a very useful, but challenging course. Alot of time is required to complete problem sets and learn the material. It is a very interesting course",
    "take it. the material is interesting.",
    "I particularly liked the variety of applications discussed in this class. It is a good class overall - just be aware the tests can be difficult (also I say that having just had the final). Overall, I would choose this class over the math-department differential equations courses because this class takes applications into account. I would recommend taking this class.",
    "This class gets harder and faster-paced towards the end. It is also a considerable workload, with 3 midterms, a final, and problem sets even during the weeks that we have midterms. The problem sets are long and repetitive, and it's often hard to find the motivation to do them since they are worth 10% of the grade.",
    "well you should take this class only if you need it for your major. Take this one and not the one in the fall.",
    "Diff EQ with some applications. Take it if you don't want theoretical stuff, but be prepared for some theoretical math towards the end of the year.",
    "This class is taught by Prof. Smooke,I enjoyed it and that's no mere fluke,You'll learn a lot if you dare,Euler, Bessel, Laguerre,A course you definitely should tooke.",
    "Great if you want to get a practical understanding of how to solve diff. eq's, probably not great if you're at all into the theoretical bases of it. Problem sets are long, and there are a lot of them (sets were assigned the weeks of each exam (there were 3) and even during reading week). Professor Smooke is great, though. Pay attention to little historical details in class, they show up on exams as extra credit.",
    "Uses alot of math techniques, covers alot of material",
    "A lot of problems, not much time. Great TAs and reasonable tests",
    "Over the course of the semester, this class slowly whittled away my will to live. The lectures were boring and straight out of the textbook; they really added nothing. The homework assignments were loooooong and repetitive. Don't take this class unless you absolutely must, and if you must, just take the version in the math department instead. Seriously, this was the most painful class I have ever taken at Yale.",
    "Do it, if you need it. it has 3 midterms, hard psets and a hard final. it's not easy.",
    "Usually, this course ends up as a requirement for all engineering and math majors, so there's no going around that. However, if you're trying to decide between this course and its counterpart in the math department (MATH 246, I think) then the choice is clear: take ENAS 194. Not only is Smooke exponentially better as a teacher than Dan Kushnir (who was teaching it when I shopped it), he also doesn't go into a lot of theoretical diff eq complications that Kushnir attempts to cover. If you're someone who doesn't care about understanding the esoteric, arbitrary theories behind different methods of solving diff equations, ENAS 194 is for you. The weekly psets are doable and 3 midterms give you plenty of opportunity to diversify your grade.The only downside is T-Th 9am class time, but once you get used to this pattern of sleep you'll decide to postpone your Toad's outing to Saturdays from Wednesdays - no big deal.",
    "Take this class, especially if you're a physics major. The DUS Peter Parker will allow this to apply this to the major, and it's really helpful when you deal with differential equations in other classes. There's a lot of work, but it's possible to learn from the book and homework if you'd rather not go to lecture. Do thehomework!",
    "Most likely you are taking this as a required course, but if it's any condolence I enjoyed it much, much more than multivariable calc!",
    "difficult class, but if you know your stuff, you should be fine",
    "If you must take it take it with smooke. Oh and take it with a buddy.It helps in doing psets in a group.",
    "It's a fine class. Not too difficult, but make sure to study thoroughly for the tests because sometimes Smooke throws curveballs that were not on the homework. It's a techniques class, so it's not that interesting beyond the fact that you learn a bunch of different techniques for solving differential equations, but it's very useful for almost any engineering or science. The problem sets take a very long time so make sure to start them early: they're a lot of busywork.",
    "Great course, required for all engineering majors, but rightfully so since the material is so useful. Definitely take it. Smooke is the best teacher ever, but he won't be teaching it next year :(",
    "This class is the prereq for just about any higher level engineering courses so if you are an engineering major you have no choice but to take it. It's a good course; the material covered can be challenging but it is mostly application based. The homework also can get tedious and is often very long, but overall it is a good course.",
    "For being a higher level math course, this was a great class. Definitely take this instead of the math equivalent--less proofs and more applications.",
    "The most important part of this class would be to do the problem sets. They took me awhile, but basically everything I learned was through doing the problem sets, so don't leave them all for the end of the semester. Smooke is okay, but I had a really hard time paying attention for the full 75 minutes. A lot of people in this class seem to not really care too much about learning the material, but if you put in some effort the material is actually really interesting and you can learn a lot.",
    "I would take this course as it bases the instruction of differential equations in applications to the field of engineering.",
    "Problem sets were a little lengthy and I hear that the tests were more difficult that in past years, but overall good course.",
    "would not recommend unless required for the major... lots of work and tough",
    "I would recommend this class if you like math and science. It starts out pretty easy; you just need to go to class and do the psets. But after about 6 weeks, it gets much harder. Be prepared and stay on top of your work. Also, I had not taken Linear Algebra yet and I did just fine with the matrices stuff.",
    "A very useful class if you are planning to go into engineering. The tests and homework are hard and long, but it's worth it if you push through it.",
    "I would recommend ENAS 194 to a fellow student because you learn a large amount of material that isn't too difficult and is explained well but is very useful to many different branches of science. The amount of time devoted to PDE's in particular helped me immensely for my upper level physics classes.",
    "Problem sets can take a while to complete. Class does not get too rigorous and focuses more on applications than proofs.",
    "A hard but rewarding class. There is a lot of work, and problem sets will consume entire evenings before they are due. The book also often lacks examples that help with the problems. I liked the material we did and ultimately would recommend it.",
    "Everyone in this course has been sent here by some technical major. No one's really interested in the material; they'd take differential equations in the math department if they were. Since you have to take it, take it. It's not thrilling, but it's competently taught and you will learn what you need to know. Be prepared for monster problem sets. Also, reading the textbook before lecture might make the task of following derivations and examples more manageable."
