   "comments": [
    "You do a lot of hands on activities, which is nice to break up the monotony of most courses, which have lectures in class and psets outside of it. It can be difficult to grasp the material at first if you have no prior background, but you learn to make cool stuff.",
    "This class was amazing - fun, informative, incredibly useful. I feel like I understand the material, and that I have the building blocks to explore topics and projects in the field of electronics in the future.",
    "It is a good course for people who have no background\/experience with electronics. You learn the fundamentals, which you can use to build different projects.",
    "Practical Electronics was a solid introductory course in electronics and gave me a good understanding of the fundamentals. The best part was that it was basically an intro course, yet in a small setting, so there was time for questions, additional discussion, etc.",
    "Phys 112 is an interesting introduction to electronics. You learn the basics of circuit building, and the material is not intimidating or difficult.",
    "I would recommend to anyone who has even a little interest in electronics. Very well taught and not a bad work load at all",
    "This is a hands-on class that teaches you the fundamentals of designing and building electrical circuits, then lets you push your knowledge further in a direction of your choosing with a project at the end of the semester. It was incredibly fun and informative, without a lot of stress or too much work. I definitely recommend this to anyone interested in electronics, regardless of their background in math\/physics\/CS. I'm a STEM major and did not find the class too easy, but I also know not-STEM-inclined people who took the class and found it manageable.",
    "You get to learn about circuits and play with them. AND you get graded for it!",
    "I would definitely recommend this class for someone who wants a hands-on science that is pretty stress-free. The best part is that doing the in-class activities vastly helps you understand the material. Most of it is extremely straightforward. The best part is that you can just learn the basics of this class or take it as far as you like - Mr. Irons is more than happy to explain circuits and help you tinker around with your project if you meet with him.",
    "I highly recommend Practical Electronics. It's so rare in a liberal arts education to be taught real, hands-on skills, and that's exactly what this course endeavors to do. I had no physics background at all, not even in high school, and not only could I keep up, but I felt engaged and genuinely interested in the material. It is rewarding to actually understand and manipulate electrical currents, and you spend about half the class doing experiments which makes the time fly. The final project was fun, but a little too unstructured for my taste, so I scrambled near the end to pull it together.",
    "A very manageable science credit where you learn things that are useful, hence the name. Prof Irons is great and sincerely wants people to do well, the final project can be very fun if you pick a project you like but should be enjoyable either way.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to anyone with little background in electronics. I feel like I have truly learned the basics of electronics, all through a series of hands-on activities.",
    "Absolutely. Obviously this class is not for an Electrical Engineering major. But anyone else with little or no electrical experience will learn so much. Reading a textbook and memorizing information is not the primary focus. Instead of lectures we did hands-on projects every day.",
    "Lots of hands-on putting circuits together in class, with the expectation that you will learn what things do on your own. If you are a hands-on kind of learner, it would probably be great, but less so if not.",
    "Yes, absolutely.",
    "This was one of my favorite classes at Yale. I came in knowing nothing and came out with a solid understanding of basic electronics and feel comfortable building circuits. The professor was amazing and overall it was a great experience."
