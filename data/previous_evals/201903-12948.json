   "comments": [
    "honestly, none. I thought this would be an amazing course and it was not. not engaging, professor was not nice, hard grading, arrogant attitude.",
    "I guess the ability to more critically analyze music and musicians.",
    "I gained a thorough understanding the social, economic, and political factors that went into the music of both John Coltrane and Jimi Hendrix, as well as a view of how their music functioned in the history of the 20th century. I also learned some basic jazz theory and information on the beginnings of studio technology and its use in jazz and rock.",
    "I greatly increased my knowledge of american music",
    "I developed new music-listening skills, particularly in terms of paying attention to what cultural, political, or personal influences may have impacted an artist's work.",
    "I developed a deep understanding of the context in which Jimi Hendrix and John Coltrane lived in. I learned about the history of Jazz, R&B, and Rock, as well as the story of other musicians that surrounded or influenced Hendrix and Coltrane. The course also gave me much insight about the music of these two artists, and the impact that they had politically and socially.",
    "I learned about the careers, lives, and sounds of Coltrane and Hendrix.",
    "I learned about Coltrane, Hendrix, and the music of their eras",
    "Pretty interesting dive into the lives and music of Jimi Hendrix and John Coltrane and how their careers related. I learned so much biographically and about their music, introducing me to lots of new material.",
    "Learned a lot about the history of both later jazz movements and early rock movements, centering around the histories of Jimi Hendrix and John Coltrane in their respective fields. We learned all about their biographies, the music that affected them, the music they produced, and much much more.",
    "i learned about the ties between genres like blues, spirituals, jazz, and rock and how they're all very rooted within the african american community. also learned a lot about the careers and influences of john coltrane and jimi hendrix.",
    "how to critically evaluate music from technical and historical standpoints",
    "The first half of the semester is about Coltrane. The second half is about Hendrix. I really liked all the listening we did in class.",
    "I learned a lot about both of the subjects of the course, as well as general music history and African American history.",
    "We took an in depth look into the lives and works of both John Coltrane and Jimi Hendrix. We learned how to critically analyze their music in the context of their respective time periods and personal struggles. It was insightful and opened my eyes to different styles of music as well as intricate ways of understanding that music.",
    "Through the life and work of two multi-faceted icons of popular culture, the course managed to provide a comprehensive knowledge of African American music, addressing it from different perspectives. I learned how the works of John Coltrane and Jimi Hendrix were contextualized within broader narratives of African American history, and the development of popular music in the United States. The course addressed these two musicians through a comparative perspective, and that was illuminating, particularly concerning non-musical factors that were intertwined in the life of both - spirituality, politics, for instance - and how it affected the way they conceived and shaped their music.",
    "Deeper knowledge of African-American music as well as the ways in which African-American art is reflected and refracted in Western popular culture."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Professor is not an engaging lecturer, doesn't make time for his students, won't respond to emails, reads his lectures off of a sheet of notes by quoting entire sentences...",
    "The discussion sections should follow the readings and lectures more closely, instead of working through material from two or three weeks in the past.",
    "While I appreciate the specific attention this course pays to two American musical icons -- and appreciate how in depth this course goes into examining their lives and musical careers -- I think that this course expects a lot of prior technical music and historical knowledge that I would assume many students (but the handful who were constantly speaking in lecture) didn't have. There is a lot of reading and listening, making it pretty much impossible to get to every assigned word and song on top of a normal semester's course load. There is also an unnecessarily large amount of papers (one of which was due on the same day as the final paper); to my knowledge, this course does not even come with a writing credit.",
    "Michael Veal's way of teaching was very engaging. His back and forth between playing music and talking about the artists was always successful. He never lacked charisma and knows an astounding amount of information about the topics he teaches. Any question one has, no matter its specificity, will always be answered. The readings were sometimes quite a lot, and broad, but apart from this, great class.",
    "I think a strength of the course was the variety of ways through which we analyzed the two musicians. One weakness is that you aren't supposed to need music theory knowledge, yet it definitely makes it much harder if you don't.",
    "It was on interesting content, but the readings and lectures were often lackluster. The content needs to be organized so that there are other exciting things to talk about than the artists",
    "Way too many papers, 5 separate papers and a lot of weekly reading was a lot. Also, not sure I saw the need for a 20-25 person lecture and section as well, I think making lecture a bit more discussion based would improve the course.",
    "The strengths of this course are the material itself and the lectures, I was captivated every lecture and was fascinated by the music, how it all connected, and how it all came together. The weaknesses of the course were the section was pointless and a pain, and the listenings were always difficult to access, being on Canvas and often unlabeled in terms of singer they were difficult to transfer into any listening device\/easy mode of access.",
    "strengths: listenings are curated really well just for class, interesting readings, professor is clearly passionate about the subject, one of the few crosslisted courses i've taken where there is a clear effort in subject material to show the bridge between the two different subjects (in this case, afam and music) weaknesses: musical references go over the head of anyone who isn't a musician or a music major; neither TA had clear connections to african american studies or music which is shocking considering the studies of the professor and the course material (no, liking jazz music is not enough); oddly structured in having sections right after class but also demanding participation in the lectures themselves, didn't touch on most of the readings in section; almost all the authors we read are men and many of them are white, with no black female authors that i can remember; assigns too many papers for what makes sense for the length and organization of the semester, with two papers falling on the same day on the last day of reading period (would make much more sense to assign 1 introduction paper, 1 paper for coltrane, 1 paper for hendrix, and 1 final research paper)",
    "strength: prof veal is extremely knowledgeable, listening to and talking about music was engaging weakness: disorganized, section wasnt very helpful (Holly was really good, but we often talked about readings we had done weeks before and couldnt remember)",
    "Too many paper assignments! One each, rather than two each, for Coltrane and Hendrix (plus the final paper) would have been plenty.",
    "I felt that the course covered a broad range of material in sufficient detail to satisfy my interests, but it also required 26 to 35 pages of writing through the semester. I feel that could potentially qualify it as a writing credit.",
    "Professor Veal has the capacity of engaging the class in a thoughtful and dynamic conversation and to establish points of connection in a way that by the end of the semester the course forms an integrated narrative. If taught from an analytical point of view only, Music can become an exclusive subject. Approaching music from diverse perspectives, and avoiding using only music jargon, Veal's classes encourage non-musicians to be at the class, promoting interdisciplinarity.",
    "The biggest weakness of this course was how little time was given to write the papers. There were many sources to be discussed for each topic and the week that was given to submit them was oftentimes insubstantial. But otherwise, the course was excellent."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "No, there was little guidance, a disorganized schedule and a mean professor.",
    "I would only recommend this course to students who have a strong musical literacy and are prepared to engage on the subject matter in a high level of discussion. I'm a student who wasn't used to these sorts of discussions and I honestly struggled during the course. Lectures often went over my head and I wasn't able to contribute to section in meaningful ways. The subject matter was really fascinating and I enjoyed the readings, but engaging in the classroom was difficult for me personally.",
    "Yes, if they were interested in the material",
    "Not unless you're either 1. a tremendous fan of either\/both artists in the course title, and already have a working knowledge of his\/their work and genre or 2. taking this class Credit\/D. Also beware that this is a small-ish lecture and Prof. Veal cold calls on students.",
    "If you are interested in any of these two artists, or jazz and rock, I would one hundred percent recommend this course. Its workload is not overwhelming and the things you learn are amazing.",
    "I would recommend this course if you love or want to get to know the music of Coltrane and Hendrix. However, if you don't have a strong musical background, get ready for some challenges.",
    "I'm not sure. I liked the content but was disappointed by the class",
    "Yes, super interesting, but a good CDF because it was a lot.",
    "This course is great for anyone interested in Coltrane or Hendrix or just expanding their knowledge of music in the general fields. There is definitely a lot of work and a lot of writing, but if you have to be doing work, this is at least a fun thing to be working on.",
    "no i would not. while there is some interesting subject material and the professor is clearly passionate about it, the course is poorly organized which is not helped by the authors you're learning from or the TAs and the sections they lead",
    "definitely an interesting and eye opening class",
    "Yes - especially for musicians. Its very in-depth and Michael Veal really knows what hes doing. It is a fair amount of writing but also very fulfilling.",
    "If anyone is interested in either of the musicians covered or the time period in which they worked, I would highly recommend this course.",
    "Yes. John Coltrane and Jimi Hendrix are two seminal figures, not only in music but in the culture of the 20th century as a whole, and approaching their work is a way to build a bridge between academic knowledge and society.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course. Michael Veale is my favorite Yale Professor, the most eloquent person I have ever seen speak and the most knowledgeable person on the subject of music that I have ever encountered."
