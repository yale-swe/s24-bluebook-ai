   "question_text": "What knowledge, skills, and insights did you develop by taking this course?",
   "comments": [
    "This was the first class in which the focus was explicitly on the writings of queer authors and social critics. In addition to the critical nature of the class derived from the writings, the students (all eight of us) were taught how to question the world and its oppressive structures. Perhaps most importantly, it was taught that academic writing is not necessarily esoteric prose. In fact, the reality is quite the opposite--good writing is measured in part by its accessibility rather than by the number of complex words used.",
    "This course taught me how to effectively and confidently analyze and write about both theoretical academic pieces and potently emotional, personal works. As the syllabus promised, I learned to write with flair. In a very real sense, this class also allowed me to develop a more rigorous approach to my writing. The classroom environment promoted risk-taking and the formation of a distinct intellectual voice. I now understand that academic writing does not have to be without personality.",
    "This class helped me to develop my level of close reading and engagement with texts to levels that I did not know I was capable of. At first, I was scared and did not participate much, but as the class progressed I found my ability to analyze texts and write on them grow immensely. I also developed my knowledge of queer theory and found my level of understanding in that area to broaden, allowing me to feel my analytical and critical thinking skills grow deeper."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The course's main strengths were its open scholastic atmosphere (i.e. in how students were never afraid to question a certain aspect of the texts being read) and its coverage of such a broad range of topics--although the class is officially titled \"Writing Queer\", we as a class had managed to discuss essentially everything from digestive bacteria to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Since writing seminars are primarily meant to introduce students to the mechanics of writing at Yale, perhaps examples of 'good writing' (e.g. in thesis papers, dissertations, etc.) from Yale students (not limited to undergraduate students) could have been used more frequently, although even in this area the instructor was extremely effective in her critiques of our essays and in using the examples of queer writers as models of writing.",
    "This was a very strong course, particularly because our section was small and thus allowed for a high degree of participation and individual attention from our instructor. The readings chosen for our class were varied, interesting, and extremely relevant. The course itself mirrored much of its subject material in its aversion to overly-burdensome structure. It was a good introduction to some of the most important authors and pieces in intersectional queer theory, and was a great starting point for someone not previously familiar with the field.",
    "The flexibility given to instructors of the course allows the instructors to tailor the class to the needs of the specific students in the class.",
    "The strength of this course was definitely the level of cohesion in the class - there were only eight of us, and we grew close, which facilitated my learning and made me less nervous to share my writing and thoughts around people who would otherwise intimidate me. Scarlet helped with this, as well as with using texts as a lens to analyze current events and our own lives. However, I feel that the course could be improved by more lecturing on the part of Scarlet - she is immensely knowledgeable, and I would have gained more simply by listening to her insights than by the conjectures of my classmates. My favorite moments in the class were her explaining readings (especially poems), and while I gained from the ideas of my classmates, our occasional brief forays off-topic made me wish that I could be listening to Scarlet."

   "comments": [
    "I would strongly recommend this course to another student both owing to the atmosphere of critical thinking and to the class as one in which (due to the class being dubbed \"Writing Queer\") students of similar interests are able to gather and discuss their interests, meaning that the class is not simply that, but is also a group of friends.",
    "Yes.",
    "Yes, most certainly. This class was rigorous and enjoyable, a highlight of my week. It allows you to submerge yourself in writing and theory without completely dominating your schedule. As for an introduction to writing, the class was a breath of fresh air in that it promoted a fluid, natural approach. I am leaving this course as a much more confident writer and scholar, with a new appreciation for the nuance of identity and its connection to language.",
    "Writing Queer was possibly the best class I have ever taken. I would recommend it to any student, particularly one who identifies as queer. It helped me to understand myself through the lens of queerness, which I had not previously explored, and improved my level of close reading and engagement with texts. The environment that developed in the class was supportive and kind, and enhanced my learning more than I thought possible. Scarlet is kind, understanding, and hugely dedicated. This was the class that I told my friends about every day, and they were all jealous they did not take it. Definitely one of, if not the, best English 114 section. While I sometimes wished for more of a challenge in the 114 curriculum as a whole, Writing Queer is as good as it gets for a course at Yale. I was lucky to take this, especially in my first semester at Yale, and would be lucky if my future classes were half as amazing. It is not overwhelming in regards to the workload, and Scarlet does everything she can to help. My writing definitely improved from her feedback, and some of my best friends were made in the class. Without a doubt, this is a class worth taking. Scarlet's personal style and kindness always left a tear in my (left) eye."
