    "Take this class! Lots of reading required but the lecturers are spectacular and the policy memos posed provoking questions that expand your knowledge and understanding of the world.",
    "Absolutely, a must take.",
    "Definitely take it. Couldn't be more worthwhile.",
    "A great look at four different aspects of global affairs and a classic Yale class. It really gives you an in depth look at what the global affairs major is all about. Policy memos aren't nearly as bad as some people say. If Gen. McChrystal is teaching a module, take the class. He's that good. Make sure you keep up with the reading, purely because it makes lecture much more enjoyable.",
    "This class is a solid \"maybe\". Take but with caution. Lots of reading, lots of writing. Takes a lot of time to do well. Module quality tends to fluctuate. Module 1 with the generals is GREAT and I wish they could have taught for longer, but modules 2 and 4 were \"meh.\" Maybe they'll revise the course again, since some of the modules change from year to year. Great TA's, will challenge you and make you think.",
    "Not too hard course that is interesting subject matter but taught poorly. The Jackson Institute gets really cool, big-name teachers who are experts in their respective fields but are not actually good teachers.",
    "If you're interested in IR, the intro polisci class might be a better choice. The case-study approach lacked coherence and the quality of the \"module\" instructors really varied. Though impressive for their professional accomplishments, the instructors fell short on pedagogical efficacy.",
    "A decent class, but totally depends on the modules you get. One policy memo per section and an extremely long essay-based final. 2014 modules: 1. Evolving View of Conflict: This module had the potential to be very good but it wasn't. Everything was so vague and WAY too much student participation. I don't care what adjectives students associate with war, I want to hear what the Generals, who actually KNOW something, say about war. This module needs to be more specific, everything I learned came from the readings and not class. The simulation in class was embarrassing and juvenile. This module could be great but fell short. 2. Humanitarian Assistance: Fantastic. I loved Karunakara and found the material fascinating. He did just the right amount of lecture vs. class participation and kept the class moving smoothly. Engaging lecturer and great module. 3. Economic Relationship w\/ China: You can't teach an economics course without using economics. Without an appropriate economics background, this module was inaccessible. All I learned were economic terms that I memorized the definitions of but do not mean a thing to me since I don't have appropriate background. Poor choice of module. 4. Middle East: Good. Sometimes a bit disjointed, but overall my second favorite module behind the second one. Emma Sky was engaging, though the module lacked a common thread from lecture to lecture. This class did the simulation right, engaging and informative.",
    "It is a fantastic introduction to Global Affairs because of its relevant topics. The topics cover different areas in Global Affairs, from economics to humanitarian aid to security and diplomacy. The lecturers are great and extremely experienced in their fields. I would absolutely recommend this for anyone interested in Global Affairs, or just about the world around them.",
    "GLBL 101 was a really interesting class. I thoroughly enjoyed learning about current issues in depth such as the Palestinian\/ Israeli conflict, the Afghanistan War, the economic relationship between the U.S. and China, and modern humanitarianism. The readings were engaging and the module leaders had extremely insightful points of view from their extensive field experience. A great course!",
    "GLBL 101 is definitely a drag at times with the sheer amount of reading and the stress of policy memos but I think I learned a lot and do not regret taking it as an intro to the global affairs program. I know several people that decided against applying to global affairs after taking the class, but it hasn't diminished my interest at all. All the TAs seem to grade fairly and the material isn't too challenging. I would recommend to anyone genuinely interested in global affairs and would advise people hesitant about taking the class to drop if they don't love the material. Michelle was a cool professor with tons of real world experience and Mela Louise (my TA) was the baest of base, you definitely want her or Michael Eastman if you take the class and they're still TAs.",
    "An interesting course, but very surface level. People take this course because they are star-struck for the instructors who are invited to teach each module. Doesn't really give you much insight. You could just as well read the New York Times. You need to write 4 policy memos which are half of your grade, but you don't get a writing credit. The Global Affairs major is still in development, and this course is a case in point.",
    "It is a good course. Although it is about global affairs it is also pretty U.S. focused. It was not the class I thought it would be but I still enjoyed it. I think it is important to be aware of the problems happening in the world and this course helped me start that habit. It also helped me decide my major. I thought it was too much information for the semester, though. I know there are many global issues and it is important to discuss them all but three weeks per topic is a bit too short, in my opinion. Great course overall, however.",
    "Great overview of four interesting, current topics in global affairs- take it if you are at all interested in international relations\/current events. The module structure is good if you like the topics- make sure to look at them before taking the course, as the first module was pretty different from the next 3. You aren't allowed to use laptops in lecture though, which can be annoying. Professor Malvesti is great- talk to her if you can, though she won't be giving many lectures (just the first and last ones)- she's incredibly intelligent and interesting to speak with. The guest lecturers for each module vary in style and quality- none are terrible, but you will certainly like some more than others.",
    "I would recommend this course if you have any inclination towards global affairs. In fact, my time in the course helped me decide that I didn't want to major in global affairs because I had a misconception on what the major was about before I took this course. Despite not using this towards my major, I would still consider it a good use of a credit and it helped me develop skills that I will use in my chosen major. Also, on a different note, this course is very intense and you may feel like you are going to die of anxiety in the first few weeks of lecture. You'll get over it and what doesn't kill you makes you stronger.",
    "I would definitely recommend the course. It is a great freshman year or sophomore year course to dip your foot into studying international relations\/ global affairs. I felt a lot more informed about global issues and can now read global articles and feel like I really understand. There is a lot of real world application to the material taught in class.",
    "I personally wouldn't recommend GLBL 101. I'm sure there are a number of people who did overall enjoy the class but I thought it was a large mistake on my part. I did enjoy the module on humanitarian aid but overall I could've done without the other three. The information presented by some of the module speakers were often very superficial and not in depth enough to really emphasize overall themes. Also, if you discover pretty early on that global affairs isn't for you (like I and many others discovered) the class becomes pretty brutal to go through. The assigned readings are very often excessive and the policy memos take a lot of time in that you are required to analyze a situation not covered in class, using overall \"themes\" learned. A lot of work that is painful to go through if you're not completely devoted to doing global affairs.",
    "I would recommend this course to a freshman or sophomore. It gives a good overview of some current issues in international relations and provides a foundation for policy writing. The modules may not all appeal to you but the modules are short and it is nice to get a new professor every couple weeks.",
    "You should definitely take this course if you do not get into that seminar you wanted.",
    "I would recommend it for a student who is trying to figure out if global affairs is a field he\/she is interested in pursuing.",
    "I think the greatest strength is this course is exactly what it promises - an introduction to the Global Affairs major. I went into this class hoping it would give me a greater perspective on issues around the world but the subjects were scattered and I didn't learn a lot of facts - what I did learn was how to analyze current events and problem-solve.",
    "Gateway to Global Affairs is one of the best classes at Yale. It is an experience unlike any other - one that allows you to engage firsthand with global issues. I now feel more connected with the world than I ever have before and I have this course to thank for that. I recommend taking this class if you have any interest in international affairs, current events, policymaking, economics, or just want to experience something remarkable.",
    "Having these distinguished lecturers come in is really amazing. It's so cool to have people who are\/were actually professionally distinguished in the corresponding fields to speak. The problem, however, is that a lot of them aren't trained in teaching, so sometimes their lessons felt very unsubstantial. But they always have something interesting to say to make up for it.",
    "No. There are better classes. This class is not cohesive and is only good for what it is: a sampler of different global issues. It would be better to just go intense about one field of study then many. Really there are too many variables: the lecturers, the topics, the TAs. Too many thinks can misalign and lead you with a bad experience. I started sure of my interest in Global Affairs, but now I am unsure because this class seemed to be not done properly.",
    "An amazing class where you get to learn from experts in their feild.",
    "This is a survey course over a few relevant current events on a global scale. Each of four modules lasts about three weeks, and at the end of each you have to write a 1500-2000 word policy memo, which is not too bad. The reading is typically very interesting and manageable, and I would definitely recommend the course. One of my favorite at Yale so far.",
    "I initially was hesitant to take this course too, but I'm glad I did. Even though it's not required to be a global affairs major, I think it's a really great overview of it's about. And for me, I realized that I did care a lot about Global Affairs and decided to apply to the major. The modules were all very interesting and policy briefs weren't that hard. You had to really get the format and what they wanted though. Also make sure you turn your policy brief on time! They will be harsh about grading in that regard. The biweekly runs up Hillhouse at 11:59 were always fun because you could see other people running up with you.",
    "It's a great survey course and a good way to get some exposure to the Global Affairs major. That said, most of the curriculum can be learned from reading the newspaper every day.",
    "Amazing class. Take it.",
    "I would say GLBL 101 is a survey, real-world application course of global affairs. I would recommend it to any student who is interested in current issues and especially those who are considering majoring in Global Affairs. It is a great way to get acquainted with the field and with people involved with the Jackson Institute.",
    "Gateway to Global Affairs is an excellent course to take if you are unsure of what you want to do but are interested in the international community. While the four modules are broad and don't get into the nitty gritty details of the issues, they definitely give the students a clear understanding of the topics. I really enjoyed this course and would recommend it to a fellow student.",
    "I highly recommend Gateway to Global Affairs to anyone interested in International Relations or to get a littler deeper understanding of what is going on in the world. This class made it so I had to keep up with current affairs, usually I make excuses for why I can't keep up, but it gave me a reason to. And now that I've written policy memos on different international situations, I'll continue to follow these events to see what the outcomes are.",
    "I would recommend this class to another student because it was a good preview to the many different aspects of the global affairs major.",
    "The class is divided into four modules (the module topics vary from year to year), each one taught by a different guest lecturer. It meets twice a week, plus an additional time for section. At the end of each module, we have to submit a policy brief and there is one final exam at the end. Overall, an interesting class with a manageable workload.",
    "YES. Excellent class for an introduction to Global affairs\/international relations. You also get lectures with really interesting people! A must take!",
    "Take this class if you have an interest in current affairs and would like to get some broad brush about a few important issues. The quality of each module will vary, sometimes dramatically, but you'll enjoy the class if you have a genuine interest. If you know a lot already however, this class can be boring and your time is better spent elsewhere.",
    "Great class, I recommend it to anyone, even those not interested in Poli Sci or Global Affairs. Was my favorite course this semester, and don't worry about which T.F. you get they're all good. The modules cover a wide range of topics so even if you find one not so interesting in a few weeks you'll be on to something completely different. The module leaders are awesome and have first hand experience at the top of their respective fields. (ex: General McChrystal for the modern warfare module and Dr. Karunakara for the humanitarian aid module.)",
    "I would recommend this course for someone interested in getting exposure to a wide range of topics. Yet, I would dissuade a person already interested and knowledgeable about certain aspects of global affairs from this course because they might find it not as in-depth as they might like.",
    "Global is very interesting sometimes and very boring others, depending on the guest lecturer. Not too much work except for the two days before policy memos are due which are very stressful. Section was helpful and generally interesting.",
    "Take it if you're wondering about whether you want to major in global affairs, or if you want experience researching today's issues.",
    "Very interesting course but make sure you are interested in all 4 modules in the semester not just the interesting one at the beginning Becuase you will have to write a paper on each subject. Good course, significant amount of reading if you do it all, policy memo style essays",
    "An intro course to Global Affairs w\/ 4 modules. Some may be interesting to you, some may not. However, all hold valuable information. At some points, may seem more advanced than is reasonable. Workload is challenging but absolutely not impossible.",
    "I would recommend it to a Middle East major",
    "I would recommend it if you have never written a policy memo and want to hear a few interesting lecturers.",
    "I would definitely recommend Gateway to any student. The topics are all interesting and it gives a great overview of the topic. Also it is amazing to hear from some of the top professionals in their fields on work they have done and experiences they have had.",
    "Learn about history and apply it to current events. It's really cool.",
    "Yes, I'd absolutely recommend this course! There were definitely times when I was completely lost and confused and felt like the most stupid and nave person on the planet, but then I think back to all of the great conversations with people in my section and all of the 'aha!' moments in lecture or readings. And then I realize the incredible quantity and quality of what I learned. The material is difficult, for sure. (Example: during the China econ module with Stephen Roach, the School of Management grad students in my section admitted it was hard. And then there was me, a lowly freshman who's never taken econ, trying to do the same coursework as them.) But if you actually care about the issues and work really hard to process all of the info (biggest piece of advice, hang out with your discussion section!), then this course is totally and completely worth it. YAY GATEWAY",
    "This class is a broad overview of several global issues. It's good for understanding the complexity of issues without solving them. It's frustrating because of its broadness.",
    "Only take it if you are interested in current global affairs. Otherwise the material is complicated and heavy. But the speakers and lectures are nice.",
    "The class is formatted into four modules, each with its own lecturer and a policy memo assignment. If you're self-motivated and interested in global affairs, most of the curriculum can be leaned from reading books and the news on your own. However, you get to hear from lecturers with fantastic careers and experiences, and the class is fairly engaging for one so big.",
    "Great foundation\/introduction to important current affairs issue. By nature, very survey-like and surface-level, but if that's what you're looking for, highly recommend.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS!!! Even if you are not intending to pursue Global Affairs as a major - this is a great class to engage with currents news and materials. The class is split into 4 modules and each lecturer is top in their field. The short policy memo's at the end of each module are actually enjoyable to write and research, and the TA's are always helpful and available. I also liked how although the class was a lecture, there was still encouragement to participate during lecture. I enjoyed the varied simulations was conducted in class. Absolutely fantastic - no weaknesses.",
    "I would very much recommend the lecture portion of the class to another student who is interested in learning about several important issues from interesting and engaging people. However, I can not recommend the discussion section with Mr. Eastman because of his inappropriate behavior.",
    "Its a broad introduction to four significant global topics. Each module is taught by an expert in the topic.",
    "GLBL 101 is an introductory international relations course that explores four different topics that are affecting the world today. I recommend it to anyone who is interested in global affairs and wants to delve a little into different global themes to narrow their interests or just explore four major themes in one course. At the end of each module, you write a policy memo on a topic related to a major element of the module.",
    "I would definitely recommend Gateway to Global to anyone who wishes to broaden their understanding of world events. It covers material that is pivotal in the future of our community, both locally and internationally. It is well organized but had a very large workload.",
    "It's a show class for Yale. You get to learn from leaders in their field, however, the modules don't necessarily contain things you're interested in. Because of the number of modules in the course, everything is covered on quite a superficial level, so this is not the class for you if you're looking to go in-depth into a subject area, hence 'gateway'. Nevertheless, it's a highly enjoyable and engaging class where you get to learn from experts, about topical and relevant issues."
