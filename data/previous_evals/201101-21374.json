    "For undergrads - this class is a good opportunity to see how sociology research is done firsthand and to understand everything that goes into the publication of an article. At least this year, there wasn't a whole lot of additional work beyond reading and critiquing the weekly papers, and I think having some additional work\/readings might have helped me learn more. On the whole, though, it is definitely interesting if you are a sociology mahjor."
