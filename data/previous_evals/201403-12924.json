   "comments": [
    "Definitely take it, if you're looking for a fast German immersion that isn't too overwhelming.",
    "This class is a really fun way to learn German! Every day, we do all sorts of activities -- the 50 minutes go by in a flash. This is not the boring vocab-memorization beginning language class that you are picturing. If you need to fulfill a language requirement or are thinking of starting a new language, I would definitely recommend this class! Especially with Professor Schenker!",
    "definitely recommend it (at least with Schenker), but, you know, it's good to learn german.",
    "This class will be tricky if you lack an affinity or talent for languages and have not studied German before. That said, it will be rewarding if you're prepared to put in the work.",
    "I would recommend GMAN 110 to another student if they are interested in learning a new language. It is very important to be committed to the class and stay on top of the material every day.",
    "I would recommend this course to other students",
    "Schenker is a great professor, lowkey intense but completely competent\/worth it. Class at 1030 is prime as well. Not too early, not too far into your day either.",
    "German 110 is an outstanding course for any student interested in learning German. The professor is phenomenal, the course is engaging and pleasantly challenging, and the class is perfectly suited to introductory students. I would highly recommend this course to all students.",
    "if you don't want to learn german obviously not. if you do then maybe, i think maybe it isn't worth wasting an entire credit and a half of your scarce yale credits, and that german is something you might be able to learn equally well and equally quickly basically anywhere else. on the other hand, i did appreciate taking a language class this semester because i was taking mostly very conceptual classes like math physics and philosophy and this course seemed like a break and a good way to start my day. so it really depends on your personal schedule and academic plans."
