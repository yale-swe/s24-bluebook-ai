    "This class is a must take! I learned so, so much. The class deepened my understanding of the Old Testament and made me realize how much there is to discuss in each Biblical story. As someone who hadn't really looked at these stories since fourth grade, it was incredible to go back and see how rich they all are and what they can tell us about both Biblical society and our own.",
    "An intro course to feminist and literary interpretations of female characters - challenging text wise - but wonderful as the teacher encourages you to have your own input...",
    "take it! an interesting radical look at the old testament",
    "This is an incredibly interesting topic and it's one you will get a lot out of, especially if you're interested\/have experience in biblical exigesis or feminist studies before. I would recommend this course based solely on the fact that it's so fascinating. That said, the prof is crazy and for some reason it was always a mad scramble to obtain the readings - there was no course packet and no way to buy them, she would forget to email them out, etc. - and the whole grade is based on one monster of a final paper - ahh.Summary: Never have I been so confused while taking a course, but now that it's over I can tell I did get a lot out of it.",
    "This was hands-down the best class I've taken in my three years at Yale. The workload was manageable, so we all could actually do all the assigned readings and have meaningful discussions (as opposed to some courses where students are assigned an overwhelming 400+ pages of reading per week, and end up doing none of it). The class was structured very well, with units on the major female characters of the Hebrew Bible. Each week we had readings from the text as well as literary and feminist critiques of the text.Professor Polliack really made the class fantastic. She has the rare blend of encyclopedic knowledge of the Biblical text, its commentators and criticism -- and a motherly patience with us as we grappled with the text, commentators, and our own interpretations. What an amazing teacher. I am sad that she is only visiting for this one year."
