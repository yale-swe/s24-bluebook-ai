   "comments": [
    "I would not recommend this class. The class felt like a requirement class, not a class taught because there was a super amount to teach on the subject. I cannot say I am really any more prepared to write my senior thesis after having taken the class. Maybe I'm just slow; I don't know if it was me or the class. The one major benefit of the class was the people. This is a class of the majors, and I feel like religious studies majors are super fun, super nice, super my type of people. (hurray for rlst majors!!). It could also be that Lofton brought out the personality of the class. But I feel like I bonded in the class with my peers more than I have in any other class at Yale.",
    "Not too many people take this class out of major, but you do learn a lot if you are interested in a survey of the religious studies department at Yale and the ways that you can evolve your thinking as a scholar in the study of religion.",
    "Yes, absolutely, Professor Lofton will change the way you think for the better.",
    "This class is fantastic (especially if taught by Lofton!) It really teaches students how to look at and analyze material (even if you are not an expert in it), and how to look at and criticize the methodology of studying religion. It is cool to trace the same subject all semester as well, and to get good feedback on those papers. For class presentations, you meet one-on-one with other professors in the department, which was a great way to get to know professors better - and they are all really helpful! 100% would recommend (if taught by Lofton!)",
    "RLST 490 is a great class. I learned a lot about the best practices for doing religious studies scholarship, and I now feel very prepared for my senior thesis. It was interesting to read the works of so many members of Yale's religious studies department. The writing assignments, which forced us to focus on one object for four papers, was really fun and interesting. The only frustrating part of the class was that the discussions often got very technical because there was no overarching theme to the class; there were no main ideas to which we could relate the readings, so we focused too much on the content of the readings themselves.",
    "I would recommend RLST 490 with Professor Lofton to any student not afraid of having philosophical discussions and discussions about religion and how it is studied. This is truly a methodology class - time is spent dissecting how an author (always a professor within Yale's RLST department) approaches his subject and his errors and successes in his approach. This learning in methodology is then applied in a series of intertwined papers on a topic of your choice. Though this may sound dull, it is not! Every seminar meeting was lively and engaging. As many have said before, everyone remotely interested in religion or American religious history should take a class with Professor Lofton before they graduate. Her energy and passion for her field are infectious and she wholeheartedly wants each one of her students to succeed."
