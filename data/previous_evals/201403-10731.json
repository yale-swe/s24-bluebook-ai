   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this course to anyone that is interested in improving their Greek and their understanding of the development of Greek literature. The syllabus for this course makes it one of the more challenging survey courses because it takes on works that are less obviously connected than those in other survey courses.",
    "This course is a whirl-wind tour of Greek poetry. Because there is so much material to get through, the course is fast-paced and, naturally, not everything can be discussed in depth. To say there is a lot of reading would be an understatement. I imagine that the course varies greatly depending upon who's teaching it."

   "comments": [
    "The course covered huge chunks of the Greek reading list and prepared us for both the oral and written Greek exams. Most of the literature was new to me but I felt that class discussions were useful. I also feel that I understand Latin literary history better now from knowing the Greek precedent.",
    "This course was invaluable because it provided a framework to read many, many works of literature that I have had no previous experience with.",
    "Fundamental overview of Greek poetry, which will inform all my subsequent work in this and related areas.",
    "Prof. Bakker hit upon a wide variety of topics on all texts discussed and also drew our attention to questions that warrant further research. As a result, I've developed interests in particular authors and themes on the basis of which I can focus my reading."
