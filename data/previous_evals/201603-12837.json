   "comments": [
    "I feel as if I finished the course with a good grasp on the field of metric analysis and many questions that have yet to be answered in the field.",
    "The course was very organized and had a nice diversity of subtopics\/repertoires within the topic of meter. There were some occasions (maybe two) when the pace was a bit slow; Rick would be explaining a topic to ensure everyone was following, and when asked about the pace, none of us wanted to make anyone else feel uncomfortable, so we said it was fine. I think this happened when discussing the Rahn & Pressing, and maybe one other time... Not sure how everyone else felt, and we definitely could\/should have spoken up about it, but just wanted to let you know. Also loved the feedback! Was a bit harsher than I anticipated, but it definitely helped me to know what was strong about my writing and presentations, and what could be improved. And if something was acknowledged as being improved, I knew that it was a genuine remark. Glad to have gotten such feedback early on, so I can think about it as I look forward to conference presentations and article submissions.",
    "This course was very engaging and fun. The short exercises and presentations were effective way of learning and applying the new material.",
    "I have only positive comments. The course is well structured, the readings are dense but reasonable, discussions were open and friendly. Your comments on papers were very helpful. I really like the system of doing student seminars at the end, and I like that the workload is spread out over the course. I found the course extremely useful in learning to analyze meter, and in generally developing the ability to think like a theorist. I appreciated your flexibility with our differing approaches and skill sets."
