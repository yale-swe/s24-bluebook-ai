   "comments": [
    "So much fun! If you have the privilege of being accepted into this seminar, by all means take it. You will read a lot and learn a lot.",
    "very little written work but if you really participate verbally you get a ton out of the class",
    "This is a great class. Every week you have one or two papers to read and then for two hours you discuss them. Your entire grade is based off of participation and one class where you present the paper, so you really need to read and understand every paper we read. If you are willing to put the time in to do that, it is a very rewarding class. If you don't want to spend the time to read the papers, then this class is not for you.",
    "This is the best bio class I've taken at yale. It's a Tom of work but reading and presenting papers is a really important skill and if you put the work in you'll get a ton out of it",
    "MCDB 435 is a small seminar for upperclassmen that focuses on key papers in the history of cell biology. It involves reading 2 papers a week (all of which are fascinating), and then spending 2 hrs once every week discussing it with your classmates. The professors direct the discussions in a way that really forces you to dig deep and think critically. This is one of the best science classes I have taken at Yale, and I truly believe it has made me a better scientist and thinker.",
    "I definitely recommend this course!",
    "Good course to take during a semester with Med School interviews; not too heavy, and meets once a week. Don't underestimate the workload though: some of the papers you'll review require more time than others.",
    "I would recommend 435 to other MCDB students because it is not only a great course, but also is taught by two professors who are devoted to students coming out of their class with a better understanding of biology and skills for presenting research.",
    "Landmark Papers is a rare MCDB seminar that gives you an opportunity to discuss papers that you really wouldn't get in another setting. It's a class that definitely gets better as the semester goes on. As everyone learns what's important to understand for each paper (usually focusing on the figures and the methods), the discussions move more quickly and it's not as stressful to hear your name be chosen from the bucket (which you'll come to know and love\/hate by the end of the course). If you're willing to take the time to prepare thoroughly for each meeting, this can be a great course. But don't sign up for Landmark Papers if you're only taking it because it seems to have a light workload...not everyone who wants to take it always gets in, and the discussions would be painful if people who weren't at all interested were in the course.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS. Best class in the MCDB dept, and one of the best at Yale. A wonderful way to synthesize everything you have learned in your biology lecture courses while discussing seminal papers that defined the field. The intimate setting is great, you really get to know the professors and your classmates. Overall, a perfect class, you must take it!!!",
    "Even if you don't want to take this class, take it. If you want to be a scientist, this class is essential. You learn so much in one semester from Mooseker and Rosenbaum--even after a couple week, I noticed a huge improvement in my comprehension, in my critical thinking, and in how I approached biological questions and problems. Discussion in a science class is definitely a treat, and Mooseker and Rosenbaum, especially Mooseker, are not only amazing researchers, but amazing and experienced TEACHERS. They really care about you, the class, and what you get out of the class. This is definitely a highlight of my Yale career, and it's a shame that there aren't MORE classes like this.",
    "Take this class! This is a wonderful course. I have never been more satisfied with a biology course in all my four years. The class is an excellent opportunity to synthesize the information that we have learned in the core courses in an interesting and meaningful way. Both professors are experts in their field which is always useful when digging into these fairly complex papers. I have certainly benefited from their expertise. This class is a gem in the biology department and the only improvement would be to offer more sections of the class so that other people can benefit from the experience.Having said that, the group tends to be self selecting so be prepared to do work. Also, this class may be a challenge if you do not like speaking up. The professors are very encouraging so you really shouldn't be hesitant to do so."
