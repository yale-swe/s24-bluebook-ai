    "Many, many! A wonderful course that helps students improve our critical thinking skills as well as a place to further develop our introspective capacities as we prepare to face the daunting environmental challenges of the modern age.",
    "Great personal development, good conversations, lots of thinking and reflecting on community and identity",
    "The biggest insight I took away was the importance of integration across disciplines and self awareness.",
    "Insights into -- and practice pondering -- the value systems, worldviews, etc. that humans (ourselves included) hold both consciously and unconsciously, along with the ways those personal paradigms translate into collective views that shape and get shaped by the structure and activity of a given society. I appreciated the time we spent contemplating and discussing the value of interdisciplinarity as a standard operating procedure in problem-solving endeavors, as well as Susan's unwavering emphasis on maintaining \"a commonwealth of human dignity\" as the ultimate end-goal in efforts to address humankind's numerous and diverse issues.",
    "Better understanding of my own standpoint and positionality, and how that influences the work I want to do.",
    "This course allows me to develop a broader personal and professional perspective. I learnt a lot about myself and how to face professional challenges."

    "More class time! More written feedback could be helpful, too.",
    "Strengths: Personal vulnerability, introspection, metacognitive tasks, good debates Weaknesses: None!",
    "organization could be improved, and the communication on course work expectations was not clear. I think a clear organized class would be easier to follow.",
    "I appreciated the freeform-ness of the whole thing; it was nice not to have too many class-related expectations placed on us aside from weekly journals and readings. It made me feel like we were really free to come into class and get down and dirty with pondering and philosophizing. It also helped that the class size was relatively small; it made our discussions seem more intimate and personal, as though each of us could take what was being said to heart and respond as frankly as we pleased (as might be the case in an informal conversation with a friend or peer). I don't think it's very easy to foster that kind of atmosphere in a classroom, but I'd say Susan and Dina succeeded at doing so. Which brings me to another well-worth-mentioning strength of the course: our TA, Dina. She was absolutely incredible and such a joy to be around and learn from. The only suggestion for this course that comes to mind is about feedback on journals. I would've liked to get some more personal feedback each week (or even just some weeks) on my journals from Susan and Dina. That's only because I have no experience with philosophy-esque thinking, so I would've been interested to hear their thoughts on my writings."

   "comments": [
    "Take it - and make sure to find time to spend with Professor Clark outside of the classroom. It is in those moments that you can most figure out how to push your thinking further.",
    "Take this class! You will learn a lot, and you will think a lot!",
    "Very light load. Focus in class, though it might be tough, because there are rare moments important information is shared. I learned more from the TA and my peers than the professor.",
    "Keep up with the readings, and even if you're shy, try to contribute to class discussions (with worthwhile comments\/questions) as much as you can make yourself. You'll benefit from getting in the ring and tossing ideas around with the other students.",
    "I think it helps to have taken Prof Clark's Foundations of Natural Resource Policy and Management before, though it is not required, because it provides a basis and grounding for the type of work done in this class.",
    "Commit yourself to this course."
