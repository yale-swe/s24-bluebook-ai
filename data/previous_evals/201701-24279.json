   "question_id": "GS403",
   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I really liked the format. A genuine feeling that we were all trying to explore this area together rather than following a predetermined line of reasoning laid out by professor Gorski. The downside was of course that at certain points we did end up walking around in circles, getting lost on irrelevant sidetracks and occasionally getting awkwardly stuck having to return to square one.",
    "The only strength is that some readings are very good and worthwhile. Weaknesses: You are expected to read one book per week and write a short book review each week. Ridiculous. The class is 2 straight hours of discussion. Every single class. What ends up happening is that a small handful of people who actually are engaged or care about their grades or like to hear themselves talk will air their views for the majority of those 2 hours while everyone else sits and waits for it all to be over.",
    "Given that the topic was so vague and complex, structure could have made this class far more engaging. While an open discussion format is awesome, if that devolves into everyone merely offering their own opinion, that can get tough if it happens every class. Focusing on a few aspects of populism and having everyone read the same material could help narrow discussion, which could in turn encourage quieter voices to speak up!",
    "Weakness: the course structure made it easy to invest very little energy and scrape by none-the-less. I would encourage more outside-of-class groups (we complained about scheduling difficulties, but I doubt this would have been the case if it were presented as a hard requirement) as a way to encourage reading and discussion. Strength: the course was very flexible with respects to allowing students to apply key lessons and material to their areas of interest regarding populism. I also appreciated the flexible structure of reading assignment.",
    "The course's strength was the instructor's demeanour. He was patient, sincerely collaborative, and manoeuvred discussion productively. The course's weaknesses include the reading list, class participation format, and the subject matter itself. The newness of the seminar's topic is responsible for each of these problems. However, the instructor should not have allotted different reading material to different students, which made class discussion dissonant. The reading list should be modified too, with fewer books - especially those on the syllabus at the moment - and more excerpts and articles."

   "comments": [
    "Absolutely. Though suspect the nature of the course would be different.",
    "DO NOT take this course. It is phenomenally boring and a waste of time.",
    "I absolutely recommend this course, given what's happening in the world. I think a bit more formality might be useful, but the class and Prof's approach were welcoming to all and quite interesting.",
    "For a self-directed student with an interest in the topic, yes, I would recommend the course.",
    "Yes, because the opportunity to discuss subject materials with Gorski is well worth the negatives."
