    "This course will teach you to think about objects in an entirely different way. Magaziner is one of the sharpest professors I've ever had. That being said, only take this class if you are passionate about art\/technology. If you're just taking it for the Africa content or theoretical content on modernity, the readings may not necessarily keep you captivated.",
    "Although I'm honestly still not entirely sure what this class was about, I recommend it anyway! You'll read a wide variety of really interesting material--from essays on art history and urban planning to novels to books about infrastructure, biomedicine, religion, and radio--which all come together in a cohesive, fascinating way. The class is A LOT of work--often around 200 pages of reading and a reading response every week, but the work pays off. Instead of a final essay or research project, you'll be asked to create 6 blog posts over the course of the semester. Each post analyzes an object (broadly interpreted) through the lens of the themes discussed in class. (The biggest challenge is keeping up with the posts over the course of the semester.)",
    "Excellent course. Dan is an incredible professor: very thoughtful seminar leader, assigns excellent readings, and a great person overall. This class is a little all over the place, which could be a good thing if you're looking for a lot of methodological diversity\/exposure to different ways, but a little disorienting at first. But it all comes together in the final assignment, which will force you to synthesize the various readings that don't really look like they fit in at first. Excellent course, take it (and anything else he teaches) if you can.",
    "Probably my favourite seminar at Yale. The readings are really interesting. It is a lot of work but definitely wokr that you want to do.",
    "This class was SO much more work than I bargained for, but I also learned way more than I bargained on. I will never look at African art or Western representation of Africa. Honestly a life changing and mind shift-altering class. And Magaziner is one of the best professors you'll ever have at this school.",
    "Take this class. You will learn a lot about so many things about Africa. And you will have some riveting discussions in class. The readings are a bit bulky but you will want to read them because they are super interesting.",
    "Amazing class, really. Transformed my approach to objects and to studying history through the built environment. Incredible conversations and incredible energy A ton of reading, and everyone came fully prepared every time. Not out of fear; out of excitement. One of the best academic experiences of my entire career.",
    "I would recommend it if you are very interested in art.",
    "Yes I would recommend it. Magaziner is a great teacher, and the material is super interesting. Chances are, you'll learn something in this class that you wouldn't learn anywhere else at Yale.",
    "One of the best courses I've taken at Yale--you must take a class with Magaziner before you graduate! This course covers a hodgepodge of topics related to the concept of \"modernity,\" and flies you through a dozen locations on the African continent, and Magaziner's open-ended assignment style makes it best for a student who already has background knowledge or interest in Africa.",
    "Take it. Don't pass up a chance to take a seminar with Magaziner.",
    "Definitely take this course (or any with professor Magaziner). He knows very much and will introduce you to material\/concepts that are neglected\/excluded from syllabi. African history is very interesting and a huge field--there's so much to learn. This class was very interesting--thinking about art and technology was both an interesting approach to specific circumstances and widely useful to other areas of history."
