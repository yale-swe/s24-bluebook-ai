   "comments": [
    "Broad understanding of the immune system, T\/B cells and related processes, and how these contribute towards global health initiatives and general healthy living.",
    "Not much",
    "I have a better understanding of how the immune system works.",
    "You gain a great understanding of the immune system.",
    "I developed a tremendous amount of knowledge in biology and a way to apply it to other viruses\/diseases etc. This sight was incredibly insightful and exciting to learn all the specific facts about immunity and why our body works the way it does, why our immune system reacts in certain ways with pathogens and the like, and why our immune systems can self-destruct. This course was so fascinating as I learned about why things that happen in our body happen, like food poisoning.",
    "This class gave me a more in-depth insight into immunology than I had received in high school\/prior to college.",
    "I understood more about interesting parts of our immune system that I never really thought about. The mechanisms of both the innate and adaptive immune system helped us to understand the biology of diseases such as influenza, HIV, HPV, etc. Also, the fact that there are positive effects to having bacteria in our body.",
    "I learned all about basic biology and the immune system, tied with some excellent literature and interesting current topics.",
    "Learned much of the mechanisms that are involved in an immune response.",
    "I learned in-depth how the immune system works, how certain virus and infections operate like HIV and influenza, and how a vaccine works.",
    "I gained a really shaky understanding of how the immune system works. I took this class for the science credit, so that's enough for me.",
    "I learned a lot about the immune system and the microbiome. I also gained a better understanding of disease pathology, the history of scientific research, the workings of vaccines, and how culture can affect perceptions of illness and disease.",
    "I learned much about our immune system and various contagions (as the course title indicates). This course was definitely a lot more interesting than I first believed, and has actually helped to change my view of pathogens.",
    "I learned a great deal about the human immune system along with its many facets, and various infectious diseases.",
    "This class provides a detailed explanation of the human immune system and diseases relevant to humans in the 21st century.",
    "I was able to gain a substantive understanding of biology and disease in general",
    "I learned more about the immune system and diseases than I thought I could ever know, as a non-STEM person. Images and diagrams are also helpful in tackling some of the material."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Lecture slides could be structured better so that students can review them later. More words, fewer pictures. Also, the TAs prepared really useful tables and drawings to help structure and clarity the course material. I wish these were included in the course booklet.",
    "The professor is very aware that a lot of students taking this course are just doing it for the science credit, so she does a great job of combining hard scientific knowledge with reminders about why we should care--the social context surrounding HIV for example.",
    "The strengths are that Paula Kavathas is honestly the best professor and performs demonstrations at the beginning of most classes to help students visually learn. In addition, you will take trips to the medical school and YUAG for a wonderful and enlightening experience. You will leave this class with a very good grasp of the material.",
    "The p-sets were fair and easy to complete if you reviewed the lecture material from that week. The class required a lot of reading for section. While it was pretty interesting and the topics accompanied one another nicely, there wasn't enough time during section to discuss everything.",
    "This class had many interesting topics in it that informed us more of immunobiology. For the next session, it would be nice to just exclude the book portion in general; the books connected to the topic, but it would have been nice to spend more time reviewing the actual material taught since sometimes they did not make sense.",
    "This course was incredibly enjoyable, and time flew by during lecture. I learned so much about how the immune system functions, and enjoyed the tie into literature and the real world - beyond just the science of the subject.",
    "Well designed course in that it wasn't overwhelming, espcially for a non STEM major, but somewhat disorganized at times.",
    "It's not too difficult and fairly interesting! Paula is wonderful and the TFs are constantly supportive and informative",
    "This stem course for non-stem majors has a wonderful amount of support such as printed out lecture slides, and a book make by the professor with all the relevant material for the course. One weakness of the course, in my opinion is that it is easy to walk in and immediately get intimidated because there are a lot of biology terms thrown around at the beginning so it feels easy to get lost. I suggest devoting either a section or one class time to covering very basic material and terms that will be applied throughout the course.",
    "Professor Kavathas cares so much! I actually felt bad about how little effort I put into the course. The material is presented well, if your high school biology background is weak there isn't much review material.",
    "Really great TFs!",
    "Strengths: - PowerPoints were organized and understandable - problem sets tested the material from lecture and external readings Weaknesses: - some of the books were unnecessary",
    "This class is very well equipped for students whose primary area of study might not be hard science. It asks students to engage with material and readings, which are very easy to respond to. Sometimes the material becomes too scientific and jargon-y, but it overall is very approachable.",
    "I really enjoyed this class overall and have very few suggestions. I thought it was well taught and well organized and that TA's were also incredibly effective at teaching.",
    "Outlines that were given at the start of every lecture were very helpful throughout the course, as well as the red booklet. Lectures were very engaging and aided in doing the problem sets. The lectures and problem sets could be more tailored to helping students prepare for the actual exams, which were much different from the former."

   "comments": [
    "Yes, I absolutely loved this course and Professor Kavathas. She truly cares about every student and made the lectures interactive, fun, and personable.",
    "YES! Take this class instead of another gut science credit (astrophysics, etc.) because you will actually learn a lot of useful material. The class is relatively small, and Prof. Kavathas is a really kind and effective instructor.",
    "No. If you're looking for a gut science, you will find it in this course, but you will also be incredibly bored and get nothing out of it. I'm sure there are other ways to get a science credit that are more interesting",
    "It's not a gut science (memorization is heavy even if it's conceptually very manageable), but the teachers are sweet, and you can learn something without too much exertion.",
    "Yes, it's an awesome science credit and Paula is the best!",
    "Yes! If you want to learn about immunity and contagion in a way that it will stick to you and you will get a true grasp of why our body works the way it does, TAKE IT! Also there are incredible field trips you go on like the medical school and the YUAG. The books you read are amazing as well.",
    "Yes, this is a good class for someone who is interested in immunology\/bio but doesn't need to take the intro modules.",
    "I would recommend this course to other students if they need to fulfill their science distributional requirement. The material is interesting and it doesn't go too in-depth into biology which is a blessing.",
    "This course was very enjoyable and informative! It is perfect for those who are interested in the science field but are not necessarily made for the lab. It provided a really wonderful view into the field of immunity and contagion, and the field trips and literature were fantastic.",
    "Take it if you need a science credit! Definitely a better alternative to the intro science courses.",
    "The final is long and you realize at the end of the class that you've learned a lot. But it's pretty painless and gentle learning along the way!",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. If you are not pre-med or are not well acquainted with biology, this course introduces you the immune system in a way that will make you care and be engaged. The course could also be interdisciplinary with conversations about politics and ethics surrounding scientific research and development.",
    "I took this hoping it would be an interesting gut. It's actually good, well taught class. I would recommend this more if you're someone who was into science in high school but isn't a STEM major. I think I would have gotten a lot more out of the class if I'd put more time into it (which I was never going to do).",
    "Yes. This an interesting science credit, unlike some others. I genuinely liked what I was learning. I think the grading is fair and predictable, and the exams are straightforward for those who studied.",
    "YES! It's a very interesting class and you're guaranteed to learn something you probably never knew before. That said, it's a SC credit so expect to some memorization of science-y material, but it's not too difficult.",
    "I would highly recommend this course if you are interested at all in the immune system and\/or need a fun science credit.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to other students, particularly non-Science majors. It offers fascinating and useful material about human immunology.",
    "I would recommend this to anyone interested in learning about disease, biology and public health",
    "Yes, it was an interesting course to take (especially coming from a non-STEM person like me!)-- it can get dry at some periods, but it is useful knowledge.",
    "This isn't a gut, though it is a fairly \"fun\" science course for non-majors. Professor Kavathas did everything in her power to make the information accessible and approachable."
