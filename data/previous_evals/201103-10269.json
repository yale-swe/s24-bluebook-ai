    "Fantastic class to take on Gender\/Sexuality studies, really a unique and engaging course that will teach you not only about the field of gender and sexuality but also broaden your understanding on submitting and publishing an article. After taking the class I feel like I can critique articles well, and I can even critique my own work better too.",
    "I would recommend this class in particular to people with a specific research project in mind -- the more research you have done in advance, the better the class is, because then you can focus more on the problems of writing an article (versus the problems of writing a paper)",
    "This was an excellent course and a great introduction to the nuances of what it takes to get a paper published."

    "This class helped me research and write a future dissertation chapter! (Which is truly exciting). I want to continue my research in the upcoming years.",
    "I don't think I will continue the project I started in this class, but it was a great experience in writing a longer, more involved research paper (certainly the most involved I have done in grad school up to this point)"
