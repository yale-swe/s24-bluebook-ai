    "Take it if you want to know a former's president point of view of the world. The class requires a lot of time in order to do the readings and reading responses. Overall, I don't regret taking the class.",
    "A great course: you will go through a solid cross section of all of the issues facing the world in regards to globalization (i.e historical nature of globalization, financial liberalization, migration, effects on the poor (in developing vs developed countries), contagion and crisis, bilateral vs multilateral trade agreements, etc...). It's worthwhile because the course is not an echo-chamber of pro-globalization rhetoric; I would argue a majority of the readings come the perspective of skeptics, which makes the course interesting.Warning: a lot of reading (several hundred pages a week + reading response). Seems like a lot but you get used to it.And my advice to future classes: try to meet up as fellow classmates outside of the scheduled class period. It sometimes feels like you don't have enough time to get to know each other and discuss the ideas of the class.",
    "You need to learn further by yourself in order to understand the topics of the class.",
    "The class basically lists the generally known arguments for and against globalization without going into much depth. This is because the course covers a wide variety of topics and most of the class is spent listening to students rehash the readings. Professor Zedillo is great but exposure to him (and his ideas) is very limited.",
    "Great look at the most important topics in globalization today, from immigration to inequality to financial flows. I would recommend it but mention that student presentations are a majority of the class and at times can drag on."
