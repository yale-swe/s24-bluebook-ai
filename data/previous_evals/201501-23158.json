    "I would certainly recommend the class for other graduate historians. The necessity to put together a very disparate collection of scholarship that exists thus far into some kind of sensible and informative narrative of citizenship was both challenging and satisfying. Professor Sorkin has a lot to teach and graduate historians would gain a huge amount from his knowledge and experience. It also offers a flexible opportunity to engage in a historiographical investigation into an issue of one's own choosing for the final paper.",
    "Yes I would recommend it. It is key to explore the background of the concept citizenship and how it has been built, so the person can have a better perspective of today's society.",
    "I would certainly recommend this course to another student."

    "The seminars benefitted my development as a graduate historian and the assignment flexibility allowed me to make the most of the course regarding my own research interests.",
    "I want to focus on immigration polices. To learn how the concept citizenship has been built and how toleration and equality has been built in our societies it is key to understand were we are, to question some assumption that western societies does regarding welcoming immigrants and to design future policies from new perspectives. It is also interesting to see that history is full of continuities and that our society is not exempt of these continuities, on the contrary, it is important to recognize them."
