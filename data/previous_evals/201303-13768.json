    "The readings are good. I like the structure and flow of topics week to week.",
    "The course was highly disorganized and it often seemed success was based upon how you could agree with the instructor's own ideas. The lack of structure could be improved upon.",
    "Strengths - interesting variety of health econ topics, small class size so easy for class discussionsWeaknesses - though the overall course structure was very well-defined, actual class was a little disorganized and all over the place (especially in the first few classes. But as the semester went on, class got much better and was more focused.",
    "It is a little difficult, but that is what makes it different than introductory courses. He talks a great deal about the concepts and gives a lot of real life examples. Some times the models are a little hard to grasp.",
    "interesting subject matter, but a bit disorganized. difficult for students to understand where the prof. was going with certain lectures",
    "Overall this class is great!",
    "The biggest strength of the course is the reading list. The articles and studies we read were very interesting and pertinent to the course.",
    "Great course -- maybe my favorite at YSPH. The professor was wonderful."

    "Instructor: Sanjeev Kumar \u00a0a good professor, but sometimes I think he understands things in a very different way from most people. Sometimes he asks vague questions, and even after he says the answer, it's unclear how the answer relates to the question.",
    "Instructor: Sanjeev Kumar \u00a0Strengths: enthusiastic about content, provided interesting papers to read.Weaknesses: facilitation skills could be worked upon, it seemed arbitrary how he evaluated our work and very subjective.",
    "Instructor: Sanjeev Kumar \u00a0He is a very intelligent guy and definitely helped me think more as a health economist. His passion for health econ and understanding why things are the way they are is contagious.It was a little frustrating that he took so long to return our homework and I think he could have structured the class better. I also think weekly assignments should have been posted a week before they were due (not 2-5 days before they were due)",
    "Instructor: Sanjeev Kumar \u00a0The professor is great. Sometimes it might be nice to get homework back quicker, or at least quicker in the beginning. It is hard to know if we are doing the assignments right without feed back until the later weeks. He could explain models in a more structured way and provide some readers\/handouts\/lecture notes. In class, he introduces topics and ideas with question and answer sessions, but sometimes it is not easy to follow.",
    "Instructor: Sanjeev Kumar \u00a0very enthusiastic and eager for his students to learn. engaged students in discussion. at times unclear about broader goal of the course. could have better gauged the econ background of students and tailored lectures to their needs\/experiences.",
    "Instructor: Sanjeev Kumar \u00a0Dr. Kumar is a great and passionate instructor. He made this class very interesting and engaging.",
    "Instructor: Sanjeev Kumar \u00a0It was great to have a professor that clearly has a passion for healthcare economics; however, class discussion was not very engaging most of the time. The discussions we had in class were very interesting and a lot of important points were made, but a more involved classroom experience is possible. Perhaps explaining the theoretical concepts more clearly or choosing to focus either on theoretical economic topics or conceptual arguments in the field would be better.",
    "Instructor: Sanjeev Kumar \u00a0Prof Kumar was great. Entertaining, informative. Acknowledged the limitations of neoclassical models every step of the way. Adequate discussion of behavioral economics. A modern, unique, engaging econ professor."

   "comments": [
    "Recommend- I think all students of health and healthcare should have a deeper-than-basic understanding of economics.",
    "Interesting to be exposed to a different way of thinking.",
    "If you are interesting health econ - then take this class. It isn't structured like microecon at YSPH and is more discussion based.",
    "Great to take if you can work independently. There is a lot of reading to do, so try to ask him to post it earlier in the week. He stays true tot he syllabus so you can also look it up (a few papers might change or get added. Take it to get more ideas and concepts, not as a class to gain modeling skills or more a structured\/conventional approach to economics",
    "I would recommend this class to another student!",
    "It is a very informative course on healthcare economics. You learn a lot through the readings, but the classroom experience is not very engaging.",
    "Strongly recommend. Maybe not that accessible\/relevant to people with no prior interest in the field, but it was a great overview of most of the important topics, concepts, and papers in modern health economics."
