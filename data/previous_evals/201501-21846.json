    "Alot of work but WORTH IT!",
    "As above - do it if you have any interest in Japan and its language. You will not find many classes with the quality of teaching this high.",
    "If you're taking JAPN 120, you're probably taking it as a continuation of JAPN 110. While the course material is obviously more advanced, the overall level of difficulty more or less stays the same (i.e. some of the concepts are hard to understand but probably no more than learning basic language structure for the first time). Some of the lessons are stuffed full of new material that you'll go through at a breakneck pace, though, so be careful not to fall behind -- as always, if you do the work every day, you'll be fine. If you're considering taking JAPN 120 without taking JAPN 110, it might be helpful to ask the senseis for a list of topics so you're not caught off-guard -- the material really is comprehensive, so it might be confusing not to have a solid understanding of the grammar and vocab from the first semester.",
    "Definitely recommend. This course is so fun than it made how much we learned amazing",
    "Fun class; it's a lot of work when you're taking it but you'll appreciate it when it's all over, and wish you could take more! I took it as a senior, but I wish I had taken it earlier.",
    "Lessons everyday with speaking practice and lots and lots of homework",
    "If you want to learn Japanese, don't miss this opportunity."
