   "comments": [
    "If you are interested in photography, the history of photography, scientifice photography and photographic science, this may overall be an interesting course. As someone who didn't really have any of these interests, it was a drain. While having grad students in the course made for more high level conversations, they were very very hard to follow as an undergrad who simply did not have the same background in art history or history of science as these grad students. I didn't get nearly as much out of seminar discussions as i have in other courses, and i was frankly intimidated to participate in class.",
    "I would recommend this course but make sure to keep your other courses relatively light if you want to succeed\/not fall behind.",
    "YES. If you have any interest in photography\/scientific imagery, or even if you don't quite frankly, take this class. Professor Ramalingam is incredible and changed how I approach and \"read\" photography, both in and out of science.",
    "Photography and the Sciences is a study of photography not as art, but as a tool, as a process, and as a changing technology. I would recommend this class to anyone interested in the early history of photography, the purpose of objectivity in science, or the nature of photographs (are they art or are they science?). Chitra is an amazing instructor - she will make you think, challenge your writing, and help you develop your ideas. This course should be taken seriously, but there is a lot of room for fun and personalization. The final paper is written on an item or project of your choice. One of the most fulfilling classes I've taken at Yale!"
