   "comments": [
    "Easy class. Lauermann is visiting though so I do not know if he will be teaching it again. If so, take it.",
    "The curve makes it very easy as a credit-d-fail but you won't learn anything. Meets the epe requirement at least.",
    "Required for econ major.",
    "Very challenging, but Lauermann makes sure that if you use all the resources you are given and you really put in the time and effort, it is possible to do well.",
    "*Only if you have to take it. It is a shame that Prof Lauermann is leaving next year (he was a visiting fellow). I really enjoyed Prof Lauermann's lectures. He made a dull subject (check reviews from past students with different professors). He actually made the material easy to understand (I shopped the other two professors who also teach it).",
    "Stephen is genial if a little scattered. His lectures are overviews of topics explored more via problem sets and exercises, which are unfortunately difficult and above the caliber of what he has taught in class. It would be useful if he gave us more actual in-class guidance of the more difficult aspects of the course. In addition, his notes have rampant grammar mistakes or and are sometimes written with ambiguous questions that are difficult to anticipate. He is awkward as a person, although I learned enough in his class. The tests were killer (52% mean) but generously curved.",
    "Basic class on intermediate microeconomics. Good for the mathematically inclined. I would recommend it if you are actually interested in economics, otherwise why take the class.",
    "Pretty standard intermediate micro class.",
    "Take it if you have to. It isn't that bad.",
    "Unless you need this class for your major I would NOT recommend. I placed out of Intro Micro and I wish I had taken that again instead of this. Lecture is confusing, the exams are impossible (I took an entire course in game theory last semester and still only got a 76 on the exam covering game theory, an exam that the class averaged a 68 on).",
    "Take this course if you're willing to put in some studying before exams; this isn't a class you can prepare for the morning of. That said, it all depends on the professor. Other teachers of intermediate micro have less-than-stellar reputations, so be sure you know who is teaching when you sign up. Professor Lauermann was the opposite of other teachers I had shopped this course with; he was totally chill and one of the best professors I've had--in any department.",
    "Take if it's a prereq. Otherwise, not an intellectually stimulating class.",
    "If Lauermann teaches this course again I would definitely take it, I've heard very bad things about it in the past when he wasn't teaching but didn't feel the same struggle when he taught it. The course goes through a lot of mathematical explanations of microeconomic theory building off of what you learn in intro micro, and goes into game theory as well which was fun.",
    "Intermediate Micro is a notoriously difficult class that is the bane of many Econ majors' existences. I was apprehensive about the class, but it turned out to be nothing I had to worry about. The first exam was murderous, but the generous curve smoothed everything out. The best part of the class was the professor. He genuinely seemed to care about his students' success. Definitely take it with Professor Lauermann if he happens to be teaching again!",
    "If you don't need this class for your major, don't take it.",
    "It's unlikely you have a choice in whether or not you take this class, but Professor Lauermann is a good professor to take it with.",
    "ECON 121 is hard, very hard, stupid hard. But you should take it with Lauermann if you have to take it. He's incredibly fair and gives you a lot of resources including old exams, ungraded exercises to do for section (which is not mandatory, but can be helpful), problem sets that are basically graded pass\/fail, and he records his lectures and posts lecture slides so if you miss you can basically relive lecture from the comfort of your futon and pajamas. Overall, terrible class just because of how ridiculously hard it is (I got a 33% on the first exam, a 36% on the second, and I'm in the B\/B+ range), but Lauermann does his best to make it bearable. Disclaimer: don't take this if it's not required for your major.",
    "You have to take it if you want to be an Econ major. Prof. Lauremann is the guy to take it from if you can.",
    "Don't take it unless you have to - but if you do have to, ABSOLUTELY take it with Lauermann. He's the best thing to happen to this awful course in years.",
    "This evaluation is irrelevant because we had a visiting professor this semester. Nonetheless, the class on the whole was much lighter than usual in difficulty, workload, and level of the material. As such, I would recommend it for someone who wants to get through Intermediate without major pains. The downside is that I feel like I learned almost nothing this whole semester and am not up to par in economics as my peers who have taken past iterations of the course. Class: material was too easy and did not adhere to Yale\u2019s standard for \u201cintermediate\u201d economics, which is inherently more advanced than that of other colleges. Grading:nice and inflated; candy to the ears of the typical econ majors. Difficulty: laughably easy overall, with somewhat tricky exams due to time pressure. (I\u2019m a science major, so take what I say with a grain of salt if you find that your calculus\/algebra skills need polishing.) Class materials: clear and plentiful. Opportunities to succeed were there all along. Though not stellar, lectures were complemented with slides, exercises, practice exams, and external resources to aid in understanding. You can\u2019t really ask for more than that. Workload: nonexistent. Two-hour problem sets graded for completion.",
    "ECON 121 covers much of the same topics as introductory microeconomics. However, calculus is used to solve the problems. The first portions of the class deals with supply, demand, partial equilibrium, and general equilibrium. The final portion deals with game theory, and is by far the more interesting section. There are weekly problem sets and three midterm exams. While the midterms were difficult, the curve was extremely generous. Many practice materials were provided for both problem sets and exams. I would recommend the course only if you have an interest in economics.",
    "A pre-requisite so I guess not too much room with decision making there...",
    "Econ 121 was a challenging course, but it is definitely doable for all econ majors. Professor Lauermann was a very good professor. He provided us with a wealth of resources to help us prepare for midterms, and there was no final since we had 3 midterms throughout the semester. His teaching slides were clear and helpful in explaining the material. Problem sets were graded based on completion, which was a plus. Overall a great class.",
    "This is a mandatory class for the ECON major, so if you're in it, you probably have to take it. I would even recommend it for students who aren't ECON majors because there is a wealth of learning, especially if Lauermann is teaching it again. I was really satisfied with the class, but it does help if you have a stronger math background because it makes going through the concepts a lot easier.",
    "Brutal, a great credit\/d class because it's impossible to fail (22 is a B- on the exams) but also a good curve so if you do the work it should be fine. No final which was nice.",
    "The material is seriously tough. Even though the problem sets are graded loosely, if you put the effort into them and check with friends the exams will be much easier.",
    "You have to take it if you have to. He probably won't be teaching it again.",
    "It was fine. I would not recommend but it is a requirement.",
    "You probably know what you're getting into with this course. It's not fun, but you have to take it. If you're an econ major, just suck it up. If you're an EPE major, consider using your credit\/D here, or take this concurrently with Ethics, start them both on credit\/D, and switch whichever class you feel better about. I will say, however, that this was by far the easiest intermediate micro class that has been taught in a while (I can say this with certainty despite not having been enrolled in other classes). If you sum all the review sessions I went to, the sections I attended, and the graded problem sets I bothered to pick up, the total is 1, and I still got an A in the course.",
    "It is a decent course, but nothing inspiring. Again, if you're good at math this is basically a gut.",
    "If you're not an econ, global affair, or econ major, I'm not sure why you'd take this \u2013 there are way more 'practical' econ courses if you want to take a class to get you a job. That said, if you do have to take it, Professer Lauermann is the best. Though he was a visiting professor, so not sure if he'll be back. The class is tough, but the workload isn't extreme aside from the weekly (ungraded!) problem sets and midterms.",
    "If you have to take it for your major, then there's no way around it. If you don't, then don't take it.",
    "Great professor!!",
    "Wouldn't take it if I didn't have to BUT IF YOU NEED TO TAKE IT 110% TAKE IT UNDER LAUERMANN; he is one of the only econ professors I've had that REALLY CARES about providing you with a wealth of material to understand the concepts covered in class. I have rarely felt so strongly about a class at Yale that if you are willing to work hard, you could get an A.",
    "If it is for your major, you should and you must. If not, stick with the intro courses",
    "Don't take this class unless you need it for your major. It's not interesting and it can be really frustrating at times.",
    "It was a good class. The curve was beyond amazing. The material was interesting to me and was really important for other econ classes you will need to take. I liked the three midterms format; lot of studying but the problem sets weren't bad and the tests weren't cumulative.",
    "It's really not a hard class. I'm not one of those type-A econ majors. People whine about this class all the time and it's really just interesting and necessary for any econ major. Do it. It wasn't my hardest class this past semester by any extent.",
    "Most people have to take it. If you have to take it, your best bet is to do it with Lauermann.",
    "Hard class, but necessary for the major. Take it with Lauermann if you can.",
    "Must take, only because the school says so.",
    "Take it in the spring.",
    "Not bad at all! Very clear concepts and problem sets. Most people won't take this unless they have to, but I had a pretty good experience.",
    "Not too useful of a class. It's good to know how to optimize with Lagrangians and solve for general equilibrium if you plan to take other advanced economics classes. Especially not that useful for EP&E majors.",
    "Lauermann was a great professor. Take it with him! It was not too difficult and he provided a lot of helpful resources.",
    "I'm guessing if you're reading this that you have to take Econ 121 for your major...but it really isn't nearly as hard as most kids say, especially with Lauermann (although I think he's only a visiting professor). Just a more math-based version of Econ 110\/115 with more powerful tools, but nothing too complicated. I guess the material is a little dry but it's useful for the rest of your classes, best to just get it out of the way early, especially as close to taking intro micro as possible. If you can take it with Lauermann again, definitely do because I've heard the other lecturers aren't nearly as good.",
    "Take the class if you have to. If not, why would you put yourself through this willingly?",
    "I would recommend this class if Professor Lauermann teaches it again.",
    "A Well, take it if you need it for your major, but if you don't need it, don't take it. Intermediate Micro is often a painful class for econ majors, so make sure your other classes that semester have a lighter workload than ECON 121. Don't take Intermediate Micro and Intermediate Macro at the same time (this would be too much) - otherwise, you'll be fine!",
    "ECON 121 is a great class, especially when taught by Prof. Lauermann. Everyone says the material is really difficult, but Prof. Lauermann makes it very understandable and does a great job of explaining things in lecture. I would 100% recommend this class, especially if you can take it with Prof. Lauermann.",
    "I would recommend it. Problem sets every week but they are manageable",
    "It was actually really good. The material is more interesting that I expected and Lauremann does a good job. It's not easy, but if you need to take the class for Econ, I think this is definitely the better semester to do it. Only psets and 3 non-cumulative midterms. No final!",
    "I wouldn't recommend taking this class unless you have to for your major. You learn a lot but it's pretty challenging and not super engaging. The first 2 exams were pretty brutal but the third wasn't nearly as bad. The grading scheme also helped a lot.",
    "Hard course, but it's a fair course! Take if you need it for your major!",
    "You probably have to take it for the major, so just do! Difficult at times, but quite rewarding at the same time!",
    "Econ 121 is a brutal class as I'm sure you know. If you can take it with Lauermann, then definitely do because with him I actually did not mind the class at all.",
    "It's a large econ lecture and the material isn't easy. However, if you have to take this course (and you probably do), take it with Professor Lauermann, who made the process so much more painless than it could have been.",
    "Good course with a strong and organized structure which I appreciated. Consecutive lessons were based on previous lectures and the syllabus fit together nicely.",
    "Well of course for some majors it is necessary. But I would definitely wait to take ECON 121 until you find a professor who matches your learning style. I shopped the class a couple of times before I found Prof Lauermann and he was the most compatible with the way I learned material. Each prof has his\/her own way of imparting the same knowledge.",
    "I mean the only real reason a person would take this course is that it's a requirement... I would take it with this professor as opposed to others. Even though he doesn't care to meet with you or anything he provides a lot of resources that can help you succeed. Keep in mind though that a lot of students in the class may have a huge advantage over you because they have other economics background.",
    "A very good class. As an EP&E major, I enjoyed the class much more than I thought I would. Though much of the material was technical, some of the topics -- such as price discrimination from the game theory unit and elasticity from the first unit -- were quite relevant to the real world and highly applicable outside of microeconomics. Professor Lauermann is a wonderful teacher. Since he is a visiting Professor, I'm not sure if he'll be teaching again at Yale, but if he is, I highly recommend taking Econ 121 from him. He was an incredibly clear and straightforward teacher, who taught one of the most well-organized classes I have ever seen. During the semester, he would frequently solicit anonymous feedback and suggestions from students, which he both responded to in writing and actually changed his teaching to accommodate. Professor Lauermann was also quite funny, friendly, and an overall stellar teacher. The workload for the class was highly reasonable. The problem sets were graded generously and grading overall was fair and very transparent. Section can be quite helpful, but it is not mandatory and not too necessary if you feel comfortable with the material.",
    "I think that Econ 121 has a bad reputation. People said I should just repeat introductory-level economics instead, but I didn't find this course terribly difficult. The problem sets are manageable if you don't leave them until the last minute. Lectures go at a reasonable pace. The midterms were difficult and very long, but the curve is helpful. The course was not particularly engrossing, but I did learn the material. All in all, it was not as difficult as I was told and it served its purpose."
