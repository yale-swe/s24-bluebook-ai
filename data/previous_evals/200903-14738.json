   "comments": [
    "This course is a survey of topics in Neuroethology with emphasis of scientific discoveries and breakthroughs using this approach. I would highly recommend this course to other neuroscientist.",
    "Bats, owls, and electric fish. Need I say more? Totally awesome subject matter, and there are always interesting questions to ask. Professor Mazer is great at connecting the varied topics.",
    "I would summarize it as a seminar course focusing on primary literature in a broad range of neuroethology topics. The specific topics depend on the group of students taking the course; we were allowed to pick our topics in our first meeting. I would recommend this course to fellow grad students who are interested in either behavior or sensory systems. It didn't require a large amount of work each week, making it easier to participate in the course as an advanced grad student, but I still learned more about areas of research interesting to me.",
    "A good class for getting an overall background of sensory neuroethology through a mixture of classic and recent papers. Small class size and interesting and enjoyable discussions distinguish the class from all others I have taken. I would recommend this class, especially for more advanced students looking to expand their knowledge of a different field."

   "comments": [
    "This course gave me the opportunity, context, and knowledge to explore important scientific discoveries within my field I would not have otherwise been exposed to.",
    "Awareness of other areas of neuroethology will help with my research, although the course did not directly affect my current project. However, it will help when deciding what research I may want to pursue as a post-doc since I found some of the topics covered very interesting.",
    "This course gave me a better understanding of the research and history of a field that I knew little about and also gave some insight into the external factors that influence research and funding in neuroethology. Reading was directly relevant to my research at times, but was usually more interesting in terms of broad concepts of different evolutionary strategies of sensory systems."
