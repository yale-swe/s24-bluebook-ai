    "Yes!!!!!Take this class if you like ancient history.Cannot stress it enough.",
    "I would strongly recommend this course for everyone. Even as a prospective EE major, this course helped me appreciate history, and the heritage that surrounds us.",
    "It is a good history lecture, and if you like ancient history its a good class to take. Try to take it while Kagan is teaching it because he is a brilliant lecturer.",
    "I highly recommend the course. Very interesting lectures, from the grand introduction on why we should study the ancient Greeks, throughout the course of ancient Greek history. One aspect that especially caught my attention was how much rested on the outcome of certain events, such as the Battle of Marathon, of which Professor Kagan mentioned that if things had gone slightly differently, the entire future of Western civilization as we know it could have been prevented with the defeat of Athens just at the beginning of its great developments. Much of the course material also deals with what can be seen as parallels with more modern events, and international relations. Very illuminating course, both a good foundation on the origins of our Western civilization, and for intriguing insights on human nature and our own modern world as well.",
    "TAKE IT. Kagan is incredible and everyone should know greek history",
    "Great, great course. Kagan is baller, especially when he goes on about how \"some historians argue this...but theyre wrong.\" interesting material, great lecturer, not that much work (read problems and you're basically set). really recommend it.",
    "No matter who you are, take the course! It is amazing and the work is manageable if you keep up and actually do it.",
    "Intro to Ancient Greek History is a must-take class at Yale. However, it is a lot of work, so credit\/D\/fail is an option to consider. Kagan is the expert on the Peloponnesian Wars and does a great job at lecturing. Section is sometimes helpful and at other times not. There is a lot of memorization required for the midterm and final but the class is so well taught by Kagan that it is worth it.",
    "I wasn't particularly interested in the history of Ancient Greece, and I took this course to fulfill one of my preindustrial requirements for the history major. Kagan, however, is a legendary lecturer for a reason, and the course was interesting and enjoyable. The reading is reasonable for the most part (it gets heavy with the Thucydides), but grading is pretty tough.",
    "Good overview to Greek history, a lot details--good class to take pass fail",
    "I would summarize it as a great introductory course to ancient Greek history as well as one that non-History majors could benefit from. I would recommend anyone to take it since it is an enlightening course on political and historical material.",
    "It's a great class. Take it.",
    "Very challenging course, even credit d. The exams require a lot of knowledge. Prof. Kagan was not as good as i thought he would be - interesting material but easy to fall asleep...",
    "It's a truly amazing class--take it if you like history that actually about what shaped events--politics, politicians, generals, and battles--midterm and final are fine so long as you study--and paper is fine, all sources provided to you already--most readings not at all mandatory",
    "I'd highly recommend this class. Donald Kagan is an amazing lecture who gives an epic, in-depth look into diplomacy, reform and war. Some people may criticize the class for not discussing social history, women, etc. To them I say, go back to eating your granola and leave history to the greats like Kagan. Admittedly, there is a lot of reading, but if you keep up with it, you can do very well. Take the course with a section, it will save your life. Take it while Kagan is still around, anyone else teaching it would be a sad joke.",
    "Greek History was a very intense look into the History of Ancient Greece from 2000BC to around 350 BC. It was very interesting, and I would recommend it to another student interested in this subject.",
    "Take it if Kagan is teaching it.",
    "A Yale classic - take it, but be prepared for the reading!",
    "Best class ever. MUST TAKE!!",
    "Take this course. Your Yale undergraduate will be less complete if you fail to experience Kagan\u0092s brilliance. This is a GREAT history lecture course. It deserves its place among Yale\u0092s legendary courses, just as Kagan deserves his reputation as one of the university\u0092s best professors.",
    "Intro to Ancient Greek History remains a classic with good reason. It's a very interesting survey of Greek history. The textbooks and supplementary readings (Plutarch and Thucydides) are engaging, and the lecture is well organized. Exams are reasonable, and the paper is pretty fun to write.",
    "This class is great. It's a good introduction to Ancient Greek History. Even if you're just considering this class, I would recommend going to Kagan's first lecture because he tells you why you should study this period. Donald Kagan is definitely one of the best professors we have at Yale. You will learn a lot, the readings are interesting, and it's manageable. Thiscourse is definitely worth taking.",
    "One of the best history lectures at Yale or anywhere else in academia; Professor Kagan is tremendous; exams cover a lot of material but are manageable",
    "Definitely take this course! It's excellent and teach me a lot about how to think history and life!",
    "This has been my favorite class at Yale so far. The lectures are so engaging and informative and I've learned so much over this past semester. I came into this course already a classics lover, but now I'm officially obsessed. Kagan is an amazing lecturer who manages to turn the sometimes dry and monotonous facts of Greek history into an engaging story. The way he talks about some of the leaders made me feel like I actually knew them, which made me actually care about their lives and the decisions they made. The course is known for being pretty difficult, but as long as you go to lecture, take a section (it's DEFINITELY worth it - ends up being so helpful in the end), and really understand and spend time on the readings in the general textbook and the problems book, it really isn't that hard to do well. The primary readings are interesting, but not totally necessary if you don't have the time. Most of the important parts of the primary texts are reproduced as excerpts in the two textbooks I mentioned, so if you really are that stressed about the amount of reading just stick to the two textbooks. Take this class, you won't regret it.",
    "Kagan is an intellectual titan. He cares about history for its application in today's world, and thus you will learn a lot not only about people with strange names who lived in 500 BC but also about how our own politicians should conduct themselves and conduct policy, especially foreign policy. He is insightful and will stir your heart during several lectures - and it is in these times that you will actually learn something from a Yale education.",
    "The course is fascinating. Take it.",
    "If you like history, you cannot miss this.",
    "Take it! Hands down the best lecture I've taken at Yale. Each class is like story time, and it never gets boring.",
    "You must take this class. Kagan>Zeus.",
    "Yes take it.",
    "A classic Yale course that covers great themes, authors, and has one of the best lecturers at Yale. Fantastic.",
    "Overview of an important time in the development of western civilization, democracy. There is a lottt of material but once you lay it all out it is manageable. I recommend taking the class with section because the TAs (especially Claudia!) help a lot for understanding the material as you go and for grasping what is on the exams, what to focus on. Professor Kagan is great, he's entertaining and funny, I hope he comes back!",
    "Pretty comprehensive look at Greece and all the various arguments and interpretations of ancient and modern scholars regarding the most significant issues surrounding the time period. Pretty intense at times though. You can get by without doing some of the readings, but cramming is difficult.",
    "Take this class if you want to learn about \"The West\" in an unbiased and accurate fashion. The lack of relativity and disregard for the classics that characterize this class is sorely lacking in the rest of Yale's curriculum, so if you are a non-DS student who wants a taste of the classics that formerly defined a Yale education, this is the course for you.",
    "This was the most enjoyable and worthwhile class I have taken at Yale (I'm a senior). Kagan is an excellent lecturer and this class has by fine tuned over many years. It has the best ratio of work-to-value of any class I've taken. I do think that the rule \"the more you put in the more you get out\" holds in exponential form here. When you bring the reading and the lectures together you get a really excellent course, but either alone really doesn't do it.",
    "Great intro to Ancient Greek History",
    "Great classic, old-school class. I would definitely recommend it.",
    "One of my favorite history lectures I have taken. While the class is not easy, it is fascinating if you have interest in diplomatic or military history. Also good for the student of American politics\/statecraft.I loved it.",
    "This class should really be titled: \"Intro to the military and political history of Ancient Greece.\" So, if you're not into military and political history, don't take this course. That said, it's amazing to see how the conflicts of 500-400 BC are not really that different from conflicts today. Everything about the Peloponnesian War seems oddly contemporary.This is an amazing class, one of my favorites at Yale. Prof. Kagan is passionate about the subject, and he believes that the study of Ancient Greece matters to understanding today's world, and you will probably be converted to this view. There's not a ton of reading for this course (you don't really need to read Thucydides and Plutarch if you don't have the time), but the exams require you to memorize a ton of information, so expect to put in a lot of work before the exams. If you want to understand what it means to be human, take this class, and study the ancient Greeks.",
    "The class traces Greek History from the Minoan Civilization until the Fall of Athens. It's a great subject and the professor is the most well known in the world. However, realize that it is a lot of work in terms of reading. The textbook isn't so bad, but the first account readings (like Thucydides) can be rough, especially since they were assigned around midterm time! Nevertheless, it was a great course!",
    "Yes, absolutely.",
    "This class is a good a intro lecture history class as Yale has. You actually come away from it knowing the general outlines of both Ancient Greek history and the controversies among historians. Kagan is a good lecturer, but his style doesn't allow him to draw in listeners in the same way that some of Yale's other lecturers can. If you make the minimal effort to start listening, though, you should find his lectures to be informative, well structured, and entertaining.",
    "If ancient history is not your thing, you're probably not going to love this class, even though Kagan is fantastic. That being said, this period of history is surprisingly relevant to our own, and Kagan does a great job of explaining its modern-day significance. All in all, I would say this is a great course.",
    "Yes, but make sure that you get a good TA, it makes all the difference.",
    "Introduction to Ancient Greek History is a wonderful class that, honestly, everyone should take. The courseload is not nearly as bad as I feared it would be - perhaps because of the two semesters of DS I took the year prior - and the material is extremely interesting. If you have never taken a Greek history course before (DS does not count), you should take this course.",
    "If you get a chance, take it.",
    "I would recommend this class to another student. I think this course's content is fundamental to understanding modern society, and Professor Kagan was an excellent instructor.",
    "This is a great class taught by the famous Professor Kagan, and it definitely lived up to my expectations. If he is still teaching the course, try to make it part of your schedule, even if you are unimpressed by the first lecuture. There is so many applications for the course after the midterm, and there is no one better to teach it than Kagan."
