    "I would say take this class for the second half of the course, where you will meet awesome people. If you are into political theory, then you may enjoy the first half, but I found that part kinda boring, but the second half more than makes up for it.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student.",
    "Absolutely take this course. If you have any interest in the science of politics and public administration, this class is a must.",
    "The course was useful in framing political institutions. I enjoyed the focus on federalism and Ostrom's theory of public administration, a refreshing perspective given the viewpoints of most professors in the Political Science and EPE departments. Also, since I will pursue a military position when I graduate, it was a special honor to have speakers of the Army and Navy visit and speak about women in combat as well as grand strategy. Despite the class being a bit poorly organized sometimes, it definitely catered to a student's specific interests, a quality that I found valuable when it came time to write the final paper."
