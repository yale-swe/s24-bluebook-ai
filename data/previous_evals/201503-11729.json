    "This is a really great overview class of women writers, specifically poets, in traditional China. The writing assignments are all open-ended. Be prepared for group discussion and do not be afraid to speak up! To get the most out of this class, do the reading and speak up during the discussion period. Prof. Chang is amazing and extremely kind. You cannot go wrong with taking a class with her. This class will not give you an in-depth view of any one poet, which can be frustrating, but it's good for exposure.",
    "YES!",
    "I would recommend this class to you if you have a basic understanding of Chinese or Chinese history (I had neither and found the course challenging at times). There are three papers and participation in biweekly section. I enjoyed the themes of poetry and discussion sections. Professor Chang is very knowledgable and dedicated to her students.",
    "Would recommend for someone looking for an interesting survey course about Chinese literature. Definitely accessible to those with no or little knowledge of Chinese\/China or literature.",
    "Would highly recommend to anyone interested in Chinese, Chinese literature, women's literature or global feminism and gender studies!",
    "Everyone should take classes outside of the Western male canon, and this class is definitely a great one to take. Even if you have no prior knowledge of or interest in Chinese literature, this class will teach a lot about both content and different ways of thinking about literature. I loved learning about the roles of female writers in the Chinese literary tradition and having my eyes opened to different modes of empowerment outside of what we traditionally envision as Western readers. Professor Chang is incredibly insightful and funny in addition to being one of the pioneers of this field, so she always seems to know everything and everyone. Take this course -- you will gain a lot from it!",
    "This class would have been taught better chronologically, rather than thematically, as the women writers\/poets you will read (of which there are many!) becomes difficult to differentiate. I hesitate to even recommend this class at all, as if you have knowledge of Chinese you will understand that A LOT is lost in translation here (aka if you can take a similar course in Chinese, go forth and do so). Likewise, the intense blurring between the works of and lives of the women discussed in class made understanding the critical frameworks through which we read and wrote on works (or even which frameworks to use!) difficult. The setup of the class is a little strange there are 50 minutes of lecture, and then 25 minutes of discussion led by the TF, but Professor Chang could have easily led the class herself (and often did); this was an inorganic setup for conversation. With that being said, if you're looking for a humanities credit without a lot of work, I wouldn't not recommend this class."
