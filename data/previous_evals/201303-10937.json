    "I would definitely recommend it for someone looking for a pre-1800 requirement for the English major. Milton isn't everyone's cup of tea, but if you don't mind the material then it's definitely worth it!",
    "John Rogers gives a fantastic lecture. Even if you have almost no interest in Milton, the lecture will be informative and interesting. It makes for a very pleasant way to fulfill a pre 1800 requirement for the English Major. That being said, you are still reading Milton...If you don't like dense poetry, don't take this class just for kicks.",
    "First few weeks really suck, last few weeks really rock. Hang in there during the early stuff and you'll be grateful.Also, you'll get to know Milton so well: by the end of the semester, you'' have read every poem Milton ever published.So take this class, there's really no excuse.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS, even if you aren't an English major. Professor Rogers does a fantastic job at guiding the class and offering new insight.",
    "This is a FANTASTIC class. Professor Rogers is always interesting, but also so personable and friendly. Even though I had read Milton before, I feel like I have a much better and more nuanced understanding now. The TAs were also great, very relaxed but knowledgeable. There is quite a bit of reading, but no more than an average English class.",
    "I am an English major who needed another pre-1800s lit credit in order to fulfill requirements for the major. Coming from ENGL 126, I wasn't so keen on reading copious amounts of Milton, but Professor Rogers made me want to read and come to lecture. He made Milton exciting, which then made his works exciting. It was so interesting to be able to learn about Milton the person and see how he came alive throughout his works. It added another level to Paradise Lost, Paradise Regained, Samson Agonistes, etc. Yes, there is quite a bit of reading, but that's an English class for you. Take this class. You'll end up loving it and Professor Rogers.",
    "Do you like Milton? Right, that's what I thought. But even coming from where you're coming from (whether it's a vicious hatred like I had at the end of ENGL 126), Professor Rogers is AMAZING and will work miracles. I am coming away from this class with a genuine appreciation for Milton, one I thought I'd never have after 126 DESTROYED Paradise Lost for me. Rogers illuminates all of the wonderful, crazy, boring, insane, narcissistic, brilliant moves of Milton, and he does so in the most delightful way possible. Rogers's love and passion for Milton really shines in his lectures, and you will leave at least one lecture feeling that you're smarter than you were when you walked in. Just don't make any weekly commitments in the five minutes after class is supposed to end, because Rogers needs those to make his final points.",
    "You will read all of Milton's later works, plus earlier poems that you've never heard of. I would definitely recommend this class because Professor Rogers is an excellent lecturer who makes the course material interesting. Yes, you will have to suffer through Paradise Lost (again, for you English majors out there), but this is a GREAT pre-1800 credit. I was surprised by how much I enjoyed it. One thing that helped was that I had an awesome TA. I can imagine the class being painful with a bad TA.",
    "Absolutely-you learn so much context about a man and his poetry--works that might otherwise be difficult to comprehend.",
    "A class that studies the evolution of Milton's poetry, from his earlier poems as a budding poem to his major epics. Little work, wonderful lectures, interesting essays. Just take it.",
    "The reading is not easy, and sometimes can feel endless. That being said, it is so important and interesting that I would encourage anybody to take this class. Take it Credit\/D, if only to be able to read Paradise Lost. Or take it as agraded class and prepare yourself to sink your teeth into what is some incredible poetry. While the reading can seem daunting, themes tend to reoccur in each work throughout the semester: if you couldn't quite grasp it the first time, you will have plenty of other chances, and it makes for incredibly easy essay writing. Although people who don't love English may tell you otherwise, Milton's poems are ideal reading--beautiful, philosophical, and so imbued with meaning that they move you in a different way every time you read them.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS!! You. Take it. Rogers is a gifted lecturer, and makes the material engaging in a way that I have never seen in many many English classes here. I emerged from lots of lectures grinning in happiness.",
    "Yes - it's a great lecture class - it's not an overwhelming amount of work, but you will still learn a ton. It's also a CLUTCH pre-1800's if you're an english major.",
    "YES! This is one of the best English classes I've taken at Yale as a senior English major. Milton is inscrutable, but this class will give you the tools to begin figuring him out.",
    "As a non-English major taking the class, I was very surprised at how much I enjoyed the class. The reading is pretty light and lectures are very interesting, making this a viable Credit\/D class. Professor Rogers is one of the best professors at Yale.",
    "Take this class if you're interested in Milton's work -- it is a class in which you only read his work. If that's the case, you'll really enjoy Professor Roger's lectures, and walk away from the class feeling like you've learnt quite a bit about the poet.",
    "Most people take \"Milton\" b\/c they're English majors trying to do away with a pre-1800 requirement. That's why I took the course too, but I was VERY surprised by how much I liked it. Prof. Rogers' lectures are excellent and it's not a ton of work. Milton's works range from bizarrely awesome (Comus) to obviously awesome (Paradise Lost) and I ultimately feel like a more well-rounded English major after having read them alongside the context of Milton's biography and legacy. Highly recommend.",
    "I didn't not enjoy this class. It was totally personal for I had a good TA and Professor Rogers is really good. If you absolutely know you like Milton, go for it. I liked Paradise Lost when reading it for ENGL 126, but just did not like this course - was too much and I thought the general structure and themes of the course were very tired by the end.",
    "Yes! You should take this course if you are a junior or senior English major. Otherwise you'll get killed - Milton is HARD. But so worth it. Workload is really reasonable.",
    "TAKE THIS COURSE. The lectures are wonderful. John Rogers is a joy. You should absolutely read all of Milton. Also, even when I put off my reading for this course, which was more often than I'd like to admit, I still learned a ton from the lecture. You can catch up on the reading later, and you'll want to. You'll probably already have read Paradise Lost in 126, and it's great to go over it again. I got a whole lot more out of it the second time around. It's SO rewarding to read Milton's political writing along with his poetry.",
    "This course covers Milton's life and his most important works, which may sound daunting and irrelevant to many. I can identify with that; I am not the most avid reader of 16th century poetry. But after a semester with John Rogers, I'm totally sold on Milton. The course has weekly readings that are fairly extensive, but only two 5-page papers (both rewarding opportunities to really dig in to a text) and a final. The final exam is challenging but manageable; the professor and section leaders prepare you well and instruct you on the most important things to study. In general though, this course taught me to close-read better than I ever have before, and I now feel comfortable approaching a text that doesn't immediately open up to interpretation or lend itself to a definitive reading. And beyond that, Professor Rogers' lectures are incredible thought experiments in themselves; it's worth taking the class just for the chance to listen to them.",
    "Take this class! This is a great class. If you need a pre-1800 and you want it to be a lecture, this one is awesome. Rogers is a great lecturer, and the reading is good and not too oppressively long. Stick with it through some of the early readings, which are not as good, because obviously Paradise Lost kills. And the early stuff starts to seem relevant and important once you see why Rogers had you read it, to set up who Milton is and make you understand the later works better. So good! Go for it.",
    "I thought this course was phenomenal to give an overview of this great authors work. Will introduce the student to this work and position in within the canon.",
    "This is one of the best classes that I have taken at Yale. I highly recommend to all English majors (even if you read Paradise Lost in 126 and think that you don't like it). I also recommend to those who are not English majors, but have even a slight interest in poetry. Professor Rogers brings such energy to his lectures that I think he could make anyone care about Milton the way he does. Before taking this class I had not understood the value of taking an English course in a lecture format. But this course made me realize the benefit of getting to read Milton when guided by an expert. Rogers will not only guide you through Milton but will enable you to see both the intricacy and the power of his poetry. This is a course may be on a dead white man, but Professor Rogers will show you that reading him is DEFINITELY worth you time!",
    "Yes! Take this! Professor Rogers is phenomenal, and these are readings that you need to do, especially if you are an English major- Major English Poets does not do justice to Paradise Lost. The readings are very manageable each week, and you just have 2 short papers and a final on top of that. A very interesting, engaging class."
