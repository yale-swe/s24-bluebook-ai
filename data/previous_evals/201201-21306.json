    "Moot point, since he'll be gone. It's a shame, because I definitely would.",
    "Boss. Darden is a fantastic seminar leader and just a cool guy. Too bad he's leaving.",
    "The class is engaging. Prof Darden is a funny guy, but impossible to get emails back from or graded work from, so I'm still not sure what my grade is like. The course material and reading are fabulous and in that aspect, I learned quite a lot about the causes of war. Overall, a nice class; the only flaws were in organizational structure and Darden's frequent travels which lead to him being impossible to reach.",
    "Really good class, not amazing. Professor Darden is smart but a little scattered, and our class discussion would have benefitted from more careful preparation on his part. The research paper is great because you can write about whatever you want, as long as you draw upon the framework we use to discuss wars in class. The reading is also really good, though there is a lot of it, but you don't have to do all of it to get a lot out of the course. It helps to have some background in either Greek history or modern European history (or both!), but you will get a lot out of it regardless. There are much better seminars at Yale, but this is a solid course on an important topic.",
    "Take it if youre interested in international conflict. It's more theoretical than you might think though, which is probably better.",
    "Really fun class that covers theoretical and structural explanations for war and tries to fit the more popular notion of direct causes of war into that framework. Not much work at all during the term and can probably survive just using summaries of the reading. Big paper at the end but you can write about any war you find interesting.",
    "If you want to learn about a plethora of wars and their causes take this class.",
    "Take with a different professor other than Darden"
