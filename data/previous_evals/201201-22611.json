   "comments": [
    "Very difficult to follow the lectures, covers extreme breadth of material to the extent that it is difficult to establish an understanding of the topics.",
    "Great science credit - definitely take it",
    "yes definitely take this if you need a science credit",
    "The material is not presented in a very interesting way, which is too bad because it could be an extremely interesting course.",
    "Astro 170 was a very good overview of the basics of cosmology. It is very interesting to understand some of the processes that compose the universe. If you are remotely interested in cosmology, I would recommend taking it, especially if you are a non-science major. The tests were all open book\/open notes, making the class very approachable and enjoyable since you don't have to spend all of your time memorizing details and formulas. You just have to understand the concepts. Overall, a good non-science QR\/SC credit.",
    "This is a pretty comprehensive introduction to cosmology, and, if you want, you can get a feel for a range of different topics in the field from the lectures. But the lectures are pretty disorganized and generally seemed to be targeted at a more scientifically literate student than most non-science majors are.That said, you don't have to really learn much at all to pass this class. The course description my year said that you needed a strong background in high school math\/physics to take this course. Not true in the slightest. To understand everything that's presented in the course, you would need that kind of background. But only a small portion of what you see on the slides ends up on the test, and that's usually the most straightforward portion -- simple plug-and-chug equations, combined with some basic memorization.If you're only concerned about an easy A, you'll be fine here. But if you want to make sure you've taken a class that's worth the credit: I definitely feel more knowledgeable\/prepared to keep up with developments in modern cosmology as a non-specialist now that I've taken this course. But I've got to think there are non-science credits out there that are much better taught.",
    "good",
    "Go for it!",
    "Good class, not very difficult, and awesome material (if you like that kind of thing)!",
    "Easy science credit but waste of time.",
    "This is definitely an easy class. My friend got a perfect score on the final paper and literally had never once come to class. There are only sections before problem sets and exams, and they tell you totally how to do all the work.",
    "Interesting class. Take it if Astronomy is something you might be interested in. Don't take it if you are looking for a science class with minimal math.",
    "Rather dry and sometimes boring course but was overall interesting if you're interested in space and the universe at all.",
    "Astronomy 170 is a course with interesting material, but with room for a large amount of improvement. I would not recommend the course to another student as of now, but hopefully in the next few years the teaching process can improve.",
    "Intro to Cosmology is the class to take for a QR\/Sc credit. As long as you go to sections and moderately prepare for the tests, then you will do well. The problem sets are graded a little bit harder than I expected, but the tests are pretty easy.",
    "Very challenging course for non-science major. I would recommend only to those who have great interest in astronomy or science, otherwise I wouldn't due the level of difficulty.",
    "Good for a SC credit, as it's pretty easy but you still learn a lot. Again, you might get bored a ways in. But I'd say it's worth it.",
    "I would recommend Astro 170 because overall, the concepts that are covered in the class are very interesting and the workload is extremely manageable. I wouldn't necessarily recommend this class for someone interested in pursuing astronomy as a major because I think he\/she will feel frustrated with the style the course is taught and the work that is assigned, as well as the level of material that is covered."
