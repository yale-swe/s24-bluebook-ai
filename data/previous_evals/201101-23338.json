    "Q3: Writing a reading response up to Dove's level every week was challenging and sometimes tedious. However, I am glad that this was part of the course. Many times, I finished the reading and would think that I had nothing to say about it. Knowing that I had to say something about the reading forced me to think more about what had been presented. I was always surprised to find that I actually had quite a lot to say about the reading. Also, since everyone did all of the reading each week (rare in most classes), the discussions we had were much better than in other classes.",
    "I thought this was a very valuable class, especially because it is related to my interests. Most the course readings were useful and the lectures were excellent. This class requires a lot of work, so it would be important for students interested to try to take other classes which may be somewhat lighter.",
    "This class requires lots of work each week. A considerable amount of reading (6+ hours) plus a one page commentary on the readings. The class was about half social scientists and half natural scientists. Some of the material is highly theoretical, and it's clear that some students are more comfortable speaking a certain language than others. I think this class is valuable for people who have done a lot of field work; it will help you reexamine your work and findings in a new way.",
    "The course is excellent. The readings and lectures provided by the instructor are really insightful. This course helped me to understand more the relationship between disaster discourses, policy interventions, society and natural resources management. This course is really valuable for people interested in disaster risk reduction and natural resource management that includes, recognizes and engages the people living in the communities holding the rights to the resources."

    "Dove. He's so awesome.And the final paper. I was utterly absorbed in the paper for the last 2 weeks of the semester. I never find myself so into a single assignment for class. I love that we were able to write about whatever the heck we wanted to write about.",
    "The range of perspectives, the mix of students, and the breadth of content and geographies that the class dealt with.",
    "Discussions, Prof. Dove, and the TA.",
    "The final paper project which you could tailor to your own research. I think this helped me tremendously with my approach to my research as well as will be a useful paper for furthering my career. I also enjoyed the lectures and discussions very much and it was interesting to hear different people's perceptions about the articles.",
    "Some of the readings were fantastic and will be in my mind and reference library forever. The class discussions were generally very dynamic, with lectures providing lots of stimulus and exciting ideas.",
    "The instructor classes and certain key readings.",
    "That the course is an advanced seminar and involves a lot of class discussions. The discussions are lead by the students. The number of students in the course helped to manage the discussions which complemented and expanded the analysis of the information provided by the instructor through the lectures and readings."

    "The only thing that comes to mind as a fault in the class is something that I don't think could really be fixed. There were some people in the class who tended to take over the discussion. These were mostly people who have had a lot of professional or academic experience with the material, and who had very strong opinions in either direction. This left people like me, who took the class to learn about the material, having a hard time getting any thoughts or words in during classes.The only way I can think of to fix this is to further restrict the class, but that seems silly. The class would be super boring if it was all people who came from disaster backgrounds. What made the class interesting was having people from different disciplines weigh in on the issues as well.",
    "Minor thing: Considering the time spent reviewing the weekly responses that the Prof. and TA spend, a bit more feedback might be helpful and insightful.",
    "The discussion leading sessions sometimes felt like had too many people as discussion leaders and were not in depth. It might be better to have each students to 2 sessions with a group of three students.",
    "I thought writing the commentaries was strenuous at times, especially writing up summaries for each article. I would recommend letting students focus on individual articles or ideas. I would also recommend keeping students to a 500 word maximum for commentaries because often times my (and others) commentaries had word limits well beyond that.",
    "the disparity between PhD and master students, who have often different concerns. Some Master students are not willing to think out of the box. Not a big deal though."

    "Great! Annie was always willing and able to talk about the class or life if you saw her around, and she was very good about responding to email and forwarding relevant answers to others.Dove is notoriously difficult to get office hours with, but when you do, he always asks exactly the right questions to keep you going or to get you unstuck with whatever you were stuck on.",
    "They were both available.",
    "Professor Dove was available during office hours and Annie was available more often. Both provided helpful and useful feedback throughout the semester.",
    "Weekly office hours. Consistent response via email. Congenial way of interacting with students. Instructor is most interested in your learning experience; very open to your ideas and new approaches. Dove receives student commentary readily, always eager to take a detour and explore a new idea, generate new discussion. He's got a gift for seeding the conversation and then letting things develop. Great listener.",
    "Excellent. Prof. Dove makes FES a better place to learn and to live. His classes are always extremely valuable, more that anything I have been attending at Yale. Ms. Claus was a cheerful, smart, precious TA.",
    "The TA and the instructor were really responsive to student's ideas, opinions and comments. The instructor helped me a lot to expand some ideas I had for my master's project."

    "I actually was not particularly interested at first in the subject matter. I took the class because I am interested in anthropology and because I really like Dove's classes. I found, however, that I actually got a lot out of the class material.I am mostly interested in how people understand environmental information and how their behaviors can change when the form of communication also changes (specifically, when that communication is in the form of art). It turns out that disasters are a very large part of how people understand their environments, and so knowing how people create and respond to such disasters is more important than I had originally thought.",
    "Coming from more of a natural science background, I appreciated the shift in perspective that the class affords, and the issues and lessons of the class will stick with me, I'm sure.",
    "I come from a natural science background and focus on disasters, so I thoughtit was useful knowing more from the anthropological perspective. Also, the research work I did for my final paper will be helpful for my future work.",
    "I'm not sure how well it fits into any specific work, but it changed the way I think about \"disaster,\" and it exposed me to some fantastic writers, some new parts of the world, and some fantastic FES colleagues."

    "Annotate all of your readings so that they will continue to be useful to you. You'll spend a LOT of time on the work, and it's a shame to look back at the material and not have the main ideas right there at your finger tips. Do the reading--it makes discussions so much better.",
    "This challenging class requires an enormous amount of work but it is also extremely enriching. No student who is interested in social studies should miss the opportunity to work with Professor Dove.",
