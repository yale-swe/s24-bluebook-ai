    "The course was a great review of classical physics and I think it has greatly improved many of my analytical skills.",
    "Understanding of Stat Mech, E&M, etc.",
    "I learned about statistical mechanics and electrodynamics. I also improved my analytical skills through the well planned problem sets and tests.",
    "In this class, we covered stat mech in the first half and e+m after break. It was definitely a lot of material, but Professor Padmanabhan is so amazing that it all felt very manageable. I had never really gotten electricity and magnetism before... but when Professor Padmanabhan taught it, it finally clicked!",
    "This class covered two main topics: statistical mechanics and electricity and magnetism. Within statmech, I learned about the microcanonical ensemble (the multiplicity function, entropy, probability a particle is in a certain energy state), canonical ensemble (partition function, average energies, specific heat) and grand canonical ensemble (fermions, bosons, and how to think about other quantum gases). Within E&M, we covered electric fields, currents, magnetic fields, flux, induced currents, different charge distributions, image charges, the Biot Savart law, potentials, and other topics.",
    "I learned the basics of statistical mechanics and electromagnetics in this course.",
    "You learn E&M, statistical mechanics, and a continuation of thermodynamics from the previous semester if you took 401",
    "Learned classical physics methods and electricity and magnetism topics",
    "I learned a lot about statistical mechanics and went much more in depth on E&M topics.",

   "comments": [
    "The instructor is probably the biggest strength of the course. Professor P. is one of the best lecturers at Yale. Also because of the huge breath of topics covered it is hard to get bored.",
    "Great course. Fantastic instructor. Slightly too many problem sets (to the point where it seemed to get in the way of actual learning) but fantastic curriculum overall",
    "Professor Padmanabhan is the best part of this class! I have a lot of trouble understanding E&M, but he was able to explain everything much more simply than any other professor I've had. The class was organized extremely well, so that problem sets solidified what we learned in class, and tests were very fair. I wish we had done more E&M practice problems in class like we did with other topics I felt like the whole unit was a bit rushed and I still had trouble understanding some of the aspects of the topic.",
    "The biggest strength of this course is unquestionably Professor Padmanabhan, who is the best professor I have ever had ever. I'm hoping he doesn't teach this class again so he can teach something that I can take, but if he is teaching this class then you should for sure take it! It was a lot of work (the problem sets are long and not easy and the tests cover a lot of material) but all of the work was very intentional and super helpful for digesting the material. This class is challenging, but in all the best ways. It isn't arbitrarily difficult for no reason. It is hard, but in a way that makes you think deeply about the concepts and really try to understand them instead of memorize the problem structure.",
    "The statmech portion of this course was taught very well, though conceptually it took work to figure out what was going on. However, E&M was definitely more confusing and I feel like some of the time spent on statmech could have been spent on E&M. More examples are always welcome in a class like this, as I feel like we did a lot of derivations but didn't really use them.",
    "The course was good.",
    "This class gives many opportunities to improve and do well in, and Nikhil is such a great teacher",
    "Strengths: very conducive to learning the material Weaknesses: some problem sets were more difficult than the course material",
    "The course was organized and taught extremely well. I think it was handled in the best way it possibly could have been.",
    "I think there could be more focus on problem-solving in class, perhaps walking through problems that resemble problems on homework or on exams. It sometimes felt like the material discussed in class was disconnected from the skills\/knowledge we needed for the homework and exam problems. That was one weakness. One strength was the clarity of instruction, including the professionality and availability of the instructor.",
    "So much material! But Prof. Padmanabhan is great! Stat mech is pretty awful and seems to have no real applications, which makes it a slog, and then E&M is just a lot of stuff you did in Math 120 and kind of forgot. But if you're a physics major (or math bs) you have no real choice."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "I can't speak to this course taught by anyone else, but Professor P is a great lecturer and the class was a super interesting. Even if you aren't a physics major I can't recommend this class enough because you get to see almost every part of physics and get to solve classic problems. The latter part is particularly fun because you start to realize that the you can do the same problems that stumped famous physicists for years.",
    "I would especially recommend this to mathematics majors who need their science credit for the B.S. major variants",
    "If Professor Padmanabhan is teaching it, definitely take it. But I guess you'd only be taking this if you have to anyway.",
    "If Professor Padmanabhan is teaching it, you should 10000% take it. I mean, whatever he is teaching, you should just take that. He is the best teacher I have ever had, and honestly probably the best teacher at Yale. His class is challenging, but in the best way. He puts so much thought into the assignments and lectures and is truly so dedicated to helping his students succeed. I feel so fortunate to have had him for two semesters and if you get the chance to take a class with him, you would be silly to pass it up!",
    "Would highly recommend. The material is very interesting and Nikhil does a fantastic job at making the topics enjoyable to learn. His excitement on the subject is contagious. He always makes sure that all students understand, and genuinely cares about each student. He made E&M (which I hate) actually enjoyable, so I am thankful for that!",
    "If this class was being taught by Nikhil again, I would recommend it. It gives a very comprehensive overview of statmech and E&M; I feel like all of the material will be useful in the future for graduate school or in a later physics career. Problem sets were only around 6 questions a week and took about 6 hours to do, so it wasn't a terrible amount of time put in. Nikhil is a wonderful lecturer and a very understanding professor, consistently offering multiple office hours as well as a study hall with a TA. As someone who had only taken 181 in preparation for E&M, this class was definitely a challenge; however, it was doable if you put in work.",
    "For a student studying physics, I would definitely recommend 402.",
    "Take this class with Nikhil if you can! He really cares and explains things very well. I would say take 401\/402 sequence as opposed to 410 etc. but thats also because I had a wonderful experience with Nikhil and felt the course moved at an adequate pace.",
    "Yes, for a physics major",
    "Yes, especially if needed for the major",
    "Yes!",
    "If Prof. Padmanabhan is teaching it, then yes!!!!"
