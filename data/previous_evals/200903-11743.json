   "comments": [
    "YES, TAKE IT.",
    "Take this class if you are interested in the subject and want to read a lot of historical case studies. It's not too hard and it's a lot of fun. Definitely recommended!",
    "Yes. Great class!",
    "If the subject matter seems even remotely interesting to you, TAKE THIS CLASS!! Warning: this is not history. It is mostly discussion about theory, but you will learn some history in the mix.",
    "Yes I definitely would recommend this class. The material was fascinating and the work load was manageable. If you put in the work it was not that difficult to do well.",
    "Sociology 216 gives a good overview of many well-known social movements, mainly in the United States. The class explores these movements through readings and class discussions. The final paper allows the student to choose a topic of own interest which makes writing the paper very motivating and interesting. Overall, a great class with a great professor.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. It looks very much at the theory of social movements with the use of examples to make points more clear. I loved it.",
    "It covers the theoretical frameworks and questions sociologists have about social movements. The seminar is mostly discussion. I would not take this class if you are not interested in the drier aspects of sociological theory.",
    "Take it!",
    "Really interesting class because one does not usually think of social movements or happenings at this level of depth. It takes things you have learned about (i.e. Civil Rights movement) and other things that you haven't and looks at other aspects than what's in the history books.",
    "A great introduction to social movement studies with an emphasis on case studies from 20th century social movements.",
    "take it if you like interactive seminars. discussion reaches exhaustion sometimes and that can be annoying. but it's def worth it",
    "I would recommend this class for anyone interested in social movements. Just be advised that it is a sociology course, rather than a history or political science class, which means that the material is approached very differently.",
    "This is a great class. Although it is listed primarily as a sociology course, the spread of student interests in the class was very vast and there were many different majors who offered many different perspectives on the material that we were covering each week. Reading responses are due each week but they are assigned in order to have us each think about the reading before we get to class and to promote a better discussion in class. Professor Eyerman is wonderful and very good at guiding discussion. A great class that discusses action, social movements, and activism.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to a fellow student because it will teach a student to look at current events in a whole new way."
