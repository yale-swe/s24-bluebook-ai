   "comments": [
    "I learned about pollution, the importance of decreasing it, and the challenges of implementing efficient policy. We also studied renewable and non-renewable resources and how to best manage these resources.",
    "Interesting course, would recommend.",
    "Very interesting course if you're willing to pay attention during lecture and think critically about what they are trying to teach you.",
    "I learned a lot about different ways to value the environment and to value environmental harm.",
    "This class was very well taught and examined many aspects of topics often ignored in other classes. It did this through the lense of economics, which was fairly effective. It was also very attainable to non economics majors, which was very exciting.",
    "I learned all about conflicts of interest and current policies regarding the proper management of natural resources in today's world. The course was primarily focused on the United States, with a majority of the examples and cases pertaining to US industries. The vast array of conservation, abatement, production\/extraction management and environmental policies I learned in this course were all extremely interesting and engaging for me. I loved learning how you can integrate and use economics into the field of natural resource management to value any particular stock or management plan. This class was easily my favorite class of the semester!",
    "I learned how to find market solutions to environmental issues using economics.",
    "I gained a greater knowledge about pollution and resource control beyond my precious understanding that pollution is bad and recycling is good. This class goes deep into many environmental issues and allows me to now better understand our current situation and how we should manage going forward. I also learned about the effects that competition and government regulation has on the environment and what would probably happen without it. These are valuable skills to me.",
    "I learned about how economists think about environmental problems and how to solve them like an economist.",
    "Qualitatively interesting but Econ part was not great.",
    "Resource management. How renewable\/nonrenewable resources are managed. Trade offs in pollution control. How to value natural resources.",
    "I learned a lot in general about tying economic matters with environmental problems. It was a very interesting mix.",
    "I think I have a better idea of how the environment is managed from an economic perspective and the predominate models used.",
    "Insights on managing non renewable resources",
    "Learned aspects of resource management that I had not previously considered.",
    "I learned a lot about how economists think about managing pollution, nonrenewable resources, and renewable resources. We discussed the economic reasoning behind strategies for managing environmental issues ranging from climate change to fisheries. We learned the justification for regulations as well as the advantages and disadvantages of various forms of government intervention. In addition to the economic perspective, we also gained a basic scientific and factual understanding of these concepts and the terminology used to discuss them.",
    "I practiced the demand\/supply solution to different public environmental goods, and learned new cash flow based methods (Hotelling, MSY, Faustmann) to manage certain goods."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Weakness: The professor rarely prepared lecture slides for class, and just talked like it was a TED talk, so it was hard to follow.",
    "All of the psets were purely math. None of the qualitative work was brought up until the midterms\/final, so these parts had to be studied much more than the math. Add more qualitative questions to the weekly HWs.",
    "This course does its job in giving the facts. While I found the content interesting, at times the class could get a little monotonous. Overall I would recommend.",
    "The course could be somewhat more organized and the lectures are very conceptual based versus the facts that will be on the test.",
    "I think this course would really benefit from assigning students a textbook.",
    "The lectures weren't relevant to problem sets. You learned how to do the problem sets in section, which was annoying as there didn't appear to be a consistency in how the sections were taught.",
    "A little disorganized. No textbook made things a bit less coherent. Problem sets sometimes only tangentially related to lectures.",
    "I thought that the strengths were section, some of the lectures were really great, and the topics chosen. I almost feel like there could have been an entire seminar to any one of the units covered. The material was really fascinating and I enjoyed particularly the information about the fisheries and other renewable resources. This class truly made me want to take more classes in environmental economics.",
    "This course is designed for a broad base of students (Econ majors and forestry school students). This can lead to the watering down of material from each of those fields. The strength of this course is that it tries to develop an intuition about internalizing the cost of doing environmental damage when planning economic projects. However, the P-sets were often divorced from this intuition and simply an exercise in math. I think the P-sets should integrate the intuition part more.",
    "My biggest issue with this course was the fact that there were no set office hours for help with problem sets. The TAs seemed to decide that each TA would be responsible for certain problem sets, and that TA then decided to hold office hours whenever they wanted during the week. This made it hard to attend office hours because the times were always changing and I often had conflicts. This was especially an issue because I found the problem sets to be confusingly written at times. This could be solved by having each TA have office hours every week, so students have consistent office hours that they could attend. Another weakness of the course were the oftentimes vague exam questions. Many times during exams I was unsure what information I was being asked to provide.",
    "The strengths of the class were that it talked about a large breadth of material and did so in a manor that was understandable for non economics majors. A weakness of the class is that it relied on very simple models that were most likely inaccurate, but they were too advanced mathematically for some of the students to handle. This detracted from the overall credibility of the class and its concepts.",
    "there was rarely a clear objective for any given lecture other than talking about a certain topic and much of lecture felt like rambling. Little connection between lecture and section, and the problems from the problem sets were not remotely conceptualized in class (only parts of them in section). As a subject the class has lot of potential, perhaps bringing in more guest speakers in the field of environmental economics or setting a more clear objective for a given lecture\/week would improve the course",
    "The material was interesting and lectures were great, you can tell Professor Mendelsohn is very knowledgeable about the field. However, there was no overlap between problem sets and lectures. You kind of had to hope for the best that your TA would give you a hint and even then it was a lot of struggling.",
    "This course was exceptional and I loved Professor Mendelsohn's lecture style and real-world examples he gave in class. Sometimes the problem sets seemed to stray a bit from the course material covered in class, but the exams were very fair and the teaching staff did a good job of answering questions on material covered in less thorough detail.",
    "The course material was often dry, and there were no slides posted online so you had to be present at every lecture. The sections were a good compliment to the lecture, because they made sure you actively engaged with the material and made the problem sets a lot more comprehensive.",
    "The course is well taught and for the most part, sections are well organized the big issue for most is that they don't get the most out of the course because they don't attend lecture regularly. Professor Mendelsohn is great and really knows so much about the environment. He does a great job of pointing out the flaws in management strategies and identifies ways in which public perception of an issue and the solution they believe to be best can be wrong. He doesn't just explain topics but gives applications to them and teaches us why they are important. Problem sets are not always well explained and students that only do the easy problem sets aren't as well prepared for the exams, which is a downside if they don't know.",
    "This class makes very broad statements, but is never like oh this is how an economist would think about it, and this is very simplified. As an evst major, a lot of the things the professor would say would make me pretty angry, especially because it was a very one sided view of the problem. This class had a lot of potential to be very interesting, but got caught up too much in an idealized world and theoretical concepts.",
    "I really enjoyed learning about climate change, but the course is not well designed and it's not clear what we need to know at all. Post the lecture slides!!",
    "Interesting material. Very organized\/structured. Sometimes I thought the TA's were a bit inconsistent in their answers to specific questions. Also the homeworks could be a bit confusing\/unclear at times.",
    "Weaknesses: qualitative questions on exams were very unpredictable",
    "It was not always clear how problem sets related to class discussions or which parts of lecture were most important. However, all topics were very interesting and relevant to our understanding of environmental economics in general.",
    "This course material would be easier learned with slides, at least for certain graphs.",
    "The course does offer a good overview of environmental management but is very disorganized and the assignments do not correlate well with the lecture material. The course would benefit from a set of lecture slides to guide note taking and overall major take aways.",
    "No lecture slides",
    "The professor is very involved with the field and enjoys what he teaches, but the material can be repetitive and dry at times.",
    "I thought the course was interesting and engaging, especially because it tied many of the concepts directly to real world issues. I feel like I learned a great deal about how resources are actually managed. I think the course could be improved by better outlining the lectures. A lot of times it was hard to tell what the key points he was trying to make were and when he was going off on a tangent.",
    "One of the strengths of the course is that it covers many of the environmental issues that are important in today's world. It also gives a broad perspective of the important takeaways from the academic literature, and the reading list allows students to explore these in more depth. Another strength of the course is that it suggests tangible interventions that could be implemented to improve the current situation. Additionally, the fact that professor Mendelsohn uses the chalkboard during lecture facilitates learning, as many students find it easier to follow when graphs and diagrams are drawn in real-time. One way to improve the course might be to work through more example problems, either in class or in section, to better prepare students for the problem sets. Another potential suggestion for improvement might be to provide mathematical\/numerical arguments alongside the intuitive and graphical arguments presented in class, which might help those students who are quantitative thinkers.",
    "The strength of the course is the ability to group together environmental issues that have different economic solutions. The weakness is that both the grouping and the lecturing are poorly organized. We are assigned reading materials that are too obtuse for undergrads. The fact that we were waived the reading requirements added to the confusion. The professor lectured without slides, and students often missed his point without the help of some written guides. The TA sections were also poorly organized, with different sections teaching different things; students perform very differently among the sections in the tests."

   "comments": [
    "I took this class because I heard it was a gut to be honest, it probably was, but the topic wasn't that interesting to me, and it was hard to follow the professor throughout the term.",
    "Good class if you need a relatively easy Economics elective.",
    "Yes. This course is not too hard, but it also isn't too easy. A good class for an Econ major but would recommend to all.",
    "While the material of this course was interesting enough, the structure is poorly organized, and information taught across TA sections were different.",
    "Yes, great econ credit and interesting application of economics to real work problems.",
    "This is essentially a microeconomics class with a focus on the environment as a widget. Pretty much, you'll apply concepts that you learned in intro micro to environmental issues. It provides a decent framework to start looking at environmental issues, if that's something you're interested in. Psets every week (take less than two hours each), two midterms, and a final.",
    "I would recommend this course to other students as it examines so many aspects of society that we take for granted. It also gives students the tools needed to analyze these problems in the future.",
    "No. Though the material of the class is mildly interesting, the class is POORLY organized. The lectures were vague and the problem sets were unclear (with consistent typos). The exams were ridiculous - they weren't necessarily difficult, but asked questions that were NOT covered in lectures, sections, readings or problem sets. I do think that this class has potential, but given that it has been structured the same way for years, it is unlikely to change.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. The integration of economics into the fields of forestry and natural resource management is extremely interesting and the course material has wonderful concrete examples. The problem sets are pretty average and fair, and the exams are very fair as well. The teaching staff is willing to answer questions and there is a 2 hour office-hour session per week. If you like the idea of looking at the world with a slightly new perspective on valuation, this course is for you!",
    "I would recommend this course to another student who is interested in both economics and the environment. The workload was very bearable, and the math was never more complicated than taking derivatives. It was definitely enlightening to learn how markets can efficiently solve environmental issues, and that government action isn't always the answer. However, if you aren't interested in these topics, the course will be very boring for you.",
    "I would recommend this course but I feel that if you're not going to go to lecture, then the only incentive of taking this course would be to try and squeak by with a decent grade. However, this lecture is very insightful and will help a lot with understanding the material. If this is something a student isn't willing to do, I'd recommend taking another class with a light workload since it's very easy to mess up on exams in this class if you don't know what you're doing.",
    "If you are taking this class as an evst major, there are more interesting classes to take as a core class. While low in coursework, it is pretty dry, and the things you learn in this class contradict a lot of things you learn in other evst classes.",
    "Solid Econ elective if you need an easier one",
    "If the topics interests you, take the course. Professor Mendelsohn is clearly a brilliant man and you actually learn a lot about very relevant topics in class. The homeworks can be a bit confusing at times so go to the office hours or talk to TAs- they are always willing to help.",
    "Decent Econ credit, heavy on qualitative material if you're into that. Easy quantitative",
    "Good course for basic diving into environmental economics and the workload is relatively easy.",
    "As a non-econ major who enjoys the subject and needed a last QR credit, I think Natural Resources was a good choice. At times Professor Mendehlson strays from the material that is on the problem sets and exams, but the TAs did a great job of teaching those specifics in section. You will definitely come away from the class with some new, interesting knowledge.",
    "No, pretty bad. Lectures are vague and midterms and final are random",
    "I wouldn't recommend this course. It's definitely easy, but also very frustrating. None of the math you do for the exams and psets is difficult or time consuming, but the psets are so horribly formatted and written that it's often impossible to begin without going to office hours. Most people got perfect scores on the math section of both midterms, meaning the short answers (which are worth half of your grade or more) end up being curve breakers. And since concepts are poorly explained, you better hope you attended lecture and section every time otherwise you'll get a B just from that section of the exam.",
    "The course was ok for an Econ elective that does not require much background or math but does provide interesting information. The class would be much better and less confusing if organized better.",
    "Good class for economics majors looking for easier electives to balance with the more demanding econ courses.",
    "I would recommend this course to economics majors interested in applying the tools of economics to environmental issues. The course was divided into three sections: pollution, nonrenewable resources, and renewable resources. We learned not only the economics of environmental issues, but we also used economic reasoning to discuss the best solutions. I think the course is best suited for economics majors, or at least those who have some familiarity with economic concepts, such as through intro\/intermediate micro.",
    "I do not recommend this course to another student. Even though the topics covered are stimulating and useful, the lectures and the TA sections are a mess, and you would be better off studying the topics yourself.",
    "No, poorly organized and one of the worst taught classes I've taken at Yale.",
    "This class is ok. Workload is low but you don't learn a lot. Lectures are somewhat boring."
