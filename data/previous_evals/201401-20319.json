    "You need to want this class. It is a lot of work, and, for some, myself included, there is a steep learning curve. Professor Cole's standards are high, but he will put in as much time as you do to make your project transform before your eyes. The translation workshops that were at the very heart of the class exposed the genius of our literary peers at Yale College. During the workshop process, peers are at once highly critical and supportive. You will, at points, become frustrated if you care about your project, but in the best way imaginable. This class is an exercise in probing \"tip of the tongue\" moments and searching for the perfect word. I cannot say enough about this class.",
    "This is a legendary class, and I think it is for good reason. Professor Cole is unbelievably dedicated to this course and spends an insane amount of time organizing it and helping out the students with their translation projects. The students in this class tend to be extremely intelligent and work on fascinating projects, and it is the kind of class that bonds over the course of the semester. Be prepared for a fair amount of theory--if this isn't up your alley, the Tuesday discussions might feel tedious at times.",
    "The Practice of Literary Translation is really two different classes combined: one is an exploration of the history of translation, reading several versions of the same short passages from a single famous text (the Bible, the Odyssey, the Rubaiyat, etc.) and critical texts on the art\/practice\/theory of translation. It's a fabulous opportunity to get a feel for the reality of a translated text when you don't speak the original language--even without any Spanish, looking at seven different versions of a passage of Don Quixote gives you a feeling for what they're all doing differently and, therefore, what must be there in the original. The second part of the class is a series of workshops of each student's semester-long translation project, which is a wonderful chance to give and get peer feedback on the work, which Professor Cole also gives lots of assistance with. If this sounds cool and you're not scared away by a lot of reading, writing, and hard work, I cannot recommend this class enough.",
    "First, Professor Cole is so outrageously and wonderfully caring toward his students. I don't think I've had any other professor who's read my work or listened in section so intently. And this makes you want to work for him, encourages you to do your best! Because of his care, I felt motivated in this class as I have in few other classes at Yale. Second, of course, he is intelligent and talented, and leads you to intense and great thought through example, through questioning, his insights are invaluable, he is great. I learned so much in this class about not only translation but also thought, inquiry, language in general. I recommend it so many times over.",
    "A mix of theory and praxis. If you get in, take it.",
    "Take it! Amazing class. Please please please don't bring your laptops--translation and commenting on other's work requires a lot of trust, and laptops detract from that.",
    "Absolutely great course, tied with only one other\u2014Hepokoski's 19th & 20th century music\u2014for best I ever took in four years at Yale. Professor Cole's genuine care for his students and for translation creates a sensitive and compassionate atmosphere for group discussions and critiques, so that rather than the typical section assholery and grandstanding each of our discussions was truly a sharing and exploration of ideas. In this course I did my best academic work at Yale. Rather than slogging through a hack job for some deadline, I was working tirelessly with a personal imperative to help others understand a text as I do. And it's hard to imagine how my translation could have turned out any other way\u2014between the support and equally exciting work of the rest of the seminar and Professor Cole's guidance and thoughtful feedback, I had all the tools I needed to succeed. You have at least an inkling that you like translation. Let this course explode it into a lifelong passion, and introduce you to some of the most wonderful minds on campus to boot: I'll stay in touch with a couple people from the seminar as we graduate and continue to work on our translations."
