    "If you're taking the class, definitely take the lab! There is so much food - it's amazing! Fruit, candy, pie, cake, you name it! Basically, you get to eat everything you learn about. Getting to the greenhouse is certainly a trek, but it's worth it. Seeing the plants really helps for the lecture class. The quizzes are very hard - you have to know the plant families really well to succeed. You have to be able to look at a plant and identify it to family, which can be difficult. Just knowing facts about a family is very different from actually being able to recognize it. The labs are always a time crunch - there is so much to see. The final exam is very reasonable, and it's helpful to study at the greenhouse. There's a trip to the NY Botanic Gardens, which was a lot of fun. The trip to West Rock at the end of the semester was also a good time.",
    "yes, definitely. it helps so much with the lab, and it's really great to be able to experience plants so intimately.plus, we eat a ton of stuff. some labs we have over ten types of food\/candy\/drinks\/fruit, including a warm, freshly baked strawberry rhubarb pie! it's so great.",
    "This class is GREAT. Pretty much you go to the greenhouse once a week and draw flowers and various botanical structures based on what you see (no artistic skills required!) Dave does an amazing job getting the greenhouse ready with all the plants for each week of study. Often we got to eat food products derived from the families we were studying that week (cake and fruit and candy and pie!) We went on two great field trips, one to the New York Botanical Garden and one to West Rock to collect specimens. Homework is usually to either study for a practical quiz or collect information on an on-campus plant and upload it to an online database (all very doable and low-stress). I would definitely recommend Plant Lab to another student because I looked forward to going to this class every week.",
    "very nice",
    "A great lab course. All lab work is done is class! The quizzes and final were difficult, but not impossible. There is a lot of memorization you need to do, but you also get to eat a lot of different types of plants in lab!",
    "YES take this class. Even if you're not science-y. Even if you're not interested in plants (yet). You'll eat types of fruit you didn't know existed, you will spend hours drawing flowers, and you will come away with great applicable knowledge about the world around you.",
    "It's a wonderful course to take as a lab with the lecture. It's a fun lab, though it is a lot of memorizing, so if that's not your thing, this is not the lab for you.",
    "If you're taking the lecture course and can fit the lab into your schedule, do it. It's not too much work, you get to spend an afternoon every week in the Botanical Gardens, and the field trips are fun.",
    "Take it! If you:- enjoy being in a tropical greenhouse during the winter- like ripping apart flowers and looking at stuff under the microscope- have always wanted to be able to identify plants and understand their biology, this is the class for you- want to try civet coffee or magic berries...then this is the class for you."
