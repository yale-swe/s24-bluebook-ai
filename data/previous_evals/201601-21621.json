   "comments": [
    "I highly recommend this course, especially if you have any interest whatsoever in recent Chinese history and\/or contemporary Chinese language. Be prepared for some heavy reading and vocabulary memorization, but you will come out of the experience speaking, writing, and reading better than you ever did before (definitely worth it).",
    "A great class to take if you're trying to maintain Chinese skills without taking a hardcore language course. Su Laoshi and Wang Laoshi were both incredible, and the material is extremely interesting. The only downside is that you won't see a huge improvement in your Chinese, but I think that it's a worthwhile class to take especially for the amount of time and effort it requires.",
    "Excellent course. I'm Chinese, and the class really gave me insight into the zeitgeist of early to mid 20th century China, as well as how this period influences Chinese culture today. Additionally, I get to name drop a few prominent authors while talking to my parents. Finally, I got to brush up on my Chinese writing and reading skills, which have definitely gotten a little rusty.",
    "The course title is misleading. I expected more literary discussion, instead of sentence and diction. We did read one sample piece from seven of the nine major literary figures. What little Su laoshi told about culture and literature was fascinating and gave a framework for developments in China in early 20th century. The course had too much homework, which, I guess, is a reaction to earlier evaluations about too little work. Because too many students signed up, at the beginning of the semester, we spontaneously broke into two sections. Wang Mengxiao, a grad student, taught half of the classes (note, both teachers taught both sections in rotation). Originally, I was disappointed to have a TA, but she turned out a delight. Wang laoshi was clear and enthusiastic. She led the discussions with complex questions and gave friendly interpretations of student's responses. Her powerpoints on words were helpful for review.",
    "Was apprehensive about taking Chinese again, given that it was the class I did the worst in back in high school, but I really shouldn't have worried - CHNS 165 was a great class that really allowed me to enjoy and appreciate the Chinese language as well as Chinese literature and culture. Proud to have finally read works by Lu Xun and other notable 20th century authors, and to have learned to read traditional Chinese along the way. Su Laoshi was also wonderful teacher with all sorts of interesting personal stories and viewpoints that really enlivened the classroom!",
    "If you are interested in Chinese fiction of the 20th century, take this class. Professor Su is an incomparable figure here at Yale. His knowledge is remarkable, and the depth of his lectures and personal anecdotes is unique."
