    "Take it! Similar in structure to the intro B\/W class: lectures interspersed with crits, except now you're working in medium format. Lisa is great.",
    "A really great intermediate class - lots of freedom to work on whatever you'd like, while also receiving constant guidance and help from Lisa. The schedule was sometimes haphazard but never detracted from the class at all. The course demands a lot of time for shooting, developing, and printing, but is overall absolutely worth it - Lisa is wonderful and medium format is amazing.",
    "Amazing class! If you love photo, take it! You'll use awesome medium format cameras to take large negatives. You'll shoot less pictures, but more emphasis will be put on each.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class to anyone as you can explore a wonderful medium and learn photographic techniques.",
    "Shoot. Kill. Develop. Crit."
