An overview of the environmental and economic benefits and costs of introducing trees to agricultural systems, and the forces that slow and prevent the introduction. Practical knowledge of how agroforestry systems function nutritionally\/environmental and economically, and practical skills of how to set up agroforestry systems.",
    "Good understanding of agroforestry practices and how they're being implemented.",
    "As the title states, I learned about the scientific and practical aspects of agroforestry systems. I gained insight into the role agroforestry may play in ecosystem restoration, landscape design, and food systems.",
    "The scientific consensus and current technical opinions about agroforestry, but also an overview of agriculture and forestry. Incentives and barriers for agroforestry. How to evaluate sites and trees and how to plan agroforestry projects.",

   "comments": [
    "The course was extremely engaging, and was a delight to attend each class. I went from a place of near total agroforestry ignorance to now having a breadth of big picture and practical knowledge in the field. I was not in the majority as a student who wanted to learn about scalability, but I would have loved to learn more about large agroforestry operations in the U.S.",
    "I would have liked to have more time in class for group discussions of the readings and\/or lecture material.",
    "Strengths were in good field trips, great lecture material and classes. Weaknesses in lack of expectations of final project, incorporation of some of the readings into lecture material.",
    "The field trips were great and much appreciated. It would be great if there was a short section at the end of each module to discuss how the lessons learned would be applied to agroforestry system design. Personally, I would have appreciated a nudge or two--i.e. outline or literature review--to submit for the term project earlier in the semester.",
    "Strengths: good combination of scientific lectures and discussions about practical implementation. Many examples and case studies. I really enjoyed the field trips. Weaknesses: While the many examples were very interesting and helpful, it would have been nice to talk about overall themes that could be applied to different regions. More examples from other regions would have been nice (if there is existing literature), for example from Africa, Asia, South America.",
    "I felt that the concepts really were solidified when I was able to see them in the field (ex. on the oak springs field trip )- the more fieldwork the better though I appreciate that field trips are expensive!"
