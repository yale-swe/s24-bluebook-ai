   "comments": [
    "Great course. You can design your own research project (or jump onto a project you find interesting.) My lab techniques really improved through this experience!",
    "It is a semester of individual research- 10 hours a week in the lab are expected, so it obviously requires some discipline on the student's part. I recommend it to anyone doing senior research or interested in pursuing basic science research. It's very flexible in terms of what lab you work in, as long as it's somewhat related to EEB.",
    "This is a great course if you are interested in research and working closely with a single professor.",
    "It's Independent Research - make sure you have an advisor you like who does research that interests you. Also make sure that he or she is easily accessible. You must be able to work well on your own and manage your time well."
