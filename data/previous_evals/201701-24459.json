   "comments": [
    "I learned how to make a business on the opposite side of the world in an environment that I have never step foot in.",
    "-learned a lot about teamwork, managing bosses, and the details of getting a business started.",
    "Specifically I learned a lot about fundraising models, how to create a financial spreadsheet, how to create a business plan, how to work effectively in a team, among other things.",
    "This course was all about learning by doing and about troubleshooting extremely complex problems. We designed a business from scratch, which is something I've never done before, in a region that we had no access to and very little information about. Given these obstacles, it was amazing to see what my team and I were able to create. I gained a lot of teamwork experience, practical business skills, and how to think creatively.",
    "I learned most extensively from my team members - particularly in terms of financial modelling and constructing and presenting business cases.",
    "I learned a lot from the course especially about the Somalian context. It was also interesting to be in a fairly disorganized structure and forced one to respond quickly to changes."

   "comments": [
    "This course is extremely unstructured. It was frustrating at times having varying goals amongst the team (some believed that this was going to be a huge business worthy of Amazon retail, etc. but that was just truly unrealistic for where we were starting). This is a reflection of the lack of local understanding by a significant portion of the group- having people on the group helping us contributed to shifting this incorrect mindset of the team.",
    "It was very back-ended with the first half of the semester being pretty slow and the second half super intense. The whole point was that we couldn't control it, but I think stress levels got really high. It was definitely not like a regular class though so I could imagine the instructors not necessarily wanting to change that. However, I think sometimes accounting for the fact that actually these are students and this is one of 4 or 5 commitments would not only be good for the class, but also good for student morale.",
    "A strength of this course was the people--- I have never worked with such an amazing team where everyone was pulling their own wait. A weakness is the format. We were inefficient many times because things were disorganized or people were being needlessly repetitive\/talking for the sake of talking. Whenever we had agendas this problem was combatted.",
    "Strengths: The mission was an exciting proposal and the students that were chosen were inspiring and self-driven. Weaknesses: There was a serious lack of information from the Somalia side. We started off with no funding which greatly complicated things (perhaps this course could start off with a base amount of money). The first several weeks were spent discussing the emotional parts of the Hope Village story. While it is important to know the background of what we're dealing with, I found that Gabriela's focus on the story was not appropriate and came off as a bad case of the \"savior complex.\" This did not help us in creating an actual business. Furthermore, Gabriela's leadership and instruction were a huge weakness. She constantly imposed arbitrary deadlines, set unrealistic expectations, ignored information that was communicated to her (we would agree on something one class and the next class it was as if this had never happened), and her insisting on the honey product (which I think was not worth pursuing) and then placing the blame on us for this was completely ridiculous. Furthermore, it was clear towards the end of the class that she was unable to separate social interactions from professional work as she ended up heavily criticizing some extremely valuable and hard-working team members apparently based on nothing more than a personal disliking of them (from my view). Some of the claims that she made that some people didn't do any work or were huge disappointments were completely unfounded and unjust. I think for the most part, she was an obstacle, a distraction, and another problem to manage in order to get anything done in this class. This class could be improved by finding a more pragmatic, responsible, and communicative leader.",
    "Weakness: The course started of very slowly with limited initial direction and focus. Strength: very student-led, student motivated, passionate.",
    "A lot more structure. Less busy work. More voice from the class on how to reach final goals."

    "I have mixed feeling about the course because it was very nerve-wracking but also very rewarding.",

    "If you are someone who is actually going to put in the work and be realistic, take this course. It is amazing in so many ways.",
    "I would recommend this class to another student if the problems I stated in the previous question were addressed. Otherwise, I would not.",
    "Very dependent on their interests and personality. It was a high risk, high reward course."
