    "how to take your poetry to the next level (even if you're starting at level 0), experimenting with different styles of poetry, think about what makes something a poem rather than for example, prose; thinking about what makes a \"good\" poem or \"bad\" poem and the extent to which these labels even matter",
    "I grew so much as a writer and reader, and I learned how to give better feedback to my peers.",
    "Intense growth in my poetry writing skills. Started out not having formally written poetry before and ended proud of my writing. Learned to analyse poetry well and discuss and workshop in a class.",
    "I developed skills in poetry writing and creation, as well as in group poetry analysis.",
    "Learned how to adapt skills from the poetry I love reading, and poetry I may not read as often as well. Developed a much stronger voice(s) as a writer.",
    "I was fairly unfamiliar with modern poetry before taking this course, and now I have a good understanding of modern poets and the dynamics of writing poetry in the modern world.",
    "I really developed a new perspective on poetry and how to write. I have been largely inspired by Professor Gorin, my classmates, and several authors I have read.",
    "A deeper understanding of how to use language in all forms of writing and communication. How to use repetition to make ordinary things beautiful. How to modify repetition to create surprise and humor and flow. I gained access to an art form that can be intimidating\/challenging on the surface, and now take immense joy in it. I learned a variety of generative tools to spark creative inspiration and keep producing material even when the way forward isn't immediately clear. I gained a cursory knowledge of the recent history of English-language poetics, and an introduction to the work of some of the major living poets.",
    "Expanded my knowlege and appreciation of poetry (David has us read so much good poetry and find poets we like on our own), wrote more poetry and recieved excellent feedback on my work."

   "comments": [
    "the workshops were a big strength. the way office hours was organized, i LOVED the one-on-one feedback. definitely feel like david did everything he could to give everyone as much one-on-one time as possible (which is difficult with the class size). there should be more poetry classes like this available!",
    "The assignments are well laid out to give you more freedom as you grow more confident as a poet. Being more diligent about boundaries around time spent on each person during workshops would be helpful.",
    "There is a great value in writing poetry with people of differing backgrounds, reasoning for taking the course, prior poetic experience, and writing styles. The best part is the class, and the small size allows you to become intimately involved with the work of your classmates. You are also exposed to a wide variety of poets both in the classroom and in the syllabus so its a great way to expand your poetic horizons. David also keeps the atmosphere fantastic.",
    "Love Professor Gorin and the work we read \/ class dynamic. I would have loved to receive more written feedback on my work.",
    "The strengths in this class are the workshops, the themed assignments every week, the class discussions, Professor Gorin himself, and the style he teaches in.",
    "Strengths: excellent feedback, great weekly prompts, exciting course packet of poems. David really facilitated his students sharing their work with one another. This network of poets was one of the key strengths of this class."

   "comments": [
    "yes definitely! it's so so fun thinking about language through the lens of poetry and writing funny things that have such life on the pages!",
    "I highly recommend taking this course with David Gorin! He creates a welcoming classroom environment for people of different writing backgrounds, dedicates so much time outside of class giving thoughtful one-on-one feedback, and puts together a really enjoyable reading packet. One of my favorite classes at Yale.",
    "If you want to read great poetry and be pushed to write every week, absolutely! The poetry prompts were great and the workshops+reading a lot+meetings with David will push your poetry to the next level, particularly if you're a beginner. Loved it every single class, always brightened my mood.",
    "I think it's a great means of expression and I'm really happy I took it though I was initially skeptical. Just do it.",
    "Yes! Awesome idea for a course and great professor",
    "Absolutely! The class was a fantastic opportunity to have your work be heard and improve your writing.",
    "I would 100% recommend.",
    "Simply can't recommend highly enough. This class taught me to listen to myself and to others, sparked endless information, and set me on a path to read tons more poetry in the future. Reframed how I think about poetics and aesthetics in general.",
    "Take! Super fun and supportive class environment. David gives generous and plentiful feedback, the syllabus is good, and his assignments really helped ease me into writing poetry on a weekly basis."
