    "Number and duration of classes; the classes were too few and each one was too long.",
    "Assignments were longer than I expected for a one-credit course, though very helpful for thinking through different topics.",
    "I wish we had had more time. I got so much out of the few meetings we had, and feel that if this were 2- or 3-credit course, it would be even more helpful. I didn't find the process design section as useful, but that's also because my interest doesn't lie in that area. Other than that, the only improvement I could suggest would be to distribute readings electronically before class and require students to read them so that they are more prepared to discuss the concepts.",
    "It would have been better had the class fall on the same day\/ time each week it ran, as it was very difficult to fit this course into my class schedule because the classes fell I think on 3 different days\/ times.There was perhaps a few too many assignments considering the short length of the class and the fact that it was only 1 credit. I would suggest dropping 1 or 2 assignments, perhaps the journal reflection.It would be nice if the course didn't focus only on public consultation, but also focused on other types of meetings (ie. corporate meetings, non-profit meetings), and other types of negotiations other than ie. land disputes (salary negotiations, etc.). I recognize that this is likely because this is the area of expertise of the instructor, but it would be nice to bring in other types of negotiations\/ meetings.",
    "This would be an excellent full-semester course.",
    "Scheduling",
    "Could be presented in terms of broader applicability, not just from the lens of the specific kind of work done by the instructor. The international angle could have been presented earlier.",
    "The international aspect was not very engaging or well setup, and it would be great to have a slightly longer course with even more opportunity for application and learning about concepts."

    "They were great opportunities to practice the skills being taught and hang out with FESers.",
    "The negotiation exercises were very helpful, and it was nice to meet different people.",
    "The group exercises we did were the highlight of the course. The mutual gains negotiation we did toward the end was a blast and very, very helpful to understanding how a real negotiation like that might unfold.",
    "Several of the assignments required us to get together with a group outside of class. We had a lot of fun with the exercises, and made these work sessions into fun events.",
