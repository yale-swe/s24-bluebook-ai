    "Personally, this class was a little too hypothetical for me. We'll never truly know the exact thought process of hunter \/ gatherers or other ancient peoples and that is frustrating but the readings are fantastic and the course is inspiring and engaging. If you are more sociology based, this class is perfect.",
    "a good credit, made me think, generally fun.",
    "Great class. Interesting information in a smaller class setting. Only two exams and a small paper just make sure to stay on top of the reading.",
    "This is a fantastic survey of human& environmental history over the past 13,000 years, focusing in particular on the pattern of how the dynamic environment has, time and again, altered the trajectory of human history. The approach is through scientific literature (spanning decades-old articles to findings not yet released in print), supplemented by well-chosen, surprisingly accessible book chapters. Professor Weiss's lectures tend to meander, but discussion section helps pull things together, and by the end of the term one has a solid introduction to and familiarity with the subject. Professor Weiss is also hilarious.If you seek short, clear, simple answers, this course is not for you: Professor Weiss instead opens the door to the unresolved questions of archaeology& paleoclimatology, presents his own (radical) views, as well as classic arguments and counterarguments, and leaves you with a very real picture of global environmental history, as both a subject and a reality.If the topic interests you, absolutely take this course.",
    "EVST 226 is a very strange course. I wouldn't recommend it unless you have a high tolerance for uncertainty both within the material and within the classes (like, what was the point of the lecture??). Read Guns, Germs, and Steel though! And if you do take it, go to the review sessions that Weiss offers before the midterm and final, they help relieve some of the uncertainty.",
    "I would recommend it if you are a meticulous note taker. The material isn't difficult, but the lack of an outline or focused curriculum made things difficult to keep up with if you missed a word or two.",
    "Harvey's kinda crazy, there's not much work for the class, and lectures are an excellent cure for the will to stay awake. Not my favorite, but I'm not much of an archaeology person. The last half of the class is a lot more interesting than the first.",
    "Great class--Mild work, amazing professor, interesting topic. Just don't expect organization. I'm really glad I took it though",
    "We are taught in our more traditional history classes to study the past in order to understand the present and predict the future. This same concept applies to environmental history. Anyone interested in the current state of our environment should take this class.",
    "An interesting overview of how abrupt climate changes have affected human populations historically. It is not the most structured or organized course, but the lectures are fun to listen to.",
    "I would recommend this course. The content is really interesting and Professor Weiss is a fun teacher. Readings are managable and the exams are also managable - but they do require you to think, not just regurgitate facts. I thought this course was a great compliment to some of the science enviro studies classes giving historical perspective and societal impacts to go along with the hard science.",
    "Environmental Studies 226 provides a broad approach to history with respect to the relationship between past environmental changes and anthropogenic responses. Although the material presented throughout this course is very interesting, I would not recommend this course to a student who needs organization or structure.",
    "I would recommend this course to someone if they are invested in the subject matter and prepared for a looser lecture environment."
