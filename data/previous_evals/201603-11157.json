    "I learned a lot of Italian grammar and vocabulary. Having to learn so many things improved my ability to memorize words quickly.",
    "I had never taken Italian before and I am so happy I did. My professor was superb and so nice. She was a great teacher and was so helpful in office hours. She was always happy and engaged when coming to class.",
    "I gained a solid base in Italian. We learned almost all of the grammar necessary to effectively communicate, and we learned a ton of vocabulary. I feel like I can speak and write in Italian effectively, to the extent that I could go to Italy and feel like I could communicate.",
    "Learning a language is difficult, but my instructor made sure that we had multiple ways to look at things in order to better understand the material.",
    "Great class, learned most of the Italian grammar."

    "I would have liked to have spoken more Italian in class and to have it be more immersive.",
    "This course was wonderful, but the amount of homework per night was a little much. However, the project assignments were enjoyable as they varied into presentations. The professor was amazing and so kind and always available for office hours.",
    "The weakness was that we didn't read enough. I would have appreciated more Italian readings to learn more vocabulary and idiomatic expressions. The strength was that we got very good at listening and could understand spoken word better than in other level 1 language classes I have taken.",
    "I found that I have a very difficult time with memorization and application when it comes to learning new languages, but that once I practice enough, I am fully capable. This is my first time learning a language, unlike everyone else in my class, so I did struggle a lot. But I really enjoyed the challenge of it and cannot wait for L2!",
    "Excellent class, only thing that should be improved is more communication in Italian and minimum in English."

    "Yes! Everyone should know Italian and get to work with the members of the department.",
    "Italian is a great language to learn at Yale, and ITAL 110 is not difficult, yet remains interesting and engaging.",
    "Italian department at Yale and L1 are definitely a YES!"
