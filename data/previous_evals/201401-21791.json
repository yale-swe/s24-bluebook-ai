    "No, don't take it. Find any way you can to get out of taking this ultimately useless 5 hour lab class on Monday evenings. But you probably can't because as an ABET ChemE major you have to take boring, irrelevant, and yet time consuming classes like this.",
    "The TAs are fun. You will get to leave before 9 about half of the time, mostly at the beginning of the semester - the bio labs take longer than the chemistry labs. And yeah, learn some biology. But really this class isn't scary."
