    "It's Chinese. Take it at Yale. It's worth it.",
    "Chinese 151 is an excellent continuation of the Chinese sequence here at Yale. We discussed interesting topics pertaining to Chinese culture, economics, and politics, and the course reinforced and deepened reading, writing, speaking, and listening skills. I would recommend taking this class if you are interested in strengthening your Chinese after having taken Chinese 150 in the fall.",
    "If you are studying Chinese and passionate about the language, continue taking it! This is a great class that'll just keep improving your Chinese language proficiency but be prepared for a lot of work and to be dedicated to the class!!!",
    "I would highly recommend this class. I returned to Chinese after two semesters off, and this class helped me both rebuild me skills and reach a new level of competency. While I still have much to learn, this class left me feeling confident in my Mandarin proficiency. By the end of the semester, you will be reading news articles, watching movies, and reading actual short stories by Chinese authors. If you've reached this level, you know about the workload; however, I think the payoffs from 151 are even greater than 150.",
    "You learn a lot of vocabulary but not so much on your tones. If you aren't devoted 100% probably not worth taking."
