    "Take it! If you are going to take one graduate seminar in EALL, that's the one!It facilitates you with all you need to know about Plum in the Golden Vase and the ways to think about a late imperial Chinese fiction!",
    "This is a close reading class centered on one of the greatest Chinese novel, Jinpingmei. Through reading the novel, you will get a basic idea about how the late imperial Chinese society operated, the lifestyle in the Ming, and more importantly, the rhetoric of Chinese novels. But you need to have some basic knowledge of Chinese, so that you can make sense of the original Chinese texts.",
    "good for anyone interested in Chinese novel",
    "Yes I would definitely recommend it to another student. PGV is one of the few novels that a scholar of Chinese literature cannot bypass and Professor Lu is the best teacher to teach this seminar."

    "It is really helpful. It's not only the knowledge but also the waysto think about literature!",
    "This is the most conventional literary course that I have ever taken at Yale. I learned a lot about how to really close read a novel, how to dig into the deep psychology of characters in the novel, and how to write a literary paper in English. Since my dissertation will also be based on literary texts from the late imperial period, this kind of training is extremely helpful for me.",
    "Contributed very much to my discipline and research.",
    "deepen my background of late imperial Chinese literature and material culture.",
    "It introduced me to the scholarship in the field and has deepened my understanding of the novel."
