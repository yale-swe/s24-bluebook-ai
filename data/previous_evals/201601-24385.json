    "Good class if you're really interested in intellectual history with a focus on early US history. Not a good introduction to philosophy or intellectual history.",
    "If you wanted to learn about democracy at its idealistic roots, about the way we envisioned the world when we created it, and the underlying ideas that all the politics, infrastructure, and social stuff is built on, this is a phenomenal class. Don't be put-off by the reading list, it's a lot but worth it, and Professor Somos makes even revisiting the people you've read before interesting."
