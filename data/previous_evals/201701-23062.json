    "One of the strengths was the about of hands-on help from the TFs. They were a great resource and were always available to help with any issues I came across. The main weakness I saw was how the problem sets could have been used more effectively. Instead of being key moments in learning some of them were quite easy and some were optional. Overall they were quite useful when there was a problem set but they missed out assessing some of the topics I would have found more useful."

I came in knowing very little about R and at the end was able to do a fine piece of research using a dataset. If you are a sociology major thinking about using data this is the course for you."
