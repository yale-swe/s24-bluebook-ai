    "Not a lot of work but not terribly engaging.",
    "Yes, great class. I wrote my senior essay with professor Kranso and that was one of the best decisions I have made in my college career. If you have any interest in the Untied Nations (even if you don't), take this class. Not work intensive, only 2 presentations and a paper for the semester. You don't really have to do the readings, but if you do they are interesting as well and can really help you on your end of term papers if you pick the right topic.",
    "I highly recommend the class. Although discussion could get a bit dry at times, the material is great and would give you a great overview of how the UN works. Prof. Krasno is a great Professor with so much experience with the UN. Her personal stories add a personal touch to the class."
