    "The teaching style does not work for me but the content is great",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone.",
    "I appreciate that this class allowed for a lot of flexibility and creativity and that it also was very functional\/practical in orientation. I would highly recommend this course to anyone interested in policy science. My only suggestion would be to inform students that there would be a lot of reading on the front end of the class and more hands-on project work in the second half. Would help with student planning and preparation. Otherwise excellent course and instruction. Thank you!",
    "The course was very accelerated at the beginning, and I think I missed a lot early on because these concepts are difficult to understand unless you really have time to let them sink in. Susan understands this, however, and doesn't criticize students for not grasping the concepts--she doesn't assume it's because we aren't trying! Knowing that made it a lot easier to keep after the material even when I felt like I was very far behind. I have been continuing to read and re-read the course readings over winter break--a testament to the course, for sure!",
    "The opportunity to attend the COP is amazing, and provides the foundation for the course. In many cases the course was disorganized and unclear - perhaps a result of having a student run course. I suspect the TAs (and thus the class) would have benefited frommore direction from the course Professor. While frustrating during the semester, the lack of organization is more than made up for by the opportunity to attend the COP as a (somewhat) interested party.",
    "This class should be taken by every mem student",
    "This is a very practical course that every environmental manager must take. The concepts of policy science are very useful not only in terms of projects management but also applicable in daily lives. One comment i have is that i would sometimes stuggle to understand what the instructor was saying. It would tough to catch-up with her.",
    "Jenn Hoyle, the TA, did a particularly fabulous job. She worked very hard and made lots of time to talk with us one on one and in small groups about tough issues in the class."

    "The integration of philosophy, psychology and science, and the opportunity to learn from my classmates through presentations.",
    "This class was amazing because I think it has given me a great tool with whcih to strive for a better understanding of policy and how it can be used in striving towards the coomon interest.",
    "Not only did it enhance my way of thinking, but introduced me to thinking about my thinking.Gave me the vocabulary to describe and a method by which to understand a problem.Prof. Clark and Jenn Hoyle were so generous in terms of sharing their time and insightMind maps - great way to capture the complexity of standpoint",
    "Exposure to really useful new way of thinking.",
    "Learning the policy sciences framework.Learning how to apply the frameworkOther people's presentations",
    "the policy framework can be apply to both professional as well as personal realms.",
    "how applicable it is to all problems",
    "Class discussions.",
    "I gained a whole new way of thinking, which I think will be very valuable in my professional career. I already have a renewed excitement for going out into the \"real world\" and applying these new concepts!",
    "The opportunity to learn more about interdisciplinary approaches to conservation problems.",
    "Attending the COP.",
    "The practical aspect of the policy sciences and its application not only in terms of conservation or projects but also in terms of daily lives.",
    "In my professional work, I have used and worked with some of the functions of the decision process and the five tasks of problem orientation of the policy sciences framework. However, I did not have the tools to analyze, evaluate or reflect on each of these functions and tasks on a theoretical basis. This course provided me with the opportunity to reflect upon the many social and environmental policy issues that I have worked with as a practitioner during the past 15 years. It has helped make the \u0093invisible work of thinking and decision making visible\u0094.In addition, this course has provided me with new skills and foundations in thinking more effectively and acting more responsibly in complex natural resource policy cases. It has given me tools to integrate, synthesize, and locate the best arenas for interventions that would facilitate problem-resolution. I also feel that I am better equipped with a new set of concepts and terminology of the policy sciences, in particular: awareness knowledge, how-to-knowledge, and principles knowledge.I particularly enjoyed listening and learning about other policy problems and how each student colleague confronted the social and decision process in other to come up with a new problem orientation and problem-solving alternatives and recommendations. This provided all of us an in-depth application of theory to each of our particular cases; a sort of \u0093learning by doing\u0094.",
    "The pedagogy matched the content--people come first in natural resource management, and people came first in the class. Beginning with a self-orientation and moving on to others, then place, then issues really allows the flow of the ideas to match the structure in which they are presented. It was also neat that this pedagogy was not invisible, but rather quite explicit. That helped build learning and understanding of the content."

   "comments": [
    "organization and execution of lectures",
    "The professor could better facilitate class discussions by asking more direct, less rhetorical questions.",
    "Some more concrete disection of exmaples would have been useful in this respect.",
    "Balance the reading assignments more. Because there was so much in the first few weeks, I found myself racing through some of the material to keep up. This is not the type of material one can or should race through. Consider assigning some of the ancillary readings (i.e. not from the Policy Process book) for later classes, in order to re-enhance, refresh, and so on understanding certain parts of the policy process.",
    "Fewer students to better facilitate discussion.",
    "It seemed like there were too many presentations. Maybe the class would benefit from being a little smaller so that everyone participates.",
    "devoting less class time to student presentations",
    "The course needs to spend more time addressing practical examples. It also needs to be smaller (no more than 10).",
    "The discussions in the first few weeks of the course could have been more inclusive (they tended to be dominated by a few outspoken students, who Susan continued to call on because they did provide great insights, but it made some of the rest of us feel inferior and made it harder for us to speak up). I also think the readings could have been a stronger focus of the class discussions, which could have hastened our grasp of the material.",
    "1. Putting the policy sciences lingo into words more understandable, useful, and applicable to real-world situations.2. Susan often made it difficult to provide adequate discussion time because students often did not know if her questions were rhetorical or not, the class was too big to have intimate in-depth discussions, students often feel intimidated by Susan, she did not give us enough time to think of responses to her or other's questions, the class table\/chair arrangement was inadequate and not conducive to a discussion class, etc.",
    "Organization of course work, expectations, etc. From the first class through to the last class, things felt disorganized.",
    "It was sometimes tough to understand the instructor. We were handed out a lot of handouts which i sometimes struggled to go through. But considering all the four courses i took, i found this one more practical and useful.",
    "1. I recommend that the class conducts an in-depth evaluation of one or two case studies before starting the student presentations (ideally one successful case and one failure of the policy process). We read over the Ecuador case and the different case studies in the handbook, but did not go into much detail about them during our lectures. This will help students visualize the framework in its entirety.2. The Foundations Case Book uses case studies from 1996 and was printed in 2000. It would be interesting to revisit some of these cases and conduct an updated policy analytical framework to see changing trends and conditions and as such, new problem-solving recommendations and alternatives. In addition, I recommend adding new information and cases that can help facilitate the understanding of the policy process and the need for an interdisciplinary focus (as Susan mentioned in our last lecture).3. I believe this class should be a requirement for all FES students. Until we achieve this, I recommend extending a second section of the course (during the spring semester) with more experiential learning skills and methods of the policy process.",
    "While I very much enjoyed presenting and watching some of the other presentations, there's no denying that with this many people in the class a full half semester was devoted to presentations, and that seems too much. Maybe we could present in pairs or small groups instead of individually?Also, while I know that if I had kept my journal faithfully every week it would have been a very useful tool, I was not able to do that and ended up filling in a number of the entries at the end of the semester. I don't know if there's anything to change that, but it would be helpful if Susan or the TA could give a few sample prompts, especially at the beginning and during the student presentations, to help get the juices and motivation flowing."
