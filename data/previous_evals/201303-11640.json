   "comments": [
    "Great course to take if you are interested in the energy sector. However, you will have to be self-motivated to go to lecture once the midterm is over since the final grade is a paper.",
    "Great class, take it doh.",
    "This class actually teaches specific on the oil industry technologies, etc. (pretty rare at Yale). Felt more like a class that would be offered at a larger university with specific majors, etc. If you're really interested in the geology of the oil industry take it!",
    "Fossil fuels is an introduction to fossil fuel resources and alternative energy. It's pretty topical and relatively interesting, but the lectures from the day-to-day are dull and seem pretty surface-level in terms of scientific concepts. It's a chill class to have though since lecture is not super necessary.",
    "YES! take it!",
    "It is a great class, I highly recommend it!",
    "Interesting class overall with a really light workload. You probably don't need to attend class, but you should, because Professor Oristaglio has a very interesting industry perspective on everything. These days, alternative energy and cleantech have become buzzwords, so this is an excellent class to get some energy fundamentals. How we get and use energy is the issue of our time, so I'd recommend this class to anyone who wants a well-taught introduction to the subject.",
    "Yes, an engaging study about a subject matter we all should know more about. Professor Oristaglio is the absolute man, it was awesome.",
    "Yes I recommend this course. Our world is highly dependent on fossil fuels and energy in general. The course gives a great overview of these topics. The field trip was great too!",
    "I would recommend it for a person looking for a science class. It is not the easiest science course, but I learned a lot about some important issues that I should know. You become more well-versed in these areas, which I originally knew nothing about.",
    "This was a great introduction to fossil fuels--the long history of their formation, the brief history of their extraction, and recent trends. It goes over the geology in depth--so be prepared for that! Great readings, good lectures.",
    "If you are curious about Fossil Fuels, take this class it explains a lot that makes you understand the facts behind the news headlines and opinions.",
    "Please take this class. And go to class after the midterm! The material is still interesting and you can learn a lot.",
    "Great class and not demanding. You will appreciate it all the more if you are an early morning person and are willing to walk up science hill to sit in lecture -- it's worth it.",
    "A good course, but I wish it had been more quantitative. Focuses less on \"energy transitions\" than one might wish. Beware the final paper.",
    "Very informative class about oil formation, exploration, and discovery, with a bit of other fossil fuels information thrown in. Parts are a bit simplistic for people with real science background, but overall pretty good! Also, DO THE FALL BREAK TRIP. The coal mine is stunning. The 20-page paper at the end is a bit daunting though, and so is walking to the G&G building at 9am in winter.",
    "If you don't want to learn or be challenged, take the class.",
    "Yup",
    "A great introduction to fossil fuels and the future of energy...a gateway to understanding petroleum origins and energy issues.",
    "The class is not a lot of work, but don't take that as a cue to slack off. The class can be super valuable and you really get out of it what you put in. It's a chance to learn a lot about a subject that's otherwise totally foreign to Yale and very relevant to current events.",
    "Great course! Professor Oristaglio is great, and the material is pretty interesting.",
    "I strongly recommend this class - accessible and interesting material along with a solid lecturer make it enjoyable. 9:25 on science hill is a drag, to be sure - but weighed against the easy problem sets, midterm, and final paper, it's not a big deal.",
    "Not a hard course -- at least, not the Psets or the midterm. (Dunno about the essay, we'll see how he grades it.) No need to do the reading and tons of help available. But if you do care about the material, Prof. Oristaglio is an excellent lecturer.",
    "Take it if you want a great low-workload course that introduces you to the environmental, political, geological, and engineering aspects of fossil fuels. An interesting survey class that gives you as much as you put in, with a dedicated professor and a fairly hefty final paper that is graded harshly (or so I heard). __________ PROFESSOR: Oristaglio had worked in the industry as an engineer\/geologist for tens of years before \"retiring\" and teaching at Yale, and he knows absolutely everything if you care to ask. He explains the concepts very clearly, and is easily understandable and somewhat engaging but not that fast-paced (so he won't jolt you awake in the mornings). He grades the final papers himself, and applies a fairly high standard to the grading. __________ CONTENT: The content makes the class - we go through the uses for fossil fuels, the geological origins of them, the geological and geophysical techniques used to find them, the location and sources of the world's largest fields, ongoing technological changes (fracking, shale oil, oil sands). The focus is definitely on oil; gas comes a close second, with coal being devoted an entire lecture. The content is explained well through slides that he puts online, as well as readings (that are for the most part optional but interesting). The in-class slides are usually put online a week or so after the lecture. __________ TRIP: The class also included a one-night trip over Fall Break to a coal mine and gas compression plant in eastern Pennsylvania. Not only do you get to appreciate the real physical work that goes into retrieval and transportation, it's interesting to hear the facilities' owners and employees and Oristaglio talk about what it's like to work there and their relationships with government agencies, the changing economics of fossil fuels, and the local changes that have come with the gas boom. I strongly recommend going! __________ WORK: The work involves 3 problem sets (very quick each), a midterm (quite simple as well with a thorough study guide), and a 10-page single-spaced paper. The paper is what really tests your knowledge, and he makes it clearly that the difference between an A and a B is usually on the paper, since most students get almost-perfect on the other assignments and he grades quite thoroughly. I really liked writing the paper though, and he gives you a lot of latitude to have multidisciplinary (for example, more economics-y) papers. __________ SUMMARY: This class is known to be a gut and it definitely can be, but it's a great class if you choose to not take it as a gut too. If you choose to take the class properly, you gain a lot of insight into an important industry, get to know a remarkably friendly and knowledgeable professor, all without too much pressure!",
    "I would say the class is a very interesting class and is not difficult at all. Just know that the paper is a large portion of the grade. I would definitely recommend the class to another student, and would suggest he\/she make every effort to go to class as often as possible just for the sake of learning the material. I would also highly recommend the field trip.",
    "definitely! very interesting and oristaglio is fantastic",
    "Recommend.",
    "it's a science credit for non-science people but you'll actually learn a ton. it also gives you a realistic picture of the energy consumption in the world and shows you how naive the fossil free yale thing really is",
    "Take it.",
    "Interesting material, but it's too early and too far away. Professor Oristaglio is a great guy with a really interesting story. He's really flexible with the assignments as well, and super knowledgeable about everything relating to fossil fuels.",
    "I highly recommend G&G 274 is anyone interested in knowing more about fossil fuels with an emphasis on oil and gas.",
    "Great survey class if you want to learn about how fossil fuels are formed and how they are extracted. A must take if you want to understand energy. Also, fun class.",
    "Good class overall- a few problem sets, one tests, and a huge final paper. Really useful information for anyone interested in energy, the environment, economics, and just generally the future of energy in the world.",
    "Lovely science credit; interesting material; fun assignments; early morning rush.",
    "G&G 274 has been one of my favourite courses at Yale. Professor Oristaglio is extremely knowledgeable and does a fantatic job of covering an extensive range of topics relating to fossil fuels, but all in sufficient depth. He is very clear about what will be on the midterm, and the exam was very fair. Professor Oristaglio's background in industry was both welcome and refreshing. TAKE THIS CLASS.",
    "I would not recommend this - I suggest reading the news to learn this material and taking a more interactive course instead.",
    "G&G 274 is a great class that will teach you an abundance of information about fossil fuels. The professor will make sure that you understand the lectures and will provide help on the problem sets if you need it. The readings can be a bit lengthy, but you should definitely take this class to get a thorough overview of the topics discussed.",
    "Highly recommendses",
    "I think that G&G 274 had a lot of great stuff to learn from, but overall, I didn't really enjoy it too much. Often times it was repetitive and I felt I could've done away with a lot of the information we were exposed to. I didn't really appreciate the course work distribution, but the psets and the midterm were fair and the essay was pretty flexible, which was nice. You really have to be into all of the material to really take from the course. Unfortunately, by the end the class was just tiring."
