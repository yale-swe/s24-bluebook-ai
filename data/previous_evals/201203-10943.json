   "comments": [
    "Recommended. The readings are fascinating, the genre of still life is found in almost every museum collection but understudied and under-appreciated. Be prepared not just to work and read, but to think and engage in class.",
    "An excellent survey of the major questions surrounding the genre. Well-structured blend of thematic and historical investigation. Certainly worth taking if you're interested in questions of genre, the high and the low, and the project of illusionism. Will haunt your everyday.",
    "The Genre of Still Life provides a useful overview, primarily of still-life painting, and focuses primarily on the nineteenth century. This is class is applicable to students in a variety of disciplines. I would recommend it particularly to those who wish to work on formal analysis.",
    "I would summarize the course as anexploration of the still life from its earliest appearance as xenia in Rome up to the end of the 19th century, focused most on the 17th-c. Dutch and 19th-c. French traditions. I would recommend it to another student, especially one interested in the genre and in painting."
