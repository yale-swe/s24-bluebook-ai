    "yes",
    "Yes, although the library had lost several books I needed.",
    "I wish that Stanislas had made his lecture slides available to us to download, because they would have been a great reference to keep.We were originally assigned to have class in 211, which is a really bad room for seminars because it is too big and has no big table. Luckily, we were able to switch to the other 2nd floor room after a few weeks.",
    "The resources for the course were entirely adequate besides the library, which as usual, felt entirely inadequate. Between the short hours, the one book policy, the 24-hour lending policy, and the fact that books are often missing, hard to find, or the library doesn\u0092t own them at all, the Arts Library is lacking in many ways that, at a school of such purportedly high quality, should be absolutely embarrassing."
