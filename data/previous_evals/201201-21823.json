   "comments": [
    "If you think you would enjoy reading the court cases, definitely take it. If not, take another course. I personally found the materials to be very interesting, so although I sometimes found Prof. Stone Sweet's lecture to be disorganized, I was still able to enjoy the course.",
    "I would recommend this course as a great foray into international law. Very pertinent issues and gives you a great basic understanding of the main tenets of international law as well as good introduction to thinking about the law and exploring court cases.",
    "Really cool class. My first encounter with law. Prof. Stone Sweet is by far the most engaging and interesting lecturer I've taken a class with. His lectures are really good and flow very naturally. I spend most of lecture trying to frantically write down everything that comes out of his mouth -- he has power point slides but rarely even looks at them, which I respect a lot. He's also quite funny and chill. The class itself is a lot of work, and consists of a lot of pretty dense law reading, especially once you get to the European stuff that may as well be written in German. Two exams and a paper is a pretty decent workload as well. I'd definitely recommend it to people though -- I shopped it on the whim and took it because Stone Sweet was really great and I don't regret it. Take it!",
    "This course was meant to be a survey course about, as stated, the law and politics of globalization. Unfortunately, it delved a little too much into legal minutiae that was pretty much incomprehensible to most of us in the class. Take it if you're willing to put in the work - really not too much, you don't have to keep up with the reading since most of it is supplementary information.",
    "Maybe - it depends how interested in law you are. It's a lot more work than I though it was going to be and the readings are hard to get through. But I do feel like I understand a lot of international systems much better than when I started the class.",
    "Take this course if you have any interest in International Law. Honestly, I came into this course knowing I liked international legal systems, but never thought I would end up enjoying it this much. Don't take this class just for the kick of it - its certainly not that kind of class ! There is a lot of case law to be read, and a lot of really technical readings.Finally, I took this class as a freshman, and managed alright (I think), but if you're on the fence, I'd suggest maybe waiting another year.",
    "Great course, you can't really learn this material in any other class. Very pertinent to current real-world issues.",
    "Dry material, lack of a sense for the real political\/social implications for the cases studied. Absolutely no critical perspectives on what are highly contested institutions such as the WTO (Prof. Stone Sweet completely naturalizes free market ideas). Effective, however, in teaching their basic structures and related legal methodologies. Not sure if I would take again.",
    "Definitely take it if you're looking for a more law-oriented political science class \/ SO credit.",
    "This is a great class if you are interested in international law. It gives you a general overview of the main international legal systems and focuses on the most important cases from each of them. Plus, Prof. Stone Sweet is great! I think one of the most important things about this class is to keep up with the readings and don't fall behind. If I hadn't read the cases each time, I would have probably been lost during lecture. The cases are dense and difficult but I think you should put an extra effort in it if you want to get the most out of this class - plus I believe it would be a pain to go over a bunch of them right before an exam. Otherwise, just take it Credit\/D.",
    "I would summarize Law and Politics of Globalization as a good introduction to legal cases and international institutions. I would definitely recommend it.",
    "Take it!",
    "lots of reading, boring lecturer, curved exams, unnecessary section. Don't do it. this class isn't even about globalization or politics. it's about intergovernmental systems.",
    "I loved this class!! I was truly sad when it ended. The material you learn is the best part of the class. Learning about multinational corporations and human rights, the European Union, the WTO and international arbitration in a single class is pretty amazing. This is the first class that has given me a very concrete tool to analyze globalization through a legal perspective. Incredibly interesting. Midterm, research paper and final. It fun! DO IT!",
    "If you're interested in getting a good overview about how legal global exchange happens, definitely take the course. You'll get a good broad understanding about how the major international legal organizations work, particularly regarding trade. Some of the readings, like straight court cases, are dry, but if the understanding of globalization is worth it to you, go for it.",
    "Take it if you like Law, of if you are not sure about going to law school. You will get to read a lot of cases. It's a great class if you like law and political science. You will be amazed at how much you have learned about the four judicial systems by the end of the course.",
    "I would highly recommend it to anyone interested in law, political science, or the intersection of both. Professor Stone Sweet is brilliant, a great lecturer, and literally wrote the book on many of the topics you'll cover in the class. Try to glance at some of the readings during shopping period to see if you'll enjoy them for the rest of the year: many are excerpts from the actual decisions, and are thus extremely technical and detailed.",
    "You can pretty much get away without doing much of the reading. Otherwise, I found it pretty dull. It's a lot of reading cases, so if you don't like that don't do it.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS WHEN OFFERED (only once every few years)",
    "Law and Politics of Globalization is an interesting introduction to international economic law. However, it is more interesting at the beginning when the Alien Tort Statute is discussed than it becomes later on. Prof. Stone Sweet is very knowledgeable but very disorganized, and having both a final paper and a final is both somewhat redundant and unfortunate.",
    "Yes - especially if you don't much about international commercial law yet (although it also covers some international law on violent offenses - i.e. Alien Tort Statute).",
    "Absolutely take this course. It was easily one of my favorites of my college courses to date. If you have an interest in international law, corporate and trade law especially, or in the EU, take this course!",
    "This is basically a course on international trade regimes and courts dealing with international disputes. Alien Tort Statute, Corporate Social Responsibility, the European Union\/European Court of Justice, the WTO, and then some idiosyncratic and little-known dispute settlement bodies for investment disputes. Pretty good, pretty interesting, just be prepared for some less than captivating reading.",
    "Read the syllabus. If it looks good to you and you would be interested in reading about every one of these topics then take the class. But it something looks boring to you don't do it. The reading is dense.",
    "This class is all about the various legal systems that oversee trade\/economic globalization. I would caution you if you have no interest at all in law, because most of the reading comes directly from legal briefs and the course is very law (rather than politics) intensive. As a result, it can sometimes get a little dry. That said, you're going to learn A LOT, and coming from a non poli-sci\/law\/global affairs person, it's still really cool stuff. The workload is manageable-a midterm, final, and paper, and you get the essay questions in advance of the exams. Professor Stone Sweet is a pretty good lecturer too, and he selects great TAs from the law school.",
    "PLSC 168 is definitely a pre-law course. The materials are pretty dense (a lot of the readings are briefs and court decisions), but if you are interested in integration of legal systems and globalization it is very interesting. The tests aren't too bad because you are given several essay prompts in advance, but be prepared that on top of a midterm and final there is a final 8-10 page research paper.",
    "Great course if you are interested in international law. Professor Stone Sweet has a good sense of the direction this field is moving in. Readings are generally short, but are usually dense legal primary sources.",
    "Yes, but it is a difficult class",
    "Engaging and enjoyable polisci course that differs from the norm because of its evidence on legal systems. The theme of the course is really the judicialization of international regimes and accordingly, you'll spend a lot of time reading cases and picking out doctrines. Fairly easy and straightforward, but well worth your time.",
    "I would definitely recommend the class to any student who want to learn more about the legal aspect of globalization and discuss the influence of law in the world we live in today.",
    "It's a fantastic and brief introduction to the way our world works today! Definitely take it if you have any interest in law or international business!",
    "Great law class; unique in manner of instruction-discussion\/case oriented. yes",
    "Good intro to law, def take it.",
    "I recommend this class to students who're interested in going to law school after graduation form Yale. It's a very good intro to law course. It also provides you opportunities outside classes to explore Yale Law School. It's an awesome class!",
    "Eh, maybe. The material is really great, but I feel like there are other classes that might cover it in a more interesting, less subjective way. It's a bit narrowly focused and subject to Professor Stone Sweet's strong opinions and theories."
