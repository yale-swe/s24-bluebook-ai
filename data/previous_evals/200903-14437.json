    "learn c++, polymorphism, design paradigmsdon't think you won't learn anything because you know Java. That just makes you an arrogant asshole. You know who you are.",
    "A substantial portion of this class involves learning C++, which could be a plus or a minus depending on your interests. Apart from the application of object-oriented practices to programming in C++, the non-C++ specific part of the course more or less came down to a few weeks of design patterns.",
    "It's an easy class that babysits you learning C++. Some OOP design patterns are covered but there's too little focus on each method. Homework assignments are relatively easy but they dont weigh that much. Having to write a 8-15 page report in adddition to coding for the term project is annoying.",
    "CS427 is a good course if you want to learn C++.",
    "I would only recommend it as a relatively easy cs elective. You don't learn too much from the class unless you have never programmed in C++. Most of the topics you could probably learn by reading a guide to C++."
