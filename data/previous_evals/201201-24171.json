   "comments": [
    "Yes, do it.",
    "Absolutely if a student wants to take a science class that is not too hard but is interesting, just do not expect to be constantly engaged.",
    "Dull. But a really easy science credit. Fairly painless. Just prepare to spend class time on Facebook.",
    "This class is a great survey on popular scientific themes which are very relevant to modern day life. I would definitely recommend it!",
    "You should definitely take this class if you can get in. I honestly think it is the best science for non-science majors class that Yale offers. Don't worry about it being taught by three separate professors\u0097they streamline their teaching styles so you know what to expect. It's not math-heavy, and all of the tests are take-home exams. I literally cannot think of one negative thing to say about this course.",
    "This is a fantastic class that focuses on current, relevant and interesting scientific questions. I would highly recommend this class because it is a great way to get a science credit, it is extremely interesting and enjoyable and because it was well taught, it is easy to understand the material in class and not leave feeling confused.",
    "The professors are excited and engaging and the material is really cool. Best SC ever.",
    "Recommended. Pretty painless Sc credit.",
    "Definitely take this class if you want an interesting and easy science credit. The material is really cool and fascinating which makes it a lot of fun! Also, most of the readings come from NY Times best-selling pop science books so they are good to read and also very skimable. The professor are decent and the workload is not bad at all. Also, all of the tests were take home which was a huge perk. This class makes for a great 5th credit to add on to any schedule, as well as just a great class to take in general!",
    "Definitely take it for a science credit.",
    "I would recommend it to a non-science major who wants an easy science credit. You don't learn that much, though.",
    "The best way to do a Science credit. The topics covered are pretty interesting and the work is very double. All three prof are always willing to meet and help with the work."
