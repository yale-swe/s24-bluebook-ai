    "I highly recommend this class, but only if you're interested in learning about a wide variety of science topics. The homework questions require reading and understanding, but it is very manageable. The discussion sections are a nice experience and the professors involved are extremely approachable. The grading on the questions is also very fair.",
    "You do PSE for the money still really. Some people will drop out and try to get money otherwise, but it is easy through PSE. It is enjoyable and a reasonable .5 credit of work so that is also a plus.",
    "This is class is a good way to get a research stipend for the summer. If you are not planning on doing research, I do not recommend this class.",
    "Most of the lectures for this class are pretty dull, and the discussions following the lectures are led by students who didn't really understand what the professors were talking about. This class was probably the most boring part of my week, however, it is also an extremely low time commitment and it guarantees you the opportunity to work in a lab over the summer. If you are not interested in summer work, then this class is a waste of time, and if you are interested in it then it might be worth suffering through the class.",
    "Interesting lectures on diverse subjects in current research in science at Yale. This course is good for people who are interested in science, and like to see different fields. It also provides a much better look at what science is actually like for those who do it, much more exposure to the creativity and analysis in scientific research than you get in a regular science course.",
    "Yes. Take this class if you are not sure which type of science interests you. Depending upon the topic, the lecture might be very interesting or quite dull. The questions for homework are relatively easy though.",
    "The lectures are usually hit or miss with most people. I felt that of the half dozen or so first semester lectures, there was one I really liked, several that were reasonable, and one that I really was disappointed with.Having had no research experience, I'd say that this class was a good intro as to how research is done in different fields.There isn't so much in-depth math or physics, but I felt that there was a fair balance between physics and biology, although maybe there wasn't as much chemistry.The discussions tend to consist of the moderators explaining various things, and in general the discussions aren't the greatest things. It depends on your group and how interested people are in the topic.In terms of meeting other science students, I'd say that this class helps a little, but not that much, as people usually are with the people they know from elsewhere.The work is very, very light, so unless you have a reason not to take it, it's just a nice thing to have.",
    "If you need an easy science weight. However, I recommend considering the seminars you'll be giving up.",
    "You learn about a number of new topics in a (sort of) broad range of sciences.It's fun :D.If you're interested for a specific subject, this may not be for you: however, if you're not opposed to a broad-ranging set of topics, this is definitely a course I'd recommend.",
    "The lectures are interesting, though discussions are less interesting and often not very helpful. If you want to learn more about current research, this class would be good except that biweekly discussions are not effective. Also if you want summer research, this classwould also benefit.",
    "I would recommend this course only to a student who is truly interested in experiencing the whole spectrum of scientific fields. While someone with very specific interests may still get much out of the course, he or she would likely find most of the lectures to be unenjoyable.",
    "If you are interested in science in general, take this class! It's very rewarding, and you'll gain pretty in-depth insight in fields that you might not have even known existed!",
    "Several lectures on subjects ranging from bio to physics to geology to chemistry. I would recommend it if you are unsure what type of science you would like to study, or any science at all. If you are interested in doing research during the summer, perspectives will give you about 4,000 dollars and will help you find a lab.",
    "An enjoyable series of lectures that showed me areas of science I have not seen before. Requiring a comparatively little amount of work during the first semester, it was definately worth the time.",
    "A solid introduction to the type of research going on at Yale. It may not be very useful for students who already know what branch of science they want to pursue, but a great experience for those undecided or curious about it all.",
    "Perspectives is a way to meet other classmates majoring in science and saves you from applying for research fellowships for the summer. Unless there's a seminar you really want to take or a class conflict, then I would recommend it.",
    "Perspectives is a good course for people who want to learn more about other sciences and see how science from different fields connect to each other. I would recommend this course especially to people who were into science bowl in high school and like to see the inter-relatedness of science.",
    "Great course, take it.",
    "I would recommend it because it's a good way to learn about new research but more importantly about the kind of research that's happening at Yale.",
    "An excellent survey course in some exciting frontiers in science. While perhaps a bit too life-sciences-based, a very valuable and fun course nonetheless.",
    "Good seminars on different aspects of science. The friday timeslot was killer though. not much work, so take it if you want to use the funding over the summer.",
    "Every other week is a lecture given by a leading yale scientist in their specific field. In the interim weeks, psets are assigned (4-5 short answer questions) and discussion sections are held. I'd recommend it if you don't know what type of science you want to continue your studies in, or if you are looking for a research position on campus the next summer.",
    "It is a set of interesting but disconnected lectures and discussion sections in alternating weeks. I would recommend it only if you do not a specific area of scientific focus.",
    "I would summarize the class as a disparate but interesting collection of high-level science lectures and discussion sections. I would recommend the class, because I think it's nice to know snippets about different complex science topics, but I do have a lot of suggestions for how the class could be improved. I've explained these above.",
    "Perspectives on Science and Engineering features Yale Professors who discuss their research and small section groups that go over the research. It seems that many times the lectures are a little too technical for full comprehension, and the course might be better served by having Professors more generally discuss their research and then focus on the tools they use to conduct that research and how students might become more engaged with the subject being researched (or join the research itself). The discussion questions can sometimes be fairly tricky and require more than a little internet research as a product of the specificity and technicality of certain lectures. I would definitely recommend this course to science enthusiasts more than students interested in a single field of science (or students more casually interested in Science). The funding for summer research is nice but appears to be available outside of the course as well.",
    "Most of us are taking it because we got in from a selective group and therefore it looks good on a transcript or a resume, or because of the research opportunities associated with it, or both. If you don't care about it for either of these reasons, don't take this class.",
    "I would recommend it to another student, especially if they are interested in research opportunities for the summer after freshman year. It is a good way to meet some like-minded students at Yale. It is an interesting class, and it becomes more interesting, the more you try and delve into the problem sets. However, don't expect to love every single lecture. But that is another reason why I liked it: I got to see things that I liked and didn't like from a primary source.",
    "It's okay, but you have to be interested in either research or an overview science class. Also willing to give up your friday afternoons. And freshman-- this is a big deal. Let me tell you now that I didn't think I would care. I do.",
    "Perspectives is a mixed bag. Most of the lectures are fascinating, but very sophisticated, and they take a lot of effort to understand. The variety was apparently much better than in previous years, covering everything from Evolutionary Color in Birds to Quantum Computing. The discussion sections, on the other hand, tend to be dull. Either one person ends up talking the whole time, or the section leaders start going off on tangents to kill time. The homework questions can be a bit tedious, but overall it's less work than most classes, since you only have an assignment every two weeks. It's definitely a plus that you get funding for summer research. Overall, I would recommend this class to anyone who really has an interest in broadening their scientific knowledge and not just deepening it.",
    "I liked how week-to-week lectures and discussions are so disconnected from your grade that it was really just about learning. Some speakers went over my head, but overall I liked the presentations. Sometimes discussion was a little too repeat-the-homework, but overall they were engaging. I found most of the student research that was presented to us on the last day to be uninspiring. I liked the mentor-pupil relationship that existed between the discussion group professors and the students.",
    "Perspectives provides students exposure to the research being completed at Yale, as well as opportunities to find a lab to work in. Thus, I recommend it to any student interested in completing any sort of research experience.",
    "I would recommend it if you really do want to learn about the different interesting things going on in the science world. It is fun and enlightening to learn about other fields to which you may never have been exposed.",
    "Yes. Great for research.",
    "Science 198 could be a lot better, and if you are interested in taking a different freshman seminar, I would take that instead of Perspectives. However, if you are sure that you want to do summer research after your freshman year, then I think that this course will be worth it and set you apart from other Yalies. Also, this class is really not that much work, which is nice because your other science courses will be.",
    "If you are able to get this course, don't pass up the opportunity. The workload is minimal, especially next to the benefits.",
    "If you're going to do the summer research, definitely take this course. Otherwise, it might be a little more effort than it's worth. Topics can be interesting but we rush through them so you never really get a thorough understanding of anything, but granted, that is in the nature of the course.",
    "I would recommend Science 198 to anyone considering majoring in the sciences. It provided a good picture of what it would mean to work professionally on the cutting edge of scientific research.",
    "It is useful for finding topics which would be interesting for future studies\/research or, conversely, subjects which are not a good fit for future studies\/research. There will be some lectures which are not as engaging as others, particularly if the application is not as concrete, but it is still pretty amazing to hear from experts in the field who write articles for scientific journals on their topic or who receive Macarthur Genius Grants. The discussion sections were not engaging or helpful for me, but given the low time commitment and the wide range of topics covered, the course is still worth considering.",
    "I would recommend it because at least first semester it's not much work and you can get money to do research over the summer. The lectures were a bit of a mixed bag, some very interesting, some less so. The discussion sections were very interesting though.",
    "Yes, if they are interested in science, but not precisely what science.",
    "Absolutely do not take this course if you have no interest in using the money. If you do plan on spending the summer doing research, than this is a really easy course as long as you work in groups on the biweekly discussion questions and don\u0092t put them off to the last minute.",
    "Perspectives on Science is a rotating lecture and discussion course that can either be really interesting or boring. It really depends on the presenter and your interest level in their research. What makes the class really worthwhile are the new topics that you've never heard about that catch your interest and make you want explore a new scientific field.",
    "Lectures every other week and then discussion sections in between. The lectures are usually extremely scientific and mostly over the level that the normal people in perspectives understand so when it comes to answering the questions (you have to hand in answers to questions before your discussion sections) it takes forever. Luckily this only happens once every 2 weeks, but when it does it is not fun. Also, class on a friday afternoon is not the best.However, you may get one or two lectures which are interesting when the professor realizes that we are only freshman and have not been researching this topic for the past 10 years and tries to make it understandable. This is not a hands of type of course, more about you researching different projects of Yale professors. So if you enjoy surfing the internet, maybe this is for you.This course is basically only good for people looking to get a summer research job. It is not worth the year long work of friday afternoon classes, for 1 credit.",
    "Science 198 is for any student who is considering a career in science and especially research, and would like to experience first and secondhand the research process.",
    "I would recommend it as long as the student has a true passion for the sciences and wants to explore areas that he or she has never even considered."
