   "comments": [
    "If you're even remotely considering Japanese as your language at Yale, do it.",
    "The teachers are all awesome and the class has a lot of resources to teach you the material: video, audio, and web material. However, be warned that this class is a lo of work; often it was more work than my other 3 classes and lab combined. But, if given the chance, I would take the class all over again.",
    "Great!",
    "Japanese 110 03 is a really interesting class with great teachers. Each day you feel accomplished with the fact that you've gotten closer to being able to speak another language. However, the workload is incredibly large, and I would only recommend it if you are prepared to dedicate around 2 to 3 hours of your day every day for this class. If not, you will fall behind right away.",
    "Japanese 110 is a crash course in all of the basics of Japanese. I would definitely recommend it to another student, with the reservation that they be prepared for a heavy workload. The class itself is both amazingly effective at teaching the foundations of the Japanese language, and fun to participate in.",
    "Excellent class. CAN be taken, though be warned that there is daily work. No days off.",
    "Definitely recommend, but with the caveat that there is a lot of homework, which can on some nights border on excessive. It's rarely ever busy work, and it will help you improve, but it can be a pain when you have other things to keep up with. That said, everything about the course is great: the teachers (dedicated& hilarious), the amount of Japanese you learn in just one semester, etc. I really looked forward to my 9:30 class (almost) every day, which is saying something. However, I do wish the textbook for this class wasn't so ancient: prepare for practice scenarios like \"Our office has lots of typewriters, but only one computer...\"",
    "YES!!! Japanese was not only my favorite class this semester, it's the best decision I've made so far at Yale! It's quite a bit of work and difficult when you fall behind, but you end up learning so much Japanese in a short period of time. Many of us knew no Japanese going into the class, but we were able to have basic conversations with each other by the time orals came around. And as I was taking the final (which was definitely a challenge, as are most of the assessments), I was able to realize just how much material we had covered, material that would have looked ridiculously foreign just a few short months ago. It was an amazing feeling! But I think it's because the senseis are all so wonderfully engaging and knowledgable; it's a real privilege to get to learn from them everyday. While it's nearly impossible to learn a foreign language in an American setting, Japanese at Yale is, for many reasons, probably your best shot.",
    "Great class, the instructors are amazing and you learn a lot in one term. The class moves on quickly, so don't take if it you just want to try out if Japanese it the thing for you or not. There is a lot of work everyday outside the classroom as for other Yale language classes, and if you like Japanese and really want to learn something it is the class to take. I enjoyed it a lot.",
    "I would recommend this class to other students, as long as they understand the commitment required for this course. It is very rewarding to be able to learn Japanese, but it comes with the cost of ~2 hours of nightly homework."
