   "comments": [
    "Cap the class size, host in a smaller room, and either decrease the class time or encourage speakers to break up there talks so that the second portion captures interests.",
    "The class was very useful to me, because I previously had no direct experience with campaigns. I appreciated the exposure to the campaigns.",
    "This was a very good course.Question 5: The instructor was very good at getting back with emails, despite having a different job. Occasionally the instructor and the TAs sent out different information that was confusing.",
    "Class would improve from more focus on theory and mechanisms, with anecdotes from presenters (who were all great) layered on top. Instead, we heard a bunch of stories that may or may not apply to later situations. I would have benefited from a more rigorous, data-centered analysis of successful campaign strategies.",
    "Both TAs were fantastic and deserve a lot of praise. Thank you both.The instructor really makes this class - his ability to bring in some of the most interesting speakers and engage them in a quality discussion made the class. My criticism of the class mostly relates to some of the students; many came to class totally unprepared to ask quality, thoughtful questions to the speaker. Perhaps the professor should stress that it is embarrassing for other FES students to sit through basic questions that the speaker already addressed in his\/her presentation.Lastly, I would recommend that this class be taught in a variation over two semesters, perhaps one semester dedicated to communications and one semester dedicated to campaigning. How can FES advocate for the environment with no communications class? Can you imagine a large corporation without a public affairs department?",
    "Field trips would be great and valuable for this class I think.As far as the readings go, I think some were valuable and some were really not. And the readings were structured in a very difficult way. If you want people to read four books in four weeks, you need to give them ALL four books, and say, read all these in four weeks, preferably in this order. But the way they were staggered was extremely difficult, along with the sheer quantity, and I think it made the first half of the class really disorganized and stressful. I think they could be more spread out, instead of the class sort of dropping off after week 5 or 6 and then being sort of nothing. OR the class could be one of these half semester classes, where everyone is jammed in the beginning and cut short. That seemed applicable for the structure of the class as well.",
    "The course was beyond my expectations. I thoroughly enjoyed reading most of the books and articles that were assigned. Michael brought in a fantastic group of speakers. Even though the class was larger than usual, I still felt heard. Overall, one of the best courses I have taken at FES.",
    "Great TAs!!!!!!!!!",
    "This was a very unique class and I learned a lot about environmental campaigns. The profession oriented focus of the class was extremely interesting and informative. I enjoyed hearing from working professionals who were actively constructing campaigns.",
    "I thought this was a good class, but it was way too big (too many students) and this retracted from the quality of the experience. In future, I would suggest limiting the course to 35 people.",
    "Great readings.",
    "Question 1: I found the assigned readings to be wildly variable in length. Some weeks it would be an article several pages long, while others would require the reading of an entire book. Even though the readings were generally interesting, a lot contained information not relevant to the course or that was outdated. For example, the book on marketing, while a well-known introduction, was extremely dated. I would have appreciated tighter readings that related more directly to the subject matter at times.Question 3: THe reading responses were helpful in terms of ensuring that I did the reading but did not provide any value-add beyond that. In general, I found this to be busy work. I would have rather that we have more opportunities to do hands-on or creative work related to campaigning. I thought that the requirement for everyone to sit through so many presentations was a little ridiculous. Also, in 5 minutes it was hard to even get a handle on most of the campaigns. I think it would have been much more effective for students to just post an overview of their campaign and maybe clump them by subject area if others in the class were interested in their peers' topics. There was no need for us to sit through hours of short presentations.Question 7a: Prof. Northop was very laid-back and clearly took the time to read all of our reading responses, which I appreciate given his busy schedule.Question 7b: The TA's were good but unnecessarily fussy. If presentations are running an hour AHEAD of schedule, there is no need to be aggressively heckling people to stick within their 5 minute allowance. Further, I did not necessarily appreciate the plugging of their own books and work.Question 10: Maybe I have more experience in environmental communications than others in the class, but I found this to be too surface of a course to really get a lot out of it. I think that it could have been designed to involve more student\/speaker interaction or have more simulations to get more concrete, valuable products out of it, for me anyway.",
    "Some of the reading was subpar (Particularly the reading on green health care as well as the Tarsands book). Burry the Chains was my favorite of the assigned readings. I think it would have been helpful to get some feedback on the reading responses. As the size of the class prevented that perhaps this semester, either the class size could be restricted. Or alternatively, the professor could had given a summary, at the beginning of each class, of the points he found interesting from the reading responses in the class.",
    "The course was excellent. Amazing classroom experience.",
    "wonderful course and personable professor!",
    "though this class was taught by one professor, almost every class was led by a new visitor. most of the material and lessons that were delivered were delivered by these visitors. most of them were interesting and helpful, but i found their messages to be sort of redundant. i suppose i would have preferred some deeper explorations of the campaigns, though i'm not sure what that even requires of the speakers.",
    "I enjoyed the class very much.",
    "As international students this class is very important. Environmental campaigning in different devloping countries is just starting to develop. Because of this, further knowledge on how environmental campaigns have been done in other countries is so important.",
    "The course overall is excellent, but would benefit enormously from a bit more structure. Perhaps in week 3 or 4, Michael laid out the components of a classic campaign in a quick sketch on the board, and in maybe week 13, the TAs offered a workshop on planning your own campaign. These seemingly tangentially pieces of the class actually distilled the entire semester's lessons better than any of the other sessions. I think Michael should do his own piece earlier, and the TAs' excellent workshop should be a regular class, and not an optional side thing."

    "Hearing tales of campaigns, and the book 'Bury the Chains'",
    "The speakers--how wonderful to be able to hear so many different professionals discuss their work. I think that it is an important story to be told, because it presents so many successes and makes one more hopeful about the future of the environment. The food was also a nice and well-appreciated touch.",
    "Learning about the background to campaigns.",
    "Occasional class discussion.",
    "The different speakers and learning about different aspects of environmental campaigns.",
    "The Pine Barrens speaker and the last class, as well as the long memo reading from the first or second class (that described campaign elements thoroughly).",
    "Great topical overview, fantastic speakers, instructor is at the heart of this movement and understands the material from personal experience.",
    "Michael is amazing, has great perspectives, is connected everywhere, and is exactly the kind of practicum professional we need teaching classes at FES.",
    "This course had an array of activities that helped me understand the material. First the campaign presentation which was the best approach to bringing down to earth campaign examples in your area of interest. Second the workshop on campaigns, that although was voluntary, was an activity that allowed me to get close to the practice in campaign planning and brain storming methods.",
    "This is unlike any class I've taken at FES. The school seems afraid of advocacy or taking a strong position on the issues we're concerned about. I think that is a major mistake. There are very few classes like this at the school that inspire you to think and strategize about how to evoke the kind of change we want to see in the world. And there are very few classes I've taken that inspire reflection and creativity the way this class does. The readings are inspiring, and almost all of the speakers were excellent. If your experience at FES has set you considering a career on the trajectory of passive, polite environmentalism, this course will make you seriously reevaluate.",
    "The speakers were fantastic (and diverse which I appreciated), the readings were relevant and interesting, we got food every week, class discussions were engaging, the workload was manageable, the class handouts were useful, and the professor was incredibly knowledgable\/helpful if students had questions.",
    "Readings, Michael's encouragement and interest in our work, awesome TAs and fantastic group of speakers",
    "The speakers in this course are excellent. No other course at FES brings in as many influential, creative thinkers as this class. This class is also all about wins. It is a solutions-based class. It will empower you to learn from campaigns that were creative and successful. The course is really a breath of fresh air for any one tired of highly theoretical, esoteric course material.",
    "The speakers were all very inspiring and very dynamic.",
    "Everything plus the dinners provided",
    "The variety of speakers and campaigns covered.",
    "The diversity and experiences of the speakers; the food!",
    "I learned a lot from this course, though I doubt I will ever be a campaigner myself.",
    "Meeting people\/ hearing people talk from whom I'd received emails and hearing them talk about the campaign that generated said emails.",
    "THe speaker lineup was really fantastic.I thought that the size was fine, but I hope that the grading for class participation takes this large size into account. I never spoke because I didn't have anything that I felt was worthy of \"airtime,\" while there were other, louder individuals who spoke up quite a bit.",
    "The exposure to various environmental issues through the lens of a campaigner was very insightful. I liked that there was a variety of topics. Also, the topics were clearly presented. The memo was a great way to distill the lessons from the class - I definitely think this should continue to be a requirement in the class.",
    "The variety of experts who presented their campaigns. Also, Michael was excellent.",
    "Having class in a different format from other classes, listening to experienced speakers each week. Also light work load.",
    "Hearing from a variety of campaigns and the care the professor took in getting to know students",
    "Practicality and applicability to potential careers, relevance to current events, access to leaders in environmental policy",
    "Very exciting to learn about all the campaigns from the people who are most qualified to talk about them.",
    "Some of the speakers were outstanding. Michael's interest in getting to know all of the students was wonderful.",
    "I loved getting to hear speakers from important campaigns.",
    "Michael Northrop and the books.",
    "Michael brings in an incredible diversity of excellent speakers.And while the individual speakers each week were great, the final class's \"panel\" structure was fabulous. It wouldn't make sense for quite all of the speakers, but many of the other topics - corporate campaigns, for instance - would do well to feature a panel of several campaigners not only explaining their successes to us but also debating them in retrospect with their colleagues onstage."

   "question_text": "The things about this course most in need of improvement are:",
   "comments": [
    "Too many students, which took away from class discussion opportunities.",
    "Organization. Deadlines were switched on us all the time, often to an earlier due date. If you wanted the papers due on Monday, say in the syllabus that they are due on Monday, instead of saying that they are due on Tuesday, but emailing us every other week on Sunday night saying that they are actually due Monday afternoon. Similarly, waiving the last reaction paper, while appreciated, would have been more appreciated if we had known about it earlier. By the time we received the email, I had already written mine. On the same vein, what the professor said about class timing was often different from what the TAs said, and it was difficult to figure out when and where we were supposed to be, or supposed to hand something in.I know the professors and TAs are very busy people and the class was huge, but I did not appreciate the continually incomplete and inconsistent information we were given. I did not feel that my own time was respected.Some other suggestions: integrate readings more into the class, and encourage class discussions--perhaps it might be helpful, in a group of this size, to break up into smaller groups?",
    "Perhaps more variety. For example, the course gave example after example of campaigns. After five or so of them, it might have been useful to start focusing on other areas... I am not sure what exactly. Also, I appreciate the effort and planning that went into this course. However, it would have been nice to have all the courses during the regular time (e.g., no classes during reading week).",
    "Managing the speakers and the work load. Sometimes breaks are needed.",
    "Too many students in the class. It should be capped at 30 or 35 students. The large class cut down on productive discussions.",
    "Evening out the quality of the speakers (all talented and generous with their time, but with varying abilities to engage the audience); coaching presenters to pause and allow students to offer suggestions about what they would have done before revealing how the actual campaign proceeded.",
    "Probably tougher readings and more case study style readings; perhaps consider pulling from business school case studies. A deeper appreciation for \"the other side,\" meaning corporations, would be beneficial for FES students.",
    "A bit of organizational stuff dealing with the books and the syllabus, other organizational stuff, and how to manage the growing quantity of people wanting to take the class.",
    "If the number of interested students is as high as it was this semester, I would then open discussion sessions with the TAs during a different schedule than the class to facilitate a more dynamic dialogue. Also, the class discussion would profit if there was some sort of mechanism of feedback from the weekly reflection paper that students submitted, in my opinion this would have helped me and the class in focusing the discussion.",
    "Michael is a genius and seems to know about literally everything going on with campaigns and beyond. That said, he may be slightly out of touch with what to expect as far as the amount of work a student can put into the class. For the first several weeks, we were reading 1 book a week. The readings were awesome and I'm glad I read the books, but I think it's a lot to ask students to read and comment on 300 pgs\/week.Also, the \"how to build a campaign\" workshop should be during a regular class session so all students can attend.",
    "Smaller class size. Class discussions felt cavernous in Bowers and sometimes it was hard to hear the speakers. It would also have been better if the course was a bit shorter, maybe two hours instead of two and a half hours.",
    "Pruning students out! I think some students did take the class because they thought it would be easy, and it was at the end of the day on Wednesday night with food.",
    "We need a little more interactive exercises. The campaigns workshop was great, but it would be great if it is done more than once and earlier in the semester.",
    "Limiting the class size so that instructors and TAs can give feedback to student work.",
    "Nothing. everything was great.",
    "We could take time during the different talks to reflect on key decision points and what we would decide.",
    "The class size was too large and there was not enough intellectual analysis of what campaigns were actually about. I would have liked to talk more about the psychology of campaigning and not just learn about what campaigns have happened.",
    "Smaller-scale campaigns would be great, and seem more manageable.",
    "I really enjoyed the last class, and it occurred to me that bringing together a panel offers a totally different experience than having one speaker.I think that the opportunity for a group of speakers to play off of one another around a particular topic can be extremely interesting, and the shorter individual presentations serve to break up the two and a half hour block well. I would recommend having more panels to speak.Additionally, as mentioned before, I think that the readings could really be improved upon in terms of length and relative content relevance. Further, the assignments could relate more towards actively implementing the skills being learned, like helping out on an actual campaign, or designing a theoretical campaign. I know that this was offered somewhat on a Friday, but that was not convenient for all to attend.I think it would be great if some speakers were able to stay beyond the class and students could sign up to interact with them in a smaller, more intimate setting.",
    "I think the class could have benefited from more discussion within the class between peers. As someone without previous campaigning experience, I found it hard to accept some of the campaign strategies that seemed to be slightly unethical. I think it would have been interesting to discuss more about which techniques seemed to work across the board, both inter-temporally and cross-sectionally between topics.",
    "Readings could line up better with the speaker's topics",
    "guidelines for the final paper",
    "the range and depth of takeaway.",
    "Possibly some more focus on communication stategies",
    "I don't feel like my final project really enhanced my understanding of the materials from the class. It ended up being more like a research paper. I think there could have been a more effective way to learn about a campaign.Also, I wasn't that excited about the campaign I ended up writing about, but I had felt pressured to pick a campaign. In retrospect, I think I could have waited longer to pick a topic, and I might have ended up with a campaign that was more relevant to my career aspirations.",
    "Trying to piece together why certain campaigns failed would have been helpful. And, a group project devoted to participating in an actual campaign would have been really helpful.",
    "I loved everything about this course and can't think of any improvements.",
    "Less people, less homework.",
    "Hmmm, I feel like we lost an opportunity in Michael not dedicating at least one class to sharing his own wisdom. A crucial piece of campaigning is the funding, and almost no one in the field is better positioned than he to explain that. Jessica Bailey's piece was excellent, but we should have had that in one of the first classes, and not the last."

    "Enjoy, and take advantage of having so many wonderful speakers, including the professor and TAs. Their experience and knowledge is extraordinary.",
    "Class can be rather large in size, if its smaller, take the class.",
    "You get out of it what you put into it. You don't have to read every book cover to cover in order to write the response paper, but you may get more out of it that way.",
    "Prepare for each class before you go to class.",
    "Get all the books as soon as you decide to take the class, and jump in head first! Keep up with the reading and take great notes.",
    "This class will open your eyes into the world of campaigning and achieving change in the environmental world.",
    "Do the readings, despite how long they are. Also for the final project, find a campaign that really excites you. It may be difficult because we don't talk about campaigning very often in other classes at FES, and students are less active in current campaigns than they should be. [gets down off soapbox]",
    "I highly recommend taking this course if you are interested in advocacy and campaigning. The speakers were fantastic (and diverse), the readings were relevant and interesting, we got food every week, class discussions were engaging, the workload was manageable, the class handouts were useful, and the professor was incredibly knowledgable\/helpful if students had questions. Two thumbs up.",
    "Start your final project early, and take advantage of the fact that you are asked to meet and interview as many leading campaigners as possible. Their insights are invaluable and their passion is contagious.",
    "I recommend it for any student in FES regardless of their academic focus",
    "Do the readings!",
    "Engage with the speakers who come and give presentations and have a good time.",
    "have fun",
    "ask questions of the visitors and compel them to go deeper.",
    "Keep an open mind, lots of reading in the beginning but the reading is quality and the latter course work is a bit lighter but very insightful in terms of speakers",
    "Great course. Choose a campaign to study that you are totally invested in.",
    "I would advise them to delve deep into the readings and to listen carefully to the fantastic speakers. This course is truly excellent.",
    "Read and organize yourself to read and be constant on your homeworks and due dates.",
    "Enjoy the readings too!"
