    "This class is very much geared towards people who anticipate going into journalism after college. Most of my class was involved with the YDN or some other publication and had journalistic experience outside of Yale as well. That being said, it is a GREAT class for aspiring journalists. Field trips to NYSE, WSJ, New York Times and Bloomberg are also bonuses. You have the chance to meet editors and there are A LOT of very prominent guest speakers (think howard dean) who come to speak with the class in such a small setting. Even if you don't plan on going into journalism, the experience may be worth it for you. And professor herman is GREAT. he can really help you with your writing and provide a lot of contacts for you! he's a great teacher who really cares about his students. The deadlines were kind of hard for me- felt more like a job than a class at times.",
    "TAKE IT! It's such a dynamic, interesting seminar with very unique coursework. You learn how to write in a more journalistic style and you get to understand a bit about what's going on behind the numbers whenever there's a big news story about the economy. Prof. Herman is also a very knowledgeable man, and a super understanding professor. You also get to take cool tours to media organizations, the NYSE and the gold vaults of the Fed!",
    "This is hands down the best course I've taken at Yale. Even if you aren't expressly interested in business and finance, the skills you will learn in this course -- writing, reporting, storytelling -- are absolutely worth it.",
    "ABSOLUTELY. Take it. This is by far my favorite class that I have taken at Yale. I think everyone should know about the material that's taught in this class because it improves your writing and thinking about the financial sector, which I think is fundamental for any person to know. That being said, if you have even a remote interest in journalism, writing, or finance, this class will be even more awesome. Professor Herman is BY FAR one of my favorite professors at Yale. He stayed until 11pm one day during office hours (he lives in NY) to discuss people's final projects just a few days before it was due. He is incredibly invested in the course and his students, and you can tell that he really loves the subject during class time and when he talks with students outside of class.The workload is as much as you want it to be. Other than the papers, the weekly reading is pretty light and Professor Herman runs class in a way that students who don't do the reading probably won't be lost and can still follow very easily and learn a ton (though you should do the reading because it's just plain interesting!). I know that I spent hours and days on my papers, not because I was worried about the grade or thought it was necessary to do well, but because the assignments were just that fun for me. They are flexible and open-ended enough that you can choose something that interests you. I also felt like I learned way more in the process of writing these papers than for papers for most other classes. Just so you have an idea, the assignments we had were to: profile a classmate, profile a small business, write a preview for an upcoming jobs report (the one released by the government with unemployment statistics), write a book review of pretty much any book about finance\/economics\/anything remotely related to the course, and a final project\/paper about your topic choice. It's especially nice that he gives you so much flexibility with choosing topics for each paper, because it really allows you to choose whatever interests you, and I have a feeling that what I did my final paper on might actually be what I end up studying, which I never expected.I've heard that he can be a difficult grader, but in my experience, he's pretty predictable. He let us redo our first assignment and take the higher grade (!!). And for every other assignment, he gave us a \"soft deadline\" - a date by which he would give us comments\/thoughts without a grade if we emailed him a draft or even an outline. I know that at least for me, that was awesome. As long as you send stuff in by the soft deadline and follow his comments, you should do just fine. Also, I know of no other professor that does this for pretty much every assignment during the semester... like I said, Professor Herman is AWESOME.You also take field trips to New York (the Fed, NYSE, WSJ, NYT, etc.) that you really wouldn't be able to get access to normally. I could only make it to one trip but the one I did go on was really great and I heard good things about the other one, too. Professor Herman has myriad connections and traveling on trips with him is both fun and really informative. He also brings awesome guest speakers to class (you have dinner with Jim Chanos at Sally's; other guests included Joanne Lipman, Peter Lattman, etc. - lots of talented reporters\/editors).In short, take this class. Professor Herman takes really good care of his students especially if you show an interest in the class and work hard, and whenever I asked him for a favor he was always willing to go out of his way to help me. The class is well-designed (if it's offered again, I think it'll be his fifth time or so teaching the course), well thought out, and honestly just awesome. If you can get in, do NOT miss the opportunity and take the class. Everyone needs to understand a little more about finance\/the economy and everyone can benefit from some important tips about writing well.",
    "The Press, Business, and the Economy was a fantastic class. Professor Herman gave excellent advice on journalism--wisdom accumulated from years at The Wall Street Journal. Students gain a solid understanding of finance and how to relay that information in writing. Most importantly, the class guests are amazing: we had dinner one week with HOWARD DEAN and the week after with Jim Chanos, who made millions shorting Enron's stock. The class visits The New York Times, Wall Street Journal, Bloomberg, and the floor of the New York Stock Exchange as well. Papers include a short profile of a classmate, a profile of a New Haven business, and curtain raiser on the monthly jobs report.",
    "The makeup of the seminar is an odd mix of journalists who know nothing about business and econ majors who know nothing about journalism, so you will at times be a little bored, but you leave each class feeling like you've really learned something. The guests are pretty fabulous, and the trip to the NYSE is awesome--you also get a chance to visit WSJ and the Times. Really, especially if you want to be a journalist, you should take this class for Professor Herman: he is one of the kindest, most generous professors I've ever had. He takes a real, personal interest in his students which is almost unprecedented and he clearly cares deeply for the material--he's genuinely excited by it most of the time, an attitude which is infectious.",
    "A great class if you're interested in journalism and financial journalism, you're down to do a fair bit of writing, and you like that Herman brings in a bunch of guest speakers. The field trips were amazing, and some of the guest speakers were really great too. Herman cares so much about his students, and wants to get to know you -- this isn't a class to be invisible in. This is definitely more of a writing class than a business class, so just know that before going in!",
    "Overall, I greatly enjoyed this course. All of the field trips and guest speakers were great, and quite interesting and relevant to business journalism. The class got a little repetitive at times. Otherwise, a wonderful experience I would recommend to anyone.",
    "This is a chance to explore journalism in-depth and interact with newsmakers who are genuinely interested in speaking with you.",
    "To a student who is interested in going into journalism and wants to develop a relationship with an amazing person (Professor Herman) who can be of help, and wants to meet some amazing guests (Howard Dean, managing editor of the Wall Street journal, and others), this class would be great. Would not recommend this class to someone lookin for a standard class-like setting. This is a very unique setting and in my opinion a great example of the possibilities of the college seminar program."
