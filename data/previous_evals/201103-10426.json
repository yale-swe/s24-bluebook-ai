   "comments": [
    "Take it if you have to. Be prepared to cry every Tuesday and Thursday at one.",
    "I'd recommend it, at least most of it. The general structure and structural determination methods were very useful, but the lectures on enzymes were too simplistic and the lectures on polymerases etc. were just not really that useful for a general understanding. They'd be better suited for a molecular biology course.",
    "Not too shabby",
    "If you are interested in Biophysics, I would say it is a good match. However, it is indeed a hard course.",
    "Yes, I would strongly recommend this class for a good intorduction to the wide range of techniques used to investigate different macromolecules. Also a lot of handy information that we will definitely need to know like useful numbers to know at the tip of our fingers.",
    "Take this course if your a protein engineer.",
    "A cursory glance at many biophysical techniques. The course is quite useful for someone in my position, considerable knowledge in biochemistry and none whatsoever in biophysics. It was a bit overwhelming at first, the depth at which I was required to know the subject. But I was able to overcome this and I feel quite good about what I learned from the course. As I mentioned above, the biochemistry aspect of the course was not useful and repetitive for me. I wish that the biochemistry portion was more in depth. I would recommend this course for another MBB student, especially one in my same position. I do not feel that the course would be beneficial for one hoping to enhance their biochemistry knowledge.",
    "I would tell him or her to brace themselves. Alot of work and information but not very well taught.",
    "No I would not recommend this class. It was poorly organized. Yong and Don were great lecturers. Andrew was easy in class to understand, but demanded too much with problem sets. NMR itself is a difficult topic and teaching in such a short timeframe is difficult though. The last quarter however was terrible and a waste of class.",
    "The course was satisfactory. I would recommend the course, but not all the lecturers.",
    "yes I did learn a lot but it was a torturous experience. On the other hand, I believe they also neglected to teach us a lot that we need to know, especially about kinetics.",
    "Yes if one had never taken biochem before. Otherwise is mostly review, with the exception of RNA\/DNA structure\/polymerases and X ray crystallography",
    "It's very helpful, and you have to take it anyway.",
    "MB&B 720 is a time consuming and often fairly stressful class. Homework is best done in groups, but be prepared to have to make educated guesses often, and be prepared to lose plenty of points when you guess wrong, as there will often be no specific part of lecture that will shed light on how to do the homework. It seems that every student in MB&B, from the oldest students to the ones currently taking it have an overall negative impression of it. That it's frustrating, the exams will be extremelystressful (and the average score will be a failing grade), and that, as a whole, the lectures do not adequately prepare you to do well on the homework or the tests. So, there seems to be something wrong with the fundamentals of the course where so many students have a negative impression. If it weren't a core requirement, I suspect that few students would take it."

   "question_text": "How did this course deepen your knowledge of your discipline\/profession? To what extent did this course contribute to your dissertation\/research?",
   "comments": [
    "It made me realize I never ever ever want to do ANYTHING with structure.",
    "I think the general structure will helpgreatly, as will probably a fair amount of the NMR, mass spec and molecular simulation. The enzyme kinetics and thermodynamics I and probably everyone else knew already, and the polymerases and ribosomes I do not imagine will contribute anything. So, overall good and helpful, it's just that the beginning and end didn't really teach much. And unless they're going to cover it more in another course, I think there's still a lot of structure and structural basis behind interactions that we didn't learn.",
    "Helped me to understand basic techniques. There was some review in basic biochemistry. I wish there had been a little less review and a little more learning new techniques.",
    "Good to know a little bit about all kinds of methods that I might use in the future.",
    "YEs definitely. I will working alot on macromolecules and while I might not be using all the techniques or concepts taught, some of the information will come in handy.",
    "This course will be extremely useful if I pursue a field in protein engineering.",
    "I learned how to google other school's lectures on the same topic to be able to understand the concepts (which really are not that hard, but the way they are taught here is more confusing). I find it astonishing that as a graduate student at yale I am really only learning how to google subjects and not learning anything in the classroom. I think the material will be relevant in the long run to research. But if it was more clearly taught I would have benefited even more.",
    "This course definitely deepened my knowledge and allowed me to form a cohesive idea of the type of work I would like to pursue in graduate school.",
    "nothing. A lot of good information to know but very little was applicable to my research, where kinetics and potentially NMR\/MassSpec were but was allocated less time then I think they deserve.",
    "Mostly review but was a good course",
    "This course contains plenty of information that will be extremely important for any research within the disciplines of the department, but I'm not sure I understand why it has to be as time-consuming and difficult as it is. It seems that if each lecture clearly articulated the key aspects of any topic, and the homework asked us to apply principles, techniques, or logic that was articulated in lecture, then it wouldn't be such a difficult class. If you have the lecture notes and understand every topic in the lecture notes, then student's should be generally successful with the tests and homework. But, it seems that this isn't the case. So students do not understand, the lectures are inadequate, or both, but regardless of the cause, it seems that these problems can be addressed."
