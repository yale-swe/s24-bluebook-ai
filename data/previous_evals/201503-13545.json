   "comments": [
    "I knew this would be a good class, but I never imagined how helpful it was going to be. Changing the way we write is an idea that makes most people, myself included, hesitate and feel dubious. But this class does that exactly. Verlyn completely changed the way I write, and the way I read and edit other people's writing. Once you see the ideas he teaches, you see evidence of it everywhere, especially when editing someone else's work.",
    "question 4: I think the class became formulaic. It was almost boring by the very end of the semester. It felt that the class had puttered to a stop. I really enjoyed the material and thought that the skills we strove to develop were invaluable, but I think we could have gone further if Professor threw some different challenges our way in the latter half of the semester.",
    "Being able to write about and interpret difficult concepts about the environment is so important as environmental managers.",
    "This was a good writing class. It was structured around helpful, subversive first principles. Lots of good one-liners to keep. Other students that Ive talked to say that their writing got better, and it certainly helped me. But I was frustrated with the course as a whole because it felt like a missed opportunity. Specifically, Verlyns dominating presence was a barrier to student engagement. This created a disappointingly low upper limit for the class. Most bluntly, if Verlyn spoke half as much, I think the class would be twice as good. It really might be a one-to-one improvement. He responded at length after nearly every student comment, jumping off from a direct response into a tangent. Free association, even well-intentioned and well-informed free association, is quickly difficult to learn from. This class was billed as a seminar, but conducted as a series of ad-hoc lectures. A lecture might be just as effective as a seminar, but Verlyns teaching was improvisatory in a way that soon lost its novelty and much of its efficacy. A lecture would require structure and direction, and a seminar would require sharing the conversation. This class got lost between the modes. If a seminar were diagramed to track the lines of conversation, it should show a series of overlapping, spiraling polygons inscribed within the circle of participants. This is the shape of an equitable conversation. But this class would look like a kids drawing of a sun: one large circle with skinny lines radiating out. A sedentary environment (for everyone outside the gravitational center, at least). If Verlyn doesnt believe in the power of sharing the floor, thats fine. Just dont have us circle up as though we were about to speak with each other. I bring this up because the balance was so dramatically off, and so far out of keeping with the principles of the class. Verlyn preaches anti-authoritarian prose, but he does preach. This is a frustrating contradiction because it limits a course that is nominally so wonderful (Verlyn has much to share). And its so easily resolved. Just speak a little less. Ask students to talk to each other. Sit in on a few well-run seminars in other departments to remember the potential energy and fun of a class. I cant imagine a more fertile topic for invigorated learning than writing, and it was maddening to watch the students slide farther and farther back into their seats because the person in control couldnt see how much his loud presence was stepping on people who might have useful things to say. Or who might ask questions, if they were given a moment to come up with them. I think if Verlyn trusted students moreto come to the classs principles through questioning and discussionthis could have been a remarkable class.",
    "This was a wonderful course. Verlyn is a caring, deeply thoughtful teacher. Your writing will markedly improve if you put the same level of attention into the class that he does."

   "comments": [
    "I can't put my finger on what exactly the best aspects of this course were. I can say that my writing has improved over the course of the semester, I'm more interested in writing, I more enjoy the process of writing , and I'm more confidant in my ability to write. The class sections were at times helpful, and at times a little dull. But the class never felt like it dragged on too long. Having a mix of reading professional published pieces, critiquing of students writing, and discussion help in this regard. Verlyn's critiques of my pieces were detailed and critical. I valued his office hours as a means of getting more direct critique and suggestions.",
    "The personalized feedback on our writing.",
    "The weekly writing assignments are invaluable to practicing and getting feedback on writing.",
    "Students get to practice editing which enables us to really apply what Verlyn is teaching. We use writing samples from our work, and together we edit and revise our own work. Verlyn also provides very comprehensive feedback to each student on their weekly writing.",
    "The strategy for writing-- writing simple, clear, direct sentences.",
    "Verlyn is always around and happy to help with problems you encounter while writing. He's super supportive and just wants everyone to be successful and realize their potential as a writers.",
    "The structure of the course is great. It's straightforward, and the lack of structure allows each student to work on what's most important to her. Also, focusing on improving one sentence at a time was great (and resulted in fewer platitudes).",
    "Taking the time to read works out loud in class was really excellent.",
    "Verlyn is the best. I appreciate his insight and approach to writing. His comments on written work were detailed and helpful.",
    "Really beautiful central tenets. Thank you! Among them: Write what you think is most important first, then see what happens. Write from one good sentence to the next. or just, Make good sentences. Sitting and looking out the window while you think is good writing. It's all choices. You can write however you want. Take implicit meaning as seriously as explicit. Outlines rarely help. Re-read obsessively. If it catches, or sounds off, just cut it. Prose isn't that precious. Writing is noticing things.",
    "The open-endedness of this class was its most challenging and instructive element. At the beginning of the semester, the idea of writing without a prompt was intimidating. But by the end, my world seemed to teem with subjects. This course changed the way I write and the things I feel inclined to write about. It fundamentally altered my perspective. I'm so grateful that I got to study with Verlyn."

    "I would strictly limit the class size to 12. I found that the size of the class stifled lively discussion of the readings.",
    "Energy of the class.",
    "More student-led discussion time would be nice.",
    "I did think the same format for the class every week got a little old. It would have been nice to do some different exercises, or change things up a bit.",
    "Please include more writing by women and people of color. Short, masculine, declamatory prose is great, sometimes. But the readings began to run together. Students can handle more than travelogue, and if there were anything worth debating in the example pieces, students might turn on to the urgency and working potential of effective prose. And the listening thing from above.",
    "Many of our classroom discussions seemed to follow the same arc by the end of the semester. If there were a way to vary the pace of the group meetings a little more, I think it would improve the course."
