    "I would definitely recommend this class. There are so many fascinating angles to take on the topic. It was very different than I expected it to be (it's definitely more on the RLST side than the EVST side), but really interesting nonetheless. We addressed issues of policy, environmentalism, and anthropology, in addition to religion.",
    "It is interesting and important but very broad. You have to take it on yourself to invest.",
    "Take it, especially if it is being taught by Professor Grim. This might seem like a very specific area of study, but you quickly learn that it applies to many other aspects of your academic and personal perspectives.",
    "An interesting class, though perhaps more of an anthropology class than the professor would like to admit.",
    "If you ever want to learn about diverse religions of the world and appreciate how they relate to each other, this is the ideal course to do so. The professor is amazing. It will lead you to reflect on your own spirituality and relationship with the world. You don't even need to be particularly passionate about this stuff yourself to benefit from the opinions of other classmates who are not only considerably knowledgeable, but have really interesting perspectives of their own.",
    "If you like it on the first day, you'll probably enjoy it for the semester. It's a big class, though, so you'll have to fight your way into discussions. Once you lose the train of thought, you're lost for the day and it's rough. Sometimes Prof. Grim seems to get totally dislodged from reality and you wonder what you're even talking about, but sometimes that's nice.",
    "The course sounds very interesting, but make sure you look at the readings beforehand and figure out if you like the authors he chooses. It's very theoretical and at times wishy-washy and indigenous peoples are very romanticized in the course. It also focuses a lot more on religion than ecology. There is only a take home midterm and a take home final so the workload is not too much. The class was too impersonal to be a seminar because the number wasn't capped, so there were about 30 people in it. However, Professor Grim treated it that way and you never hear him talk at all, which is a shame because he's really interesting."
