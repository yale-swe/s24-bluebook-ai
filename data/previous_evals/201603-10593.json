    "I learned how to speak and write basic Japanese, but I also learned the skills needed to study to memorize vocabulary and grammar forms in a language.",
    "I gained a solid foundation in the basics of the Japanese language.",
    "I learned how to form basic Japanese phrases and that the language is built on societal rankings.",
    "I have learned to read, write, listen to, and speak some basic Japanese. I also learned some Japanese culture.",
    "Speaking and communicating in Japanese. Writing Japanese. Overcoming difficulties of learning a language. New types of sentence structures and grammatical rules. How to get a lot of homework done every day.",
    "Learned about 500 words and 75 kanji. Hiragana and katakana. Enough grammar to easily grasp hownto use new words.",
    "This class was an intense introduction to the Japanese language. I learned written Japanese including Hiragana, Katakana, and some Kanji as well as Japanese grammar, intonation, speaking, and culture. I learned topics such as how to buy items in a store, how to give directions, how to hold short conversations, how to talk about myself (family, what I like, what I can do)."

   "comments": [
    "Stengths: Very conversation focused, lots of oral practice. Weaknesses: Not much in class review; material isn't very applicable to new situations after it has been covered.",
    "While this course requires a lot of daily work, you are rewarded with how much you learn in such a short time. You really get out of this course whatever you decide to put into it. I don't have many negative things to say.",
    "There is a lot of work, but there is a lot of interaction and opportunities to further skills.",
    "Slightly too much homework.",
    "Heavy workload and it is very easy to get off track. Participation in Japanese language tables should be encouraged more, so that students can learn in a less formal but immersive environment.",
    "Requires personal engagement. If the student is engaged and dilligent (1-2 hours daily outside of class), the student's Japanese skills will develop rapidly.",
    "Intro to Japanese. What an interesting language I decided to take my final year. Japanese was like a never ending faucet, that just filled up all the space I had available in a day and more. There's no doubt I learned more Japanese in one semester than I could have ever imagined, but it is also because I put in so much time. You cover new material everyday and are expected to do a tremendous amount of studying\/memorizing on your own. Unfortunately, this method is most likely not going to change because it seems like the same book has been used for decades. On the bright side though, the Japanese teachers here are really enthusiastic in what they do and put in a lot of effort to make things as engaging as they can for their students through various methods. Since there are four teachers that rotate and teach the class, it's also easy to find someone to answer your questions. That's the key. Ask questions when they arise or else you'll find yourself in a hot mess later on. And remember, the final is cumulative. All in all, only take the class if you can devote the time. If so, it's well worth the 1.5 credits.",
    "The way that the class is taught, in immersion style, is fantastic. The professors are amazing and I like that it is taught every day. However, the course load is much too high. There are too many assignments that it makes it hard to find time to actually study what needs to be learned to do them. Sometimes, it also feels like there is too much memorization, such as in the case of the CCs.",
    "I only have one complaint about the course: the core conversations that we have to memorize every day and then are evaluated on during section. I think this daily assignment causes unnecessary stress, and grading our performance isn't an accurate depiction of our understanding. So what if I can memorize a few lines of Japanese just by repeating them over and over? It doesn't necessarily mean that I understand the grammar or the accents being used. I still think we should study the CC's because I realize they're very helpful for forging a connection between vocabulary and grammar structures, but I don't believe we should be graded on how well we can recite them. In addition, I think we should focus more on pronunciation in class rather than only in clinic. I find the intonation worksheets we receive in clinic helpful, but it would be nice to spend time in section on intonation, too."

    "I would.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to anyone interested in learning the Japanese language.",

    "For anyone who wants to learn Japanese, definitely yes. For anyone who thinks its an easy course to go with, no.",
    "If you're willing to put in the time, go for it. Don't take it expecting to cruise through, though. And go to every review session and language table.",
    "This is a fantastic class, my favorite of the semester. Recommend to anyone interested in East Asian languages. Would not recommend to simply fill a language requirement, unless learning a language is a priority. The class requires full attention and effort every day. Workload is slightly greater than other language courses.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to anyone who is ready to commit their time to learning Japanese. If you are already taking other intense classes, then it may be too much of a commitment. It is a difficult course, but if you want to learn the language, it is the best way to do it."
