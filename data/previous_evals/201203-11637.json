   "comments": [
    "Yes! Chinese is an extremely useful language, and learning it here is both fun and worth-while. Daily homework assignments and tests required a considerable amount of work, but the daily work was often simply and straight to the point. There's also a pattern that the lectures follow, so it's easy to get into a groove when learning each lesson. Overall, the professors were really good and the lessons were challenging but rewarding. The class was a pleasure to go to.",
    "In a nutshell, Chinese as a language demands a ton of time and a ton of work, but will return in full every ounce of effort that is put into it. Sometimes the course can seem frustrating, but if you make sure to stay on top of everything, then you won't lose control. If anyone at Yale is thinking of starting a new language, then I would highly recommend Chinese. I would only warn not to take this class lightly, as it is in fact quite a bit of regular work.",
    "It's a very intense and high-workload class. I recommend it, but make sure you talk to a couple of people who've done it in the past and get a good sense of what's it like before you enroll.",
    "In a heart beat it is a phenomenal class.",
    "I would enthusiastically recommend this class to any student who is certain and willing to put in the effort required to properly learn the basics of the Chinese language. The class entails a significant amount of work, especially for those who have never had exposure to a tonal or other East Asian language. Nightly homework takes around 1.5-2 hours to complete, and there is really no room to skip homework, so it's important that you enter the class completely dedicated to the work. That being said, the class itself is phenomenal and is really well-taught. All 4 teachers are fantastic at what they do and are extremely approachable and friendly. The small class size allows for more individualized attentionto pronunciation (a big focus in Chinese 110) and also lets you bond with your fellow classmates. You will learn so much in a single semester (we covered over 350 characters), and that makes the class really rewarding in its own right. There's a reason why Yale's East Asian language departments are so highly regarded. Plus, taking this class opens up the opportunity to study in China on a Light Fellowship, which is a truly unparalleled academic opportunity. If you are truly interested in learning Chinese from scratch, Yale is the place to do it! Take this class!",
    "Yes, this class is great for learning a second language at Yale. The teachers are great and you learn so much. However, the workload can get to be a lot if you don't keep up.",
    "I would- a note of caution, though- I was shocked to find that some students (usually freshmen, I hear) spend an upward of 4 hours daily preparing. I did about 45 minutes a day and did well. This disparity in preparation time is indicative of an issue specific to this language, insofar that is TONAL. DO YOU \"GET\" THE TONES? OR NOT? Can you distinguish them while hearing, and MORE IMPORTANTLY, REPRODUCE THEM while speaking? Knowing the answer to the question before coming into the class will give you a heads-up to the amount of work you'll be putting in compared to your other classmates. If you're going to take this class regardless, it isn't important to find out beforehand. But if you're, say, considering Chinese I as a \"maybe\" fifth class, I'd advise findingout beforehand. Suggestions on how you can test out your comfort with tones- approach a native speaker and have them practice with you.",
    "Yes. An overall good course.",
    "Chinese 110 is an intense, fast-paced course. The class meets every day with homework, but it's always doable and necessary. I would definitely recommend it to another student.",
    "I would most definitely recommend Chinese 110 to another student looking to begin their Chinese language studies. All of the teachers in the rotation are incredibly friendly and helpful (and pretty funny also.) The small class sizes allow for much more professor-student and student-student interaction than many other classes at Yale, which is extremely beneficial when learning a language like Chinese. The pace of the course is definitely manageable, but you still feel like you've learned quite a bit by the end of the semester. I really enjoyed taking intro Chinese."
