    "I would recommend this course",
    "I would probably not recommend that class to another student because I don't feel like I gained that much out of it. The class may have been better if there were more problem sets and projects that required frequent participation by the student throughout the semester. Otherwise, the class was largely unhelpful in my future endeavors.",
    "I would recommend the class only for the project, access to the excellent TA and some of the practical applications. Other than that, you may be better online",
    "I would avoid taking this class. You'll gather a lot more practical knowledge on your own online.",
    "Yes, recommend.",
    "Yes sure.",
    "CPSC 537 is a good course if you want to get introduced to the database. The course is a little bit fast but you can definitely catch up if you read the textbook and review lecture slides.",
    "I would summarize CPSC 537 as a thorough introduction to database systems that would be useful for statistics grad student that has not had much interactions with databases or SQL beyond Microsoft Access of FileMaker.",
    "Yes, I recommend it to fellow student.",
    "yes",
    "This course is worth a try, with challenging project, broad knowledge of database. Database is ubiquitously utilized in practical life. I will highly recommend it to fellow students.",
    "Yes. Database is the basic knowledge for students major in computer science.",
    "A light introduction to databases and SQL. It covers the basics but doesn't delve deep into any area. The project is a good opportunity to work on something that interests you.",
    "Practical course. Yes. Useful for job hunting.",
    "I would recommend it to any student with little or no experience working with databases, or who has worked with database but wishes to know how they are designed.",
    "I would not recommend this course to another student because I felt like most of the learning was done independently or through the TA office hours."

    "Database and SQL is very useful in my research",
    "I would've liked to learn more SQL and database management. I suppose I got a better grasp of the concepts that I could eventually apply. Overall, I have an understanding of the subject that I hope I can use in the future.",
    "I learned a ton about SQL, which will be very useful",
    "Deepen in databse.",
    "Database is a must for CS student.",
    "I work in computational chemistry and part of my research project involves making database for chemical compound library. I think this course prepares me for the knowledge and tools for realizing this goal.",
    "The course has given me a better understanding of the how programming languages. In the course of working on the class project we had to build a web-scraper to extract data from the web and insert it into a database. I chose to use the statistical programming language R for the task, which has given me a much more powerful understanding of the workings of R while also showing me that it is possible to get \"cleaner\" data if you have an understanding of the structure of the data in the database itself, or better yet access directly to the underlying database where you can write queries to get the data that you seek for further analysis.",
    "I understand basic concepts of database but I do not have much practical experience and skills.",
    "This course opens the new field for me to understand database, associate with its inner mechanism. This will help me deepen my overall understanding of how to apply database into our real life applications.",
    "Database knowledge is helpful for finding jobs.",
    "The structure of the course is well-constructed. It covers all the important aspects of database systems.",
    "Enhance my understanding in Database systems.",
    "Basic knowledge, very useful.",
    "Databases are very important in an every increasing range of fields, as more and more data collected and stored about the world.",
    "Glad I took this because databases is an important subject, but I wish the course had been better organized."
