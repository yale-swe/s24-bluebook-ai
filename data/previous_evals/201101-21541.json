    "After BC in high school, 120 is not too bad. You learn the coolest things in this class, and the work load is almost a joke, like 40 minute psets a week.The ONLY thing wrong with the class is that it can be very vague, or confusing at times. And, the textbook does not really give good explanations. The best way to handle this though is to study extra outside of class, or ask a friend\/tutor who has taken the class to explain it in layman's terms.But overall a rewarding class, that isn't too bad.",
    "It's a tough class--this is not high school calculus anymore. But if you do the problem sets and take good notes in lecture, it will be rewarding. The final is HARD, and is worth 50% of the grade--just something to watch out for. It will require a lot of learning outside of the classroom.",
    "Math 120 is a multivariable calculus class that explores 2D as well as 3D problems in calculus. I would really only recommend this class if you need it. I took it as a challenge and felt it was a little bit above me. Even so, for those up to the challenge, go for it.",
    "I took this thinking that I would be fine in it because I had done well in other math classes. However, I found myself not understanding a lot of the new material. It's a new way of thinking about math, so if you're ready to put in the time and effort for this class, I'd take it.",
    "Math 120 is one of these courses that you know you sort of have to take if you have any interest in the sciences or the great ideas of math, and you know you have to get a good professor in order to make it a good experience. Professor Kushnir is a safe bet in all cases; he'll teach you what you want and need to know and keep it somewhat interesting while he's at it."
