   "comments": [
    "Clarity in syllabus at the start of the semester. If there are going to be changes, it is best to discuss and obtain consensus. Inclusion of more current papers. Omit class on how to conduct scientific research, instead merge it with the introduction. Introduce topic on urban ethnobotany - community gardens. More botany!",
    "If at all possible, I think trips or additional hands-on activities\/practicums would improve this course.",
    "Though readings were interesting, they were weakly guided, and did not contain enough substance for meaningful dialogue, particularly the non-review papers. Additionally, expectations for the culminating paper were confusing, and shifted throughout the semester. Options that seemed more open based on the syllabus turned out to be unacceptable later, and guidelines for the presentation and final paper came later still. On the whole, though performing my own research was gratifying, I see no reason why a review paper on a topic of interest should not be acceptable. It seemed ambitious for such a short-term course.",
    "The best part of the class, a professional teacher, also presented the most difficult part. This was because sometimes I felt the expectations were not clearly communicated.",
    "All of it can be improved - the powerpoint lectures were not at all helpful. The 'discussion' part of class could have been much improved. The instructor did not do a good job of fostering actual discussion, rather the instructor insisted on responding to every comment made by the students and was not very open or welcoming to comments that differed from what she had already pre-determined was a 'correct' answer or the 'correct' way of looking at an issue.",
    "It would have been nice to cover seminal works of ethnobotany and more theory. incorporation of movies and films would have been nice. Classes often dragged on a bit."

I think I might have learned it better if given an assignment to do at home with instructions, rather than try to follow at the pace of other students.",
    "I gained valuable experience conducting interview-based research in this class, which was a new frontier for me. I gained a lot of knowledge about ethnobotany as a discipline, but less than I would have thought about plant groups and general trends in their usage.",
    "No. I don't feel I learned much at all. The topics covered were very superficial. I don't feel like it was an F&ES-caliber course. Importantly, the requirements for the final project were entirely different from what was stated on the syllabus. The syllabus said: \"Examples of projects can include (but are not limited to) a research funding proposal about an ethnobiological subject, a review paper that includes a thorough ethnobiological literature review of a species (see the journal Economic Botany for examples), an edited video or photo essay of any ethnobiological relevant topic, a herbarium of New Haven weedy plant species of medicinal or nutritional value.\" In the middle of the semester this somehow turned into everybody being required to produce an academic research paper with original research for final projects. This was entirely misleading and completely unfair to all of the students.",
    "Mostly. I gained good knowledge of what ethnobotany is all about, and got to experience the methodologies discussed in class through the final project. Didn't get a chance to learn many of the botanical families (not enough time allocated)"
