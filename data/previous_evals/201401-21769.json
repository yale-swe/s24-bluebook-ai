    "Would recommend. Be prepared to spend a lot of time in the shop and to challenge yourself, but worth it completely, regardless of your major.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to a fellow student. The course itself is very enjoyable if you like working with your hands and Brent was a great teacher.",
    "Take this class! It is the best class you will take at yale and you will learn a ton and love working in the shop.",
    "Take this class! I'm a science major with no previous experience in art but still had a lot of fun and made some art I'm proud of. You'll need to spend a serious amount of time fabricating outside of class, so be prepared - it's no joke if you want to have good projects. But the support from Brent and the ability to get practical metal shop experience makes the time commitment totally worth it!",
    "In this class, you learn basic skills of metal working (welding, cutting, shaping, etc.) and produce two sculptures. Class time is usually open shop, with the occasional presentation. Expect to spend a lot of time in the shop. If that doesn't appeal to you, don't take this class. If it does, and you are a self-motivated worker with an enthusiasm for both the artistic and structural aspects of sculpture, take this class!"
