   "comments": [
    "I loved it. Michael Komorowski's grading is very fair, and he isn't strict, never gets angry, and always thinks your comments add something to the class discussion. Just a wonderful environment to take a class in.",
    "English 114 is a good way to work on some of the fundamentals in writing that specifically need to be addressed. It is not about style or prose, but more how to write an argument that flows logically from the beginning to the end. I would recommend it because it addresses those fundamentals that will be useful in your writing for the remainder of your time at Yale. It allowed me to focus on specifics.",
    "I think that 114 is a great class to take early on in one's Yale career. I would suggest it for any freshman, but especially for a first semester freshman.",
    "I would definitely recommend the ENGL 114 05 for other students interested in the politics of capitalism. A good writing credit for the subject; if you're not interested in that, however, try a different section or course.",
    "If you don't have a lot of experience writing non-literary papers, I think that The Politics of Capitalism ENGL 114 is a good course, especially if you are interested in economics, political science, or international studies. The highlights are the readings (although the can be a bit on the long side), thinking about democracy and capitalism in non-conventional ways, and being able to write about almost ANYTHING for the largest paper. The downsides are the amount of work (I felt like I was writing ALL THE TIME) which may or may not be the same for any English class, and the narrowness of the topics for the first paper. I don't recommend taking it for the sake of a writing credit, there are much easier and \"more fun\" classes to take for that.",
    "it was an amazing class. anyone who needs to learn the basics of academic writing should take this class. you are not going to regret it!",
    "It's a big workload. Good grades on the essays require that you put in some amount of work. That being said, grading was relatively lenient and the readings were interesting. Make sure you choose a topic which you like (get a feeling for it during shopping period), because you will have to do and understand the material quite well.",
    "YES! Take it with Professor Komorwoski. HE's helpful, so nice, and the topic is fascinating.",
    "Probably one of the better 114 sections to take. Very interesting material and the professor is pretty good about helping you improve your writing. I was expecting 114 to a pretty unenjoyable class for the most part, but it ended up being one of my favorite classes. I recommend this section\/theme, can't say anything about the others, but I doubt they are as good.",
    "English 114 is a class for those who want to either gain, or to develop, a foundation in clear, well-structured argumentative writing. There will be many drafts and many hours spent honing your essays, but your progress will prove to you that the effort was worth it.In terms of the specific topic this section of English 114 covers, the \"Politics of Capitalism,\" this class will open your eyes to big concepts such as globalization, state-sponsored capitalism, the fundamentals of freedom, etc. that you probably have never deeply thought about. Take the class if you are interested in these topics! But, don't expect this course to be like an EP&E seminar--it is still first and foremost an English class!"
