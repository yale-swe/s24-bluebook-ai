   "comments": [
    "definitely take it!",
    "Don't take it unless you need it or are really interested or if you want to decide whether to be Math\/Econ (this course really discouraged me).Lectures are kind of terrible at times, but section will make you feel better about yourself. Problem sets are tough.",
    "It is the hardest class that I would probably take at Yale. You must have confidence in your math ability and background. The competition for a good grade is stiff, and the problem sets can take up to 10 hours.However, the material is really interesting, and really useful. Mathematical Statistics is a really rewarding subject. But be prepared for many hours of work, lots of pressure and stress and a really hard midterm and final.Don't let the name (Intro to Probability and Statistics) deceive you. The class is actually an intro to Mathematical Statistics for Econometrics.",
    "Chances are, you have to take this class, if you're reading this. This class really isn't so bad. Professor Chen is not great at teaching, and sometimes her lectures are a bit dense, but if you're good at math, then this class isn't hard. The problem sets are not too long (except a few of them), and the tests really are not that hard, if you know the concepts and can do the problems. This class is manageable.",
    "This class was not very well taught. In order to learn the material, you need to work with the book, other people in the class, and the TA. The professor (and lecture) are not very helpful.",
    "Well. If you are an econ-math major, you have to take it. Otherwise, I do not recommend it to other students.",
    "Only take Econ 135 if you are an econ and math major. It goes through two semesters of statistics in one semester, so it moves rather quickly, and includes some proofs. If you have to take it, make sure to stay on top of the work, because it just builds on itself. Taking some sort of statistics class before you take this one might be helpful.",
    "1. This class is at 9AM, when we should all be happily sleeping in our beds. 2. If Professor Chen teaches the class, don't expect to learn much in lecture. 3. Interesting material, but a ton of work. This class singlehandedly convinced me not to major in econ and math.",
    "It is boring, but yet important.",
    "Despite all its weaknesses, I would probably recommend this course if you are looking for a stats course with a bit more mathematics.",
    "It was a tough class with a fairly long weekly problem set but the curve was good.",
    "It's an introduction to stats for economics people. If you're in economics you should take this course if you're more mathematical, and if not, you should probably just take one of the stat courses."
