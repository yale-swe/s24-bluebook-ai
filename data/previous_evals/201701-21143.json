    "I learned a ton of spanish grammar, as expected. The syllabus will tell you everything that you will learn: from preterite\/imperfect to subjunctive to uses of \"se\" and relative pronouns. I definitely got a little lax in the last two weeks of class and didn't learn that stuff as well, but that's on me.",
    "I honed munch ability to speak and write in the Spanish language.",
    "I have developed a stronger understanding of Spanish grammar concepts and a heightened ability to comprehend spoken spanish. This will help me in the future if I ever find myself in a completely spanish speaking environment."

    "The professor for this course was phenomenal. She helped elucidate many of the grammar concepts. I think the workload for the course was a bit excessive though.",
    "Great course. Keep it as is.",
    "This course was an excellent survey of the Spanish language. It's rigor took away many of the joys of learning.",
    "The course is a comprehensive overview of spanish grammar. Strengths include a variety of activities and assessments to help students learn - including quizzes, projects, online homework, conversations, writing, etc. Weakness is that there is so much content that it is difficult to make time to reflect and act upon feedback, because there is always new stuff to be learned."

    "I would not recommend this course to another student, there are better, more engaging, more interesting L5 courses that are worth taking over this one.",
    "Yes, I think this class is a great way to facilitate the transition from high school Spanish classes to other L5 classes at Yale.",
    "If you want to improve your Spanish, you will have a great time. If you are just taking it for a requirement, you will have less of a great time. I took it for the Spanish, and I loved it.",
    "Yes; one learns Spanish very well through this course.",
    "I recommend this course to another student looking to gain a solid grasp of spanish grammar. The class moves very quickly, and it may be difficult to substantially improve your language fluency because you are so focused on learning so much grammar. However, if you complete the homework and participate in class, you will gain a lot."
