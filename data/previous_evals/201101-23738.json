    "If you're required to take L4 for a language or for the major, do it with a smile on your face. It does not have to be a drag - find a professor you click with and who you wouldn't mind spending extra time to work with if you need the help (Professor Diaz is WONDERFUL). Take it as a new learning experience that will only help you becomea better cultured person.",
    "SPAN 140 is a continued review of high intermediate to advanced grammar with some oral and writing practice. I would recommend the class to most students, but I would NOT suggest it for anyone who knows another Romance language well or has studied many other languages (Romance or not). I was in this situation and was very frustrated by the pace and content of the class. If you know a Romance language or have learned many other languages, you should take either SPAN 145 (L3 and L4 in one semester) or SPAN 132 or 142 (heritage speakers, can be good even if you are not a heritage speaker).",
    "Only if you need it.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. Spanish 140 greatly improved my grammar skills, as well as my Spanish speaking. I am so much more confident speaking now than I was in L3 Spanish.",
    "It's a good review of Spanish III, so take it if you like Spanish or if you want to advance to L5",
    "First of all, Professor Diaz is fantastic! If you can, take the class with him!Second, it is an everyday class, so it may get tedious at points, but it is in general very enjoyable, nice and laid back. I personally can feel myself having improved in Spanish tremendously through this course.",
    "Students who wish to advance their language skills or fulfill the distributional requirements should take this course.",
    "You don't learn that much new information from L3, but it'll help with fluency a little bit.",
    "I highly recommend this course if you are attempting to gain fluency in the language.",
    "Easier than L3, so stick with it to reach this class. Keep up on the grades, don't hand things in late",
    "TAKE SPANISH WITH SEBASTIAN DIAZ!!! He is the man! Seriously! He is funny and keeps class pretty interesting. Also, he REALLY WANTS YOU TO DO WELL! The workload is not bad at all - the only way it comes back to bite you is when you consistently leave the homework to do during your 15 minute lunch. But even then it is okay, just a wee bit more stressful for you. As I said, Diaz loves his students and if he sees you putting in the effort, he will go to great ends to make sure you do well."
