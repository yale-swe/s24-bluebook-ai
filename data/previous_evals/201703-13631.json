   "comments": [
    "I learned a lot about the practicalities of the Venture Capital industry in a well structured progression of seminars that touched on term sheets, legal technicalities, entrepreneurial ecosystems, investor relations and investment theses.",
    "A broad understand of the venture capital industry that is not offered elsewhere at Yale -- key for someone with no background in the industry. For students who did have a working understanding of venture, I thought it was interesting to be able to discuss opinions with the class and touch up on the basics. The guest speakers were also a fantastic touch.",
    "I gained a much deeper understanding of the venture industry and entrepreneurship in general. I felt like I left the class with a better understanding of where I would like to work within this industry. Overall the class was extremely insightful because it examined very relevant material on the structure of the industry and the importance of human networks and motivations.",
    "Learned about many aspects of Venture Capital firms and the prominent topics in the field.",
    "I learned a tremendous amount about the venture capital industry from the perspective of both investors and entrepreneurs. Professor Torres fostered a great community environment in the seminar, creating a great course but, more importantly, a better network of people with similar interests and passion.",
    "I learned a great deal about the venture and startup business, from the ground up. I came in with zero knowledge and now I'm far more conversant on the subject and the forms of financing entrepreneurs may receive.",
    "I learned about entrepreneurship, venture capital, and professionalism. I learned what VCs look for in entrepreneurs, how they make term sheets, how they evaluate companies, etc.",
    "I learned a tremendous amount about Venture Capital and the course helped me better understand what a career in VC could like down the road.",
    "An introduction to the world of Venture Capital. The course familiarizes the students with the terminology and processes of the industry and allows the student to investigate a relevant research project.",
    "This seminar is arranged by topic. You learn a lot of the basics of venture and the ecosystem. The second part of the course is more case oriented. We also had 2 guest speakers - very useful to hear from practitioners in the field.",
    "A good overview of the startup and venture capital ecosystems. It gives you a technical inside out of early stage investment and how Silicon Valley VCs decide to invest in startups.",
    "This course defines depth and breadth at Yale. While described as a general overview of the practices of venture capital, I found myself learning far beyond the basics through the course readings, especially.",
    "This course provided a practical overview of Venture Capital. As part of this course, several acclaimed speakers had presented to the class. This seminar dealt with topics such as deal sourcing, thesis development, and entrepreneurial communities.",
    "I learned about the business and practice of venture capital, from raising a fund, to making investment decisions, to adding value through working with founders, and much more.",
    "critical thinking, interpersonal skills, writing, research"

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The classes were thoroughly planned out, with clear objectives and outcomes. We came prepared each week with comments already posted on Canvas, which really helped accelerate discussion.",
    "Strengths: Great overview of the industry, Professor Torres does a great job of encouraging everyone to have a voice at the table, structure of the class (daily structure) I felt worked really well. Weaknesses: Not much I would change, maybe another \"large\" assignment in the middle of the semester to have a better sense of how you are doing in the class and not have such an important portion of your grade rest on the final project.",
    "Overall, the professor did a great job of covering a wide array of topics in the given time. I thought the strongest section of the class was the last third because it was the most thought-provoking. The nuts-and-bolts middle part was at times a bit uninteresting. I would spend less time on these issues and more time on the later material. The readings were interesting and the class was well organized and thoughtfully structured. The workload felt very fair and allowed me to fully engage in the readings.",
    "The course does a great job of teaching fluency in the business of venture capital. It provides great readings and resources to educate anyone interested in the field.",
    "I think it was done very well--I only wish there was more time, but nothing can be done to that end--except allowing a Business of Venture Capital II course.",
    "I thought the course was pretty solid. Yeah, I wouldn't change a whole lot.",
    "This course was really good! Jorge brought in several speakers-- an entrepreneur and two venture capitalists. It was an applied course, which is a breath of fresh air in a college where most classes are theoretical. The reading was not too dense or much-- I found it very interesting.",
    "One of the big strengths of the class was the debates that would occur around the blog posts and the visiting speakers.",
    "The course is very well structured and the professor has a wide variety of experience in the industry and brings in professionals to fill in other gaps. I think the course could also benefit from having a class that focuses on current trends in VC.",
    "We need to submit a weekly reading response. It helps ensure that everyone is the class did the reading and was able to engage in discussions. That being said, sometimes class discussions could go beyond the scope, and it would have been useful to have a couple guiding questions at the start of each section.",
    "It is good that it is a seminar. I liked the prof a lot. My only complaint was that the learning was very learning based and sometimes I wish the course was more hands on instruction rather than debate.",
    "The course was unique in that it covered the topic in depth while catering to a large variety of student backgrounds. If topics ever needed clarification, the professor offered a number of in-person and skype office hours that allowed the student to get one on one help. The course's only weakness was that it could not cover more material in the time allotted.",
    "One of the strengths of this course is that we have to do weekly reading responses. Although these were only 250 words, the reading responses kept the students accountable and ultimately led to very productive in-class discussion. Another strength was the guest speakers. It was such a pleasure to hear from our four guest speakers. These speakers gave us practical insight on both venture creation and fund management. Another strength of the course was that Prof. Torres (Who I really admire) was always willing to help connect students to various venture capital industry-experts to serve as primary sources for final papers. With regards to weaknesses, I actually think that the class may have benefited from a midterm exam or a quiz on deal-sheet terminology.",
    "Strengths: The course was well-taught, thorough, covered many important aspects of venture capital, and included great readings and amazing guest speakers. The class did not require any previous experience, yet taught so much in such a short period of time. The blog posts allowed class discussion and debate outside as well as inside of class. Weaknesses: Because so many questions in venture capital do not have firm answers, it sometimes would have been helpful to get a sense of how the majority of VCs do something, to clarify at least what the most common practice in the industry is, despite the fact that there may not be a black and white solution.",
    "excellent class taught by a passionate and knowledgable professor. cannot be more glad to have enrolled. workload was intense but the course would not be as rewarding without such demands."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "Yes! Fantastic for newbies to entrepreneurship and seasoned venture capitalists alike. It's a hugely pertinent topic in a growing industry, and is a far more engaging experience than what I'd imagine most Yale Econ classes would be.",
    "Absolutely, especially if you are a student with no background in VC but an interest (even if tangential) in VC: as an entrepreneur, patent lawyer, investor, etc. Good for those who already have a background in VC as you get credit for discussing a subject you are passionate about! Also, connecting with the guest speakers is a great opportunity for any who are interested.",
    "Yes, I would recommend it to anyone interested in the topics. I think the class really allows students to take away as much as they put in.",
    "It is a great class for anyone interested in venture capital or entrepreneurship.",
    "I would highly recommend the course. You will learn a lot, meet great people, hear talented speakers in class, and feel compelled to reject Wall Street in favor of innovation.",
    "Sure would! Here's hoping they bring it back.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to anyone interested in business or wants to take a more practical class. This class could be in the SOM. I learned a lot about business.",
    "Yes, if you are interested in the industry its a great introduction and by the time you leave you have several connections in VC. Professor Torres really cares about helping students get involved in VC and gives you the freedom to choose an interesting VC topic.",
    "Yes but only if they are interested in startups or VC.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to any student interested in entrepreneurship or venture capital. From a finance perspective, it provided valuable insights to an industry otherwise difficult to access. As an entrepreneur, it also provides useful perspectives on how to gain venture funds and how this may compare to other financing options. There is something in this course for anyone, no matter what their interest.",
    "I would highly recommend this class! I began with absolutely no experience in venture capital, and I learned so much that I now feel comfortable discussing it (and in fact I'm excited to discuss it!) This class changed my perspective on a large number of things, from risk-taking and self-improvement to ethics and career plans. I enjoyed doing the readings and loved coming to class each week.",
    "YES. What better opportunity to learn about the mysterious world of venture capital than through a practitioner so willing to share both his knowledge and network? be prepared for intense workload though!"
