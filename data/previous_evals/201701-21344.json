    "I learned about why people are the way they are and what shapes people in to who they are based off of their environment and the people they grow up with.",
    "I learned to become a better writer and was able to look at identity as a very nuanced subject.",
    "I learned how to write essays that had well-structured arguments and that used different types of rhetorical strategies.",
    "I thought my skills in persuasive writing improved a lot. the professor did a great job meeting with us and improving our skills.",
    "I feel like I've really learned how to write English in a way that is better for the reader and Professor to read and to follow directions better.",
    "I learned how to write cleanly and efficiently about complicated topics.",
    "This class taught me a clear outline for future papers",
    "This course helped me become a better writer and be able to analyze readings. It helped me become more confident and be able to speak up in class."

    "I would look forward to going to this class every single day. The professor always made it interesting and engaging. It was so cool to always be talking and understanding what is going on. Some classes did get off topic a bit and run late but the conversations were always constructive.",
    "This class only had strengths, the professor was incredibly fair in terms of papers and reading lengths.",
    "The readings were very well selected and were incredibly interesting. Sometimes I wish we spent a little more time in class discussing the readings rather than focusing as much on grammar \/ writing strategies.",
    "It could be improved by improving the first essay. The first essay I found to be a bit useless and not in line with the rest of the course.",
    "I think the course lacks a lot of freedom in how the writer can express himself.",
    "I love getting feedback on drafts. Definitely the best part of 114 is hearing how you can improve as a writer.",
    "This class has some amazing reading material, interesting discussions, and an amazingly supportive teacher and peer environment",
    "The strengths of this course were that the readings were interesting and Professor Homans is one of the nicest people at Yale. She was very understanding and helpful throughout the course. Some weaknesses were that sometimes I felt like I couldn't speak up in class because the conversation moved very quickly."

    "YES. This course and professor were absolutely amazing. I come from a very small town with limited cultural experience and this class opened my mind and eyes to so may different perspectives. I was so amazing to learn every week all the different people i go to school with.",
    "I would wholeheartedly recommend the course to everyone that I meet. It truly helped me learn more about a new topic in addition to learning more about myself.",
    "Yes! I loved this course because it forced me to think about so many things I hadn't discussed before relating to identity categories. It was also super cool to analyze the construction of identity as a whole at an abstract and society-wide level. I also definitely became a much better writer int erms of formulating an argument and using evidence.",
    "Great Class. Professor Homans is very engaging and caring and really makes every student feel valued.",
    "I think that the course is okay for people who like to write more expository style of work.",
    "Yes, this is a great class for learning how to think and write. although I hope they are left leaning because I feel like being a conservative student in a class that focuses a lot on transgender, race, and gender identity would be difficult.",
    "This is great course! The topic is engaging and Professor Homans is fantastic.",
    "I would recommend this course to other students because the subject of Identity is super interesting and thus easy to write about and the professor was amazing, well informed, and flexible on the workload to facilitate the students during stressful times.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to other students. Professor Homans is one of the best professors that I have taken a class from at Yale. She was very helpful and understanding. The course work was the same as other English 114 sections, but Professor Homans made this class one of my favorites."
