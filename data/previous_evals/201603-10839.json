   "comments": [
    "My ability as a screenwriter and critical analyzer of cinema significantly improved as a result of taking this class.",
    "How to write scripts efficiently, how to think about audiovisual storytelling, how to format a story, how to set up a scene properly, and how to specify how the film will visually look without actually describing camera movement.",
    "This course has been incredibly valuable to the development of my writing, in both filmic analysis and screenwriting. While a great deal of work, the midterm folder assignment is incredibly rewarding in that it forces one to really engage with the scripts provided in class as well as their own writing. It made me dig very deep and develop a better sense of story and how to articulate the deconstruction of story. Moreover, in developing a screenplay in the course, I have been able to really refine the talents that I already had coming into the class. I'm much more aware of my strengths in screenwriting and in what ways I rely on them to tell a story. As a result, I know much more precisely where to look when revising my screenplays, as to reduce my reliance purely on my strengths and create balance within the films that I write.",
    "An introductory course to Screenwriting where you learn how to write a script in a professional format, character development, narrative, etc.",
    "A comprehensive course, Professor Lapadula teaches it like a grad class so you do get a real feeling for what's expected of a screenplay, and what the standards you're up against are.",
    "I learned everything about screenwriting",
    "I learned to be more succinct in my writing."

   "comments": [
    "The instructor was extremely engaging and clearly very passionate about his subject. I'd say that this passion and enthusiasm was contagious. The only real improvements I could suggest have to do with the classroom's video system. At the beginning of the semester there seemed to be several issues with the devices themselves.",
    "The class requires you to read many scripts and analyze what is good about them. This exposes you to how scripts are formatted, what makes a good story, etc. Also, by the end of the course, you have one script that you worked on pretty thoroughly and workshopped with everyone in the class. A weakness is that the professor's lectures, though they do have good tidbits, tend to meander and wander and aren't too focused. Sometimes you lose the point of what he's trying to say, but then it clicks together.",
    "I think the course is very much a lecture as much as it is a seminar. It may take a little while getting used to, but a major component of the course is just weeding out the invaluable information packed into the long-form lessons and stories from Professor Lapadula. It's a much more organic process than other courses, as one is not just copying down notes on formal information. There is some of this, but a good portion of the class is learning from how Professor Lapadula tells stories, and contextualizing that to one's own writing. I think that this is a major strength, as the course doesn't try to formalize writing education, outside of teaching screenplay format. The course thereby allows for a much greater creative outlet. That said, I think it may be useful to make this more organic teaching style understood in the beginning of the course. It is an adjustment, thinking and working in less restricted terms, and I think that this adjustment could be helped along just with a better explanation of how the class functions at the beginning of the semester. In addition, it would be helpful to make the self-paced element of the course a little more explicit. There is a single due date for the midterm folder project, and one is expected to begin working at the beginning of the semester and pace themselves until it is completed for the deadline. I thought that this component was very useful, as I had to push myself to chart the progress of my work and set goals for myself to finish the midterm folder on time, but it is incredibly easy to slip on this assignment and not pace oneself, and I think it would be useful to make more explicit how self-paced of a project this is, considering it is the bulk of the course grade.",
    "I would have liked to see examples of foreign movies. The course focuses on American films and therefore, the American-style to write scripts (Classical Hollywood narrative). It is a good start, though. You learn what producers are looking for.",
    "A great class, never dull since Professor Lapadula always brings the ruckus. He also does a great job of presenting you with screenwriting gold standards, making the often sort of nebulous field of creative writing feel a little more definite. There is good and there is bad, and there are clear steps you can take to be one rather than the other. Actually one of my few criticisms is that I wish the student meetings were more strictly enforced. My group fell apart a month or two in due to students dropping out of the class, and we were never really able to get back into the swing of things, which was really a shame.",
    "The professor is amazing! He teaches very well. Maybe more time on students projects.",
    "This class was taught very well, with captivating lectures that highlighted the key strengths and weaknesses of written scripts we read, how the writing translates onto the screen, and how each of us may better create plotlines. Along with this, the instructor formed us into smaller teams that worked together in more intimate settings to hone in on key personal writing challenges. I do not see weaknesses in the course itself. However, it would have been best if more class time was provided. A little less than two hours every week definitely felt shy of adequate class time.",
    "I would have liked for there to be more discussion around tropes within genres. This would have helped some of us to address them more critically or avoid them altogether. That is my main critique of what was otherwise an excellent course."

   "comments": [
    "This was a fantastic class, one that will not only cause you to think more deeply about film, but to think deeply about human beings and their condition in society. The instructor really encourages students to engage the real world and consider the narratives that underlie circumstances therein.",
    "Yes because your classmates are thoughtful and will give good critique, and it's a low-stress, write as you can\/need to kind of class. It's all about personal self-improvement. You get out what you put in.",
    "I would recommend this course, with the qualification that one must be willing to set pace for themselves. A person will certainly learn a great deal about how to tell compelling stories in this class, but the low frequency of graded assignments and requirements means that one will have to map out their own schedule to do well in the course, which can be harrowing.",
    "Yes if you're interested in writing for American film industry.",
    "As somebody who's also taken film 396 (Writing for Film, Voice and Vision), I think this class is a much more comprehensive introduction. Where 396 is really open-ended and general, and saddles newbies with the slightly ludicrous task of a full-length screenplay, this class isn't afraid to get specific and get small. Your final project is only 10-12 pages, and if you're giving it the attention to detail Professor Lapadula expects from you that's more than enough. Lapadula's not afraid to point out errors from the dramatic to the syntactic or grammatical, and it really gives you a sense of a concrete direction in which to improve. Working with other students is a great way to learn as well and I'm sorry I didn't do it more. Would definitely recommend this as THE class if you want to get started on learning how to write a screenplay. Do NOT put off doing the midterm folder. I think about half the class did that this semester and there's a lot more work in there than you think there will be. If you aren't reading and commenting on at least one or two screenplays every two weeks you are going to be in for a nasty ride come midterms season.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class, even if you aren't a film major. It isn't too much work (although there is a large midterm packet) and is a lot of fun. Most of class is spent reading and workshopping everyone's screenplays, and you get a lot of helpful feedback.",
    "Yes",
    "Yes. It will require more work than you might expect, but it's well worth it in the end.",
    "Whether or not you have a specific interest in screenwriting as a craft; learning its mechanics will greatly improve your writing and communication skills. I would highly recommend this course to a peer.",
    "Prof. Lapadula is fantastic, and I learned a lot about writing plotlines, characters and dialogue from this class. There's not much work assigned during the semester except for the midterm folder and final screenplay, which are managable if you start working on them early."
