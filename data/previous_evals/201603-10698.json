    "Reading materials on different philosophies on beauty, the interaction between the concept of beauty and politics, economics and history. Also instructions on how to write an academic essay.",
    "I learned different writing styles and improved my writing.",
    "Beauty Fashion and Ethics ---- I was blind but now I see the light. I was literally so ignorant on all matters considered that basically everything for me was just a learning process",
    "A lot about beauty and fashion",
    "I learned very valuable writing techniques, such as how to make a clear and efficient thesis.",
    "I learned a proficient amount regarding claims and how to keep them clear and concise to set up your essay for success. Additionally, I developed a better understanding for introductory paragraphs and how to structure them since they are so crucial to the success of the essay as a whole.",
    "This course was particularly useful in developing analytical skills to apply to writing thorough and thoughtful essays. I have a much better idea of what makes a good thesis, for example, after taking this course, and I have no doubt that I'll be able to apply the skills I have gleaned to future courses. In terms of the subject matter of this course, I have a much better understanding on the variety of perspectives related to the ethics of beauty and fashion than when I began the class. In particular, I am much better at avoiding cliches (like \"the media\" or \"society\") when explaining my thoughts on beauty, fashion, and ethics.",
    "This course was extremely useful to introduce me to the standards expected of me for college-level writing. I learned how to elegantly, yet concisely and effectively, communicate my thoughts in an academic writing sample."

   "comments": [
    "I would say this is one of the courses at Yale where you will build a very strong bonding with the professor and all your classmates. Also all the reading materials are engaging and instructions on our writing are super helpful.",
    "The class is a bit long but it is interesting.",
    "Just give yourself time to work on the papers, there is moderate reading involved for the first half of the class, and it can get pretty tricky as time passes by to do all of them when required.",
    "The class was very well organized!",
    "I believe a strength of this course was class discussion regarding the pieces we read and I would encourage more of this.",
    "One of this class's major strengths is how interactive it is. Part of this is a factor of size: with only about 12 students in the class, I never felt like I had to struggle to get attention. I also really appreciated the variety of material we read, watched, and listened to. This made the class engaging, but it also gave us a more complete understanding of where we can find different perspectives on beauty, fashion, and ethics. The only weakness that I can identify is one that can be relatively easily turned into a strength. While I think that talking about celebrities and pop culture is an important part of our discussions, I often felt that we went in circles around a few cliches and didn't really discover any new perspectives related to these subjects throughout the course. This was not at all the fault of the professor, but I think there could be a little more structure in how we talk about celebrities. For example, I wish we could spend more time talking about who decides they are beautiful, what beauty means about opportunities, what consequences disobeying ideas of beauty bring, etc.",
    "Meetings during office hours with our professor was a great way to get help on our papers in a very individualized way and the mandatory ones were great to encourage those who would not go on their own. However, I think sometimes information very essential for an assignment or paper was presented in class when that paper or assignment was due that very day or the next, and by this point it is almost too late to really take advantage of what we learned in class for our first drafts."

   "comments": [
    "Yes! This is a helpful course to improve your writing and it really gives you many interesting knowledge on the concept of beauty.",
    "Yes, this is a good course to take.",
    "Getting into this, know you will learn how to write properly But it's not all going to be rosy. It's not just plain up talking about who makes what pretty, Beyonce and vogue. Its challenging and you will need to make a lot of effort to make it happen. Take this if you are genuinely interested in learning a new bunch of stuff really really fast",
    "The class was great.",
    "I would recommend this course to incoming freshman especially because it helps foster better writing skills and we receive a lot of positive, constructive feedback.",
    "Yes, I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. I thought the material was engaging, the workload manageable, and the takeaways incredibly valuable. Prof. Lindskog is a thoughtful and challenging professor, but she clearly cares about her students and what she is teaching--that makes a world of difference to how a classroom feels! I am very lucky to have been able to take this course.",
    "Yes I would recommend this course to any student, and I even believe it should be a prerequisite for almost any other class involving writing at Yale."
