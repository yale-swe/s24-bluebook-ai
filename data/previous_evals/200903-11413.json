    "It's a hidden gem. The lectures are fun and short and learning how to use the telescopes is about as fun as you'd expect. That said, the middletwo or three labs are incredibly frustrating because of vague directions and strangely difficult topics. Expect to have no idea what your grade is at any point in the class.(p.s. yes, this meets once a week for about an hour. we observed probably once every two weeks or so on some night when it was clear for anywhere between 30 minutes and a few hours.)",
    "If you like astromony and want a laid-back introduction to the field, this is a good choice",
    "Yes. It is a great half credit, it was a lot of busy work but its not difficult and interesting."
