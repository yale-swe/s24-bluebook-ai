    "I would recommend it with those who want to continue with third year Chinese. But adjust your expectation because it's not the same as L1\/L2 and can hardly be comparable to the summer in China. I guess it provides a chance for you to stabilize your Chinese, and finally learn to speak about current issues in China.",
    "If you are recommended for this course or it is the next course in your progression, there's not really another option. It is tough, but if you have time to do the work, you will learn a lot of Chinese.",
    "Lots and lots of time, but huge improvement in fluency level.",
    "This class is intensive, excellently taught, and relentless. I recommend to all students serious about becoming fluent in Chinese.",
    "This class is wonderful because it engages students in complicated discussions and pushes L5 speakers to keep expanding their vocabulary. Once again, the Yale Chinese department does an amazing job of involving the students in many ways (one-on-one, partner role-plays, lecture style, group translations, and presentations) at a fast yet not overwhelming pace.Take the class knowing that you will memorize about 80-90 new words every two days and that 1\/2 days you have some homework. There are essays every week, but they are not too long and if you like the topic of the week they are fun to write.",
    "Scroll to the end of this for the tl;dr versionThis is a good class to continue learning. It is, however, important to make sure your pronunciation of Chinese is at a decent level (or to get it there if it isn't), because it will count against you but it is not emphasized in class. Your writing will improve in this course a lot. I would recommend this course because it definitely is a step in the right direction in terms of Chinese learning. It is a lot of work, but definitely MUCH less than a Light Fellowship summer program. If you took your light fellowship program seriously, this class will be a walk in the park. If you have never done Light Fellowship, this class will pretty much be the same workload as other Chinese courses as Yale (in which case, you'll find it difficult but certainly manageable; the difficulty lies in the amount of work). If you've never taken a Chinese course at Yale, and this is your first one, then you will probably have to put in extra work to get up to speed, but if you do that in the beginning, you should be fine. The teachers are good, very professional and very friendly!tl;dr : 80 words a week. Weekly dictations on Monday. bi-weekly essays (600 characters). Tests can be challenging. Requires a medium amount of daily work, which is unusual for college courses (but normal for language courses). Taught by good teachers.",
    "Yes, this is definitely the thing to do after coming from Light, don't worry if you seem less fluent. Your vocabulary and language abilities are growing."
