   "comments": [
    "The class was too large. It felt disruptive when we had to literally shift spaces to have discussion. I also think that the students should be vetted so that everyone is approaching the material in a way that is generative. It is difficult to spend time on basic skills like thinking historically or critically when I assumed that we would all enter the class with those basic skills.",
    "The premise of the course is a good one. Unfortunately, the execution of the course was hindered by the half seminar-half lecture format. We didn't have enough time in seminar to really get into the assigned texts, which were always rich and sometimes very dense. As a result, many of the seminar conversations felt pretty stilted, and there was a big disconnect between the first and second half of each class meeting. Those in Sara's section got very little face time with Dr. Nasrallah, and though Sara is a wonderful TA, it would have been nice to interact more with Dr. Nasrallah in a seminar context. Because many of us only got to interact with her in the full class format, there was a lot of pressure to come into class with a fully formulated take on the assigned texts in order to speak in the large group. Though the syllabus included some interesting works, the more contemporary theoretical texts often felt randomly thrown together with ancient works, and the connections between works assigned together often weren't clarified. I would have liked more of an arc or a core set of themes in the syllabus. It often seemed as though the syllabus was being workshopped on the fly, with assignments added and due dates changed mid-semester. The guidelines for the final project were never fully clear (the word count and the page count both changed several times during the semester and didn't match up to one another). It's clear that Dr. Nasrallah is a thoughtful historian, but the class ultimately felt a little half-baked, ending without much synthesis of class's themes. I would definitely take another class with her in future terms adjusting to a new university takes time and always requires some correcting on the fly. I'd suggest capping the class and teaching it as a seminar. This would not only ensure more interaction with the professor, but would also limit the amount of time devoted to presentations at the end of the term, leaving more time for synthetic wrap-up discussions. I would pare down the number of separate texts assigned per class (no more than three), not because the reading load was too heavy, but because we had too great a diversity of material in each session to address each work on its own terms and devote significant time to comparisons. I might reorganize the syllabus so that a set of core themes more clearly emerged (even something as simple as adding thematic headings rather than NT quotations would help). Finally, the assignments on the syllabus at the end of shopping period should accurately reflect the spacing, length, and number of assignments over the term."

   "comments": [
    "I would. I think Dr. Nasrallah asks very interesting questions and presents material in ways that push students to probe deeply and ask questions they otherwise wouldn't. The syllabus is phenomenal, and I immensely enjoyed every piece of reading we did because it was challenging. This course was one of the best I have taken at Yale, and I felt that I really grew intellectually throughout it.",
    "I imagine with some workshopping of the syllabus and the class format, this would be a wonderful class. Dr. Nasrallah is obviously a very knowledgable and sensitive scholar. I would heartily recommend taking a class with her to anyone with an interest in ancient Christianity or in honing their skills of historical analysis. If your interests are primarily theoretical or philological, this class might helpfully round out your reading skills, but it may not be directly tailored to your interests. Your mileage may vary."
