    "Good readings, not a great class. No need to take this.",
    "Professor Rasmussen might be leaving at the end of the semester, and if so, don't take this class if not taught by her. It's her baby, and I can't imagine taking it without her. If she is teaching it, definitely take the class. The stories you hear will move you and make you think about what's going on in the world and the language we use to discuss it. It's a relevant class, despite fulfilling the pre-1865 American Studies requirement. Take it.",
    "I highly recommend this course. A very interesting syllabus that evokes even more interesting discussions. Consistent workload. Excellent in every way!",
    "Not sure if this will be offered again but if so, take it",
    "The discussions in this class did not really go anywhere. It was mostly just people making the same point over and over. The course work is a pretty light load.",
    "Amazing. Eye-opening. Thought-provoking. Amazing.",
    "This is definitely a great course for anyone interested in the topic. The workload is very reasonable and the discussions during class were engaging and thoughtful. Would definitely recommend.",
    "ABSOLUTELY TAKE IT!",
    "There isn't one day where I don't leave her class in awe. Prof. Brander Rasmussen's ability to guide class discussions and to effortlessly connect students' comments together is commendable. Great Professor. Great course. Everyone should take it.",
    "Definitely!",
    "Definitely take this course, it's wonderful eye-opening subject material and Birgit is the best around so take it!",
    "American Captivity Narratives is a really really cool course. The readings (towards the second half of the semester) are so good that if I didn't finish them in time for the seminar, I'd still read and finish them afterwards. I know Birgit is leaving so not sure the class will still be taught, but ACN ended up being one of those classes that opened my mind to a new way of thinking."
