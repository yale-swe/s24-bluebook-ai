    "Natural continuation of 110 but with more important grammar, less important vocab, longer essays, a couple of movies and a book. It really consolidates knowledge from L1 and makes you confident enough to have a decent conversation. It's amazing how much you improve after you learn ALL the tenses in Italian!",
    "While the course is still basic, it starts to delve into more complex topics like politics, which is really cool. I would recommend it if you know some Italian and want to become stronger in those skills.",
    "Ital 120 is a great course that covers advanced grammar and easier language concepts. There is a good mix of the complex and the simple which ensures that Italian class never feels like a constant struggle. I highly recommend this course since you are able to become conversational with advanced Italian grammar and vocabulary very quickly. Also, the workload isn't very heavy.",
    "Ital 120 is a continuation of Ital 110--so it's the same textbook, same weekly tema, etc. The pace slows down to one chapter every two weeks, because the grammatical concepts become significantly more complex. By the end of the semester, the class covers all major Italian tenses, and their usage. I really enjoyed the Bocaccio reading, and Megan Crognale is a wonderful instructor--she's understanding and fun, and good at explaining tricky grammatical concepts. The Italian department provides a relaxed introduction to their language, while making sure that students learn!"
