    "I really acquired a better understanding of the French language and became much quicker at expressing my thoughts in French.",
    "I improved my oral french abilities, and learned about contemporary French culture. Specifically, I learned about immigration, politics, the educational system (emphasis on high school), and the environment in France.",
    "We discuss aspects of French society such as the family, immigration, globalization, and you really find yourself forming more definite opinions (in French!) about these things yourself. So, besides the awesome amount of speaking practice you get, you grow as a person as far as knowing your beliefs goes."

   "comments": [
    "Strengths are that the work requires you to speak, which is great for your oral skills. The oral exams, presentations, and class debates made sure that every student in the class improved. At times the written work felt a little tedious and not as constructive as the oral work.",
    "It was a very well organized course. I learned a lot but the homework was sometimes excessive and we had so much reading we couldn't get to all of it. It might have been better to be more focused and have more talking time in class.",
    "I really liked the fact that there is only few people in the class. That was definitely a strength of the class.",
    "The course offers a broad survey of topics in contemporary French culture. The syllabus contains an interesting variety of articles, editorials, and films - I enjoyed doing the reading for this course. The class is designed to improve students' oral proficiency, and likely will, although homework assignments and quizzes do help to maintain (or improve) students' written proficiency.",
    "strengths: lots of in-class discussion. Regular short writing assignments I found valuable for continual improvement on written ability. And of course, Mme. Pinzka is engaging, kindhearted, witty and all around a person worth spending 3 hrs\/week with :)"

   "comments": [
    "If you want to improve your oral french, absolutely!",
    "France is interesting and it is fun to learn and talk about it. Would recommend.",
    "If the students are almost fluent in French and want to develop their vocabulary and refresh their memory as well as learn a lot about French culture and history, this is the perfect class for them.",
    "I would certainly recommend this course to any student who is interested in improving their oral proficiency, or who would like to learn more about contemporary French culture. The workload is manageable, and the course readings are quite interesting.",
    "I would recommend. Plentiful discussion on meaningful topics, a wonderful teacher, and a kind-of-heavy workload will help you improve a lot in French. Also now I know so much more about France and feel able to participate in conversations about her!"
