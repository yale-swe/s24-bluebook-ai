   "comments": [
    "For the most part, the work in this course is reasonably balanced with the rest of the coursework in the first-year spring semester. Projects are often large, but Prof. Egan does a good job of encouraging (and\/or requiring) that they be completed in stages. This allows more and better work to be more manageable, and increases the learning of each. The first major project of the semester (analysis of a real theater's documents), however, is absolutely killer. I think it's a combination of the fact that the process is brand new at that point, and that there is little time early in the semester to complete it in stages. I spent easily 15-20 hours on it in a single week, which threw off the rest of my coursework\/sleep for at least a week. The project was hugely beneficial in terms of learning, but I wish I had been able to balance it better and still do good work. Any tools that future, unsuspecting students could be given to help spread out this project would be a great benefit.",
    "There were a few moments where the workload caught me off guard. I just did not realize how long some assignments would take. For example, the initial analysis of a theater's budgets seemed like it wouldn't take that long but was actually more like a midterm. I wish it had been called that so that I would have approached it as such."

    "The course was well organized and developed logically from session to session.",
    "The sequence of the class and its materials were all organized well and made sense throughout the semester. The practice of listing assignments both on the syllabus and on a separate assignment sheet each class led to a few unclear moments. I think that students generally assume that the syllabus is the contract\/authority for the requirements of the class, but in this class the assignment sheet trumps in the case of discrepancies. I know it seems like it shouldn't be hard to follow the sheet, but when students are juggling deadlines for ten (not an exaggeration) classes and workshops, plus professional work and case study, centralized information like a syllabus is invaluable. We found in more than one class that it was very easy to forget that another sheet might have differing information. This is particularly true when a class's deadlines are not always on the same day of the week (as in this case). I know that I usually plan my homework schedule about two weeks in advance, and it can be easy to miss a detail like a variable due date. I think this issue could be addressed either by committing to hard information on the syllabus, or by listing less assignment information on the syllabus and saying explicitly that only the assignment sheets (and NOT the syllabus) are to be used to plan your schedule week-to-week. Either way, a single source of information would be helpful.",
    "I thought the organization was logical and helpful to the learning process."

    "Pat Egan invests in each of us personally and evaluates each student's work carefully and thoughtfully. At times I wish she had noticed that I was struggling with the material and needed more assistance but she was always available when approached, and this despite her busy schedule and travel. I really appreciate the time and care she invested in me.",
    "Prof. Egan is one of the pedagogically strongest teachers in the Theater Management department. She has clear goals for what she'd like her students to learn, and her course is deftly structured to achieve them. She works with personal care to make sure students of differing backgrounds and facility get the most out of her course.",
    "Pat is a very good teacher, and very patient. I often feel stupid when it comes to understanding numbers and while the class moved quickly at times, I always felt safe asking questions."

    "Sometimes the pace moved too quickly for me and I am upset that I don't have as in-depth an understanding as I had hoped; this is not my strength and I'm afraid I didn't get as much out of the course as I wanted to because this material takes me longer too assimilate. Having said so, I know this is an area I need to invest more time and energy in and I look forward to continuing to develop these skills and to do so in future classes with Pat Egan.",
    "I think if you had asked me at the start of this year what an asset is, I would not have been totally clear on the answer. The progression of financial courses this year has put a lot of pieces together for me. I now have tools I did not have before.",
    "I really learned a lot in a short amount of time from this class. I feel way more confident than I have in the past about handling finances. I feel as if I could at least speak with confidence about the components of an audit and reasonably understand what they are saying about the organization."

    "This is a great course, the material is important, and time is limited, but it can be difficult to stay fully engaged over three straight hours. Breaks were often quite short (six or seven minutes), and there was some overload\/zone out in the second half some days. I think learning would increase if the instructor committed to at least a 10 (if not a 15) minute break each class.",
    "Ask students at the end of class to write down a question or two that they still have so that they have time to reflect on things they aren't understanding so that that's where we could start the next week."
