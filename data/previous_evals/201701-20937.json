   "comments": [
    "A whole new set of techniques and independence within a lab",
    "Working on my senior thesis was an incredibly useful and intensive experience. Most of what I learned was in the lab, but I also found the assignments for the course useful because they helped me develop important scientific communication skills.",
    "Deep understanding of Parkinson's. In general, presentation skills and writing skills.",
    "Wet lab experience was challenging, time-consuming, and in the end showed me I DEFINITELY don't want to get a PhD. Was pretty cool to actually conduct research, synthesize it, present it various times, and write a research report. I'm glad I didn't go the BA route.",
    "I learned the trials and tribulations associated with the scientific process, and it was valuable to see a tangible product come out of a full year's worth of research.",
    "By taking this course, I out in a substantial amount of time and effort into my research, which I believe helped me thoroughly understand how to work in a laboratory and gain essential skills for my job beyond Yale.",
    "Good experience in wet lab and science writing. Communicating and working with other lab members and scientists of different experience levels.",
    "I developed strong research, bench skills, communication and presentation skills that will be valuable in my future academic pursuits.",
    "troubleshooting working through issues at hand",
    "Learned molecular biology techniques well, this course really teaches you how to plan a whole experiment and the reasons behind each experiment you conduct.",
    "Although I have conducted individual research projects in the past, this course allowed me to do so in a lab that I have worked in for the past three years. I learned how to carry out a complex individual project, troubleshoot appropriately, and present my data in a professional manner.",
    "This course was helpful in learning how to work and develop a project that is dynamic and requires changing of a testing paradigm. It was great exposure to lab work for the first time.",
    "MCDB seniors have to take this. I love my lab so it was fine",
    "I learned various lab procedures, how to see a project through the various phases, and how to write scientific journals reporting the results."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Lots of independence which is great! For someone who had never worked in a lab, would have been nice to have some help finding a lab to work in (luckily I found a great one!)",
    "I think the course was very good! A few minor things: for the final report, it would be helpful if the assignment noted specifically that figures and references aren't included in the page count.",
    "Organize the course better. We did not know how to dress for presentations and details about the paper.",
    "The timing of the powerpoint presentations, poster presentation, and thesis was TERRIBLE. It was incredibly stressful and I think they should have been spaced out more. Also, it would make more sense for the thesis to be due first and then the powerpoint slides and poster could have a more clear direction. I also felt as if the poster presentation was a complete waste of time, as anyone could have easily just signed in and then left. I also think it is extremely unfair of the MCDB department to require us to pay for our own poster. While they try to get around this by saying we can print slides and assemble them on the board, we all know that looks extremely unprofessional and simply doesn't look as nice as printed posters. There should be a fund for students whose PIs didn't cover the poster and they couldn't afford to print their own poster. Communication of deadlines and requirements was also extremely unorganized, as the syllabus was only kept on the fall course site and not uploaded to the the spring site.",
    "Needs more oversight with mentors. My mentor was AWOL for a couple months and since I couldn't conduct research on my own I spent 10 hours a week reading published papers and observing the work in our neighboring lab to count as lab time. The wet lab experience vary greatly across the board.",
    "I think the course is well-structured, with enough assignments to keep us on track and time to dedicate to our research.",
    "I poured way more time into this than the required 10-12 hours per week. I felt I was spending almost all my time outside my 2 other classes in lab, and then spent a lot of time preparing for the presentations and report at the end of the semester. I'm not sure how this would best be addressed, but it's hard not to feel like you need to spend more time in lab in order to get your project done than would be expected of a 1 credit senior project.",
    "This course was difficult to balance with my other coursework and extra curricular activities but allowed me to engage with and enjoy scientific research. I liked that we had to do an oral presentation and poster presentation.",
    "having some of the department wide talks half way though the year would have been more helpful",
    "It's difficult to do alot of things in the short amounts of time you spend in lab so I suggest you do a summer of research before this course. That would help a lot",
    "Although this class was designed for students to spent 10-12 hours\/week in lab, I ended up spending significantly more time. Due to the amount of time I spent on my senior thesis, I wish I enrolled for the intensive course. This may be a registration difficulty but it would be great if students could retroactively change their course from the non-intensive one to the intensive one, because it was difficult to determine how much time I would be spending in lab at the beginning of the semester. This could be verified by my PI\/supervisor. Aside from this, I really enjoyed this course. I was able to make a presentation poster for the first time and present my work in front of my peers. This class allowed me to fully immerse myself in science research, something that I love.",
    "The broad requirements for everyone can be kind of frustrating since each lab\/PI is so different. The final requirements were difficult to manage at the end of the term. It's a lot of work at once to have to generate a final paper, presentation, and poster, in addition to attending 2 hours of presentations and a poster session, on top of already spending 12+ hours per week in lab. MCDB MUST OFFER FUNDING for printing final posters, or collaborate with the residential colleges \/ labs to help students cover the costs. No one wants to be the only one at the symposium with a poster they printed at home.",
    "Strengths: develop as a researcher, work independently Weakness: I did not know when anything was due because it wasn't very clear, no one knew where to print posters or how long the final paper had to be (I had to dig into the depths of canvas files to find the document that said that). Also having both a poster and a PPT on top of the final paper was a ton of work.",
    "The strengths are that it allows for a lot of autonomy and gives students control over when they work in the lab. The weakness are that everything is piled into the last two weeks of class, and the directions sometimes are not clear about the expectations or requirements."

   "comments": [
    "Great experience",
    "I would highly recommend doing research if you are an MCDB major and are potentially interested in doing research in the future in any capacity. I learned so much about experimental design and scientific communication. The only caveat I would offer is that if you regularly spend 20 hours a week in lab anyway, it might be worth doing the intensive major so you can get 2 credits for your work each semester instead.",
    "Well, you need it to graduate.",
    "Wet lab experience was challenging, time-consuming, and in the end showed me I DEFINITELY don't want to get a PhD. Was pretty cool to actually conduct research, synthesize it, present it various times, and write a research report. I'm glad I didn't go the BA route.",
    "I would recommend this course to any student interested in gaining a substantial amount of research and scientific presentation experience.",
    "If you are at all interested in laboratory research in the future, or think you might be, you should do this year long research course.",
    "Yes I would recommend this if you are a MCDB major.",
    "pretty standard research for credit",
    "Take this course if you are interested in research, want the BS, and know you will be spending approximately 10-12 hours in lab per week. I ended up spending significantly more time and I wish I enrolled in the intensive course.",
    "You probably have to take this if you're an MCDB senior. The class isn't super well organized because they kind of let you loose too much, but find a great lab and you'll have a good experience.",
    "Yes, it is a perfect way to fulfill the Senior research requirement."
