So the good news is: If you're taking this class for the reasons I took this class -- a math class that is A) relatively doable and B) super fun and interesting -- then you're certainly in the right place.",
    "This course was different than traditional math classes and I learned a lot of different valuable skills. Being able to estimate values and use multiple steps to solve problems."

    "Strengths: great teacher Weaknesses: there aren't any",
    "Great QR for students who struggled with math",
    "Strengths were Professor Vigliotta's constant care and dedication. She's the best. My only concern is that the final for the course is pretty influential. That was scary.",
    "I liked the format of how we took notes, that was helpful and when it came time to study I felt that I was organized and not scrambling through hard to read notes. It could be improved by having review sessions and practice exams before the midterms and final exam.",
    "I think it is important that this class be small. In having only 10 students in the class, the learning environment was much more interactive and hands-on than that of a lecture math class. The learning was definitely benefited by the small size. I also think that having worksheets for each class that clearly outlined the material for the day facilitated the learning in a great way. The amount of work was also very helpful: the two projects at the end of the semester were a great way to apply all the material we had learned in class and on the weekly p-sets throughout the semester. I generally think the structure of the class worked perfectly."

    "Absolutely take this class. Professor Vigliotta is so patient and caring so that the psets and exams are very doable.",
    "ABSOLUTELY! TAKE THIS CLASS! I am literally the worst at math in the entire world and this class made me feel like I could do it. It's really not difficult stuff and if you put the time in you will be absolutely fine. It's not meant to trick you-- it's actually an environment that facilitates learning. Especially if this class is with Sarah Vigliotta (can't speak for another teacher) you would be stupid not to take it as a non-math major. It's designed for you and you will actually learn things that can be applied in real life. She's incredible and will meet with you to give you extra help when you need it CANNOT CANNOT CANNOT recommend highly enough",
    "Definitely-- if you need a QR and intimidated by math, then this is the class for you",
    "Absolutely!!!!",
    "I would recommend this course to students looking for a QR credit. The level of math is not too difficult but it still presents a challenge."
