   "question_text": "Looking back on this course, what is your overall assessment of the course:  What are its strengths and weaknesses, and in what ways might it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The instructor usually makes too many slides for one class session that he needs to talk fast about all the contents, this makes the students usually not very clear about the contents that we need to find more information elsewhere after the class.",
    "Weakness is that majority of the course is self-taught.",
    "This course does a good job of going into the nitty gritty of clinical trials. In all honesty, it covers the material pretty well- I just didn't like the topic.",
    "Overall, good introduction to fundamental topics of clinical trials.",
    "This course is perfect since it is a fundamental basis for clinical trials with just suitable for me without any background in biology.",
    "Strength: useful material for those interested in clinical trials or regulatory affairs. Weakness: The lecture's were not very engaging and there was a lot of information packed into the course.",
    "I learned quite a lot from this course. But since it provided too much information, I felt difficult sometimes to catch up with the instructor in class.",
    "The course is just too easy and doesn't touch the core part of how to do data analysis in clinical trial. More course works and materials are suggested to be covered in this course.",
    "Strengths: -presents current state of evidence on clinical trials development, management, analysis Weaknesses: - teaching to SAS without including SPSSS and other statistical programs.",
    "The course was overall useless. It reviews statistical processes we learn in Biostats 1 and 2 (required courses for all) and doesn't really dive into any of the larger portions of clinical trials. I feel that I went in hoping for some kind of robust understanding of clinical trials and left only understanding which statistical tests are necessary to assess them. I also feel the rest of the information taught doesn't apply to most students, as it was geared towards teaching you how to run a clinical trial, and very few of us are medical doctors.",
    "This was simply not a good class and not useful like I thought it would be. Concepts were sometimes unclear and simply turning in a pass\/fail assignment every week was insufficient preparation for exams. I suppose I did learn some things, but this class wasn't worth the frustration. Improvements would be reviewing the homework in class or in section to go over it, making sure lecture notes (and\/or another textbook) clearly include formulas used, and having practices problems for the exams (which seemed much harder than the assignments and lectures).",
    "For someone coming in with experience conducting clinical trials, much of the material was redundant. Some of the earlier material also overlapped with the introductory epidemiology courses. The latter half of the course was very interesting and useful.",
    "The recommended text book is not very good.",
    "exams are too long for the slotted time, otherwise would only recommend this class to those looking for a truly in depth breakdown of clinical trials - ie this class is very statistics based, which is not for everyone. If you're into that, I would highly recommend this class. It's not a lot of work, 0-1 problem set every week. Tests are in class open book open computer which was nice. Professor was obviously well versed in the material, and is pretty laid back, which was nice too...",
    "The course was informative and covered more than I would have expected.",
    "Lecture powerpoints can be improved. Sometimes they are ambiguous. Also, often we don't know about the formulas and the instructor gave us some examples instead, but we are required to use those formulas in the exams. Strength: the course is very useful and contains much detail.",
    "I thought the course was not good at all. The instructor was very monotone and just read off the powerpoint. I did not learn much",
    "This is a good course in the basics of clinical trials. Some of the information overlapped with epidemiology I and II, so it was helpful to have that background information. I think other newer topics could have been elaborated on more.",
    "this class would be better if it were split into two sessions. We learn such a large amount of material per week and it would be easier to stay interested and motivated if it were split up into two lectures.",
    "Very comprehensive powerpoint slides -- really thought they were useful. The textbook, I did not enjoy as much.",
    "Integrate biostatistics technologies into clinical trial",
    "The text book was a helpful source for background reading, but not as helpful with the statistical analysis. Although the statistics was largely revision from previous courses having a reference fro statistics during this class might be helpful.",
    "Overall, the course was good, but more integration of randomized control trials using interventions other than a pill would help enhance the comprehensiveness of clinical trials.",
    "good and useful",
    "I did learn some useful things about clinical trials, although not as much as I would have liked. Also, most of the learning came from just reading off the slides which I didn't really need to go to class for. A lot of the material was review, which was nice, but I think the class would benefit from more real life examples, guest speakers, etc.",
    "Very informative class. Might have benefitted from more detailed comments in the SAS code provided during lectures.",
    "The course load was fine, but I found it difficult to prepare for exams. Even though the exams had a lot of calculation questions, we didn't have very much practice beforehand. I would suggest that the homework include more calculation problems similar to ones that we would find on the exams, or at least a practice exam.",
    "helpful",
    "The class provided methods which I found directly applicable to activities I was doing outside of the classroom. It also developed my SAS skills by providing opportunity to learn and interpret new codes. The slides could have been clearer with definitions and examples but were helpful overall. The first few lectures probably could have been consolidated and it may be helpful to collaborate more with some of the other biostats instructors to identify areas of heavy overlap. The homework assignments were well aligned with the exams.",
    "There was a lot material covered in this course and it did a good job of boiling down the important concepts and biostats needed to carry out a clinical trial from start to finish. The weekly homework was usually not difficult, and I felt it was useful in making sure you understood the main points from each lecture. I wish the lectures were more engaging or interactive, although I'm not sure how it could be done if it remains a lecture style class. I also felt a lot of the material overlaps with other classes, including Epi II and Measurement Issues."

   "comments": [
    "Instructor: James David Dziura \u00a0Explained all concepts very clearly, and made expectations on assignments very clear. I would happily take another course with Prof. Dziura.",
    "Instructor: James David Dziura \u00a0If Dr. Dziura can't finish all the contents in one class session, maybe he could adjust his slides to include more information that even if for the slides he didn't mention about, we could still understand the contents by reading his slides.",
    "Instructor: James David Dziura \u00a0Instructor''s weakness is that mostly read from powerpoint slides. Strength was everything was clear and presented in an understandable format.",
    "Instructor: James David Dziura \u00a0Very monotone and unengaging but definitely knows his stuff. I can't say the material is very riveting but he does his best at displaying the information. He is very approachable and patient with questions and is quick to consider student feedback or concerns regarding exam grading which is appreciated.",

    "Instructor: James David Dziura \u00a0Thoughtful and clear presenter with good organizational skills",
    "Instructor: James David Dziura \u00a0Professor Dziura clearly cares about this topic. However, he was not familiar with the slides many times this was apparent. Also, it seems that the course itself is designed in a way that is not conducive to teaching or learning.",
    "Instructor: James David Dziura \u00a0I actually really liked the instructor and thought he was a nice guy, although sometimes his explanations were above our heads or there would be steps skipped in his problem-solving, which was frustrating.",
    "Instructor: James David Dziura \u00a0Professor Dziura's teaching style was good, but the class wasn't as engaging as it could have been, and probably suffered from being in too big of a classroom.",
    "Instructor: James David Dziura \u00a0Please give more examples.",
    "Instructor: James David Dziura \u00a0knowledgeable and approachable. Puts all the material in the slides, which are later easy to understand (which is important for a subject like this)",
    "Instructor: James David Dziura \u00a0Jim gave us an excellent class. He provided good explanation to the concepts.",
    "Instructor: James David Dziura \u00a0Could be more-organized. Also we need rigorous formulas if you want us to do the math. Strength: he is well prepared for our class.",
    "Instructor: James David Dziura \u00a0maybe try to cut down the words shown on each slide to make it more brief",
    "Instructor: James David Dziura \u00a0He was nice but very hard to pay attention",
    "Instructor: James David Dziura \u00a0Does a good job of explaining material and answering questions. Tests are very fair (challenging but do-able).",

    "Instructor: James David Dziura \u00a0good teacher",
    "Instructor: James David Dziura \u00a0Too many words on the slides, which made it hard to follow and pay attention. Too much reading off the slides, again which made it hard to pay attention. Class could be improved if it was a bit more interactive and involved more class discussion and participation.",
    "Instructor: James David Dziura \u00a0Dr. Dziura was very accommodating, understanding, and approachable as an instructor. Clearly explained lecture notes and thoroughly responded to questions during lecture.",
    "Instructor: James David Dziura \u00a0Responsive to students and their concerns, but I felt like I wasn't well prepared for the calculation problems on exams. The lectures didn't focus very much on the calculation problems that appeared on the exams. We also didn't get any examples of these problems through the homework.",
    "Instructor: James David Dziura \u00a0The professor was clearly knowledgeable and provided helpful responses to questions. It would be great if lectures were more engaging.",
    "Instructor: James David Dziura \u00a0The instructor was very knowledgeable and always willing to answer questions in person or by email. I do wish we could have gotten more personalized or more detailed responses\/answers to the homework. I also think the mathematical concepts could be covered in more detail during lectures, with steps clearly written out, and not just with formulas, but with numbers substituted. Overall, the slides could be more clear and concise as well.",
    "Instructor: James David Dziura \u00a0Good Instructor, it would be better if we went over examples by hand"

   "comments": [
    "This is an introductory course on starting, running, and analyzing clinical trials. I would recommend this course to a student who already has a background in statistics and has an interest in healthcare.",
    "Actually no, I don't recommend. I think most of the students took this class because this was part of the courses for the regulatory affairs track, however, clinical trial itself is not an interesting topic so it is easily for the students to blank out during the class session or lose interests and leave the classroom. I don't think it is the instructor's problem, but just not easy to keep students interested in the dry contents.",
    "Since this is a required course in many instances, I would not recommend it as an elective. The Advanced Clinical Trials class would be a much better choice.",
    "This course is good for those students who aren't interested in SAS but still need a biostats course above 505 a&b. The course touches on SAS and you do some coding for the homework assignments but it isn't graded and you are never tested on coding- just output. Plus there isn't a lab which I appreciated. The exams are open book and open note which sounds great but I actually found the exams to be quite difficult and didn't fully reflect the assignments we had throughout the course. I would recommend the course to someone who is looking for a course that is more easily digested than Regression or Categorical Analysis.",
    "Good introduction to topics in clinical trials. I would recommend to students who do not know much about clinical trials and are interested in learning more on the subject.",
    "I will strongly recommend this course to fellow students.",
    "I would probably recommend it because of the usefulness of the material.",
    "Yes. This course provides an overall understanding of how to perform clinical trials both theoretically and practically.",
    "Good course for target audience of clinical researchers or aspiring clinical researchers (beyond just public health school) presenting state-of-evidence approach to clinical trial methodologies and basic statistical approaches for examining clinical trial data. Would highly recommend this course to others.",
    "I would say do not take this course unless you have to. The course provides no new knowledge and is frankly a waste of time as a public health student.",
    "No -- don't take this class! Unless you plan on doing statistical work for a clinical trial (i.e., being a statistician), anything else you take will be more worth your time and less frustrating.",
    "See above answer",
    "I would recommend this class.",
    "I hope it's not a required course.",
    "I would recommend this course to others",
    "If the student is interested in clinical trials i would recommend it. If a student struggled in Epi 2 or biostats then no.",
    "Would recommend for a great introduction to clinical trials and research methods, particularly to supplement knowledge learned in intro to biostats",
    "I would recommend it because it is useful",
    "This course was quite dry and difficult to engage with. If you think you are going to conduct clinical trials by all means, but I don't believe it will be relevant for the vast majority of students.",
    "A good course that covers all aspects of clinical trials, including concepts and associated statistical analyses.",
    "good and take it",
    "If you are looking for a fairly easy, stress-free course that mostly reviews statistical concepts and methods, then this class is great. If you are interested at all in clinical trials, then a great intro course.",
    "Not a heavy workload, but a very informative class. Would recommend for students hoping to gain more in-depth knowledge about conducting clinical trials without doing too much quantitative analysis.",
    "Yes I woulod recommend to understand the basics of clinical trials",
    "yes very good",
    "The class was useful overall.",
    "If you feel you need a simple and easy class on how clinical trials are carried out from beginning to end then could be a useful course for you. If you have taken Epi II and Measurement Issues, a lot of the material will be redundant."
