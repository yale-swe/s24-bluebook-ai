    "THIS IS THE BEST COURSE I HAVE TAKEN AT YALE. It has completely changed the way I view the world. You MUST take this class. You will read some of the best books, look at some of the best art, and learn from the most diverse group of Yalies you could be in a classroom with. This course has been truly a gift.",
    "This is an excellent class-do take it! The readings are fantastic, the art is wonderful, professor Carby is a thoughtful, knowledgeable and caring professor. It was definitely among my favorite classes-and I've taken a lot of great classes! There is a lot of work--much less if you do the journals every week.",
    "A calculated approach to black art.",
    "Too much writing",
    "Take this class only if you are ready to dedicate yourself to this field of study. Although everyone comes into this class with different levels of familiarity with the material, our full attention and consideration was demanded at each moment in and out of class.",
    "This is a course that, in my opinion, should be offered every year and has been by far the best course that I've taken so far. Period. Although it is a lot of work, I can say without hesitation that it pays off in leaps and bounds. If offered again and this course isn't yet on one's list for shopping period, they should take a step back and seriously rethink their schedule. What I especially find so great about the course is that with it being heavily rooted in art, and everyone in class recognizes different aspects of each piece, the knowledge gained from each class discussion is so rich and meaningful that it's impossible not to be engaged and captivated by the course. I've already shared the works listed on the syllabus with my close friends who won't be able to take the course if offered again, so that they can look into the pieces on their own time because the material is THAT powerful.",
    "If you intensely care about the content of this course and are willing to deeply engage with the material, take Representing Black Women!!! Such a rewarding experience.",
    "Best. Class. Ever. Carby will change the way you view the world. We studied the most amazing Black female artists, poets and authors: Joscelyn Gardner, Kara Walker, Octavia Butler, Natasha Trethewey, and Carrie Mae Weems, just to name a few. Yet the class goes so far beyond the pieces and texts we were studying the pieces were used as a tool to frame and understand the place of the Black woman in the United States, historically and presently. The conversations in class were so deeply and beautifully analytic that they made my blood pressure rise. Im still not completely sure how it happened, but I know that the poetry I read and the paintings I observed this semester have changed my personal reality. There really arent words to describe what an amazing class this was if you ever get an opportunity to take it or anything with Carby, DO IT."
