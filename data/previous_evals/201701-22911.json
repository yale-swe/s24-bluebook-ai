    "What I enjoyed about this class is that it was very well-structured -- with the progression in time throughout the semester, it becomes very clear how the readings hang together, and what the general line of thought we are pursuing. However, the flip side of this approach is that once we focus too much on \"solving the dilemma problem\", we give less priority to fully understanding the tools that we draw on in solving the problem. And this is exactly what I do not like about this class -- some of the readings, especially the ones on epistemic dilemma, presuppose knowledge that students in this class do not necessarily have, if they have never taken an epistemology class, or have only taken one. And quite often the presupposed background knowledge is not fully explained in class either. Perhaps to help with learning, the instructor should flag clearly beforehand exactly what knowledge is presupposed in each week's discussion, so that students can try to fill in the gaps by themselves."
