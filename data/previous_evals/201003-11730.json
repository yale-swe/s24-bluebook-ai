   "comments": [
    "Very few lectures were interesting - most were delivered in a hard-to-follow fashion and the topics were not so great either. The course can be vastly improved by inviting higher caliber speakers.",
    "Great intro to a smattering of global health issues. The range in quality of speakers were pretty large, though - some were excellent, others were quite poor. In general though it was very interesting.",
    "n\/a",
    "The speakers seemed ill-informed to be speaking to the class, not because they weren't qualified, merely because it seemed that very few of them had a good idea of who their audience was.",
    "a poor introduction to global health. seemed like a random collection of information. there was no structure except for the global health module. would be better if the whole course was designed as modules.",
    "There were some amazing speakers, however the first two were not good (not including the intro night w\/Betsy Bradley).The module was ok, but the main speaker wasn't as engaging as we'd hoped.",
    "Good: not much workload, various topics within the subject.Bad: decide what module to discuss for the last four sessions at the beginning of the semester without asking for the students' opinion (survey was did to ask for opinions for the next semester). Specifically focus on some countries or certain diseases, which are necessary, but I expected more general introducation to get a bird view of global health.",
    "Most speakers not engaging, bad presenters",
    "Great lecturers!!!!",
    "Great introduction to a broad range of global health topics.",
    "The variety in the topics presented by the speakers each week was very interesting and kept my attention.",
    "The speakers were really hit or miss. They ranged from the Medical Director of PIH (who was WONDERFUL) to socially awkward graduate students slowly presenting results from a flawed summer research project.",
    "Enjoyed some of the lectures more than others; some were too technical but the practical ones were really interesting",
    "The speakers were overall very mediocre and boring.",
    "It was ok. The speakers were not always great but it ended on a bang with the last leacture.",
    "I think the last few seminars were useful, but the model needs to be improved. I am not certain I got anything out of it.",
    "The seminars are diverse and nice.However, the instructions of this course is quite confusing.",
    "It's a great seminar course, not too much work outside of the classroom and incredible guest speakers with very interesting subjects.",
    "This is a good seminar, but the speakers varied in quality. I took it because I had to, and would probably only chosen to go to a few otherwise. The module was not interesting and the teamwork was too much for a Monday night - especially since they expected us to meet outside class with people from many different schools on campus. It didn't happen - we just emailed.",
    "I really enjoyed the seminar. There were some really great speakers that were brought in and I think it was a nice supplement in helping me think about issues in global health.",
    "Some of the lectures were not as exciting as I had hoped for. Others were very good. This seminar is difficult to assess because there was such a large discrepancy between the quality of each speaker.",
    "Some of the guest speakers had interesting projects and experiences, yet the presentation could be enhanced so that it was more engaging for the students.",
    "N\/A",
    "Please get people who will talk about their work and not methodology or techniques or principles. All those things we can learn in classes, but the great thing about seminar series is that we get to hear about people's research that we could never learn about in that detail from a class. The lectures in this class should always be research-based, and never about principles or methodology.Additionally, the module was really bad. I learned very little and the group activity was like pulling teeth because it was very unstructured and not well thought-out.",
    "Strengths: Gathering professors and students is powerfulWeaknesses: More interaction between researchers and students; FEWER VECTOR BORN PEOPLE; invite people other than co-collaborators; make the seminar more student focussed, rather than \"oh, hey we invited some students, too...they are in the back of the room\"",
    "Great speakers who covered various topics.",
    "There were a few marginal presenters who were less than engaging, but for the most part I found this seminar to be very informational and interesting.",
    "The strenths were the variety of speakers and the topics.",
    "A decent seminar course and an attempt was made to cover a decent range of global issues in the semester.",
    "Good course when there are good speakers",
    "I loved this course - I think it realy teaches you the fundamentals and I feel confident about the material"

    "Instructor: Michael Skonieczny \u00a0Weakness: Please do not require us to do modules. They seen very disjoined from the class description and listening to speakers about the same topic (in general) becomes redundant.",

    "Instructor: Michael Skonieczny \u00a0Dr. Dubrow was an excellent instructor. Initially I found his teaching style rather dry- but slowly I grew to really appreciate it. He is thorough, he pays attention to student demands and tries to accomodate them. His notes are excellent - you really dont need a book!But I think his best strength is his assessments. Though many consider them hard - I think his exams are some of the best exams I have ever taken. They make you think - and you really feel challenged as a graduate student. I do sometimes wish there were less multiple choice questions and more questions that required you to explain and apply concepts in a different manner - perhaps something closer to the questions we get in our homeworks.Overall, it was an excellent class."

   "comments": [
    "I would not recommend this course highly, but it is a requirement for the global health concentration and some of the lectures were very interesting. Hopefully by inviting better speakers, the course will be improved in the future.The dinners provided were an excellent touch because (1) the students are hungry by that time and (2) they provided a great forum for interaction between public health students, medical students and other attendees, which was fun.",
    "Yes, highlights a range of topics in global health, appeals to various types of health professional students. It was an interesting, low-commitment addition to my schedule.",
    "Yes, it's pretty interesting.",
    "I would recommend it to students. It's a great way to expand your knowledge of global health, and explore new areas of expertise.",
    "Not so much workload. Dinner provided. Various topics, but some of them you may don't have interest in",
    "Horrible lecture series; often felt like a waste of time",
    "Loved this seminar.",
    "Go to lecture, listen, eat dinner. Repeat every week.",
    "This course invites speakers involved in global health to come speak to students. It presents a wide variety of topics in global health and provokes thoughts regarding how we can be involved in the future of global health.",
    "Sometimes interesting, sometimes not. It's a good way to get a free diner but isn't always worth sitting for 2 hours listening to the speaker.",
    "The course illustrated the broad scope of research and issues in global health but not all lectures were accessible",
    "I would recommend some of the seminar, but maybe not taking the entire course. I would say to pick and choose the ones you have an interest in. However, it was interesting to learn about things I was unfamiliar with.",
    "I won't recommend it to any one because they can choose which seminar they want to listen to based on their our interests.There is no benefit for you sitting down and listening to every seminar if you are not that into them.",
    "It's a great seminar course that occasionally comes with an edible dinner. It's helpful to think about research projects with, and meet and network with faculty from the university and other universities. The lectures were almost all really great.",
    "Some interesting speakers come through, but quality varies. If you don't need to take it, but are still interested in Global Health, just read the speaker's bio before the talk and decide if you're interested. Don't attend module.",
    "The course consists of weekly lectures by those engaged in global health work. You listen to them present their work and are free to ask questions and discuss with peers. I highly recommend it and think its an awesome way to help us gain a better understanding of what is being done in public health globally.",
    "Interesting topics presented during the seminar, yet some presentation are dry and drawn out, while some have been very engaging and interesting.",
    "N\/A",
    "N\/A",
    "I would recommend this seminar to anyone interested in global health because it expands the horizons of any one interest and presents many amazing ideas and studies.",
    "Yes I would recommend it.",
    "A requirement for the global health concentration or track and for those who liked mental health this past semester it worked well.",
    "Good course if you can go to only the lectures that interest you. Great course when there are good speakers",
    "Yes! Good learning, and it will challenge you to think."
