    "I definitely became much better at Italian in a way that didn't seem hard or like actual work. My listening and translation skills improved significantly.",
    "Though my grammar did not significantly improve, I became a better speaker and listener, which is arguably more important.",
    "This class was a good way to keep up my Italian in a fun and relaxed environment. I got better at developing more complex sentences and actually having to respond to questions thoughtfully in Italian on the spot. My listening skills also improved through the subtitle translation work we conducted.",
    "I improved my Italian speaking, listening and writing skills.",
    "I developed my conversational Italian skills."

    "This class is very engaging. Be it through translating old operas or adding subtitles to Italian film or talking to Michael about life, this class was always the highlight of my day, something to look forward to.",
    "The strength is Michael as a professor because he conducts the class in a way that is the best when trying to learn a new language- structured around small talk, answering questions, story writing, etc. I think that it could have been more structured, however, because we just got told what the assignments were in emails on a weekly basis and didn't really follow anything directly. It was a bit slow for me- I felt that the material we covered could have been covered in 1\/2 the semester.",
    "Very chill and fun class, could be a bit more structured.",
    "Michael created a great community of scholarship and made me feel comfortable participating and experimenting."

    "100% take this course, the level of italian necessary to go by is not easy, but if you feel comfortable enough with the language it is a great way to improve it even more.",
    "100%. If you love Italian or Italy, take this course. It's fun, not too much work, and you'll learn in the end, too. It's a good time.",
    "Yes- would make a great 5th or even 6th class. Great way to develop your Italian in a comfortable environment with an inviting teacher. I only wish that we had stuck to a strict syllabus though because we could have gone through a lot more material. It usually took us a very long time to translate a reading or write a story because there were no expectations about how long it should take us to do. It would have been nice to have a review of grammar every so often in class too as I think that my sentence structure could have improved more. Not everyone in the class is at the same level (some were native speakers) and it was frustrating to not remember a tense and be able to answer a question well on the spot. Overall good class!",
    "Yes, very fun and chill!",
    "Yes! In L5, you will both improve your language skills and enjoy a small group that will inevitably become tight knit through the semester. Michael is amazing."
