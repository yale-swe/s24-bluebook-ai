    "TAKE IT WITH THOMAS HILLE. HE IS JUST AS GOOD AS MIKI.",
    "I learned to work through concepts to find paths to answers through several methods.",
    "Gained knowledge of multivariable calculus. The class was especially useful to me because I was taking Physics 260 concurrently, which relied heavily on the material I was learning in Math 120.",
    "I saw applications of calculus to the real world, and I learned to think about functions in more than one dimension.",
    "This course went beyond the introduction to multivariable calculus my former school had to offer. I learned how to practice complex topics in a constrained time period, and improved my study habits.",
    "I became much more comfortable with working in 3 dimensions, and I gained a stronger knowledge and appreciation of calculus by extending it to multiple variables.",
    "I developed various techniques to solve problems in multivariable calculus.",
    "I learned how to apply different problem-solving skills depending on the scenario. I also learned about thinking in three dimensions and developing my spatial awareness."

   "comments": [
    "Last semester I took it with a different teacher and failed. This semester I am taking it with Thomas Hille and am probably going to get an A. This course is not taught very well and is definitely taught too fast. For those of us who didn't take this class in high school, it is a struggle even after taking Math 115. Most of us drop out and do not try taking it again, but I enjoy the material and wanted to learn math 120 so I am one of the few who stayed.",
    "Math 120 is difficult conceptually, and it would benefit from spending more time on examples and practicing methods rather than long descriptions of their derivations.",
    "My strength is in my ability to intuitively understand problems and 3-dimensional space. My weakness is in my algebra skills and my habit for making small mistakes in my calculations.",
    "The course covers difficult material and moves quickly, and without a solid foundation of some concepts, it is hard to integrate everything together. Giving students a better picture of how things connect might help make it easier to understand the class. For example, by the end of the course, we know several different ways to calculate line integrals. Giving students an overview of when to use what method could help with overall understanding.",
    "The strength of this course was the reasonable amount of work that was assigned on a weekly basis, that led to a fair understanding of the course material covered.",
    "Strengths: Participation was highly encouraged; there was good focus on conceptual understanding; office hours were frequent and easily accessible; and homework was very useful for enhancing conceptual understandings. Weaknesses: I would have enjoyed having more practice problems to work with, especially when it came to more difficult concepts like extensions of Green's Theorem.",
    "The strengths of this course are that most of the material that shows up on exams is covered in class. The weaknesses of this course are that there seems to be a difference in teaching in each of the sections, and also the course moves at a significantly faster pace in the second half of the class but without much forewarning. The class could be improved if more time were spent on later concepts."

   "comments": [
    "This class wouldn't be the first one I recommended to a peer, but it certainly is manageable.",
    "This class should only be taken if you need it to fulfill your major",
    "No, unless you absolutely need this as a prereq.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone who is interested in pursuing math or physics. I wouldn't exactly recommend it to my humanities friends who are looking for easy QR credits.",
    "I would recommend this class to students who enjoy higher level math and\/or physics applications. For students looking to just get a math credit, taking a lower level math class might be a better use of their time. Math 120 is difficult and complicated, and for students who will not need rigorous calculus in the future, it can sometimes seem overly abstract or unnecessary.",
    "This is a good class for students who have already taken a BC calc and\/or multivariable calculus class in high school.",
    "Yes; it is a great introduction to math at Yale and very useful for those who wish to strengthen their knowledge of calculus.",
    "Yes I would recommend this, especially if you do not have any background in multivariable calculus like I did, because I noticed that certain concepts can be seen in other fields like physics and economics.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student only if they were willing to spend a lot time with the material on their own terms. The instructors do provide a lot of outside-of-class-time to help with the material, but the student has to seek out these opportunities."
