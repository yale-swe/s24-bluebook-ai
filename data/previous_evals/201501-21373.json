   "comments": [
    "I would probably tell them that the course is taught from a sociological viewpoint and introduces you to a variety of useful regression models that you will see in most quantitative social science journals. While you won't necessarily learn how to do your own quantitative research, the course definitely equips you to understand academic journals that use many of these regression models. It empowers you to read, understand, and interpret them on your own.",
    "I would highly recommend this class to other students. It teaches basic quantitative methods and how to read and evaluate quantitative articles.",
    "I said a bunch of this before. But this is a *fantastic* course and if you have the opportunity to take this or anything else with Vida Maralani, you should definitely do it. You learn a range of methodological tools and approaches, as well as their strengths and weaknesses, such that you come away a much more sophisticated consumer of empirical social science literature and with a strong foundation to pursue more training to do your own empirical work. I also found that the class tied together methodological choices and substantive, sociological thinking in a sophisticated way that made me a better thinker and, I hope, researcher. I can't recommend the course or professor highly enough -- they're some of the very best Yale has to offer.",
    "I would definitely recommend SOCY 581 to another student (even for those who are not required to take it)! The course provides a comprehensive overview of mainstream quant. methods in sociology, and the social sciences more broadly, and can be applied in reading academic articles as well as implementing quantitative research projects.",
    "Take for those who need to understand basic quant models for research. Doesn't seem as useful in preparing students to actually apply these models to own research because material is very basic.",
    "I would say \"If you want to get familiar with basic statistical approaches in the social sciences and be able to say 'yay!' when you look at a quantitative paper, go for it.\"",
    "Building on OLS modeling from the first semester to understand a wider variety of statistical models employed in quantitative sociology. I would recommend this class to another student because it covers an array of foundational models in a straightforward and comprehensible manner, and could serve as a useful primer for a higher level statistics course (I would imagine).",
    "It is a class that will teach an individual the basics of quantitative data analysis, and put you in a position to read sociology more broadly. I would not recommend this class to anyone who would want to learn how to analyze quantitative data. For that, I would suggest that individual seek out another class.",
    "A great course if you want to hold a solid understanding in the statistical models used for sociological research. It is focused on being able to read academic presentations of research and learning quantitative details of certain models. The models are also explained through their qualitative measures and typical uses. It is difficult if you do not have a firm understanding of both STATA or if you cannot provide detailed, sociological explanations of the data that you find. Ultimately, this course is what you make of it in terms of how much you try to understand the models both in construction and use. The professor is also very open to clarifying any issues that come about when doing the coursework, so as long as you go to her and the teaching fellow for the help, you should be on a good track.",
    "I recommende this course, in particular, to the students who trains statistical analysis using sociological data. The course could give us the way to analysis sociological data. Thus, the sociological students having the basic mathmatical knowledge are the most appropriate."

   "comments": [
    "While I don't plan to do much quantitative analysis for my own dissertation research, I definitely have gained a deeper appreciation for quantitative analysis within sociology. Typically sociologists are so sharply divided by quantitative and qualitative methods, but I feel the way that Vida taught the course, I could see a clear synergy between the two. I definitely felt like learning quantitative methods was a good exercise for sharpening my skills in inductive rather than deductive reasoning. I also appreciate that much of quantitative reasoning requires a different kind of creativity when it comes to interpreting the quantitative results you see in your data.",
    "This class, and Vida's help and guidance, is the linchpin in preparing me to make crucial decisions about my direction for my dissertation and for my career in my discipline.",
    "Please see my other responses as well. I thought that this course both gave me tools to be a better consumer of empirical social science research and gave me strong foundations to move towards doing my own empirical work. I also found that Vida contextualized the methods and sorts of papers we read within the social sciences really helpfully - which helped me situate my own interests and work and has helped me in formulating my research agenda. I'm certain the skills I built here will contribute to my own research. They already have - I've seen a significant difference in my facility, ability, and confidence analyzing empirical papers. All of which is tremendously valuable both practically to the projects I'm working on now and, I think, to my growth as a researcher and scholar.",
    "This course definitely deepened my knowledge of my discipline. Vida made sure to share standards and norms in quantitative sociology, which was really helpful in developing a base and understanding of what it means to be a professional sociologist who works on quantitative methods. To the extent I use quantitative methods in my dissertation\/research, I am confident that this course will prove to be incredibly helpful.",
    "Helpful in that reading journal articles now, most models are more or less understandable to me. Need a follow-up class that goes more in depth to the real applications of these models.",
    "It helped me greatly to get familiar with basics of quantitative sociology.",
    "I learned that there is much more to modeling than OLS, and models that would actually be more applicable to my research interests. Predicting the probability of binary and ordinal outcomes is a skill I found particularly useful. And learning some basic statistical approaches to adjusting for the lack of random variation in a study also makes me much less pessimistic about the validity of quantitative claims. It contributed to my research in that it made me certain that I would like to do some quantitative work in the future - even though I definitely need to practice...",
    "It allowed for me to read more broadly in the discipline, which is a positive thing. It will have an impact on my dissertation and research insofar as it helped me think through questions in a more systematic way.",
    "The statistical methods I learned in the class is definitely useful to proceed my study."
