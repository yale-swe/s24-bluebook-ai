    "The trips were very well organized. The TA gave great feedback about the process flows.",
    "The trips are excellent complement to class experiences.",
    "Seeing how things work behind the scene and being able to ask questions directly to the workers.",
    "The field trips were great in this class. We went to a variety of factories and industrial plants and got to see their work in action. The class was very well-organized by Andrew, Erik, and JooYoung.",
    "Cool field trips.",
    "Going out to the industrial facilities.",

   "comments": [
    "Perhaps, it would be beneficial to show a good process flow for each trip at the end, so that the students could use it to compare it to their own.",
    "Perhaps a little more variety in the types of facilities visited? One or two more like the printing press? Another way to think about capturing additional range could be to survey what kinds of trips other SIGs offer and if it's worth incorporating one or more into this class. SIG leaders could even be asked to provide locale and contact ideas so TAs and instructor's contacts aren't the sole source in need of leveraging.",
    "The only thing I would recommend is that we review everyone's factory recommendations after each field trip. It would be helpful to hear other people's thoughts on how each factory could improve in efficiency and in this way I would learn more about how companies can improve in their sustainability. It would also be helpful if the TAs showed us a correct flow diagram after we hand ours in, just to see the correct way to do it.",
    "The exercise of making flow diagrams feels like its more about making a pretty picture than it is about learning the process. It would be nice to have less flow diagrams and ad in some other types of activities for the field trip responses."

    "I think this is a great class for people in the industrial ecology field. It's great to have hands-on experience looking at how factories run. I definitely believe it should be repeated. Perhaps, it could be beneficial to limit the types of factories to a topic each semester. For instance, one semester could be \"waste and recycling facilities\". This would be beneficial because then students would have a sense of the range of methods and technologies used in that industry - how different facilities are.",
    "This course was a great hands-on class and fit well into my program which focuses on corporate sustainability and environmental management for businesses. This allowed us to get out in the field and see companies in action, producing metal products, electrical circuits, distributing products (Staples) and others. It was great to have the tours led by the company members themselves and to hear what they're doing to be efficient. It really helped to put all of our academic learning into the real world.",
    "It's a great way for industrial ecology students to get a firsthand look at industrial processes.",

    "yes"

It gives you an on-the-ground perspective of how manufacturing works, what companies are doing to be efficient, and how to make recommendations for their improvement of efficiency. It makes for early Friday mornings, but it's absolutely worth it!",
    "The fieldtrips are really cool. The follow-up assignments (at least the flow diagram part) feel like busywork though.",
    "It takes a lot of your time, but its worthed if you like industrial ecology.",
    "take it ! this kind of opportunity to see business operations from various industry is vary rare. take advantage of it."
