    "You likely have to take it for the MechE major, but it's a fun hands-on class. The best engineering classes are the ones where you get to build things, and the entire semester is focuses around one big project. Just be proactive in making progress early in the semester, because once fall break hits the amount of time you have to finish everything starts to fly by.",
    "ABET Required. It can be a great experience, just be sure to pick a good project, keep up, work hard, identify strengths in yourself and your teammates, and then it will still take over your life, but at least you'll enjoy it.",
    "It's really very simple. If you have to take this class there's no need to read these and if you don't, don't take it. Unless of course you feel extremely prepared and willing to devote a massive amount of time. This class highlights Yale Engineering's weaknesses.",
    "Great course, but a ton of work. All of my other classes were really easy and I found that this course demanded a lot of my time. Really fulfilling because you get to make whatever your team decides to make.",
    "I definitely recommend this class, but I wouldn't take it at the same time as another big project-based class because you're going to want to devote a lot of time to it.",
    "While I did not enjoy MENG 489 for the most part, I dont regret taking it because I learned a ton. I only wish it hadnt been so unpleasant because it has the potential to be amazing. This is the only course in Yales MENG curriculum where you will do real, full-on engineering and learn what it means to be a mechanical engineer. I think I am a much better engineer now for having taken this course. By the only coursewhere you will do real, full-on engineering, I mean the following. I took MENG 491 before this and, dont get me wrong, it was one of my favorite classes ever. 491 taught me how to think about opportunity spaces in design, but in terms of what we actually built, it didnt require a high level of engineering knowledge. MENG 489, on the other hand, sucks at opportunity spaces, but really puts all of your engineering skills to the test. You design some serious equipment in this course, and that is invaluable in an engineering curriculum. 489 shows you what the difference is between hobbyists and engineers, and it expects you to be an engineer. The sad thing is that this course is the only such course in Yales curriculum. Before I took 489, I didnt know what a bearing was. That that is an appalling thing for a 4th-year MENG major to have to say. The MENG curriculum should have at least one course before senior year (preferably both sophomore and junior years) where students learn about ACTUAL MECHANICAL DESIGN. As it was, I felt like I had so much catching up to do (and Im still not caught up) about things like gears, bearings, etc., and I know that Im not alone. It makes no sense to ask students to design complicated machines when they havent ever seen a set screw before; they should be introduced to common mechanical elements during freshman or sophomore year. We ended up getting by learning things on the fly, but it would have been a lot better if we had had a solid foundation in mechanical design before embarking on our senior year capstone course. On top of that, the course suffered from other serious problems. I will try to be brief in enumerating them since I just went on a big rant above. During September and October, there were so many busy-work assignments that by the time we finished those we hardly had time to work on our actual project. I understood the teaching objectives for these assignments, but it would have been nice to make them such that they helped us along with our projects while we did them instead of being ancillary and distracting us from the design process. I did not feel like the project my team came up with ever had a chance of becoming useful or marketable. Your experience of the course is heavily influenced by who your teammates are. You get no choice about whos on your team, and unfortunately, a lot of the people taking this class are not very motivated or good at project management. Also, it was a bummer that a lot of people were applying to consulting jobs and didnt seem that interested in engineering anymore, but were just taking the course to finish the major. I suppose its the problem with a course that students are required to take as opposed to (again, thinking of MENG 491) a course where everyone really wants to be there and is excited and motivated. I would say that my teams lack of motivation was the source of most of my frustration with the course while I was in it. So, to summarize: this course will teach you a lot, but it may be a pretty disheartening and frustrating experience while youre in it. Stick it out, and what you learn will help you in more fulfilling projects in the future. But hey, maybe the MENG department will have really stepped up the way they teach the course next year. I hope so. It definitely has the potential to be good, but if the implementation is poor, it can be very unpleasant.",
    "Definitely take one of the design classes before you graduate. Medical devices seems to be much more organized but this course is cool because each team gets to choose their own project. Make sure to spend a lot of time and effort to come up with a manageable and interesting project since you will be working pretty hard throughout the semester. Try to do a lot of the legwork at the beginning so you won't be fighting to the finish. Great teaching team!",
    "Awesome class. If you became an engineer to invent, solve problems, and learn how to do those things in the real world, you'll love MENG 489. Note that this is a project-based class, and the work may (and probably should) dominate your schedule."
