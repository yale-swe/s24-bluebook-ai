   "comments": [
    "I would recommend it. The material was a little more theoretical than I had hoped, and discussions sometimes went off on tangents, but the readings were always interesting and the weekly responses were good to help understand them.",
    "Absolutely. This course completely changed how I view development projects, the work of environmental NGOs, and my perspective on how \"development\" should be implemented.",
    "It was great. It's not too too much in class discussion. More summaries of the readings and then bouncing off of that a little bit. The workload's not bad at all. Just find a fun final paper topic and you're golden!",
    "This is a great class! It will really teach you to read carefully, and to think critically about the things you are reading. Carol is fantastic. The class provides a lot of really important theory for other environmental anthro applications. I think this theory is important for many fields, though.",
    "take this class if you are really really interested in theory and can bs your way through a seminar; otherwise, there are more interesting ways to learn about culture",
    "The class has really interesting subject matter, but approaches it in a dry way, doing an intellectual history of environmental anthropologists. Could be better.",
    "Environmental Anthropology is a course about the history of ideas - how humans relate to environments, how we conceive of \"natural\" disasters, how agriculture affects ecosystems, how much we can really ever know about the world, etc. It's simply a terrific course. Carol Carpenter and Michael Dove, who co-wrote the main text, switch off who teaches it each year, so I can attest to the fact that Carol at least is an excellent professor. Definitely go to office hours. The reading takes a long time to do when you're getting used to it, but most of the pieces are fascinating. Take this class!",
    "A thorough introduction to the field of Environmental Anthropology. Wholly theoretical, discussions in class utilize real-world examples to fortify philosophical positions.",
    "Take this course if you are looking for an upper level cultural anthro seminar. Non-anthro majors interested in the environment could also learn a lot about the course.Very logical course structure, reasonable weekly requirements (do the reading, write theses for each of the papers). And then a final extended research term paper that took a fair amount of time.Professor Carpenter is a kind, knowledgeable professor, though she can dominate seminar discussions.",
    "This is the best course I have taken so far at Yale. It is a theory course that is followable. It has changed my perception of everything. Professor Carpenter is sensitive and brilliant. Her commentary before discussions and her responses to questions blew my mind. The reading responses she requires demand real engagement, which is endlessly rewarding. She is very available for office hours and offers reliably incredible insight.",
    "mehh, take it if you need an environmental\/ ecological anthro class or have literally read nothing on the subject; however, the ideas thrown around aren't that revolutionary and some of the assignments are a little tedious."
