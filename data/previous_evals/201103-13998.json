    "This was a good course if you're interested in international relations from a monetary policy perspective. Not much about fiscal policy, and very Latin American-centric. Work load was light",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. You will learn a lot about international macroeconomics and current affairs.",
    "I would strongly recommend the course to other students",
    "Yes I would recommend the course to another student. I would suggest it for students who have taken economics before and are looking for a less theory based course.",
    "A good course for both the econ novice and expert. Builds on fundamental macroeconomics and real-to the date applications."
