   "comments": [
    "Take it if you are really interested in the social history of London. This isn't just a run down of important events in London's past, but rather a look into what it was like to live in London during this time.",
    "This was a fantastic and enlightening study of the demography of early modern London. The only reason not to take this class is if you are primarily interested in political history.",
    "If you have any interest in the subject (Early Modern London is not everyone's cup of tea) or want to really learn how to engage with primary sources, this is the seminar for you. Keith Wrightson is wonderful. A very kind professor who is brilliant. I will say that if you have no interest in London, this class will drag like no other. But I found that material from this class helped me understand the poetry from this time period much better (I'm an English major), so I would recommend the class also for non-history majors who are interested in England during this time period.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. This covered a lot of material that would be important for anyone interested in London (and England in general).",
    "It was good, not great. I was not very familiar with the material, but very interested in urban studies, and in that sense there was a lot of good material, but our discussions were not very valuable, in my opinion. The readings could be evaluated to make sure they are all relevant.Wrightson is really awesome, knows literally everything about early modern England, maybe taking his lecture would be a better experience, though.Lots of reading, but not a heavy workload aside from that.",
    "The early modern period is not my favorite in history, but nonetheless I enjoyed this class. The classroom atmosphere was relaxed, and I feel like I've come out of the class knowing something about the social climate of early modern London. Be warned that the course packet is quite fat, though, and that a great deal of the early readings are about demographics. But that shouldn't stop you from considering the class.",
    "London: 1560-1760 is a fantastic, imaginative class. The other reviews probably mention that the first two weeks are dull; they deal with statistics of mortality and growth, etc, but this sets the stage for a very enriching immersion into a colorful period. Professor Wrightson is simply a giant in his field. He navigates you through London with a sense of mystery, wonder and humor. He is also very kind and has calming effect on his class. Did I mention the final paper is only 10 pages?",
    "London with a focus on social history and criminal records. Not much context, very much about the culture, not politics of the period."
