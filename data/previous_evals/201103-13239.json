    "The beginning of the course lacked direction and organization. There was no book because it was still being printed. The professor is the author of the book so most students thought he would give us an electronic copy of the book so we wouldn't fall behind in class. Did this happen? No. Rather, we wasted nearly 4 weeks of class time before the book was made available and when it was ready to be purchased, the instructor did not have enough copies for the class. His reason - \"I don't know how many people are enrolled in the course so I didn't know how much to buy.\"When we finally got copies of the book, the required coursework was typical compared to similar classes. However, the last 3 weeks of class, the professor announced that he would be assigning 4 homework assignments for the semester with the last 2 due the last 2 weeks of class. There was nothing in the syllabus about homework or how much we would be required to do during the semester so this was a surprise to the entire class."

   "comments": [
    "This course offered a thorough review of epidemiologic concepts and methods, as well as an overview of topics relating to the health effects of physical and chemical agents and air pollution. The course provided an opportunity to consider the practical aspects of epidemiology and as such was a good supplement to the introductory Epi courses offered as part of the CORE curriculum.The homework assignments which provided an opportunity to critique articles were a strength of the course and were pertinent to the types of \"assignments\" that would be necessary in a work environment. It allowed students to integrate and apply all of their knowledge rather than having to answer a list of questions provided by the instructor.One limitation is that I would have liked to see greater emphasis on the topic-based lectures during the second half of the course, rather than the focus on fundamentals in the first half. As such, I think Epi1 should be a pre-req for this course so that there is less overlap, particularly for EHS students who take both.",
    "The course should really be titled \"Cancer Epidemiology\", because that si really what we discuss most. I think this would be a fine course if it were titled Cancer Epidemiology, and you would know exactly what you're doing. I'm unsure why EHS students are required to take this course as well as Epi I and Epi II. We simply repeat what we have already learned numerous times, by the time we are finished with the first year we have all of the fundamentals of epidemiology, and we don't need a review class to go over them. This should be an optional course for people interested in doing cancer research or working with NCI, and maybe instead of a final you could write some kind of grant proposal or study research proposal for NCI and use this class to get ready for research or a summer internship. It was not particularly helpful, even though the professor is a very good lecturer and a generally nice guy.",
    "I don't really know what I learned in this class, I think not much.",
    "good course overallbut could be more organized and structured",
    "This was one of the most enjoyable classes I've taken at YSPH. As a non-EHS student, I really enjoyed learning about the subject, and it was a great intro into the field for someone who was unfamiliar with the material.",
    "This class is a joke. We have a syllabus--just for show. We have powerpoint presentations 3 years old. We have homework assignments with no instructions because we're \"supposed to know\" what to do. The tests are comprised of material that was covered for 5 minutes in class. Two days before the final, the professor posted slide shows for us to learn--and then tested them heavily on the final. The professor doesn't want to teach, and he does not respect the students. This class is required yet it's a joke and I didn't learn anything that I hadn't already learned in epi 1 or epi 2.",
    "Strengths: A wonderful instructor with a verve for environmental epi and an ability to convey its most fundamental principles to students that are second to none.Weakness: Dr. Zheng focuses on specific subjects for too long. I think this is a result of a mismatch between his teaching style and our learning style: students are wont to abstain from participating verbally in class, which Dr. Zheng (I think) mistakes for us not understanding or following-along. Wanting to truly teach his students (a wonderful quality), he goes over (and over) whichever topics he feels we don't comprehend until he is satisfied (or exasperated) with our apparent level of understanding. This leaves little room for review of more-nuanced aspects of Environmental Epidemiology.This is a really great class, but I would love to see a faster-paced, more detailed curriculum.",
    "This was a pointless class. For the first 2\/3 of the semester, we covered basic epi principles that were already covered in the first-year Epi course, which were not at all specific to environmental epidemiology. Furthermore, the way Tong presents the material is unclear and confusing, and he contradicts what we have previously learned. The last 1\/3 of the semester was more focused on environmental epi, but I didn't learn anything given that the presentations were fragmented and difficult to follow. I learned almost nothing in this class. The midterm, final, and homework assignments (4 paper critiques) were a joke. Nobody understood what the questions were asking (they were in fragmented English), but nobody got below a 90 either. Barely any feedback was given on our work throughout the semester.",
    "A thorough and comprehensive introduction to Environmental Epi, even for those who haven't taken Epi before. The first part of the course lays out the principles of study design, exposure assessment and results interpretation. The second half of the course applies this knowledge to real studies as presented in class by the scientists designing and conducting those studies. This must be the best way to understand the practice of epidemiology -- and provides a rich opportunity to pose questions to key figures in the field.",
    "There are no strengths to speak of in this course, only weaknesses. This class needs to put a more practical perspective on environmental epidemiology. The professor spent 5 weeks on one topic and did not seem prepared most of the time for his lectures. This lack of effort was extremely disrespectful to students who chose to attend the school to learn something substantive. The course is representative of the lack of caliber of some of the courses offered at YSPH and it stems from a lack of effort, care and enthusiasm from professors."

   "comments": [
    "Instructor: Tongzhang Zheng \u00a0Very good. Dr. Zheng has years of experience designing\/conducting epidemiologic studies and was able to articulate the practical issues relevant to these topics throughout the course. Good feedback was given on the homework assignments. Lecture material was presented in a well-organized manner.",
    "Instructor: Tongzhang Zheng \u00a0The professor is very personable, funny, and a good lecturer. He is probably one of the better lecturers in the school of public health, and I think this would be a great course for people interested in cancer research, however I think that this interested people in CDE more than current EHS students.",
    "Instructor: Tongzhang Zheng \u00a0Really funny nice guy.",
    "Instructor: Tongzhang Zheng \u00a0good teaching strategies",
    "Instructor: Tongzhang Zheng \u00a0Dr. Zheng is a great instructor-- his enthusiasm for the subject motivated all students to do well and participate in class. He also encouraged students to look at material from different angles, and thus made each class interesting. He is a very engaging lecturer and I would recommend this class to EHS and non-EHS students.",
    "Instructor: Tongzhang Zheng \u00a0Tong is disconnected from his students. He thinks we're all happy and learning well, but we're not. He's also unprepared for class everyday. He'll post his slides 10 minutes before class with typos or just pictures (my favorites) and then ask us why we didn't review the slides before class. (Maybe because we were walking to class when you posted them?) It's clear that he has no regard for his students, or he's just scatter-brained. Forexample, at the beginning of class he told us we needed to buy his book for the class. The book wasn't available for 3 weeks. When it finally was available, he only ordered 10 copies (for a class with at least 15 people) and gave us the price in Euros. Then, when we asked what chapters corresponded with his lectures he responded \"read the whole book.\" His behavior makes me feel like he is dismissive of students, and that he does not care about teaching. It made me angry to sit through his random lectures every week. A complete waste of time when I could have been taking other classes and learning more.Another example of Tong not wanting to teach: when we asked him if he meant to schedule two classes during reading week, he responded:\"Oh that's reading week, great, then I don't have to teach!\" I think \"I don't have to teach\" sums up just about everything I need to say about this class.One more thing: we have 4 homework assignments for this class. When we asked him when they were due, Tong said \"Whenever\"...just another example of his dismissing student work or not really wanting to be a part of teaching. I could go on, but I think the rest of my class will supplement anything I missed.",
    "Instructor: Tongzhang Zheng \u00a0Dr. Zheng is a wonderful person and a wonderful professor. I highly recommend him.",
    "Instructor: Tongzhang Zheng \u00a0With his accent, he is difficult to understand. He provides the powerpoint slides 30 minutes before class starts. The powerpoints will have maybe 30 slides per lecture, but he spends approximately 45min of class time on one or two slides and never gets to the rest. So the lectures are not coherent or cohesive, and you come out of each class having learned almost nothing. His expectations for homework assignments were never clear, and he would not tell us when they were due, but then he would suddenly expect them by a certain day. The questions on the midterm and final were in fragmented English and difficult to comprehend.He is a nice, funny guy, and he encourages questions and student participation, but the bad outweighs the good.",
    "Instructor: Tongzhang Zheng \u00a0Prof. Zheng is warm and engaging. He really cares about the students' comprehension of the material and knows everyone by name. He is also funny and lighthearted which makes class fun. I never wanted to miss a class.",
    "Instructor: Tongzhang Zheng \u00a0Two words: Nut job. As stated in the previous question, the professor lacked care, effort and enthusiasm for this course. He seemed unprepared most of the time and talked just to waste time and even acknowledged that he didn't want to teach the course. Further, he is extremely difficult to understand and most of the class was spent trying to figure out what he was saying. He had a few guest lectures come in and didn't even show up to class on those days!"
