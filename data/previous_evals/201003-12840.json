   "comments": [
    "Pretty much a course on FDI; slight use of economic terms, so although intro econs are not required, they definitely streamline the conversation; I'd recommend it if you ever expect to go into business--one of the most business-oriented courses in undergrad",
    "Yes if you are interested about how MNCs actually work. Much better than a class about Ethics and MNCs.",
    "It's not a bad class. LaPalombara is a really nice, engaging professor. You learn a considerable amount about the way FDI works, but it does get a bit repetitive. Students design and do a simulation every week, and the same kind of themes and answers get recycled from week to week. Would be a better class if everyone did the reading.",
    "It would really depend on who the other students in the seminar are. Professor LaPalombara leads seminar for the first few weeks, but the rest of the time is spent with students presenting on the readings of the week. I thought most of the presentations led to interesting discussion, but if the group isn't as committed to staying on topic and really delving into the details of the week, it could get repetitive. Readings are definitely focused on one specific topic -- foreign direct investment. If you're not interested, you won't enjoy talking about it for eight weeks.",
    "Yes. Manageable amount of work. You need to do one presentation during the semester in a group that is easy to run.",
    "It is a very good course with not too much reading and a great professor. The in-class break out activities were informative and made me think about the issues from all perspectives.",
    "Absolutely. Any EPE student that is remotely interested should absolutely take this course - it applies directly to the interdisciplinary study of economic and political power and their ethical implications.",
    "This course focuses on the relationship between governments and multinational firms. You look at a lot of interesting case studies to highlight each class's theme. You are also expected to become a \"country expert\" and be able to present in front of the class about your topic. In particular, I would recommend it to students with an interest in business. In general, it's definitely worth taking if you want to do the work. Otherwise, you probably won't get much out of it.",
    "Global Firms& National Governments gives a very focused overview of foreign direct investment. It is refreshing to study something practical and to be able to have the in-class experience really inform your understanding of news that you can read about in real-time inthe NY Times, Wall Street Journal, Financial Times, etc. Professor LaPalombara is an expert in the field and has a wealth of experience to share. Additionally, he is very generous with his time and goes out of his way to meet with students outside of class.If you don't mind the specificity of the topic, then you should definitely look into this class as a great way to enhance your understanding of real-world politics and markets.",
    "Take it if at all possible."
