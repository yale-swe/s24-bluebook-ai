    "I slightly improved my grammar from L2 Italian.",
    "I increased my proficiency in speaking, reading, writing, and listening in Italian.",
    "Intermediate Italian building on the skills learned in L1 and L2. Similar grammar structures used in more complex ways.",
    "By taking this course, I continued to develop my knowledge of the Italian language and culture, particularly in terms of broadening my vocabulary, learning new grammar, experiencing different aspects of the Italian culture, and practicing speaking in Italian with my professor and peers.",
    "I didnt really develop many skills since we didnt learn new material, it was just review. We got a semester of practice speaking though, which is useful.",
    "This course is not very engaging because we don't cover very much new content. It is a review of all of the grammar and verb tenses we learned in the L1 and L2 coursework. The refresher and practice was nice, but there was an opportunity missed in that we essentially brushed through all of the new vocab presented in the text. We were never quizzed or tested on it and so there was no real incentive to incorporate it into our day-to-day speaking. The strengths of this class are that it is conversation based and that if you study the verbs, you will do well!",
    "Honing Italian grammar learned in L1 & L2.",
    "Reinforced a lot of the grammar from L1 and L2 with a lot of new vocab! This definitely helped me strengthen my use of the language."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "This course relies on students teaching themselves grammar from the textbook. The classes feel pointless, and sometimes irrelevant to the grammar that we are trying to learn. This is a stark change from L1 & L2 where the classes felt important and the grammar was explained and taught. At best the class is not engaging, and at worst miserable. A daily quiz on the homework from the night before would help retention and incentivize learning daily as opposed to strictly the night before the exams.",
    "The biggest strength of this class is the faculty, the professors are always engaged in teaching.",
    "I think the small sized classes and daily meeting times are key to learning a language. The workload was probably too heavy but assignments were helpful in learning the language",
    "Strengths - very interesting, engaging, understanding professors, lots of resources when in need of assistance weaknesses - sometimes struggled to reschedule make-up quizzes or exams when there was a conflict with sports\/extracurriculars, especially because this class meets 5 days a week",
    "A strength is that it still meets 5 days a week, so everyone is forced to get more comfortable speaking and interacting in Italian. Weaknesses are that no new material is learned, and there are several classes taken up with trips that arent particularly informative.",
    "Having some review in the syllabus for L3 was a nice refresher after the summer break. I did not anticipate that almost all of the curriculum for L3 would be review of the verb tenses and grammar, however. I wish we had spent time on the vocab (and even been tested on it!) because it would have allowed us to truly incorporate it into the language. It is a shame that the final exam focussed entirely on grammar, because we probably could have taken that same exam at the end of L2. I really appreciated the time spent discussing the European migrant and refugee crisis, especially in the context of films. I wish however that we had been provided with more concrete facts and an outline of the history of the crisis and Italy's involvement, because I fear that many of us walked away with a really negative, black and white view of what is really a very complicated issue. Doing independent research on 1 news article does not seem to do this topic justice. I think L3 could be a good time to spend the semester reviewing grammar, but also a good time to do in-depth analysis of Italian history, current events etc. This method might provide us incentive to really learn and use the new vocab presented in the text. Instead, we brushed over the new vocabulary entirely.",
    "Class meets every day, which is inconvenient but helpful for learning. Professor Iacovella is great.",
    "More interactive activities would be useful!"

   "comments": [
    "I wouldn't except for the fact that it is required that at least L3 language is completed, and it would be silly to start over in a second language.",
    "I would recommend this course because I have learned a lot and enjoy it thoroughly.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to another student because it has helped me to foster a greater appreciation for the Italian language and culture. My expanding my knowledge of a second language, I feel as though my Yale education is making me a more well-rounded student. Additionally, I made many kind friends in this class and genuinely had fun.",
    "I would, but only for fulfilling a language requirement. If youre looking to learn new material and engage deeply on topics, this class wont provide that.",
    "Italian is a beautiful language to learn and I generally recommend the department of Italian at Yale. The syllabus and organization and learning goals for L3 should be redesigned and reevaluated.",
    "Yes--Italian is a cool language and culture, and Professor Iacovella is great!",
    "Yes! I personally love the Italian language and think its very much worth learning!"
