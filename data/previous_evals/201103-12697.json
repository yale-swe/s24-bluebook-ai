   "comments": [
    "Takes you from cantus firmus through analyzing full movements. Major assignments include composing piano variations and a minuet and trio for string quartet. Minor assignments include daily homework that is collected and graded, which keeps you on track. Class is sometimes a little slow-moving, but I definitely learned a lot. Like AP Music Theory, but it goes a lot further.",
    "Taught either by a professor or T.A. Small class sizes. Composition, reading, listening assignments and part-writing worksheets. Expect to read two dense chapters per week. I would recommend this class to someone if they are interested in learning theory, although as an end goal, this class is not the most exciting. A plus was getting to have our compositions performed by a string quartet at the end of the semester.",
    "Take it I'd you want a solid background in classical music theory",
    "If you're looking to gain a stronger theoretical background for the sake of composition, this course gets the job done. But though you'll leave class with a greater sense of how harmonic progressions and voice-leading works--you'll know more about music--, you probably won't appreciate it more (as you would hopefully appreciate literature more after studying it), or have a good big picture sense of the classical style.",
    "Great, but the grading is super strict. And if you write your compositions like Haydn would actually compose, you'll get like a C.",
    "If you ever listened to classical music and wondered why it sounds so different to other styles, then this is the class to take. The analysis of classical music through use of roman numerals and music theory shows you how and why classical music sounds \"classical\". By the end of the course, one of things you will be able to do is come up with a chord progression that sounds like classical music.If you play classical music to a high level, this class will show you how the pieces you are playing work harmonically and structurally. Definitely take this class as the next step to deepening your appreciation of music!Note that the class does not cover any kind of modern music, pop, jazz etc it is strictly classical. Don't expect to this to be \"free\" composition, it is a class on \"model composition\" so you need to write in a specific style and do chordal techniques specific to classical music.",
    "Music Theory 210 is an introduction (albeit a fast-paced one) to the principles of four-part, mainly 18th century tonal harmony. The principles are practiced through various worksheet exercises, model compositions and in class group and partner assignments. I would definitely recommend this class to another student, particularly one who plays an instrument and already has a basis in music theory. The class is technical and very specific but it has informed and enriched my listening and playing of music.",
    "If you want to gain a deeper understanding of classical music theory or if you ever wanted to compose your own music in the classical style, PLEASE PLEASE take this course. I have such a greater appreciation for classical music now. Elizabeth Medina-Gray is an absolutely fantastic instructer. You will not find a warmer, more receptive individual nor a better teacher."
