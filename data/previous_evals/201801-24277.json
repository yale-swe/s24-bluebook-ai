    "This course opens the window to the world of peacekeeping! It was such a great, comprehensive, and professional introduction!",
    "At this point in my academic and professional career, I did not think I could learn much more about the UN but then came along Tony Banbury. This is the type of class that any global affairs major should take given how relevant to course material is.",
    "I learned so much about the UN. It was fantastic to learn from a highly experienced practitioner.",
    "Policy memo writing, situational analysis, great understanding of operations and relationship between DPA and DPKO, understanding of key UN Peacekeeping operations.",
    "I learnt a great deal more about peacekeeping missions, especially in Africa.",
    "The overall mission and limitation of the UNPKOs.",
    "I gained a thorough understanding of the logistical, operational, strategic and political aspects of UN peace operations. I grew my skills in conflict analysis and gained experience in the analysis and critique of bureaucratic structures and procedures.",
    "I learnt how to think like a policy maker, how to write policy memos but also about the challenges of the UN and power politics in general"

    "Class trip to the UN!",
    "Having someone like Tony giving the course is extremely important. Other people with a UN background would not have been able to do this course justice. In terms of weaknesses, there were some weeks in the middle when the topics were just REALLY boring. This is fine, but there should be some strategy to get people involved, like an activity.",
    "I thought the course was excellently structured and every assignment\/reading was thoughtfully selected. I really appreciated the UN trip Tony put together for the class. He is a fantastic resource for students.",
    "Weaknesses: started out slowly. Strengths: the professor. Banbury organized one of the best UN tattoos we'd ever had. Each speaker was high level, well prepared, deeply engaged.",
    "No weakness. The greatest and the most helpful class I have taken from my Yale education.",
    "The readings and discussion in this course were of a very high caliber. Assignments were similarly relevant and useful for comprehending and operationalizing course material. Some sessions might be made more engaging through breaking up longer discussions into segments, bringing in outside speakers, and conducting in-depth studies of one active peacekeeping operation.",
    "This course is perfect. I would not change anything"

    "Yes.",
    "Yes. If you are planning to work in the UN in the future, this is the class that you should take.",
    "Yes. The quality of discussion and Tony's class leadership made the class a fantastic deep-dive into one of the most important aspects of UN operations.",
    "Yes for anyone who considers a career in the UN or international organisations"
