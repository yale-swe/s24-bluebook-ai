    "Take it if you enjoy reading long Victorian novels and teasing them out in section, and listening to revelatory lectures from a Professor who rocks leather pants.",
    "I would absolutely recommend ENGL 265 to another student. I thoroughly enjoyed ENGL 265- from the brilliant reading list to the brilliant Professor Yeazell. The course does a great job of balancing the heaviness of the reading list with the thoughtfulness of the analysis (this is not exactly a class for those looking for light reading).",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. Even though it is a lot of reading, it is well worth the time spent and the readings are actually enjoyable - they don't feel like chores at all",
    "I would recommend this class for anyone who has an interest in reading Victorian novels, English major or not (my section actually had very few English majors). The reading load can be a lot, but the novels are fascinating and usually go by pretty quickly. Prof. Yeazell's lectures are great -- accessible but also insightful -- and I actually found section helpful and illuminating rather than annoying. Really enjoyed it! Middlemarch is phenomenal.",
    "I would absolutely recommend Victorian Literature to another student. Be prepared to work hard and earn a lot for your labor--this course is fun and fulfilling, an amazing learning opportunity and a great way to immerse yourself in classic works of literature.",
    "Victorian Novel is a fantastic class to take if you love to read, because so much of it is getting to read and deeply engage with some phenomenal pieces of literature. The novels are so much fun to read, the lectures are both insightful and delightful, and the \"work\" of reading the novels hardly feels like work at all.",
    "This is basically high school Brit Lit on steroids, without the Old English\/poetry stuff. The Victorian era probably was the height of the novel, and it shows in this class. Some of the books are better than others. In my opinion, the Bronte's are nothing compared to George Eliot or Dickens, but that is just me. There is a ridiculous amount of reading-physically impossible to do it all. With that being said, you do not have to do it all, you just have to do enough. Read Middlemarch in its entirety. That is the best book in the class, and it will change your life. The lectures are great and totally worthwhile. Yeazell is a beast in her little leather pants, and keeps it interesting all fifty minutes. This is a hard class, though. I think that on the first day my TA said \"Professor Yeazell is waging the war against grade inflation!\" EEEEEK. But anyway, don't take classes for the grade (if you're worried, just start it credit D). You will feel like you know these books, and Victorian Lit more generally, very well after the course. The final sucks though. Way too hard.",
    "An impressive amount of reading, but absolutely take this class if you love the Brontes or Dickens!",
    "Prof Yeazell is brilliant, the syllabus is excellent, and the lectures were a pleasure. A great way to cover some classic literature.",
    "The Victorian Novel was fab, def take it."
