   "comments": [
    "good",
    "I felt that the theory part of the lecture was beyond the scope of public health, but then again, I'm not really an ethics theory kind of person.",
    "I realize we have to take this course and this is probably the best way to do it, but it was not my favorite.",
    "completely useless; there was hardly any focus to this seminar",
    "This course is OK, but could improve from a more practical design. As an undergrad philosophy major, I was already familiar with\/interested in the basic schools of thought in ethical theory (deontology, consequentialism). However, I didn't feel that an overview of these is particularly helpful for YSPH students. One cannot learn ethical theory in 2 hours. I think a more helpful design would be a consideration of ethical problems that we might actually face in practice (i.e., research ethics, ethical problems that public health professionals are likely to encounter -- the intersection of health care and politics, etc). More interesting case studies for discussion could have been chosen.",
    "This course did not do justice to the importance of bioethics and research ethics on the public health profession. In fact, I found that many students were not taking it very seriously, which bothered me. It's extremely important that students have an appreciation of ethics and its applications in public health practice, and I do not feel that this message was adequately communicated during the seminar.",
    "For those of us who missed a class and had to write a paper, it would have been helpful to receive comments on it. As far as I know, no one read it and I feel like I spent some time on it which could have been better used if no one was going to read it.",
    "Not useful. If you are in an MPH program, you must have SOME understanding of ethics. This \"course\" would be better if it were integrated into another course that all first-years take (i.e., Intro Epidemiology). Or perhaps, each division could cover ethics in their division seminars.",
    "I enjoyed the small group discussion, however, I felt that the groups were too large.",
    "This course made us think about difficult situations.",
    "I feel like this course could have been more well done. I think it was relevant to do the trainings and understand them but I feel as though the concepts introduced in the two seminars were not well-presented and could have been made more relevant to public health. I honestly feel as through I did not take anything away from those two nights. The case-study discussions were okay, but they could have been more well-done and conversation was often forced.",
    "I thought that the design of the course - brief lectures followed by discussions - provided an excellent overview of research ethics in public health. I think I would have gained more from the course had it not been scheduled at the end of the day.",
    "Useful and practical",
    "Good.",
    "It does not classify as a course as the class met just twice in the entire semester..The course did offer a broad insight into the ethics and morals before research is conducted... and also the regulatory requirements around research.",
    "I think it should be offered after shopping period is over because the timing of the class did not fit well with people's schedules.Also, the lecture can be shortened and focus more on the discussion section.",
    "I liked this course for the discussions. I am a person that likes to debate so I enjoyed talking about the ethics behind a gun control issue and teaching junkies how to fool pharmacists into giving them clean needles. So I thought the experience was fun.",
    "The course is slightly inadequate in its coverage of topics in bioethics. However, only so much is achievable in a limited span of time.",
    "The seminar was OK. I didn't really learn to much about ethics, but the group discussions were good.",
    "Good dialogue.",
    "too short to really discuss overall ethics",
    "Good to strengthen your knowledge in esearch ethnics.Case study will be a good way in demonstrating right from wrong.",
    "I took this course?",
    "good",
    "A necessary course.",
    "Overall a good format. The group discussion during the second half of the seminars works best when kept informal. Moderators who facilitate the sessions informally seem to have better success getting students engaged.",
    "Strengths: Instructors had excellent breadth of knowledge on subject matter. Material was presented in an organized, informative way conducive to learning. Material was interesting and applicable\/relevant to my future career (health policy\/global health) and the field of public health in general.Weaknesses: Many students (particularly those in EMD\/BIS\/CDE) did not understand the point of the subject matter and class sessions, and did not participate in the discussions. They also complained about having to attend. This is something that should be addressed by the greater YSPH administration if possible, because it is clearly valuable and relevant material.",
    "It wasn't that meaningful. It is easy to tune out and I don't think I gained anything from it; especially since I have already been through several research trainings.",
    "it was good overview of ethics. a big topic to cover in two days.",
    "I think it could have gone into more depth of topics related to public health, as opposed to talking about ethics in general. It would be helpful to know more of the ethical gray areas we might be confronted with, where there is no good answer.",
    "It was fine although i am not sure I got too much out of it. The speakers were interesting though",
    "Interesting seminar.",
    "A good introductory seminar to ethics of research. Would have liked a few more seminars on it during the semester.",
    "This was pathetic. A pathetic attempt to introduce principles of ethics to students who are enrolled in a research-hungry program. This should be a class, and if it's not a class, it should be taught by people who are ethicists and scientists, not researchers with a passing interest in ethics. The mastery (or lack thereof) of ethical principles, of theories, of implications was unimpressive. The discussion was uninspired.",
    "It was nice to have an introductory exposure to ethics and ethical situations which may be encountered in the public health setting.",
    "I think that the ethics curriculum is very important to the school of public health. However, I feel like a lot of my peers may have brushed this off. I think that the ethics curriculum should be expanded.Things covered in the first lecture were interesting; however, I think it would be valuable to give students the opportunity to discuss real-life plausible scenarios where things are in the gray area. A lot of examples provided are black and white. It may be beneficial to give examples where things are not as clear with different contexts surrounding them to facilitate a discussion about the types of considerations that go into making difficult, but ethical, decisions.Having specific department seminars every so often over the course of our time here discussing ethical issues we may face in our particular fields would be of value.",
    "The lecture portion was interesting but the breakout sessions were absurd. The discussion leaders did nothing to lead discussion and allowed people to get way off track.",
    "It could have better training in terms of HIC and HSC application procedures.",
    "I enjoyed the lectures, but I thought the discussion sessions were not useful.",
    "The two lectures of the ethics seminar were thought-provoking. However, they could have covered more of a structured outline of research ethics in public health. I did not think the discussion was very useful because of the studies that were chosen.",
    "I think that a class on research ethics should be required. I think it has very interesting material and should be invested more in.",
    "This seminar was a good way to stimulate thinking about ethical issues in PH.",
    "Poorly organized. Good intro- theoretical perspective on ethics. Afterwards there was little cohesion. Examples used for case studies were poorly constructed and not useful in delving into the subject.",
    "this is an important topic, for people who were not exposed to this type of info prior to this course it was extremely important to learn itI liked the format where a lecture would be followed by practical exercise, i think for an ultrashort course this format definitely drove the points home- good thinking!",
    "excellent.",
    "helpful",
    "The lecture part is really great and engaging. I really appreciated the points he made. The discussion was really poor --the case study wasn't good and the leading of the discussion wasn't really that great either. People starting getting off topic and it wasn't really that beneficial.",
    "Strengths: I loved the philosophical background laying the groundwork for research ethics, I really liked both instructors, and the discussion sections were lively and engagingWeaknesses: we need much more time for research ethics! This is such an important and interesting topic that cannot be covered in just two days. Also, we should explore some alternative approaches to ethics for public health, such as that espoused by David Buchanan. Students should be made aware that ethics is about much more than just the IRB, rather it representsa whole theories or approaches to health promotion, programming, and research.",
    "Very brief introduction into ethical issues.",
    "It was appropriate and needed. Good introduction on ethics."

I also think that the timing was also poor since I know that many students, including myself had a lot on their mind and it was something that could have been done right after shopping period was over or during shopping period.I think ethics are very important in public health and the discussion of a case study is a good idea, but in some ways was redundant, especially if you have previous experience in IRB, etc.",

Only change would be to require some short readings as background in the subject, even if they are handed out in discussion sections or at the start of the first lecture, in order to give all students a better understanding of the context of\/rationale behind PH ethics.
