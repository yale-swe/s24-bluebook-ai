    "I feel that the title of the course, the Historical Sociology of Knowledge, is an apt summary in and of itself. I would highly recommend this course to another student because it is insightful, engaging, comprehensive, interesting, and enjoyable!",
    "I'd recommend this course to anyone who wants to study historical sociology. This is not a methodology course, it might also not provide a \"canonical\" syllabus in the field, but it discusses works that are creative approaches to the study of historical sociology and the sociology of knowledge. I took away a lot from engaging with creative attempts in depth."

   "comments": [
    "This course introduced me to historical sociology and specifically to the historical sociology of knowledge. It allowed me to expand my framework of thought regarding both history and sociology, and it equipped me to understand each field in a new way.",
    "Much like a workshop, the course helped me to review what others in my discipline are doing, but unlike a workshop, it was a continued and in-depth, more structured discussion. The course also helped me to get a good sense of how to approach macrosociological questions. This is very helpful for preparing my dissertation."
