    "This course completely changed my understanding of Victorian poetry, and opened my eyes to the incredible diversity of subject and style of verse within the period.",
    "general overview of Victorian poetry; periodized framework for asking questions of aesthetic value",
    "I read a body of literature I was not at all familiar with before and became more adept at archival research at Yale!",
    "I learned more in this class than in any other from my graduate career thus far. Professor Levine did an excellent job providing us with enough historical context for us to understand 19th century references, context, and public feeling. The course was thoughtfully and smartly framed: we began with 20th century reception of the Victorians with which we are more familiar and the Victorian poems themselves before moving into deeper and wider readings of Victorian poetry and criticism. Doing so allowed us to not only understand the New Critical system of evaluation more thoroughly (which has become so familiar that we forget its continued reign); it also allowed us evaluate the New Critical system of evaluation itself, and thus our own standards by which we measure and analyze poetry. Throughout, my close reading skills were sharpened and I found myself better able to negotiate historicism and formalism."

   "comments": [
    "I truly enjoyed the course and found it to be an excellent survey; we hit a wide range of topics, styles, and authors without feeling rushed at any point.",
    "I thought this course was a really useful survey of Victorian poetry, in particular its less well-trod areas, and of the reception of Victorian poetry, both contemporary and later. I think I would have liked to have dwelled more on questions of badness and literary value, though clearly the class' main thesis was that Victorian poetry isn't anywhere near as bad as it's cracked up to be, and doesn't necessarily resemble the overly religious, sentimental, and formulaic specter that new criticism conjured. The question of whether poems that fit the bill can be reevaluated would have been an interesting one to discuss. But also simultaneously asking \"what is literary value?\" and \"what is victorian poetry?\" might have been entirely too overwhelming for the class, which was already so rich.",
    "the course was extremely well-organized and followed the syllabus. I believe that it could have been a bit more interdisciplinary, as a fanciful attempt at criticism.",
    "One of the greatest strengths of this class was the way Professor Levine's opened each session. She would recount discussions from previous sessions and tie them to the questions, claims, and lines of inquiry we would explore in the current one. It created (without forcing) continuity and structure to the course overall, as the questions we asked were clear yet capacious enough to spur insightful class engagement. Said differently: the course had a trajectory that was just structured enough for deep discussion and just loose enough to catalyze innovative and exciting thinking. I'm impressed by how she managed to strike this balance. It's something I want to emulate in my own teaching. Also, this class opening was a great way for Prof. Levine to demonstrate how much she was listening to our ideas and thinking alongside us."

    "Absolutely",
    "Definitely. Naomi was fantastic, and made the material come to life.",
    "Yes. I think it was a really good survey of Victorian poetry, as well as an interesting way to reevaluate my opinion of the Victorian period.",
    "I absolutely would! It serves both as an excellent introduction to the field and allows for deeper exploration of topics for seasoned Victorians.",
    "Yes. I learned a great deal. I rarely participate in class discussion, and I felt encouraged to participate in class. It was a rigorous and inviting atmosphere. Again, that's a hard balance to strike in a class, and Prof. Levine achieved it."
