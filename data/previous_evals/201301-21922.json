   "comments": [
    "I would recommend it to any senior interested in a topic not offered in seminars",
    "Do it",
    "Yes! Always great to get credit for working in a lab.Different labs have different requirements for how many hours per week you must work and if you need to do a final project at the end, so ask around before picking a lab.",
    "I think anyone who is a Psych major should seriously consider working at least one semester in a lab in order to get that experience. I never thought I would be interested, but I became interested in the Baby Lab for two reasons: I love babies and there was no final paper. Most labs require you to write a final paper, but since I knew I didn't want to do research in the future and just wanted to try it out, I didn't want to have to write another paper. I would highly recommend this! It's 10 hours a week, so it does take up a significant amount of time.",
    "Highly recommended. All psychology majors should consider doing directed research for at least one semester, it is a completely different experience from typical classroom settings. You will learn a whole new skill set and above all it's fun!",
    "YES! Conducting studies is the basis of psychology, and you will learn a great deal from partaking in that process.",
    "Yes. Especially with Ifat Levy.",
    "If you're doing research, definitely do it for credit!",
    "yes, if you find an appropriate mentor and proejct",
    "I would definitely recommend doing some research (Psych 492\/493). It's really interesting to get to conduct your own research.",
    "It will vary depending on what you do. I worked at the Rudd Center and absolutely loved it.",
    "Cool to get experience in the field of psychology.",
    "Research experience is really important in Psych, so if you can get some done during your undergrad experience you should! The requirements are pretty fair, depending on the lab you're in.",
    "Yes, this was a great credit for my senior thesis.",
    "PSYC493 is a great way to get a sense of how clinical research is done. I would recommend it to any student interested in pursuing research or to any student interested in the field of the laboratory. You can learn in great depth about a subject you are passionate about.",
    "I would definitely recommend doing this if a student is interested in the material and has a good relationship with the grad student\/professor.",
    "I would recommend it especially if you need psychology credits because it is a great way to learn about research.",
    "Directed research.",
    "Not much to say- it's research for credit! I've worked in a neuroscience lab at the medical school for a few years, and used 493 through this lab toward the senior requirement for the psychology major. Pretty chill.",
    "You get what you put in. I would suggest taking Directed Research to get your feet wet in psych-related research, but make sure beforehand that you're interested in both the general goals\/concepts of the lab and the day-to-day work. I didn't know exactly what I was going to be doing when I went into the experience, and I ended up hating it more often than not.",
    "Take this course to work in a real psychology lab, help a grad student with their research, and learn how to write a proper APA paper. It was a great experience!",
    "Definitely do directed research if there is a lab or researcher at Yale that you want to work with, and if you have ideas for research projects that you'd like to conduct. This is the best way to experience rigorous training on research methods applied to real-life work, with your own project. It is an unbeatable experience forthe research-oriented student."
