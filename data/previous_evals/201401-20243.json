    "I would recommend Math115 to another student if they want to take Calculus BC. While it is a typical calculus course, it is very well-organized and well-taught.",
    "A great course that covers a wide variety of topics in calculus. Professor Hsu (Yu-Wen) was incredible, I really recommend taking the class with her if possible, she makes it a delight! Quite a lot of work, especially in reviewing all the material for the exams, as well as p-sets that could be difficult (use the help resources!). Definitely recommend this, as a QR, class for a major, or just simply because you enjoy math!",
    "No, take math 118 if you are an econ major or math 112 for the math credit",
    "It's much harder than Calc BC but a good class to take if you're willing to work hard.",
    "I really did not like this course. The midterms were disproportionately hard, and I feel like we were always rushing in class to learn information. There was too much crammed into one semester, and even though my professor talked and wrote quickly, we still didn't get to some stuff for, say, the problem set due that week. I wasn't able to learn efficiently at such a fast pace. But on top of that, there were questions on the exam that were to \"test our knowledge,\" or something along those lines. Oh, and they were worth like 30 points. I can think of a perfect example. We BARELY learned how to find volume by using cross-sectional slice in class (we briefly rushed through it at the end of one class), and maybe had a couple simple homework problems with it, but lo and behold, the hardest question (literally, they said on the exam that it was the one most of us WOULDN'T get) on the whole exam was devoted to cross-sectional slices. There went 30 points for me. But wait! There were true\/false on the exam, too! I would often get the answer correct yet still would get an \"F\" (another thing I hated: they graded each question on a scale of A to F, which was distressing) for that question because my explanation for a question I didn't even have time to really focus on was insufficient. Overall, I stressed over this course way too much, while others, who had already learned the information in high school, were breezing through it and finishing 2.5 hour tests in 45 minutes. Only take it if you must, and if you do: study by not just looking at, but by DOING practice problems and redoing homework problems. Then, when you have questions you come across in your studying, write them down and make time with your professor to ask them! I know that my professor, at least, was always looking forward to helping me.",
    "Calc II takes a good amount of work and practice - be ready to put in some effort",
    "It is probably a requirement if you are taking it, and it definitely is not a bad course in general. Try to keep up with the material by actually working on the psets and you will be fine.",
    "Be prepared for a lot of work, but you learn a lot."
