   "comments": [
    "This is a really fascinating concept for a class, but it definitely lost momentum as the semester wore on. Things start to get especially repetitive around the middle of the course, when it becomes all Hemingway, all the time. The final unit on The Waste Land and To the Lighthouse definitely makes for the most interesting reading, but in-class conversation tended to drift away from meaningful comparison, leaving the Waste Land pretty well unexamined. A pretty average English class overall, made harder to be patient with because of the diversions of London.",
    "You read books by American authors who lived abroad. I would recommend it.",
    "I would not recommend this class to a fellow student. The reading is very demanding, requiring students to read a book a week, with little return on their work. While the reading list was interesting, the perspective on these widely-read materials was not refreshing or innovative, but rather cliche and overdone. The lack of teaching and guidance in this course resulted in the informal and unproductive discussion in class. This was one of the least rewarding classes I've taken at Yale.",
    "This course was incredibly relevant to the experience of being abroad. Being in London while taking this course was definitely a boon and experiencing the places written about in the readings made the readings seem infinitely more interesting (although the syllabus itself was objectively great, too). However, the way the class was structured (one two-hour class once a week, usually discussing one book a week) made it difficult to look at any of the readings in depth.",
    "Americans Abroad is really a class on modern prose and poetry--discussion of nationality and expatriotism is not a major component of the class. Though the syllabus offers the opportunity to read some really terrific work from the period, the instruction is so poor that I would highly caution against enrolling in this class (unless it it offered in London again, in which case, go!). Though Professor Chambers is highly approachable, she often seemed unprepared to lead discussion, asking few good questions and not focusing on any passages for close reading. Seminar was often painfully directionless and offered little further insight into the work at hand.",
    "This class was a huge missed opportunity for something great. While going to the theater every week was wonderful and enriching, we did not become empowered theatre-goers through any other means. We had no assigned readings. We did not read scripts (other than for Macbeth). We did not learn anything about the history of theater, or even of theater in London. Our only assignments were weekly theater reviews, which were fun and, depending on your commitment to the project, stimulating to write, but by the end became a very monotonous process that could be completed without much engagement in the task. At times, I felt no different than the tourist just making the West End rounds, a horrible sense to have towards a class that is designated for 1\/4 of the semester's academic stimulation.I hope that future incarnations of this course are more successful--there is certainly the material on the \"London Stage\" to make for a very rewarding semester.",
    "This is a discussion based English class in which we read one book per week on average and then talk about them in terms of modernism, the war, ex-patriotism, and the other texts. We wrote three essays, two of which were comparative. There were also a bunch of informal writing assignments and reading responses that came out of nowhere and we never got feedback on and I didn't really know what to make of. I really liked most of the books we read and the essay topics were open and interesting. The professor was extremely helpful in terms of written feedback and helping with brainstorming and giving suggestions. Class discussions, however, were so informal as to be almost awkward and aimless. I would recommend this class as an overview of modernist literature in which you get to read some interesting books, but not as an intense literary exploration of these books beyond their surfaces."
