   "comments": [
    "I took AP Econ in high school and still found this class fairly challenging. Katerina Simons is a great professor, and she definitely teaches the material well. The curve is fairly decent, but the problem sets are tricky (especially after the first midterm).",
    "Definitely recommend! Great foundation of knowledge, regardless of what major you choose. Only 6 psets in total.",
    "You learn the material very well but the seminar is more difficult than the lecture.",
    "This course was lacking in strengths. It is a small class with the grading and teaching style of a large lecture. It is an allusion of a small class without any of its benefits. There is still a curve (which negates the grading weight of the problem sets) the professor, while easy to understand and occasionally funny just rehashes the textbook in her lectures making them insignificant (this is again a characteristic of a large lecture course). I say take the lecture--you will still be stressed before the exams and will learn about the same amount. More personalized attention and innovative repetition of the subject material would make this course much better.",
    "I would recommend for sophomore year, and make sure the student is ready to put the work in.",
    "Prof Simons is absolutely hilarious and explains everything really well. Great course and not a lot of work (only 6 problem sets that each take less than 2 hours)",
    "Informative but very fast paced. If new to Economics, take lecture, as you are more likely to learn the key concepts that at times are expected that you already know in the seminar.",
    "Definitely better than Econ 115. The material is much more in depth and the problem sets correspondingly harder. Some of the less math intensive material is stuff anyone would find enjoyable to learn and discuss. I would recommend it to most incoming freshmen.",
    "It is a more rigorous and more in-depth version of the lecture. I wouldn't recommend it because I think the same information was taught better in the lecture with more applicable everyday examples, which was lacking in the seminar.",
    "Take this class if you have any interest in econ whatsoever, or even if you don't. The curve is supposedly harder in the seminar than in the lecture, but you learn a lot more material and learn it a lot more thoroughly--and you have half as many problem sets to do. For me, it was worth it. Simons is a good teacher, and she teaches you everything you need to know from the textbook, so while reading the textbook can be a good review, you definitely don't have to. Simons may not be quite as entertaining as Tolga, but she's engaging and fun to listen to regardless. Overall, a really good course--even if you're not planning to be an econ major.",
    "The microeconomics seminar is awesome, definitely try to get into a section! My class had about 15 people, which was great for getting engaged in class. Professor Simons was great; she's organized and efficient, and always has time to share funny examples and have \"buzz groups\" with the person sitting next to you to do practice problems in class. I'd never taken econ and I loved this class. Everyone always says to take this class with Tolga, but Simons was great!",
    "If you don't think you would pay attention in the lecture this gives a good alternative. Otherwise take the lecture course.",
    "Yes, this was a good course to take. It was very interesting, especially for someone with no economics background. The workload wasn't much, only 6 problem sets with the lowest grade dropped, a midterm, and a final. Professor Simons was a helpful teacher, with entertaining examples. Take this course if you think you're at all interested in economics!",
    "Yes, I'd recommend this course. It's a very informative course that serves its purpose excellently and is taught very well."
