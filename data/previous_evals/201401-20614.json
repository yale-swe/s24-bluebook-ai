   "comments": [
    "I strongly recommend NOT to take this course. If you need the credits from this class, maybe it is a good idea. If you take this purely out of an interest in the subject matter as I did, you will likely be disappointed. Merriman clearly knows a lot about French history, but his lectures are poorly organized and confusing. At the end of the course, I don't actually think I've learned a lot about France since 1871 despite doing all of the readings, watching all assigned films, and attending nearly every lecture and section. Merriman is a nice guy and clearly cares about his students, but ultimately, he isn't a very good teacher. Sections do little to clarify lectures.",
    "More work that people imagine. Especially dependent on which TF you get.However, is an interesting course and Professor Merriman is an engaging lecturer even though he can go astray sometimes.",
    "I would recommend this course. It's a good look at a less-focused-on era of French history, taught by an amazing professor.",
    "This is a good class if you want to learn about French history, BUT you have to do the reading. When I shopped the course, I thought Merriman's style of lecturing was quirky, but I realized a few weeks into the class that I couldn't follow his tangents and I would have learned very little had I not done the textbook reading. In some ways, though, this forced me to learn a lot of information for the final.",
    "definitely recommend, great professor, fun class, not much reading, a paper, midterm and final",
    "As a French major, I was well pleased with this course. It definitely gives you the historical\/cultural context for a lot of literary texts written during this period, which can prove extremely useful if you're interested at all in modern\/realist French literature. As a whole, it was also really interesting to learn about French history from a leading world expert in the field. Professor Merriman is a very engaging professor - definitely one of the more memorable professors I'll have at Yale. That being said, be aware that his lecture style can be a bit difficult to follow at times.",
    "\"Up against the wall MF\"",
    "Professor Merriman is fascinating and captivating. Lectures are a bit scattered speckled with irrelevant information, but just his presence and kindness are reason enough to take this class.",
    "Great class! Not too hard and really interesting!",
    "A fun and easy history lecture, with a focus on cultural history and a decidedly left-liberal bent. Professor Merriman is wacky in the best possible way. The workload is light, with sporadic readings and film screenings. Grading is based on a midterm, a 7-10 page paper, and a final (written or oral, with questions given out in advance). Take it if you're looking for an interesting fifth class or are at all curious about recent French history.",
    "This course is a glimpse into how John Merriman, one of Yale's great historians and funniest professors, sees not only France but also history, culture, and politics in general. I would absolutely recommend it.",
    "Overall, great course. It breaks down the recent history of France, and definitely gives you a new perspective and understanding of the nation....At the end, you feel very much a part of the country! Interesting topics covered.",
    "It is a fun, chill course with a medium amount of work and very cool professor",
    "This class is good look at a broad period of time in France (1871 all the way to the present). The readings for the class are very manageable, which is a huge plus compared to many other history classes. The course requirements also include viewing a few films, but they are well chosen and interesting to watch. The lectures can be a bit confusing with lots of Professor Merriman's long anecdotes, but overall the class is enjoyable.",
    "Amazing class. Not a ton of work--a decent but not overwhelming amount of reading, and most of it is interesting. Prof. Merriman is a brilliant lecturer.",
    "A fun history class with energetic teachers.",
    "An overview of the complex social history of France since 1871. I would highly recommend this course to anyone interested or to anyone looking for a fun lecture.",
    "Take. It. For. Merriman.",
    "Definitely. Really interesting material and really engaging professor. Not too much work at all and it is really so useful to understand France in a much deeper context.",
    "France since 1871 is a good survey course of French history.",
    "Yes there is very little reading required and it is very interesting course",
    "If you are interested in French history, take this course. Taking a class with Merriman is a unique experience, and you will learn a lot about French culture and politics.",
    "This definitely could be an interesting class if you're someone who really enjoys history classes but it definitely wasn't the right fit for me. A few IDs on the midterm are incredibly specific, as in maybe highlighted on one or two pages of the main textbook. Also there were weeks when we had almost no reading, and others where there were two books and a French film. I know some people in the class definitely enjoyed it, but if you're not in love with the first few lectures during shopping period, it's not for you.",
    "Great lectures.",
    "This is a great course about France since 1871. Mostly political and social history, with a bit of military mixed in. I found it fascinating."
