   "comments": [
    "Take it if you need it for the music major or for lessons-- I can't see any other reason to take it. Homework can get pretty tedious, and if you don't like composing, the model compositions are going to be a bear-- I didn't feel like I learned much about HOW to compose, only WHAT to compose. The practical applications of this course are also minimal if you're at all a naturally talented musician: much of basic theory is teaching you how to analytically explain what you can already hear\/feel. A final word of advice: shop the different sections, as they can vary drastically in feel and quality. Megan Kaes-Long was great, but the teachers seem to be different every semester.",
    "Music 210 is an amazing theory class.The course covers the basics of music analysis, from chord progressions to small forms. It moves quickly, but you are definitely equipped for the class if you took the AP (even if it was a few years ago). It is very well structured, and it is always clear what you need to do to learn the material and to do well in the class. The homework takes about two or three hours per class. You write two model compositions, a set of variations and a minuet and trio. The reading was sometimes too technical, but generally it was helpful for class discussion. This class was at 9 AM, but it made getting up early bearable!",
    "I think that the structure of our classes, with a theoretical explanation followed by looking at examples in real music worked very well. I also felt that the exercises and model compositions assigned were all worthwhile and important to my understanding of the material, although I would have liked to have had more practice with analysis before the take home final, which was an analysis.",
    "Very similar to AP Music Theory in terms of the concepts we go over - however I think that this course does a great job of truly solidifying these concepts and going much more in depth. I would recommend if you're interested in theory\/the music major - you'll have to take it eventually anyways for that! The workload is relatively constant and certainly not too much to handle. Who your teacher is can have a huge impact on your experience though, as they all teach the class differently - some with more written assessments than others. Make sure to check the teacher evaluations!!",
    "Your experience will depend on how much music background you have. Definitely trust the placement exam. If you're worried it might be too much, shop it and see. There's a lot of work so if you're not in it because you need it for the major or for lessons for credit you might be in for more than you bargained. Each TA will teach the class differently so definitely shop and see how much work they expect you to do. I had worksheets twice a week (about 4 hours each), two composition projects (20+ hours), and a take-home final (8 hours). Very enjoyable for the most part. Megan is a great TA.",
    "Definitely take this class if you are interesting in composing, arranging, or would like to be involved in music.",
    "It could depend on your teacher, but I really enjoyed this class. Learning to compose was surprisingly rewarding, so even if you're initially at a lossit's really good experience. The class involves talking about a lot of different repertoire and dealing with real music. And anyway, if you're going to major in music, you have to do it. There's a lot of homework, but few big projects and lots of time to do them in.",
    "This course is very good. There is a smooth transition from 205--the first few lessons are all review.This class, 210 02 with Megan Long, in particular was amazing. Megan is the nicest person ever, and makes an effort to sympathize with her students. She creates a great learning environment with her consideration for her students, her passion for their learning, and her passion for the material. She is also very organized, so you are sure to learn if you put in even minimal effort.This class was at 9am on MONDAY (and on Wednesday). I was actually happy to be there. I actually enjoyed being at class, and only loathed being late, because I cared about letting Megan down. If you ever have the chance to take a course with Megan, do it-- just don't expect to slack off (she won't let you, and you'll fare worse if you're new to the material).Anyway-- most of the 210 professors (often grad students teach the course) are good. They are so passionate and excited about what they teach, and are happy spending extra time to help you learn (I say this from taking a handful of music courses). Overall, the course is well structured, so if you like what the syllabus says, and if you can get one that has a little less reading(a (significant) bonus), then taaake it.",
    "Music 210 is a good class to take for anyone intending to major in music (or those interested in the classical tradition) who need a refresher on part-writing, counterpoint, voice-leading, harmony, model composition, and classical analysis fundamentals. It's much more rigorous and thorough than AP Theory (e.g., second species counterpoint is covered in the first couple classes and this isn't even on the AP curriculum) and is important to take in addition to AP (or instead) because the supplemental readings provide some (limited) context, history, and explanations for why the material of 210 is important to know and what it really means to study it. Make sure you get an exciting teacher (like Megan, who is AMAZING) or else you may get bored in this class--it's worth it to shop multiple classes to find the right teacher.",
    "Good for learning music serious theory; starts easy but quickly snowballs and gets quite advanced at the end",
    "Music 210 is a prereq for the music major, so probably about 90% of people who take it do so because they have to. And it's a hard, fast-paced class in which you cover a whole lot of material, but it's incredible preparation for the classes that lie ahead. You will learn an amazing amount and become much more musically competent in a short span of time than you thought possible. Promise.Music 210 differs from 205 in that they cover almost all the same concepts, but 210 does it through part-writing and generating the musical devices properly on your own, and 205 does it through pure analysis of other classical works. Because of this, you can actually take both and still learn both times around, but you don't have to.Really, it all comes down to the instructor. Megan Long is phenomenal, but she's not teaching it again, so just make sure you find someone who will make the hours you spend working on this class worth what you are learning from it.The final projects (compositions of a theme and variations for piano movement and a string quartet minuet and trio movement) seem daunting before you get to them but completely manageable once you're doing them,as did most homeworks in this class. It's important to keep up, because it's very hard to catch up if you fall even one assignment behind, but everything builds upon the last skill and everything is possible to those willing to put in the work."
