   "comments": [
    "This is a very interesting and unique course. The opportunity to work in the Peabody and with curators at the top of their field is amazing. The world load and expectations Leo has are not. Do not take this class simultaneously with Orgo, or something else work intensive. I would suggest taking it Cred\/d\/fail if possible. Only take it if you passionately care about science or else the workload is just insane and unjustifiable. Some students had to rewrite and do a lot more work than others, and in general it is not enjoyable to be in that place. This is the most work intensive class I have taken at Yale, but I do feel like I got a lot out of it.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student only if they are genuinely interested in the topics offered and capable of self-directing their own research and work. Being able to see behind the scenes of the Peabody Museum is a wonderful opportunity that students should take advantage of. You will get out of the course exactly what you put into it - I ended up learning a lot about fascinating topics and really improving my writing.",
    "Yay take it! If you can get in. The peabody is a wonderful museum, and it's collections are fascinating. It's nice to really get personal with the collection and the curators. As a non-science person, be prepared to really learn how to write and think scientifically, but don't be turned away because it's science. Not an easy A, at all, or even a really \"easy\" science course, but instead of struggling through one useless semester of astronomy or physics 1 or chem with a hundred other students, you get one on one treatment, a collection totally new and interesting, and you design your own papers and presentations so you CAN make it interesting. If you want to just take a science and get over with it, well, don't take this. If you hate the science distribution but don't want to waste a semester at yale, take this. It's very rewarding.The science kids seemed to love it too. Struggled with different things I think.One of the better courses I've taken, really opened up a new part of the university to me.",
    "This was a WONDERFUL COURSE. **Definitely take it if you have the chance **You do two projects\/papers, each with collection managers of the Peabody Museum. You basically do intensive research with his or her guidance, then write a scientific or expository paper describing your results. Being part of new discoveries was a completely amazing experience. Also, each student presents his or her work to the class, so you learn interesting tidbits about a huge variety of fields, from leaf shape to astronomy.I cannot encourage you enough-- TAKE THIS COURSE. When will another opportunity to work with a collections manager present itself? Also, you decide the amount of work you put in. You could do the minimum of two 2 hour sessions a week, or go in every single day for several hours. In order the fully enjoy the course, though, I would recommend coming prepared to put in the time."
