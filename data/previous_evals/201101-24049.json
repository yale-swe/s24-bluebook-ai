   "comments": [
    "Yes. It would have been helpful if all the readings had been combined into a course packet so that everythingwas in one place...",
    "No, the library had very little about my city which was difficult. There was one book which would have been prefect but it had been ordered a year ago and no one knew where it was. I went to ask them about it months ago and they said they would get back to me, still no word yet.I will also say that I really dislike the policy that you can only have on book at a time. I think its horrible and not at all conducive to learning. We work late and after the library is closed to only be able to have one book out to look at is crazy. PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE put pressure on the library to make the lending policy better at supporting our education!",
    "I will say it again: the library is never helpful. The hours are bad, you can only check out one book at a time, and they have an elitist attitude toward learning. Until the library is more friendly, helpful, and accessible, no class will have a positive review here.We could have used more storage space on the classes folder for our group projects.",
    "n\/a",
    "I really do regret not having the time to finish as many of the readings as I would've liked - There were simply not enough hours in the day. I would encourage the curriculum committee to scale back the Viz II course's demands on student's time next year so that they can actually complete reading assignments for Urban Design -- it's integral tothe course, obviously.",
    "yes.",
    "Sort of. Please make a reader available for purchase, as all of the PDF printing is time consuming and equally expensive.Also, considering the assignments, it is a great loss that the resources of the many libraries are not more integrated. An introduction to urban design I, and many students who've previously studied architecture, didn't need. An introduction to urban research, however, would have been greatly valuable. Could, perhaps, there be a more engaged approach to helping us understand how urban research is different from other types of research? How could we use the maps department at Yale in our studies, for example? Could one or two of the discussion sessions be devoted to sessions with Rubin or Harwell in one of the libraries? Could one or two sessions be devoted to a discussion of map\/planning\/urban research beyond the ubiquitous (and academically dubious) Google Image Search? I don't feel that the assignments added to my education or skill-set at all.",
    "The Library lending period is too short nor does it have enough copies of key texts that are often used by students. Relative to other comparable institutions, the Arts library falls very short.",
    "Library circulation policies oppressive.",
    "In some cases there was very little information available for the cities and spaces being studied, so we spent a lot of time in the library looking for resources that weren't available, and then tracing Google Maps to produce diagrams.If this was meant to be an exercise in exploring the library's resources, that should have been more clear and some more assistance should have been provided for finding resources. In reality we have a finite amount of time, which should be spent reading and learning, not vainly looking for material and doing graphic production work.",
    "Library could have had a broader section on urbanism and the specific cities that we studied.",
    "the library needs to stay open later.",
    "Yes.",
    "I very much wish we had a more thorough collection in our architecture library. It was shocking how few books our library had on Beijing, which was the topic of my research for the class.",
    "The resources were adequate.",
    "The library is adequate in terms of resources. Many books for this class (on subject of major urban centers) were unavailable in Haas, but could be found in Bass, SML, or sourced through BorrowDirect or ILL. However, the borrowing policies of Haas make using the architecture library a painful process. One day\/one book limits, plus a $5\/day late fee combine to discourage borrowing; choosing to stay in the library allows access to multiple books at a time, but only during short and often inconvenient hours. One week\/five book limits would be a vast improvement, and would enable us to take advantage of the printed resources we (theoretically) have access to."
