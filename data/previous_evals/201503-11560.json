    "A little disorganized, but the topic of the class is so cool. The project is really what makes this class - the first half is just a crash course to get you ready for it. I loved the project a lot - it opened my eyes to a lot of the current research being done in immunobiology and being forced to write about and come up with a novel research idea was a very realistic taste of what it would be like to do research in that field. I loved this course a lot - even though it was late in the day and I wanted to go home, I was at every class once I decided I was taking it. Worth the experience of learning to be a functional human being in the field, I think.",
    "Immunoengineering is an introductory immunology course with a focus on the engineering of treatments for immunopathologies. You'll learn about the immune system (or as much as we know about it), and some techniques to modulate it.",
    "Overall, the material of BENG463 was really interesting. I enjoyed the final project as a way to explore and think critically about a topic I was interested in, and I truly felt this was one of the BME projects that most tested and pushed my critical thinking as a BME major. However, the course was VERY disorganized, and as much as Professor Fahmy was a really kind and caring professor, he was also very difficult to contact and had difficulty with follow-through (e.g. posting lecture slides as promised, sending out polls for office hours, communicating about midterm dates, etc). This class had a lot of potential but I felt that because of how scattered it was, it was ultimately difficult to keep track of."
