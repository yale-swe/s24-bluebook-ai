   "comments": [
    "Take it if you are an Econ major with Katerina. It won't be the best class you ever take, but it will give you a good foundation.",
    "The course is taught well and moves at an appropriate pace, but is geared toward those who really want to work on Wall Street one day instead of all students who want to learn the basics of Macroeconomics. I would only recommend it if you truly want to pursue Economics.",
    "A fairly dry introduction to macroeconomics.",
    "Professor Simons is definitely a capable professor who will teach you everything you need to know about Macro. The seminar style is nice if you feel intimidated asking questions in a huge lecture, or if a huge lecture stops you from showing up to class. The buzz groups are pretty fun and because the class is smaller you get to meet some new people. That being said, a lot of people who take this class are already econ geniuses, so the curve can sometimes be rough. But overall, definitely glad I took this over the lecture.",
    "From what I understand of the lecture, this seminar is more engaging, but it is also more difficult, and that might show on your transcript. If you're interested in the material and want to gain a deeper understanding of Macroeconomics than what is contained in the textbook, certainly take this class. But if you just want to understand Macro as it is, and\/or you need the basic skills of the discipline for your major, then taking this class might end up biting off too much, and its more might actually be less in the long run.",
    "Econ 111 is an interesting introduction to macroeconomics. That being said, it's a prerequisite that you have to get through in order to major in econ\/global affairs\/ep&e, so it can be a bit dull at times. If you are somebody who loses focus easily in big lectures then I would recommend this smaller seminar. You have the opportunity to ask the professor questions, and Katerina is always happy to oblige. Plus you have the added bonus of your teacher actually knowing your name.",
    "Econ 111 was a bit of a struggle but I learned a lot and it is probably better than the lecture with shiller if you want to go into or are interested in econ.",
    "The main difference is really about the class size. If you like a small classroom setting, go for ECON 111. In addition, Professor Simons is a great professor."
