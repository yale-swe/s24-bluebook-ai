    "This is a great class with Professor Venkadesan! Madhu is always super excited about what he's teaching and his enthusiasm is infectious. I feel bad that I was often sleepy during the 9 AM lectures, he definitely deserved our full attention. This is definitely one of the most interesting and practical MechE courses at Yale. It's a lot of work (homework assignments, labs, lab reports, two quizzes, AND a final project) but all of it was useful towards understanding the material, never busywork. Just make sure to give yourself enough time for all of the work to get as much as you can out of it, rather than just rushing to finish it last-minute!",
    "You have to take it if you're MechE, but would only suggest it to people very interested in robotics\/Arduino that aren't MechEs.",
    "A lot of work and going to be challenging but very worthwhile and you'll learn a lot and have fun!",
    "The class teaches how to analyze a mechanical system and walks you through the basics of controllers up to building a line following, cymbal playing robot.",
    "This was a really fun course. It was definitely out of my comfort zone, but taught really well. It was Madhu's first time teaching it, but he really knocked it out of the park. Both he and Zak were really responsive to emails, and very receptive to honest feedback. The class is structured well, and the final contest is really fun. He will tell you the quizzes are supposed to be easy, but that is false. I don't think it was supposed to be tricky or complicated, but it just ends up being that way, at least for me. Honestly, a lot of the class was really hard, but Madhu's awesome - go to office hours, ask questions, invest time in the labs and homework. They take a decent amount of time, but it's so worth it. It was my favorite class this semester.",
    "Mechatronics is probably one of the coolest core classes that you will take as a mechanical engineering student. Unlike a lot of the core classes, mechatronics is not heavily bogged down in theory; rather, it is a pretty practical class that touches on a lot of different areas. It can be a little tricky, as it relies on a lot of electronics and programming, but I found it really fun. Madhu is an amazing professor, and you can tell he really cares about the subject, as well as about making sure that the students understand it. He frequently will connect concepts in class to his own work, which involves human control systems, and will demonstrate how an aspect of a control system works in humans so that you can gain an understanding of how it would work in general. Some of the coolest things that I learned in the class were just his tangents on stuff like how your body responds to external forces, or on how hard a problem walking is to solve. The final project was a really cool way to directly tie together a lot of the stuff we learned. Every lab we did was related to the project in some way, and it was nice to have them build on each other that way. This class is probably my favorite engineering class that I've taken, but also one of the hardest, because you're thrown into a lot of the labs without much of a safety net; you have to do a lot of digging through data sheets and internet forums, which some people didn't really like. In addition, some of the homeworks were really hard, especially the MATLAB ones. That said, the class is incredibly rewarding, and Madhu is an amazing professor.",
    "MENG 390 is very intense. There are biweekly homeworks, and the labs are (usually) biweekly, which isnt bad, but there is also a final project and two quizzes (really just midterms). To be honest, I would suggest getting rid of the two quizzes to reduce the course load. Even though they are each only 12.5% of the final grade, studying for them is incredibly time consuming. MENG 390 is also very rewarding. You will learn a lot of theoretical knowledge, but also learn how to apply it. Professor V. does really cool research (look up the W Prize) that is 100% applicable to this course, so everything you learn is absolutely worth learning.",
    "Madhu's Mechatronics Madness is not for the faint of heart. It is pretty much what you would expect from the course description, with the lab portion of class offering a great opportunity to apply the lessons of lecture in a practical setting. However, it is a ton of work (I never finished a lab in the 3 1\/2 hour lab slot), and should probably not be taken unless you are in the major or really interested in the subject.",
    "Take this class. It was the highlight of my semester. Interesting material, not too much drudging homework, and a good project to be creative with."
