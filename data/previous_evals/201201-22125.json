   "comments": [
    "Lots and lots of work. It WILL dominate your schedule. I would not recommend it unless you are an ABET Mech E. It is a good class but too much work for 1 credit.",
    "Good luck, y'all. Start early, and don't underestimate how long the data analysis takes. As intimidating as he may appear, it is really helpful to talk to Professor Gomez. This is hell, but help each other and you'll make it.",
    "Throw your extracurriculars or social life to the wind and take easy classes this semester folks\u0097it's ABET time!...but actually the only reason I rated this class as good instead of very good was that it takes way too much time for what it teaches you. Supposedly going to be reworked for next year.",
    "If you are reading the reviews for this course, then you most likely have no choice but to take the class. Just be warned, if Professor Gomez is teaching the course again, you will spend at least 20 hours on lab reports each week if he has not changed the pace of the class.",
    "This course is very very difficult, in part because the workload most of the time is twice or thrice the load it should be. Expect to spend at a bare minimum 15 hours in the lab and working in class writing it up at home. Most labs require 2x or 3x that amount of time if you want to hand it in feeling like you tried. Unfortunately, there was no selection for any more workload than \"Much Greater\" or I would have picked it. The work load really should be cut down - it might make the class more enjoyable. Gomez's teaching style feels more like a perpetual (intimidating) evaluation as opposed to actually teaching. He doesn't take time to slow down and stop being critical if someone can't remember, needs re-explanation, or has never been taught something and needs time to absorb new material. He is quite intelligent, and I think everyone would get more out of it if he had a better outlook\/demeanor when dealing with and teaching undergraduates.After you have gotten the lab back, Gomez's handwriting is awful, so expect to spend a good amount of time deciphering it if you care to.Some of the labs are moderately interesting.",
    "If you do not have to take this course, run while you still can! You have to write 10 'short' lab reports (which take a minimum of 15 hours a week to write) and 2 'long' reports that will take over your reading week and spring break. Although some of the lab topics are interesting, the course is mostly self-taught and extremely frustrating (starting with bad data and ending with a professor who is harsh and uncaring). I am quite serious when I say that I would have dropped the ABET MechE major if I had taken this class before my junior year!(Important note: I took this class with Gomez...I hear Nick is much better)",
    "You can bitch all you want about highest workload of any class taken at yale, blunt prof, hard material, etc. But at the end of the day, you really learn about concepts and analysis at a deeper level than any other class in ME. Gomez will actually reduce the workload for next year because the work we did was borderline counterproductive in terms of # of hours. Its required so not sure why you're reading, but you work like you never have and learn some very important stuff. Gomez is actually a cool guy, get to know him.",
    "This is one of the worst engineering courses I have taken so far. The workload is honestly ridiculous and requires at least 20+ hours a week. Further, it is now WR course. Unfortunately, that apparently just translates to more work in the engineering department, as this class in NO way helped my scientific or engineering writing abilities. We received feedback on reports only TWICE during the semester - once at the midterm and once at the end. Blindly writing reports with no feedback is NOT HELPFUL. And then there is the professor...Alessandro Gomez is one of the worst instructors I have had. He is inconsiderate, unhelpful, and disrespectful. Teaching the course seems like a burden to him - he has better things to do. The very little feedback you do receive on your work is belittling and completely unnecessary to helping a student learn about the topics. However, you are likely taking this course because you are ABET...so you just have to do it.... Also, I've heard the other professor (ouellette?) is much better and that the class is quite enjoyable with him (these are actually interesting topics)",
    "If you don't need it for your degree, don't take it. Some of the labs are interesting and informative, and it does build up useful analysis skills, but it's a ridiculous amount of work (some of the writeups take ~20 hours)"
