   "comments": [
    "TAKE THIS CLASS!",
    "Yes. I came into the class knowing almost nothing about Nigeria and Nigerian culture. Although the class wasn't intense (weekly readings and reading response), I felt I learned a lot. It was a very good combination of work outside of class and discussion in class. At times class discussions can get a little disorganized but overall, it's a great class for learning about Nigerian culture. The Diaspora was covered less intensively towards the end of the semester.",
    "Great!",
    "Yes, abolutely.",
    "Yes! Great class!",
    "Only take this course if you want an easy A",
    "This class is an introduction to the history of migration (forced and voluntary) of Blacks out of Nigeria and into the West. I would recommend this class to anyone who is truly interested in the material (trans-Atlantic slave trade, cultural roots of Blacks who live outside of Africa). The class presents very interesting information about the cultural similarities of Nigerian descendants in the Diaspora.",
    "It is not a stressful class but do not take it for granted. Some of the readings are actually very interesting and even if during class time you do not take to much away the readings make up for it. Also its really nice that we get to watch movies and at the end have a Nigerian dinner together. I see no reason not to take this class"
