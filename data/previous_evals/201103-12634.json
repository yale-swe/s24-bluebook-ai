    "Yes. To Econ maths",
    "This class teaches very practical skills, applicable to fields such as economics (whether academic or applied) and operations management. The midterm and final are take-home. Professor Denardo has office hours pretty much all the time, which is helpful. You'll probably end up learning the material from the textbook though, because lecture is sometimes fast-paced and difficult to follow.",
    "I would strongly recommend econ\/math majors take optimization and substitute an economics or mathematics credit using the course. The course was especially manageable if one has taken analysis, general equilibrium and game theory already, as many of the concepts overlap. I found 80% of the homework assignments and tests to be",
    "Material for this class is interesting and useful. Lectures were usually confusing and the book was written by the professor so it was often difficult to figure some things out. Everything for the class is take home which is nice but the midterm and final were pretty tough.",
    "For any student who would like to major in Econ and Math, this is the class I would like to recommend. It serves as a gateway to some important topics that would later be encountered in high-level econ classes, such as General Equilibrium and Game Theory.",
    "There areseveral things you should know before taking Optimization.1) The class is taught entirely out of the book. Prof. Denardo wrote the book, and lectures consist of his reciting it in lecture.2) I took this class to learn about applications of optimization. While there are a few examples, they do not dominate the material. This class contains many proofs. IF YOU DO NOT LIKE MATHEMATICAL PROOFS, DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS. There are many difficult proofs, most of them appear toward of the course. So if you don't see them at first, just flip to the later chapters of the book.3) While you do learn some excel, you have excel problems about 30% of the time. Don't take this course if you want to become a master at excel.4) While the midterm and final are both take-home, they are HARD. The take-home aspect does not make them any easier. Be prepared to spend a lot of time on the final durring reading\/finals week.5) The material presented in this course is pretty useful. I'd recommend taking this course Credit\/D, - you get both the exposure to the material without the stress of hard proofs."
