    "definitely! very interesting class and not too much work",
    "If you want to learn Korean, this is your only choice. It's a smaller program than the Chinese one, but Korean is much more fun to learn. It's a moderate time commitment, but any language class is, so do not let that deter you. Also, Korean is a phonetic language that borrows many words from English, so that lessens the difficulty factor.",
    "Korean 110 is introductory Korean, so you'll learn basic Korean. You actually learn a surprising amount. It's a lot of fun, and it's a relatively chill course for an introductory language class.",
    "I would definitely recommend KREN 110 to other students. The language is a lot of fun to learn (especially if you've never taken an Asian language before!). It takes some time and dedication, but the course\/workload is neither stressful nor overwhelming. It's a great class!",
    "very good - past paced, lots of work but a steady workflow. you need to be self-motivated to take it but the rewards are high.",
    "Yes. It's a little all over the place. Not as well taught as intro chinese, but enjoyable."
