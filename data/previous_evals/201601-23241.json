   "comments": [
    "Comprehensive, though not exhaustive look at gender inequality. Interesting from many angles (biology, politics, markets) and really thought-provoking.",
    "100% take this class. Worth it completely.",
    "This was one of my favorite classes at Yale. Professor Rosenbluth's experts were always interesting and engaging, and she was able to thematize many relevant issues by examining them through different lenses. I learned a lot about a field I had known very little about at the outset.",
    "I LOVED THIS CLASS!!!! It was new, but a must-take. Lecture is laid back and chill. The material can be common sense at times, but you walk away with so much applicable and relevant information. I took this with my boyfriend, and we loved every minute. You talk about so many political but also just life things like dating, sex, and relationships. Non-WR It's just a midterm, final, and 5 page final paper. I'm not one to write too much, but I wrote slightly over the limit! The readings were interesting, and the TFs were fine. FRANCES IS THE REAL STAR!! TAKE IT JUST FOR HER! She loves teaching, her students, and even in a giant lecture makes an effort to know people. She knew me and said hi in the dining hall and I had never even met her! GREAT CLASS, MUST TAKE!!",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. It has been my favorite course that I've taken in my Yale career.",
    "I LOVE THIS COURSE!!! If you have any hesitation, do know that you will love the course most likely as well. The professor is great, the examinations and paper are fair and this class will be so interesting! I think this has been one of my favourite classes at Yale.",
    "Take it!!",
    "Absolutely. It's a great and fun way to get a writing credit knocked off too!",
    "one of the best political science class i've taken; very interdisciplinary; manageable workload; very passionate and knowledgeable professor",
    "Take this class one of the best at Yale! You look at a wide range of important, interesting issues, in fresh ways. Prof Rosenbluth is amazing. I took it non-WR. A midterm, a cumulative final, and a 5 page paper all quite fair, not too stressful, and even enjoyable! Definitely go to lecture!",
    "100% YES",
    "Sex, Markets, and Power explores the dynamics of gender across a multitude of topics based on biological, economic, and social lenses of analysis. I would definitely recommend this course to another student; the lectures are so interesting and the work is not hard. You also learn a lot of applicable knowledge and it spans a great range of topics.",
    "Awesome course, learned an incredible amount, very relevant to topics of today! Very intriguing information and engaging professor and TFs. Everyone is willing to help you and the course changed my outlook on society today.",
    "I wanted so badly to like this class. The material is so important and something I cared about so much, but I just couldn't. I don't think I can recommend this class to anyone. Professor Rosenbluth makes these really jarring comments that make the course hard to sit through. Even the most interesting material is presented in a really boring and inconsistent way. She consistently went way over the time, which is something I hate, and it seemed pretty clear that she kind if is just winging it with her lectures. Don't waste a credit on this course.",
    "It is a good course and I would recommend it. In order to get the full value you need to go to class consistently. The writing credit can allow for students to not go to class and still do well but to gain the most out of the course one should attend.",
    "This course is fascinating and well-structured, and Professor Rosenbluth is a gem. Take it!",
    "I recommend it! It's an interesting overview of how women's place in the world has changed over time.",
    "Absolutely take this class--very little work but also SO interesting. Rosenbluth is the best. Take it!",
    "Takes an interesting look at women's roles in society throughout history and juxtaposed with the modern context. Very interesting material and easy assignments! Interesting to see how gender dynamics in different realms have come to be.",
    "No",
    "SMP is a great class for anyone. Super interesting material that will make you question how the world works and also will open your eyes to relevant topics today in the workplace. Not that much work but I suggest you go to lectures out of interest, as well as, to learn! Great class overall",
    "Sex, Markets, and Power is good subject matter poorly executed. The class was incredibly disorganized, with section sign-ups, the room location, technology, etc. all gone awry in a way worse than almost any other class Ive taken at Yale. The subject matter was interesting, and it was a good way to focus traditional lenses like economics and politics onto less-often addressed issues surrounding sex and gender. That said, the lectures were repetitive and somewhat unorganized through the arc of the semester, with many conclusions seeming intuitive.",
    "Awesome class!! I learned so much from this course and will definitely take a lot of the material with me in life. I genuinely looked forward to going to class and section each week. Also, take the WR intensive option if you can - it's not much work at all (three 5 page papers and a final exam)!",
    "I would say it is a great introductory course, really well structured and definitely worth taking. I would definitely recommend it.",
    "Would not recommend. Lectures aren't structured well, and although the material itself is interesting, it is not taught in an engaging way. Workload is low.",
    "It's a decent class. Very easy-- just two exams with a ton of choice and one short paper. The readings are occasionally interesting but you don't really need to do them. Professor Rosenbluth is really great, but I found the course material, by and large, to be oversimplified and underwhelming. If you're looking for a kind of interesting gutty class, sure, take it. Otherwise, you'd have better luck with other classes.",
    "Yes, definitely recommend this course! Really interesting political science class where you learn A LOT about gender equality. It's not that much work and the exams\/essays really aren't that hard if you study enough for them. I learned so much from this course. Not bad taking it WR because it was only three 5-page papers and then just the final. One thing to note is that the papers build off of each other -- so, you're only focusing on one particular topic for the entire semester, meaning you should definitely choose something that interests you.",
    "I would recommend this class to another student. Pretty straightforward material, section isn't required, and you really don't need to do the reading to do well. A good 5th class if you need it.",
    "AWESOME. Takes 3 different lenses (biology, economics, politics\/culture) to examine wholistically and in detail why\/how women face so many problems in society without feeling preachy or bitter. Great class to take if you want an easy intro into any of these 3 lenses, or just want to learn about this incredibly important everyday topic in an academic setting.",
    "TAKE IT.",
    "Take it as a fifth class, even if you have no interest in women's studies whatsoever. I am a somewhat conservative male and still gained so much from this course and was excited to attend class each day. The workload (midterm, final, one five page paper) is also tough to beat.",
    "It's a class about the role of women in society and how it came to be this way. Examines market, biological, and cultural explanations across timelines and countries.",
    "I would highly recommend this course. If you are looking for a course that will cover a variety of topics, from the gender wage gap to female political representation to prostitution to gender equality in the developing course, this is the one for you. It wont get too deep into any one of those, but will give you a working understanding of all of them. Just a warning, this course is definitely more of a political science course than a WGSS course; we often talked about policy solutions to various issues and spent almost no time discussing feminist theory and the like. But, it also doesnt get very deep into policy. The majority of the class is spent considering various issues through the 3 lenses described by the course sex, markets, and power. The readings are interesting, though you dont have to do them to do fairly well in the course. Professor Rosenbluth is wonderful! Very sweet, approachable, and willing to make time to meet with students and even help guide them on outside research projects.",
    "Yes, take it! It provides a really great overview of issues that women need to think about. We learned a lot of terms that put a name to phenomena I had noticed in real life. The WR intensive option also a really great deal if you need a WR credit.",
    "Definitely! Very interesting and relevant class that changes the way you view gender dynamics in every day life.",
    "Sex, Markets and Power is a MUST take here at Yale. It is an amazing class that combines econ with women's gender studies. I really appreciate the crossover in the class amongst various subjects. This class is very fascinating and if you're not taking it for writing credit then it isn't a large workload. I learned more from this class than I have at any other class at Yale. Praise SMP.",
    "Sex, Markets, Power is a decent introduction to the ways in which gender norms interact with politics and economics on a global scale. Professor Rosenbluth is an enthusiastic, knowledgeable, and caring instructor who takes an interest in her students despite the size of the lecture. That being said, her powerpoint presentations (and overall lesson plan) lacked structure and organization, and it seemed as though the same concepts were explained every other lecture. Additionally, the writing intensive assignments (three essays that build on each other) were horrendous. The structure and scope was so proscribed that it often felt like I was squeezing my thoughts into a rigid rubric instead of learning how to write effectively or truly explore\/analyze my chosen topic.",
    "Such an intriguing and thought-provoking course. I'm glad I took it when I did. I wish I hadn't taken it as a WR because I felt my TA graded harshly and I knew more than enough material to get a good grade if I had taken the course as a non-WR. I didn't like the WR system of writing three papers on the same self-chosen topic. It got very boring midway through the 2nd paper. Having to write on the same topic throughout the semester was not investigative, it was redundant.",
    "ABSOLUTELY RECCOMMEND! The class material is very interesting",
    "I only signed up for SMP to get a writing credit, but it ended up being a truly fascinating course that taught me so much. If you are considering taking it, I definitely would! Regardless of your major, it is interesting, fun, and not too much work.",
    "Great course",
    "Very on the surface class about inequalities between men and women",
    "Interesting but repetitive.",
    "This is a good class for anyone to do well in.",
    "I have already recommended it. It is a class opening up ideas about relationships in history and now about men and women and how societal norms came to be.",
    "Yes, I would recommend PLSC 427 to another student. I enjoyed this course tremendously. The subject material was incredibly interesting, and Professor Rosenbluth was a very engaging lecturer. The workload was also pretty light, and the readings were interesting.",
    "Sex, Markets, and Power is a very manageable WR Credit that covers a plethora of incredibly relevant topics.",
    "Definitely recommend.",
    "You need to take this whether or not you care about gender roles - this class will teach you about society the way no other class will!",
    "Take it!",
    "Wonderful course. Workload is fair. Content is extremely interesting. Lecturer-Professor Rosenbluth-is very engaging, will always answer your questions, and the T.A.'s are wonderful in discussion section. I have learned so much about how gender inequality permeates everyday life, the adaptationist and blank slate perspectives, and how we can exert political and economic power to make the change we wish to see in the world.",
    "take this because topics are interesting but taught badly",
    "This was a great WGSS course that also helps Poli Sci majors.",
    "For a political science class, this class is a little bit different in the material covered. You will learn a few interesting things but nothing particularly extraordinary.",
    "It's a superb Credit\/D class if you're looking for something with minimal work that's going to make you think about the way you conduct your everyday life.",
    "Great Great class! Must take!",
    "Take this class if you actually want to learn about women's subordinate place in the world relative to men: how it came to be this way, how it is perpetuated and what we can do to stop it. Rosenbluth is great, really knowledgeable and passionate about the topic. Very interesting and low stress.",
    "Definitely recommend. Take this class. Workload is pretty light, the tests are so reasonable and conceptual (not like many nit-picking political science classes are), and the material is really important for everyone to learn!",
    "I would recommend this class to a fellow student as a lecture that teaches very important material and has a light workload.",
    "Fabulous course! I came away from Sex, Markets and Power with such a better understanding of the implications of gender in economics, politics, and interpersonal relationships. Professor Rosenbluth is a great professor who truly cares about students. She is always open to questions, and her lectures are clear and engaging. You will definitely NOT be bored in this class. This course opened my eyes to so many forms of statistical discrimination and implicit bias based solely on gender. Take this course. You won't regret it!",
    "Easy but somewhat boring and repetitive content. Did not feel like I gained much from the class.",
    "need to know this info for your life and your soul",
    "I would probably recommend the class since it was very interesting and also a fairly easy class. It got repetitive toward the end, however.",
    "Take this class! Super interesting, useful, applicable to real life and a great intro to WGSS if you're not ready to 100% commit to the main WGSS classes.",
    "The course should really be called \"Men suck\". Not sure if it was worth an entire semester.",
    "Take this course! It is easy to do well if you try. It is very accessible stuff too! I can see people of all kinds of majors doing well in Sex, Markets, and Power. I came in unsure, but left with an unwavering, enthusiastic approval of this course. Frances is practically my favorite professor at this point. I enjoyed her leading the way as we looked at women's status through the three frameworks of biology, markets, and power. I took this non-WR, so there was one 5-page paper (30%) that investigates a causal relationship related to the course or a suggested policy proposal that solves a problem related to the course. You have so much time to do it that you can make it as hard or as easy on yourself as possible. The one-hour, in class midterm (30%) is ID choice and essay choice. TFs do a great job of tipping you off to what the IDs may be. The final is an extended version of the midterm with more choice. Again, TFs tip you off on what the IDs are. It is 40% of the grade. TAKE THIS CLASS! If you didn't enjoy it, you must have never come to class or something...",
    "For someone with no experience in this field, this class is a great intro. Not too demanding, easy to follow and very eye opening.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to any and all students.",
    "Do not take this course. This course is a disjointed, poorly-planned, and uninteresting lecture that often teaches lessons unsupported by research or evidence of any kind. Rosenbluth does not understand the concept of correlation not equaling causation, and it really shows in almost every lecture. Yes, it's a gut, but there are far better guts at Yale.",
    "I would recommend this course because it offers an intellectual approach to topics that we discuss and face on a daily basis. The gendered lens of the course offers insight into how obvious differences in gender can contribute to non-obvious consequences related to economics and power.",
    "It's a good class that discusses interesting material. I would definitely recommend it!",
    "I would recommend this class to other students. Some of the things you learn are pretty obvious but you do learn about less obvious or less known plights women face.",
    "This was a really interesting class. You pretty much don't need to do the reading as everything in the exam is covered thoroughly in lectures. It was very interesting for me to see this topic through the three lenses on biology politics and economics, although a lot of the stuff we covered was sort of common sense but giving an explanation\/ theory behind it. I liked how much free reign we had to write the final paper and research whatever we wanted.",
    "The course gave me an extensive and profound view of all the challenges and opportunities of women around the world. I would highly recommend the course, no matter what of the student's background or career interests may be. It adds significant value to you in an individual basis as well as a professional one, and keeps you interested and motivated throughout.",
    "I recommend this class! I really enjoyed it and I liked learning about such practical applications of market- unlike other classes with an econ lens, I felt like I was actually being told how market forces affect real lives. A lot of the information I learned felt very applicable. Could easily be a 5th class. I was really happy to see a lot of men taking it (even if some were taking for the writing credit, they still learned!) The theories about globalization were most interesting. It does get repetitive, I don't feel like a ton of new information was taught between the midterm and final. I like Professor Rosenbluth's lecture style but I feel like she wasted some opportunities (for example, her lecture on college assault was cursory and ill-informed at best; I was sad because there were many people in the room who could've benefited from some education in that realm). She is very clear, I liked listening to her lectures. Tends to get repetitive-- I don't feel like a ton of new information was taught between the midterm and final. She comes across like a resolutely 2nd wave feminist despite attempts to be more aware.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. It's just a good way to be exposed to a woman's narrative in traversing different societies.",
    "Very interesting course unlike any other course in the Poli Sci department at Yale.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS!!! The material is so interesting and the workload isn't much. It's such a good class and I would recommend everyone to take it, no matter your interests.",
    "Good PoliSci course that is very interesting especially if you are interested in gender inequality and real life political, social, and economic issues",
    "This is a pretty easy \"gender studies\" -esque class that has a few important themes\/lessons but is otherwise pretty devoid of real content. I wouldn't say I recommend it, but I don't regret taking it.",
    "Easy and relevant class. Would definitely recommend!",
    "Great class. Lectures are interesting and helpful. The material is well structured. Would recommend to anyone.",
    "Excellent class",
    "Would reccomend. Light load but very engaging, I find myself examining women's and gender issues with a better understanding of the context.",
    "Yeah sure. Great for a 5th class.",
    "Great class! Definitely take it.",
    "The class itself was eh. I'd recommend it for the light work load and some interesting discussion on specific issues but overall it was quite exclusively white, heteronormative feminism, which I didn't really appreciate.",
    "This was the worst class I have ever taken at Yale. Yes it theoretically has a light workload (midterm, final, five-page paper), but DO NOT BE FOOLED. It not only taught me absolutely nothing, but I think I actually lost braincells sitting in these lectures. When the professor wasnt reading the axes of graphs as if we didnt , which was the majority of the slides, she was making generalizations like (i kid you not) people in Africa and people in India, not to mention the insensitivity of using Latinx\/Hispanic as interchangeable terms, and saying sexual assault isnt actually as prevalent as we might have thought with a slide picture of a girl crying in the fetal position. She explained concepts like intersectionality in a few minutes without any nuance, and yet somehow spent like 5 lectures on the plough (literally, the agriculture tool). About halfway through the semester, I realized the only way to stay sane through the lectures was to not do any reading, because if you did, you notice when the professor said things that were blatantly wrong (which happened almost every class. Any interesting question posed was never answered, but instead each class reached conclusions like women have differing opinions from each other.But that was obvious, since this professor thought this class would teach me something, and I (a woman) think this class was a waste of a credit.",
    "Overall a great course! Not particularly difficult, but very interesting, fun and rewarding. Professor Rosenbluth is the best teacher I've had at Yale even though it was a lecture. She is incredible. Definitely take this class.",
    "Sex, Markets, & Power is a very broad overview of the biological, economic, and political factors underlying gender inequality. I would definitely recommend it to anyone interested in better understanding how gender has continued to shape social norms, economic patterns, political representation, and so many other things. My only caveat is that this is a VERY broad class. You basically cover things like workplace discrimination, abortion, prostitution, etc. each in one fast-paced lecture that often makes it hard to process it all. Still, it's a very important class that I'm glad I took. I definitely think about gender in a more intellectual and complex way now, and I've already caught myself applying what I learned in class to everyday situations."
