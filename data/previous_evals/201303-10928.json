    "you read a play or two a week. its shakespeare. if you haven't read shakespeare, you should. its pretty simple",
    "Yes -- take this class! It will make you think and give you a fresh perspective on Shakespeare's work. The lectures are always insightful and enjoyable. My section was fantastic -- the best I have had at Yale. The plays are not easy, but you will come away from the class with a lot to think about. In terms of workload, the class is what you make it. To get a lot out of the experience, the class is a lot of work, but it is highly rewarding.",
    "Definitely take this course if you are interested in Shakespeare, regardless of your major. Kastan's lectures are great-- insightful and entertaining. Plays are all great. Very good pre-1800 class.Writing assignments aren't bad-- only three (one \"manic glossing\", one short essay, and one longer essay), and a take home final that takes ages. Most of the work comes from having to read another Shakespeare play (sometimes two) every week.",
    "You read a play a week (sometimes 2), and discuss them in class and section. 2 papers, one shockingly daunting glossing exercise, and a take home final. manageable and entertaining, worth it if you are willing to put in the work.",
    "A fantastic class--take it before you graduate, regardless of whether you're an English major. Professor Kastan is wonderful and the workload is very reasonable. You won't regret giving time to this class.",
    "ENGL201 was an excellent course and a great opportunity to read most of Shakespeare's Histories and Tragedies. While the Take-Home final was a little harsh (basically the equivalent of six papers in a week), I thoroughly enjoyed Professor Kastan's lecture and truthfully attended every single one of them. Professor Kastan is also just an awesome person--for want of a better word. If you have the time, take him up on his coffee offers. Not only do you get a free drink but you get to spend 1 hour in serious conversations about life. Totally worth it.",
    "Terrific lecture--Professor Kastan both manages to convey great insight into the plays and make you think about them in a new way, while being very down to earth and funny (I mean this both in the sense that he makes jokes\/tells stories outside of the plays all the time, but also in the sense that he puts the plays on a very immediate, personal and not at all exalted level).It's a dizzying sweep through a large part of Shakespeare (usually one, sometimes two plays a week), but I think reading the plays all in succession adds a lot of value, especially if you've already read or seen a lot of them or plan to do so in the future. You definitely fail to explore a lot in each play, which is a shame, but you do begin to see how the works speak to each other, and how Shakespeare takes up and re-works themes (this is most obviously true of the histories, as they actually proceed sequentially with overlapping characters, but is ale very true of the tragedies).",
    "I would recommend it if you are interested in Shakespeare. You do have to read a play a week and write a lot of essays. Also, watch out for the final, which is unexpectedly time consuming (6 separate essays), but the lectures are amazing and Professor Kastan is great.",
    "Take it if you need a pre-1800.",
    "A really great English lecture course. You will work harder than you expect. Still, Kastan's insights, and method of approaching the texts, are fascinating and will make you realize there's a lot more to Shakespeare than you expect.",
    "A fantastic course. Kastan is brilliant, hilarious, and quite friendly. He'll offer to meet with you outside of class and you definitely should. With three assignments and not-insignificant take home final, you'll be doing a decent amount of work, and you'll be reading a play a week. Lectures are excellent. We got to go to the Beinecke and just casually flip through original quartos and folios, which is an opportunity you probably won't get any other time in your life. This class was a highlight of my Yale experience and you had better take it.",
    "It's a good course to take if you're interested in Shakespeare and need to fulfill a pre-1800 requirement for the English major, but I would warn students of the tedium they'll encounter with some of the written assignments and the final. I personally like Professor Kastan a lot, though I can see how some students might find him arrogant or pedantic. Take him up on his offer to have coffee\u00e2\u0080\u0094he'll only grow on you.",
    "Yes, if you are interested in Shakespeare or literature as a whole. I do think I am \"smarter\" after taking this class--I am more attentive to textual details, and now push myself more to think about how words, structure, stage directions, etc. affect my understanding of the play.That being said, be prepared for extremely annoying (though rewarding) assignments, relatively harsh grading, and disorganised and sometimes boring lectures. I'm glad I stuck with it at the end, but I dreaded going to lecture many times during the semester.",
    "Yeah, if you need a pre-1800 and want to learn Shakespeare. The assignments really get you to think critically about the plays. Kastan is alright - funny, natural, kind of into himself, which might be warranted, I don't know. I wish his lectures were more informative in addition to being eloquent\/argumentative; often, things just didn't come through.",
    "So glad I took this class, it was absolutely fantastic. I always believed people who said Shakespeare's plays were great, but I didn't get it myself. Reading this set of plays along with Kastan's lectures has been probably *the* most rewarding academic experience at Yale for me. The readings are really good, the lectures are killer, and the assignments (of which there aren't very many) are themselves instructive. You'll be a better thinker and a better reader by the end of this class. I cannot recommend it highly enough. ALSO: take Kastan up on his offer to get coffee (just email him!), because he's even better one-on-one. And if he arranges a trip to the Beinecke to see their Shakespeare collection, go!",
    "yes",
    "ENGL201 was a fantastic opportunity to read a bunch of great plays. The sequence of plays we read really added an interesting meta-narrative to the course, and it was enjoyable to see how different plays address similar issues (the limits of tragedy, the problem of succession, etc.). The one critique I would have of the organization of plays is that the preponderance of history plays early on is really, really draining, because the histories are just so much more difficult to follow and understand than the tragedies. By the Henry IV plays, I found myself yearning for a change of pace in the course \u00e2\u0080\u0094 which I definitely got when we then turned to the tragedies, but the histories still kind of sucked.I recommend taking this class if you like Shakespeare and want to give yourself a reason to go through lots of the plays. But honestly, despite his renown, I don't think Kastan's lectures are always the most worthwhile. He tells people that he prepares them in the 24 hours before class, and while I kind of think he's lying, the course still lacks a cohesive lecture-to-lecture narrative. And often, you can get just as much out of reading the Norton introductions to the plays as you can in actually attending lecture\u00e2\u0080\u00a6so, it's a little easy to skip.Another note: It takes deceptively long to read the plays, especially if you don't have a great deal of experience with Shakespeare. You might think to yourself, \"oh, this play is just 60 pages, I could read it in two hours,\" but then you might find yourself reading for 8 hours and still not finishing.",
    "As a physics major, I can say that this class was one of the best and most interesting classes I've taken at Yale. Kastan is brilliant and the reason that this course is as good as it is. He is friendly and fun, which you'll discover just by shopping the course. You might think Shakespeare's histories would be a little dry, but trust me, they're just as interesting and complex as some of your favorite works. If you have any interest whatsoever in Shakespeare, you will not regret taking the course.",
    "I would most likely not recommend this course to another student. The plays were enjoyable, the writing assignments relatively few, but I didn't feel any sort of momentum in the course, partially due to the fact that this is a large lecture. Our section leader was wonderful, but section still sucked, mostly because people (it seemed) weren't at all interested in having generative conversations with each other. A pretty painless pre-18, but also uninspiring.",
    "It's not a bad pre-1800s credit for the English major, and Kastan is absolutely spectacular. If you're interested in Shakespeare, it's worth it for him.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS. It's much less reading than you think, and the assignments are actually pretty fun. Professor Kastan is a great lecturer, and his banter at the beginning of class is a great way to capture the audience. Have an open mind, and be prepared to understand how Shakespeare works in a profound way.",
    "Not your average easy lecture. Take this credit d to start and switch if you're doing well.",
    "It's a great course. An awesome way to become knowledgable about Shakespeare. As much as I hate to give Kastan the satisfaction, all of the assignments were really engaging and pushed you to think about the material in a meaningful way. Top to bottom a great class.",
    "Shakespeare is a good class taught by a great lecturer. The reading list moves too quickly to fully appreciate the works, and the take home exam is significantly longer than necessary. Ultimately, you should think about if you want to read Shakespeare in a lecture setting -- I don't think it's ideal, but it is entertaining and certainly a better pre-1800 option.",
    "If you like Shakespeare and want to read his major histories and tragedies then yeah take it. Kastan is brilliant and engaging even if you haven't read the plays every class. The assignments are annoyingly unstructured but if you just write a ton when they say \"write as much as you need to\" then you should be fine.",
    "ENGL 201 is an insightful, rigorous and entertaining introduction to Shakespeare. Professor Kastan analyzes each play over two class periods, while extrapolating from them to discuss what a Shakespearean \"history\" or \"tragedy\" is. The class also focuses on comparing editions of Shakespeare--for example, whether to rely on the quarto or folio of King Lear--aided by visits to the Beinecke to see Yale's unparalleled Shakespeare collection. Professor Kastan makes a point of getting to know his students over coffee. He routinely jests with students at the start of lecture so that the class does not feel too formal. There are four assignments, two of which have no page limit. They involve researching etymologies in the OED, making arguments based on spelling or word differences between quartos and folios, as well as traditional close reading. I learned an incredible amount in this class and highly recommend it to other students.",
    "You read all the tragedies and histories. Professor is mental but brilliant. You will regret taking this course during finals period. The exam is evil though very interesting and fun if you had time to do it.Having made it through finals so glad I took this course!!TAKE IT.",
    "Take it before you graduate! Where else would you read all of Shakespeare's histories and tragedies if not at Yale? Kastan is a great lecturer, don't let that daunt you, and his essay prompts really help you grow and develop as an analytical thinker and critical writer.",
    "Take it if you love Shakespeare, take it if you need to fulfill the pre-1800 English major requirement, take it if you are vaguely interested in Shakespeare and are looking for a good Credit\/D.",
    "Definitely recommend. The assignments take some time, but they really force you to engage with the material.",
    "Yes, it is great to familiarize yourself with these plays! However, I don't think I walked out of the course with a better understanding of Shakespeare in general. It taught me about close reading, and that's about it. Also - hard grading and very hard final exam.",
    "Excellent course--I would certainly recommend this class to other English majors, especially those looking for a pre-1800.",
    "I could not recommend this class more! Just be prepared for an unusually heavy workload.",
    "Shakespeare survey course, one to two plays read each week. Three written assignments and one take-home. If you love Shakespeare, take it.",
    "Great class. The assignments take a lot of time, and the reading can feel like a lot, but you learn SO much. So happy I took this class at Yale.",
    "An engaging and memorable introduction to Shakespeare's histories and tragedies: a valuable course on what it means to be human.Should you take Shakespeare at Yale with David Scott Kastan? Say it out loud a couple more times, and the answer should be an obviousyes. You will not regret taking this course. You might regret taking the course while you're slogging through the manic glossing assignment, or struggling to come up with an original take on Hamlet, or struggling to decode Shakespeare's multi-layered and complex history plots. But as Professor Kastan assured us, 'tis true: this course will make you smarter. And more importantly, it will make you a better human being.So come one, come all! What are you waiting for? This lecture is always packed for a reason. People vote with their feet. Shakespeare and Kastan are an irresistible combination. Don't take it from me. Be there.",
    "Great lectures, fun papers (Kastan smugly tells you they make you smarter, and you don't want to believe him but they actually will), even section is enjoyable. Would absolutely recommend! Not a lot of reading, only a play a week.",
    "Take this class! I was really skeptical at first - Kastan seems like a total asshole for the first month because he's really brilliant and knows it, and because he doesn't mind going on random tangents or picking on students in the class. But the power of his interpretations (which are not always standard Shakespeare interpretations) will win you over.Get coffee with Professor Kastan. He offers, and you'll be hesitant to take him up on it because it seems weird to get coffee with a lecture professor, but you should do it. My opinion of his class changed when I got coffee with him and realized that he is one of the most caring and most normal English professors in the department!His assignments are not standard, which turns out to be a blessing, even though it requires more work, because you learn a ton. Don't be afraid of that.Take this if you're a sophomore English major - you'll need both the material and the skills he teaches for upper-level courses, so don't wait until you're a senior in the major (like me) to take it. Seniors in other majors should take it, though, because it's one of those courses that completes your liberal arts education.",
    "The take-home final is huge, and the papers are no joke. The grading on all of this material can be tough, but it is all so worth it. Take it and you'll understand.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class if you want to read Shakespeare.",
    "Yes; for anyone interested in learning more about Shakespeare's work.",
    "A great course. Take it. It's hard to keep up with the reading, but you will leave the class able to talk knowledgeably about many of Shakespeare's greatest works. Plus Kastan is a terrific lecturer.",
    "Professor Kastan is the Lebron James of Shakespeare. Just take the class.",
    "This was an amazing course. Professor Kastan is outstanding. He is incredibly passionate, interesting, and inspiring. The assignments here are \"annoying\" as he calls them, and they are totally worth it. I never felt like I was performing just for a grade in this class, but we all worked hard just the same. I definitely recommend this course.",
    "Yes, but take it for Shakespeare, not for Kastan",
    "Yes, yes, yes! As someone who hates lectures in general, I need a professor who you HAVE to listen to and Professor Kastan more than fits that description. His readings of the play have so much heart and warmth in them and he's just a joy to listen to. If you take this class and don't go to every lecture, you're wasting an opportunity to learn from the best. Reading load is fast but manageable and the papers are eccentric but pretty rewarding. Take it!",
    "If you don't take this class, you are seriously at risk of wasting your education here. Not only will your scholarship be better, but your life will be better for taking this class. Kastan is an absolute genius and one of the best lecturers you'll ever hear--I had three classes before this one every day and I was wide awake, excited for this one. If you can get Kirk as a tf, do it--great, interesting guy. Best class I've taken at yale, and probably the best I ever will take.",
    "I would recommend this class to everyone - whether or not you like Shakespeare or English, you will learn an incredible amount from Kastan, the TAs and most importantly, of course, from reading Shakespeare's plays.",
    "One of the must-take courses at Yale! Professor Kastan is simply inspiring. You will come away with a deeper understanding and appreciation of the beauty of Shakespeare's plays.",
    "Amazing introduction to shakespearean tragedies. A lot of work and challenges but definitely worths it. Anyone who likes English and Shakespeare should take this course!!",
    "Read Shakespeare, go to lecture, write papers."
