    "Very interesting class, I learned as much from the other students as I did the professor.",
    "Though a bit all-over-the-place (is it an anthro course? a political media course?), the material is incredibly interesting and the professor top-notch. Given the role of oratory and rhetoric in contemporary society, this course is a must-take.",
    "Yes, I would recommend it, especially if you are looking to familiarize yourself with present political oratory and anthropology in general.",
    "No.",
    "Anthropology of Oratory and Rhetoric is amazing. Amazing. It's definitely one of the most rewarding classes I've taken at Yale, and has caused me to rethink how language is used in the public sphere as well as in day-to-day interactions. The class combines a varied array of readings centering around the general subject of \"linguistic anthropology,\" along with applications to the contemporary political scene (rife with Jon Stewart, Stephen Colbert, and of course Fox News). Student workshop presentations are great and thought-provoking. Just take the class while you have the chance--this material is taught nowhere else.",
    "If you can swallow the anthro\/ethno side, go for it.",
    "This course looks at the cultural and material context in which rhetoric occurs and calls that thing \"rhetoric.\" Unfortunately, the course is not more profound that a bunch of re-namings. You learn to call all language \"trope\" instead of what most people think of as trope. The course ignores \"standard average European\" rhetoric, and attempts to show why that tradition is limited. The course is *far less* interesting than it pretends to be. People who study rhetoric can (and occasionally do)talk very easily about most of the things the things this course talks about, using different, more descriptive, and more widely accepted language. Unless you know that you are an anthropology major, do not take this course. Do not take this course thinking that you will get \"a different, interesting take on rhetoric.\" You will not. You will get an uninteresting take on something that is not rhetoric.",
    "I recommend! I am in no way an anthro person and really liked this course. If you are a news junkie, you have to take this course. You will watch more Glenn Beck and Jon Stewart than you ever imagined.",
    "This is a really fun eclectic class. You look at contemporary political\/cultural phenomenon in a particular framework of oratory and rhetoric that Prof. Bate lays out. This framework is a little odd and sometimes hard to get a grasp of (don't get totally scared away by lots of words you don't understand on the first day). It lays out an interesting approach, but drags a bit towards the end of the semester.The class is built around student participation - presentations and in lectures.Prof. Bate is really wonderful. He is witty and sharp and forces you to think about things in new ways.",
    "Take it if you like to talk poltics and you are interested in linguistics. I enjoyed it a lot",
    "If you're interested in an introduction to the discipline of anthropology, this is a great class to accomplish that.",
    "As a non-major, I had no idea what to expect coming into this class. It was fun to attend, and the workshops (concerning current events) were usually very well run by the students themselves. The essays are mostly geared at close analysis of the course readings, and are not too difficult to do as a non-major. The class depends on the students in it, and our class happened to be very intelligent. Barney Bate was dynamic and a totally fascinating character. This was a totally unique (albeit sometimes very tangential and scattered) class and I'd recommend it to anyone if they are at all interested by the syllabus.",
    "Very dynamic and engaging. I didn't know what was going on half the time, but looking back over the notes and doing the reading helped a lot. Bate presented a LOT of really interesting and controversial ideas. Papers were very focused on the reading and graded pretty easily in my opinion. Take it if you want to hear really interesting ideas about oratory and rhetoric and talk about things ranging from Glen Beck to Tamil.",
    "In this class, you analyze a lot of classic American rhetoric as well as speaking in other societies (Tamil, Wolof, and a few others). There are three papers, a final paper and a presentation. The class switches between lectures (which are often way too obscure to understand, and which often end up becoming debates between two or three students instead of actual lectures) and student-run workshops, so it's a fairly small lecture that encourages student participation, if you like that. Professor Bate is also very nice, receptive and a fair grader. Now for the cons. Do NOT be fooled by the other reviews saying this is the best class ever. I was drawn in by the first class, when we analyzed a Daily Show clip, but as the class went on I found the lectures and readings extremely obscure and inaccessible; there's a lot of theory, while all most of the students want to talk about is American politics. Whenever I listened, spoke, read or wrote a paper for this class, I felt like everything was in a different language, and that everything I was learning was utter nonsense. I ended up getting very little out of this class, other than a renewed disgust for Glenn Beck.",
    "It seemed like much more of an analysis of rhetoric and an anthropological study of African and Tamil speakers than an anthropological study of western rhetoric. If you're interested in rhetorical analysis take it, but don't be surprised if you end up not learning the mindblowing nonWestern approach to it.",
    "It's a great class. It really changes how you think about politics and the public sphere. There is a lot of reading but most of it is very interesting. It's not like most other linguistic anthropology classes because a lot of the issues it tackles seemed much broader--definitely worth taking even if you have no experience with linguistics or anthropology.",
    "Definitely recommend it. Sometimes seems a bit anthro-based, but it is all what you want it to be, oratory\/rhetoric related of course. Really enjoyed learning from Bate and his area of focus (Tamil oratory). But a huge chunk of the class is on American politics\/political-comedy, which is always entertaining - and insightful too.",
    "This class encompasses history and modern day oratory and relays how that affects political rhetoric. I would recommend this class as long as you are a deep thinker and enjoy thinking abstractly.",
    "A great course, very interesting. It may not be for everyone, and some will find the views expressed, particularly Professor Bate's, a tad farfetched. Some like myself, however, will find his views very enlightening and quite provocative of further thought. The course is set up well, and Bate's lectures are often phenomenal. One warning I would offer is that students new to anthropology, like myself, may at times find themselves at a loss due to anthropologists' seemingly ubiquitous love of blatantly unnecessarily complicated vocabulary. This is not to scare you away, just to warn you.A fine orator in his own right, Bate gives wonderful lectures--and the fact that the course tends to center around his own theses is not necessarily a bad thing at all. He is, however, a little prone to inflated vocabulary, but this is sometimes a good thing. With regard to his paper grading, the seemed to be a solid consensus among the students that he was ready to hand out high grades pretty quickly to papers that agreed with the general theses discussed, and quick to give poorer grades to papers that tried to take issue. This is not to say, however, that he did not welcome counter-views in class discussion.",
    "Without question one of my favorite courses at Yale so far. The ways Barney and this course demanded us all to critically examine our communication changed the way I approach ALL my school work. It's not about \"learning\" a standard set of things you need to know, but it's about truly examining what we can observe--for this class, people talking to each other--and thinking about it in ways that make us build more understanding of the world. In this class, it was an amazing search for understanding of our country's politics, our understandings of rhetoric, and our assumptions of speaking in general. Challenge yourself to get everything out of this great course.",
    "This was a worthwhile course. It's more or less an analysis of political speech and current events from both a contemporary and global\/anthropological perspective. The reading is good, but not a necessity especially because the course is run such that there is a lecture on Monday and then a class presentation on Wednesdays. This means that you'll have to lead on session of the class in a group presenting a contemporary political speech or something similar. While I found that the course was really exciting and relevant for the first half, it became a bit disorganized and repetitive around the middle and to the end. Overall though I am definitely glad I took it.",
    "The class begins with an exploration on what anthropology of oratory and rhetoric means. We then look at different case studies on the subject matter in order to understand what it means for different societies cultures and genders. The class is intertwined with student presentations on different materials discussed in class. However, the class is a tad scattered in it's presentation.",
    "Interesting way to view oratory and gender. Lots of student independence to guide the class's focus: about a third of the way through, every other class was a student-led workshop on analyzing (usually) contemporary oratory. Professor Bate is quirky, entertaining and a great discussion leader."
