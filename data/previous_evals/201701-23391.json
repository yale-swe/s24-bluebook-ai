   "comments": [
    "I really had the opportunity to tighten my writing skills and work on a style of essay writing that was more argumentative and less frilly. In the first semester I mainly just thought critically about style over content, but now my essays are fairly content driven.",
    "I improved my ability to write a historical and political thought paper.",
    "H&P is definitely the most interdisciplinary class of DS, which I really found enjoyable and enlightening. I think, perhaps, the defining term of this course might be \"mores.\" Most of the texts we read and discussions we had centered around the way that customs influence a state, how shifts in the understanding of human nature\/morality cause shifts political ideas. I think the sort of analysis of moral customs and historical events Tocqueville accomplishes in Democracy in America is the ultimate goal of the course, a text I found really invaluable in aiding my understanding of the flaws and virtues of the American experiment, for instance.",
    "I learned that I didn't want to do political philosophy, though I am very glad I read the works that I did."

   "comments": [
    "I really enjoyed the course except I missed the \"starters\" from my last H&P class where one student would begin the conversation with planned questions on the text.",
    "Prof. Oskian tends to lecture a lot in class, but her discussions are otherwise positive (about average for a DS class), and the lecturing is often quite informative if you pay attention.",
    "The texts thankfully feel more connected than last semester, but I was thoroughly disappointed by the absence of exclusively historical texts, and the inclusion of exclusively philosophical texts.",
    "We go over works very quickly, but we also cover a lot of material, so the pace of the class is both a strength and a weakness.",
    "The syllabus of this course is just so fantastic that the strength of the class is unavoidably derived from the content of the texts. I think the DS H&P lectures were the most immersive\/engaging as well (probably because the core ideas are normally more readily accessible in the H&P texts than philosophy, for example, so the lecturer can spend more time diving into the texts rather than translating the main arguments). Our seminar discussions, although always helpful in shaping my understanding of the texts, were a bit quiet and hazy at times (which was at least partly due to the students' disengagement\/mid-afternoon exhaustion) but, nonetheless, I think if some of the questions lobbied by the professor (along with the rest of us students) were a bit more controversial or colorful, discussion might have been a bit more substantive at times."

   "comments": [
    "I certainly would. DS HP was one of my favorite courses this semester, and probably thus far at my time at Yale.",
    "I became a greater writer but mostly just fell in love with books I would have never thought to enjoy without the guidance of a professor.",
    "Conditionally. I did not enjoy myself this semester but much of that had to do with my class, my instructor, and my personal engagement.",
    "Yes, I would recommend all of directed studies to any humanities inclined student.",
    "Although perhaps not the most engaging seminar out of all of mine, I would definitely still recommend taking the class .As this course is part of Directed Studies, I suppose the question must be whether or not I would recommend taking Directed Studies. From my experience throughout this year, I have found the program to be extremely beneficial in rooting me in the foundational texts which I know I will always be turning back to, hopefully to dig into further throughout my time at Yale and beyond. Taking DS I think really helps you orient yourself, both in your studies at school but also in how you see the world as it currently surrounds you. The program helps you see how we got to now, why we are the way we are. Regardless of what major you might be thinking of, if it is feasible in your 4-year schedule, I would definitely recommend taking DS to gain a greater appreciation and understanding of the power of ideas throughout history have in shaping your present experience.",
    "Yes. Its hard but you get the hang of it, and pay off is worth it."
