    "EVERYTHING AMAZING",
    "Everyone starts this course at a different stage of knowledge of statutory law, or even of the immigration and U.S. political system. Professor Dufresne promises to catch people up to speed, more or less, and she keeps her promise if the student is also willing to keep up with the classwork to the best of his\/her ability. There is a LOT of work, but this is one class where you truly reap what you sow.Fantastic course, with a fantastic instructor. This course, even if the quality of the students were lower (and they were top notch) would not lag due to the effort and energy of Professor Dufresne in teaching it. I thoroughly enjoyed the eclectic mix of activities, exercises, newspaper and textbook readings, and especially the Professor's comments on how to keep thetime spent on the homework to a certain time to \"simulate\" the busy schedule of the immigration judge\/lawyer\/policymaker. Truly an interactive course, that brought all the benefits of a college seminar with the \"applied\" learning tools that middle and high school teachers try to give their students.The students themselves also work in groups at the beginning, and prepare oral arguments together almost in a mock trial every week. During the semester and especially before the final exam, all the students bonded with each other and were extremely collaborative at tackling each challenge.",
    "BEST CLASS I HAVE TAKEN AT YALE. The professor will warn you that the amount of work is soul crushing. And at times it is. The final feels brutal, but the classes are fascinating, challenging and totally worth it. I didnt really have time to work on other courses because I was also spending so much time with my extracurriculars, but this class is COMPLETELY WORTH IT. Professor Dufresne is a rockstar. Everything about her is really cool and impressive, I dont think there was a person in the class who didnt admire her and spend as much time with her as possible. Our class also got really close through the course work. SO great!YES TAKE THIS CLASS",
    "This is a really amazing class that you should definitely take. Be prepared to be devoting much more time to this course than you will to any of your other courses, especially if you have little background in law. But it is all worth it. People in the course support each other and work together and it makes all of the work fun and painless.",
    "TAKE IT. This was the best course I have taken at Yale and I am a second semester senior. Don't be afraid of the course load. I took it while writing my thesis, and while it was much at times, it was totally doable and totally worth it. I have never learned so much in a single course at Yale. This course draws really interesting and really passionate students. I would definitely recommend it.",
    "If you want to go into law or learn about the us immigration system it is a must.",
    "It's a great class! Take it!",
    "Excellent; challenging but doable and entirely worth it.",
    "The very best introduction to law and immigration law you can hope to have. I learned about immigration law, but more generally, statutory analysis for case-arguments, policy rationales, as well as smaller bits in judicial review, administrative law, governmental structure, and so on. Basically, this is a review of one field of law that you can later apply to other fields. While we do talk about policy, we don't really deal with politics. =================== Professor Dufresne: Best professor ever! Super-knowledgeable about the field, full of interesting anecdotes on immigration court, while also very good at detecting the important points and making sure that students realize those points themselves organically (through case-arguments and post-mortems). Rarely boring. Overall just a great professor. =============== Classmates: there's definitely great student-student interaction; some of my classmates were already very involved in issues in the topic outside of class; very interesting but often long assignments ================ Class structure: the class is divided into two sides, representing the government and the noncitizen (you switch alfway through). Often, one student argues a case for each side, and then the entire sides are allowed to argue the cases. The sides also argue on other issues too. This works really well. =================== Homework: there's a ton of readings. You read through Legomsky's Immigration Law book (>1000 pages) over the semester; law is not literature; it takes longer to read and retain. There's usually a weekly assignment that takes on average 3 or so hours (after readings), which are usually interesting. There are tons of group assignments too, which are great, but make sure you keep your group on-topic.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS. It changed my life --- I had not been considering law school before it, and now I am. Even more importantly, I know now a ton about immigrants' rights and immigration issues that I was not aware of before. Professor Dufresne is wonderful and inspiring.",
    "This is an exceptional class! You should take it if you have an interest in immigration or if you have an interest in law; policy, however, is not as much of a focus.The course is an rapid but highly detailed study of immigration law. We covered almost all (~90%) of an immigration law textbook (~1400 pages) during the semester and had weekly \"oral arguments\"--essentially debates in the style that would be used in court--starting about 1\/3 of the way into the semester. The debates are excellent and not nearly as intimidating as they sound; our group met the night before each class to prepare.You will be expected to participate frequently and if you don't do the reading it will hurt you. The weekly assignments are each works of art that Professor Dufresne has carefully designed to help build a particular skill. They're generally not unreasonably long but her expectations are quite high. Her feedback is clear and helpful but very slow in coming--you might wait weeks to receive responses on some assignments and on some you might never get feedback at all.The final was reasonable and she was very clear about how it would function; we were well-prepared, I felt, although we did need to study. Stay caught up on the readings and you'll be fine.Professor Dufresne's teaching style is awesome; it definitely helped convince me that I should apply to law school. If law is a possible career path for you and you'd like to make sure that legal reasoning is something you enjoy, consider taking a Dufresne class, whether it's Immigration Law, Refugee Law, or her new Child Law (coming soon). And even if law isn't your thing, if you're into immigration, definitely take this course!",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class to any student interested in the law or in immigration issues. It will be the most difficult course you take in the social sciences, but absolutely worth it. Be prepared to devote your semester to the class, but also be prepared to accomplish more than you thought you could and learn a tremendous amount about immigration law and the US legal system in general."
