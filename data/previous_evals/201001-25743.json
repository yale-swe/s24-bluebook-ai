   "comments": [
    "Not recommended. Unless with Frame or if you need it.",
    "YES. This class is extremely interesting, though try to get into one of Fraeme's sections.",
    "Standard multivariable calculus class. Nothing special. Take it with Frame if you can (or just sit in on his section).",
    "Take it, but only if you really have to or are interested in the course material.",
    "It is a good class to take after BC calculus in high school. It begins as a simple class and then very quickly gets difficult. The tests are really hard.",
    "Math 120 is a standard calculus class. It's a lot like 115 (BC) but with extra variables. If you were good at calculus in high school, don't be afraid of this class. I recommend taking it as early as possible so you can move on to higher math or physics (if you are a science major or a premed).",
    "MATH 120 is Multivariable Calculus -- vectors, triple integrals, spherical and cylindrical integrals, Green's Theorem, Stokes' Theorem, Divergence Theorem, etc. It's definitely good information to know if you're planning on doing anything that requires calculus. But be aware that this is in general a really poorly taught class, unless you get Professor Frame. Many of the other instructors are difficult to understand, and their explanations are confusing. The final is really tough, and it's easy to lose a lot of points on the midterms because of forgetting to study one thing. It's not that much work (one problem set per week that maybe takes 1-2 hours at most), but the material can be hard to wrap your headaround. It made me really not like math.",
    "A required math class that is way too hard for its own good. If you have to take it, go ahead. But take it with Frame, or just skip out on the classes...",
    "It's a challenging course. Would recommend it if you are prepared to do reading outside the lectures and problem sets. The midterms and final exam contain questions not covered in lectures or in the book.",
    "It is a challlenging course, only take it if you really like math or need the course for later. I learned alot",
    "I would only take Math 120 if it is a requirement or pre-requisite of your major. Math 120 was very frustrating most of the time, because of how poorly-taught it is. If you can get Professor Frame, you will have a much more enjoyable experience in this course. If you have to take Math 120, be prepared to commit a lot of time to self-teaching because the material will not be taught well in class.",
    "This really depends on whether you find math interesting and whether you plan on using this class for a requirement. It is kinda fun learning to think in different ways, but this won't be enough if you don't have another reason to take this class."
