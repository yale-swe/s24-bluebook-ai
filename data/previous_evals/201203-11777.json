    "A good introduction to conducting.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone interested in gaining a solid foundation in orchestral conducting. This syllabus is applicable to conductors of various levels of experience and skill.",
    "This is a great way to learn the basics of conducting. I would recommend it to anyone serious about music, or to anyone who wants to learn how to start conducting.",
    "It's a good class, not a lot of work at all. A lot of class time is spent watching the rest of the class conduct excerpts so you don't get a ton of podium time, but I still learned a lot of stuff.",
    "In short: no matter what your level of experience may be, you will learn something from this class. If you can pass the placement test, you should take it -- you never know when conducting will come in handy! (Usually at a rehearsal or concert.)",
    "If you want to learn conducting this is a good course. There will be too many students, but that is balanced by an excellent teacher."
