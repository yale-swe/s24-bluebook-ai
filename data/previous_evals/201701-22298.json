    "This course, more than any other I've taken in the department, taught me how to do close analysis of (non-contemporary) philosophical texts. The pace of the course, which proceeded at one chapter of the text per week (where one chapter amounted to a couple dozen lines or so), facilitated this, as did the essays, which (at least the first one) encouraged us to analyze small snippets of the text. I also learned to balance that close reading with more global analysis: that is, I learned to interpret any particular chapter of the text by considering its place in the overall project of the book.",
    "Acquaintance with issues in metaphysics, facility with close textual analysis, familiarity with contemporary scholarship on these topics, development of rigorous thinking and argumentation"

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The primary strength of this course was its pace. Reading a text as dense as Aristotle's requires slow, deliberate, close reading, and so the one chapter per week pace was much appreciated (I sense that some thought this was a weakness of the course). Another strength was the technological set-up of the CTL, which enabled us to Skype in professors and students from other universities to participate in our discussions. Some of these professors later visited the class in person, and since they were present via Skype for the earlier discussions, they did not fall prey to the familiar pitfall that other guest lecturers in other courses sometimes encounter, namely, lecturing without any sense of the continuity of the course. One weakness of the course was the fact that it was the second of a multi-part course, which in itself is not a weakness, but made the early weeks of the course difficult for those of us who weren't present for the first part of the course. I wonder if David could have done more to loop us into the discussion, perhaps offering a separate meeting time outside of class to go over the parts of book Z we missed. Another weakness of the course was that David said on the first day that to accommodate both the needs of the philosophers in the room and the needs of the classicists, we would focus equally on interpretation (for the classicists) and actually evaluating the arguments (for the philosophers). Unfortunately, we did far more of the former than the latter (though is there really a hard and fast line between the two?). Interpretive discussions became especially thorny when they revolved around textual issues, since not all of us knew Greek.",
    "I thought the course was excellent, though I initially found it very difficult to get my bearings (I think other undergrads shared this view). If possible, I would recommend a more general introduction to the issues at hand at the beginning of the course, which I think would have helped some of the discussion earlier in the term get off the ground more. I appreciated the involvement of other scholars in the field. I thought the sessions went well and handouts were useful guides."

    "This course provided some of the most satisfying close reading experiences that I have had in the department (or in any other department, for that matter). Devoting oneself to a mere chapter of the text each week makes one realize just how much one may have missed when one first read Aristotle in Intro to Ancient Philosophy (or fall DS). David facilitated discussion in such a way that it was inclusive to both those of us who read Greek and those who didn't. Skyping in scholars from other universities throughout the semesters made great use of the technology at the CTL. I highly recommend this course to anyone who has some exposure to Aristotle, but would like to dig deeper.",
    "Yes, to other philosophy majors. However even other majors might find it too specialized -- one should have (as per the prereq) some established interest in ancient philosophy and metaphysics. The course was frustrating at first, because we read so closely and slowly, and began in the middle of the text. Ultimately, it's a course I think one reaps the benefits from slowly -- I think I will continue to think about these issues in more depth and return to this material to revise my thinking on it in the future. Overall, I highly recommend the course. Students should be sure to read the secondary sources provided and\/or do any additional reading needed to situate themselves in the context of the discussions. Professor Charles is excellent! Our course also benefited from (live, remote) input of other scholars in this field throughout the term. The seminar takes a relatively unique perspective on this material (seeing it through the lens of definition). Wish I had known Greek, but you don't need it (consult at least two different translations!)."
