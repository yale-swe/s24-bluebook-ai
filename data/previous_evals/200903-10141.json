   "comments": [
    "This is an excellent course, albeit one that required much more effort, time, and reading than I expected. For all I am concerned, this is really an upper-level, or even graduate level course. The students were required to read five academic books on film studies, in addition to countless articles and online resources. The reading load is heavy, and there was significant writing as well. The writing assignments were tough, I thought, very proscriptive, and the grading was also not a cup of tea. Nevertheless, I considered the class to be excellent, the instructor definitely knows his material, his approach is unique and engaging, and I would recommend it to another student.",
    "Take it for sure. Consider this class or Hollywood in the 21st Century with Ron Gregg - both are great.",
    "It's a class about the film industry, specifically how the business side interacts with (and affects) the art itself. Very interesting material; very good class; awesome prof. It's pretty much the only class at Yale that directly relates to entertainment, so don't miss it if you are interested in entering the business after graduation.",
    "It's an interesting class. Sometimes the material borders on b.s. but nonetheless, you won't look at Hollywood the same afterwards. There's a fair amount of reading and you have to put a lot of effort into preparing for the final.",
    "A fun class, very interesting. Way too much reading, but otherwise not bad on the work front. Lots of ins and outs of the film industry and a great movie list to watch. JD is fantastic too. At least shop it, and decide for yourself!",
    "Fun course. Lots to learn about the film industry. Little is taught about the business side of things at Yale. JD is great.",
    "Yes, definitely.",
    "Take it. You'll like the way you look, I guarantee it.",
    "Very hard and challenging film class. I would only recommend it to people genuinely interested in film and interested in pursuing it as a career.",
    "Take it if you are a film studies major and have never taken anything that has to do with the industry part of film. Really got me thinking about Hollywood studios and their influence on the style, marketing, producing of films.",
    "The course is about the history of hollywood, why movies get made, why people go to see them, why the films we see work well or don't... It's about where Hollywood has come from, where it is going, the intersection between industry and art. This is the most important film studies class at Yale in my opinion, bringing together formal film analysis with history of dealmaking and studio building.",
    "This class is a lot of fun, but also super challenging. I was riveted by Professor Connor's lectures, but I often emerged realizing that I did not quite understand every concept in the lecture. The readings are really important, but also hard to keep up with. The viewings are fantastic, Professor Connor is helpful and brilliant. Take it and do the work. Oh, and if you have never taken a film class before it's a bit harder - I was immensely grateful for having taken Film 150.",
    "I had no experience in film studies before I took this class, but I think it was a great introduction. The course material focuses on the business and culture of Hollywood and how industry changes are reflected in the films, which is super interesting from an economic, artistic, and cultural standpoint. The writing assignments are all very different and each is nice in its own way, and of course the movies are really fun. You don't really have to do much of the reading as long as you go to class and section, which is nice. Also, Professor Connor is a great lecturer, so class is always interesting and fun.",
    "I would summarize this class as an industrial look at the filmmaking process in Hollywood, being the seat of the American film industry itself. I would recommend this class in a second, as it provides an in-depth examination of the Hollywood process. This class was invaluable.",
    "Very good course for anyone interested in Hollywood, both watching and analyzing the films themselves, and learning about how the industry works (and the symbiotic relationship between the business side and the artistic output). Professor Connor (J.D.) is great - very enthusiastic and knowledgeable. Section I guess is a bit hit or miss from what I hear, but great lectures and mostly interesting films\/readings make this class worth taking. There's a lot of reading, but it mostly isn't necessary - everything important is covered in lecture anyway. Papers are pretty fun to write as well."
