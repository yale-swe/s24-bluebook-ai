   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this class over 225, but either way, be prepared to teach yourself the material if you have Professor Lee. It is interesting material.",
    "Professor Lee is a sensational teacher. I came into this class with trepidation, because everything pointed to a potential problem: his slight asian accent, the fact that it's a math lecture course, and that other previous classes he taught had received bad reviews. I'm someone who hasn't taken math for four years (!), so I thought it might be even more of a problem.It turned out that Lee is basically the best Math prof one can hope for. He isn't the sort of charismatic guy that's going to make you have a lifelong love for math or anything, but that isn't the point. He will allow you to learn the stuff well with as little pain involved as is possible. He genuinely wants you to do well in the course and doesn't make tests too hard. They feel fair and predictable, in the best way. He does his lectures clearly and methodically. Specific to Linear Algebra, the textbook was just sensational -- a different one than the crappy Strang one that other classes use.So, yes, take a class from Lee. He's honestly great.",
    "The course is dry and you probably won't enjoy it, but it's rather easy and Professor Lee offers a decent curve.",
    "The class can be very boring, so be careful.",
    "Take it if you need for your major. It's not so fun, in this form with no applications whatsoever. Prefer it with Prof. Feiszli.",
    "This course give you a basic understanding of linear algebra convering everything from Reduced Row Echelon Form up to Eigenvalues and vectors. Unfortunately there were almost no applications taught for these mathematical concepts. Good course though, it takes out the unnecessary theoretical aspects of 225.",
    "I took the course because I enjoy mathematics, but it was still very frustrating and not always a rewarding class. To be honest, I might not recommend this to another student.",
    "Take it if you need to, there's no reason to take it for fun. It isn't particularly hard but the curve may be difficult if everyone does well.",
    "\"with applications\" means \"without proofs\", not \"with how to represent a gradient with a matrix\"",
    "Fine class, you will learn the material. Not theoretical, very much oriented towards learning how to do the problems. Not super exciting but I feel the class was worthwhile.",
    "This class is very easy. So easy, in fact, that the curve gets bunched up and you need to be almost flawless to make a good grade. This was a nice class to take during an otherwise difficult semester. Professor Lee moves through the material very slowly (I wish we had covered more ground) but he is a very clear lecturer. After a couple lectures you get used to his accent, and you will learn a lot by coming to lecture.",
    "This class is pretty straight forward. Two midterms, weekly problem sets, and a final. The professor follows the book very closely, for better or for worse. You can review easily, and the (free) online textbook is very lucid and easy to read, but at times I wished to see how the the material we learned in class was applied to physics and engineering, and the such. The class concentrated almost solely on computations, mostly grazing over or skipping entirely any of the proofs.",
    "Take it if you have to, otherwise, stay away--really boring class.",
    "Take it because Linear Algebra is useful for so many fields in science. This was the first time the Prof was teaching it here so it may have been different in previous years and may be different next year. We spent several weeks covering reduced row echelon form for matrices. After that we progressed to vector spaces and extended echelon form, with row spaces, column spaces, and null spaces. In the last two weeks we did determinants, eigenvalues, and eigenvectors.It is straightforward material, and homework was especially simple since solutions were given in the online text we used. It also made studying for the final easier (having the solutions). If you plan to major in anything science-related or research for a professor, take this course. I have heard multiple science majors say they regretted not taking it earlier in their college careers.",
    "Only take it if you have to for your major. Try to take it in the spring when there are different professors. I enjoyed Math 120, but this course was pretty terrible and I'm glad it wasn't the first math class I took at Yale.",
    "Maths 222 is a waste of a class. The material is not really interesting, and all of it can be done on a computer. We were taught no real world applications of this class. Most of this class was self learning from the book because the professor was least interested in the material himself. Jaejeong Lee might be really amazing at math, but all he did in this class was repeat exactly what the textbook said. He wasn't really bothered if we understood the material or not, and made no attempt to make this class interesting.",
    "Take it if you really need to. If you want to major in mathematics, try taking the other linear algebra classes. Again, very basic linear algebra.",
    "Math 222 wasn't the most interesting class, but wasn't terrible. Take it if you like math or are majoring in math or science. Don't take this class if you don't like math because I think you could get bored and tired of it.",
    "Yeah. It is a good introduction to linear algebra if anybody is interested in that.",
    "This is a very computational linear algebra course. It is fairly striaghtforward because there are no proofs, but I sometimes felt that we glazed the surface of concepts without understanding the fundamentals. Not very hard.",
    "Extremely easy introduction to linear algebra. It would be great if there was an intermediate class in between Math 222 and 225.",
    "Yeah, definitely take it. It's easy.",
    "Learn fundamentals of linear algebra. Not too theory based though.",
    "Yes! Good course, great lectures, easy to follow. Problem sets and tests weren't bad, very fair."
