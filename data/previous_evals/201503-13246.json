    "The speed-dating session in the first meeting was terrible because most of the researchers totally failed to present well in 3 minutes. Recommend that they be provided with an outline or a template, and possibly some coaching, so as to keep their presentation within 3 minutes and make sure they answer three questions: what is their research about, why is their research important, and what opportunities they have for students. I am under the impression some of the students (especially 1st years) are quiet because they are intimidated by the faculty and grad students. I think we should figure out some way to fix this. I don't have concrete suggestions.",
    "Great speakers! I like the variety.",
    "Great seminar! But can we get something other than pizza once or twice? :)",
    "Very very very interesting guest speakers. Well done.",
    "Most of the talks are interesting, but could we get something other than the same pizzas from the same place every week? It's not a particularly healthy option."
