    "I would recommend this course if you have already taken a course on 20th century history or politics. If you don't know a lot about that time period, taking this class will probably just confuse you until you get to a point in the semester when suddenly everything starts to make sense.",
    "A history of the Cold War with a focus on Europe - Germany's central role, how European powers, especially Britain and France, influenced the Soviets\/Americans, economic policy, trends like Eurocommunism and counterculture, affect of 3rd world on European developments.I would definitely recommend this class. You learn a lot through the readings and especially through the seminar style discussions, something you would not get if you took Gaddis' Cold War class.Also, Maragkou was great.Decent amount of work - one presentation, one test, and final paper with about 150 pages of reading per week.",
    "I would recommend this seminar to anyone who wants to broaden their knowledge of how the cold war impacted europe and how europe shaped the cold war."
