    "Great class interesting discussion. The assignments were fun!",
    "In Persuasion and Communication I learned a great deal. I learned about early interactions between the American Government and its citizens, how the Governmental system was designed following the American Revolution, and how leaders throughout time have structure their arguments and situations to create advantageous circumstances for themselves. We studied speeches, party, platforms, political ads, and more to learn about what constituents respond to, and how they can be influenced and sometimes duped by political elites. I gained a great deal of insight into the interactions between the political elite and the citizenry, and my political beliefs have been permanently influenced by what I learned in this class.",
    "The course provided an opportunity to develop a better understanding of the historical, psychological, and strategic elements involved with political communications. We had fabulous discussions among an ideologically diverse group, which extended the readings considerably. Several of the group have been actively involved in political campaigns of various levels and were able to add those perspectives to the group. The assignments provided the chance to exercise the new information gained in \"practice runs\" of real-world campaign communications.",
    "I gained a lot of knowledge about the manner in which party elites interact with voters (through use of rhetoric, campaign ads, etc) from the very first American campaign (for the ratification of the Constitution) to today."

   "comments": [
    "The readings are great, but it's truly the in-class discussion that makes this course great. Plus, the writing assignments are enjoyable and varied--they don't feel like boring essays you're trying to bullshit.",
    "Fun assignments, the reading list is okay.",
    "The strengths are the breadth of time, ideas, and events that the course spans, covering a number of things from the creation of the Constitution onwards. It could possibly be improved by refining the topics into clear units of study, to make it more obvious how the ideas covered interact in our government.",
    "The readings were well chosen, the assignments were incredibly well designed (I looked forward to tackling them and they were useful), and discussions were led in a way that drew in most of the group each week. Both well planned and executed.",
    "Strengths: Great reading. Very interesting to read, not to mention fun. Weaknesses: I felt that the class often discussed issues outside of the scope of the reading; having actually done the homework for the class didn't seem necessary to be able to engage in discussion, which tended to favor people who had a better knowledge of current events, as opposed to people who had done the work for the class."

    "Interesting course",
    "YES. TAKE ANY COURSE WITH PROF HENDERSON. THIS WAS MY FAVORITE CLASS AT YALE. INTERESTING INSIGHTS AND EXTREMELY RELEVANT TO TODAY'S POLITICAL CLIMATE.",
    "Definitely take!",
    "Yes! Excellent class.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student. It covers a wide range of information that is interesting from both a political perspective, and as a citizen of the nation. It contextualizes lots of the tactics we often see in politics, and gives more insight into why and how it all works. I felt more engaged in politics as a profession than as a scholarly pursuit in this class, which is something that I think is one of its best advantages.",
    "For students interested in politics or campaigns, this is a fabulous course. The reading load is fairly high, but overall workload is not bad and the writing assignments are interesting to tackle. By far my favorite course this semester.",
    "Yes, great professor and subject!",
    "Absolutely! Very fun, and Professor Henderson obviously knows what he was doing. The discussions in class were very enlightening.",
    "I would recommend this class. The assignments were very unique and probably the best part: they were creative and hands-on rather than your typical theoretical papers. There was probably one too many assignments, however, as it felt like the class material was getting away from us as we focused on projects towards the end of the course. Henderson is very knowledgable and approachable. How much you take away from this class is very dependent on the other students in the class, for better or for worse."
