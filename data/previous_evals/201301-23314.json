    "Just a class based on various perspectives on Economic Sanctions. If you want to learn more, take it.",
    "Spoiler alert: sanctions don't usually work. But yes the course was interesting. Good readings - especially the more recent ones. I'd recommend it.",
    "Economic Sanctions is a good class to understand International Politics without having to go through a lot of econ theory, it's definitely on the lighter side work-wise, so you will learn but also take it easy.",
    "I would highly recommend this class to all students as the material is relevant and interesting. Given the widespread use of sanctions in our contemporary security environment it is useful to helping understand current affairs and politics.",
    "This is a terrific class and you really learn to see foreign policy in a new way.",
    "I would recommend sanctions to another student - you get an in depth idea of how sanctions work and when they dont.",
    "A discussion-based seminar that analyzes economic sanctions. Some questions considered include:How should we measure sanctions' success?Does international cooperation increase or decrease sanctions' success?What are the moral implications of economic sanctions?Which are more effective or \"better\", sanctions applied broadly to entire populations, or sanctions applied on targeted individuals?",
    "If you are interested in this narrow topic (or you think you would), and someone else offers this seminar, then take it! It is definitely a narrow discussion, which may sometimes feel repetitive, but it is a great way of learning about economic sanctions.",
    "Yes but I don't believe Marinov will be at Yale next year",
    "This class was great. If not a little repetitive at times. Marinov is leaving though so I don't think it'll be offered again.",
    "Yes! Make sure you are interested in the topic, and the course will be an engaging and in-depth investigation of the use, failings, and future of economic sanctions. The reading can be tough, but it's never overwhelmingly long."
