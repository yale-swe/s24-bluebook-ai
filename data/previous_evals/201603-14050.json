    "I learned a lot about how information economics impacts both managerial decision making and how information flows to the capital markets. Keeping an eye on the incentives for both firms and investors via many well known models such as Grossman & Stiglitz, Kyle, etc. will help me develop my ideas as an accounting researcher. I also learned how to prove theoretical models in the information economics setting. The process of conjecture, solve, and match coefficients will help me get a better understanding of how theory papers work when I go to use them for ideas to motivate my empirical research. Moreover, I now feel very comfortable with Bayesian updating, as this idea came up over and over again throughout the semester."

    "Zeqiong did a great job covering the models in depth. However, she tended to move rather quickly through the materials. She quickly improvised and realized that it would be more efficient to include the math in the lecture slides, so we can add notes based on her descriptions in class which was very helpful. However, she still did tend to move rather quickly through the material. I think it may be better to cover fewer models over the course of the semester, but to cover the models we do study in more depth and detail. The content is great, it was just that the pacing was a bit too fast."
