    "I learned so much about storytelling. Professor Sender has a number of storytelling principles that she returns to again and again throughout the course. She points them out in the stories we read and encourages us to apply them to our own work. After taking the class, I feel I am a better reader and writer of stories and that I have a better understanding for why authors use elements of magic, myths, or miracles in stories.",
    "A knowledge of the tools of good creative writing. An ability to better analyze, discuss and understand the creative writing of established authors. Improved in my ability to show, not tell, and to trust my readers.",
    "I learned a lot about how to tell stories and how to utilize fantastical elements in a way that highlights reality. I learned about the structure of a story and about how to expand my work as a writer.",
    "I gained an appreciation for the unreal in literature, across rewrites of religious texts, fairytales as well as magical realism.",
    "Gained experience in the craft of writing, and had a lot of exposure to various ways fiction\/poetry uses the fantastical."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I think the workshops were by far the strongest part of the course. I signed up for this seminar originally because I wanted to improve my writing, and they were immensely helpful (and reading other student's work was interesting). On the other hand, I think that many of the readings, while interesting, were not necessarily helpful for my own writing ability. It seemed to me they were stylistically very different from the kind of story I would typically write, and so did not really contribute to that (personal) course goal.",
    "Perhaps a little more neutral position towards religion; at the beginning of the course it seemed to be mildly scornful or dismissive of religious texts, though I know that that was definitely not the intention. For example, balancing more religiously positive stories with the cynical and negative ones.",
    "Strengths: a breathtaking array of readings, a really directed lesson schedule, well-posed discussion topics Improvement: more small writing exercises :D",
    "You have (pretty easy) reading, but it's not like an English class. You don't go too in depth about what exactly the fantastical elements in a particular piece are doing. The readings feel like props for the professor's \"teaching moments.\" It's a little annoying because you don't get a lot of room to draw your own conclusions or discuss things with your classmates, you just absorb and parrot back the professor's philosophy of writing and magic. But they're great reading selections, and the professor knows a ton about the craft and gives great feedback for your writing."

    "If you're interested in storytelling, this is a great class. Professor Sender does an awesome job leading class discussion and giving you feedback on your assignments. I learned so much and had a great experience writing in the class.",
    "Yes, especially beginning writers who are looking to improve their skills in writing in very concrete ways. This will give you very good and practical tools to improve your creative writing.",
    "Yes!",
    "Yes! The course is such a breath of fresh air from typical English or creative writing classes. The readings will make you fall in love with the genre, and Courtney does an excellent job of structuring the course and engaging you with its flow.",
    "I highly recommend for writing beginners and moderately recommend for people with lots of experience lol. You get a whole spectrum of fellow classmates, which is super nice because I feel like people in other writing classes at Yale can be too similar. You also get handheld through the basics, which builds a solid foundation for your writing craft. And you get TONS of great feedback. Anyone interested in improving their writing as well as cool ways modern writers are using magic, old and new, would benefit from the class."
