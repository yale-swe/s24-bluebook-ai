    "I appreciated the species\/wildlife focus on conservation given that it is different than other conservation courses offered at FES. I enjoyed the professor led components of the course most, and really appreciated the last class about careers and juggling family and work. In general the speakers were great, and it was nice to have an opportunity to connect with them over dinner. Amy and Billy do a great job selecting a wide range of speakers (topically, geographically, discipline, professional role, etc). That said, some weeks it was pretty rough to have the speakers present on Thursday evening (the end of the week for most of us)...I wish these could have been at another time. I also thought the \"conservation bootcamp\" at the beginning (mainly the science component, which I am less familiar with) was great. I would suggest expanding this.",

   "question_id": "FS0044",
   "question_text": "What aspects of this course need the most improvement?",
   "comments": [
    "There needs to be more of a diversity of class types. Every single class was either student led or led by a guest lecturer. Especially for students who do not feel comfortable speaking out a lot in class, this wasn't conducive to much learning. Class discussions got out of hand, making it even harder for quiet people to participate or even want to participate.",
    "The student led discussions are too much of the course and not as educational as they should be. Also, we could benefit from time to discussion the guest speaker's lectures in class.",
    "Student-led classes were definitely not ideal for learning the material. Each group seemed to pick topics and readings they liked or had experience with but this led to a lot of discontinuity between sessions. It would be helpful if student-led classes were more focused or if the entire semester worked on just one or two case studies.",
    "The student led courses were pretty rough, with a few exceptions. I know that Amy and Bill feel strongly that this is an important skill for students to have, and while I understand the argument I also think I am paying way too much money to be at FES to be taught that much by other students. I would recommend that this component be significantly downsized. Maybe it was because the student-led courses didn't clearly convey the different topic areas they were supposed to relate to, but I also struggled to see a structural arc to the class. I felt like we were having the same conversations in week 2 and 3 as at the end of the semester, and that got repetitive. I think it needs to be clearer what is being covered each week, and for there to be key learnings in all of the areas covered (instead of just loose conversation). Lastly, I think it's a missed opportunity not to take time to discuss the speakers in class. We heard some really interesting and compelling people speak, and then never had the opportunity to process their presentations with our peers. I think time should be devoted to this during subsequent classes, and maybe students should also have to respond to speakers during discussion posts. Brad Gentry's \"Strategies for Land Conservation\" class is a fantastic example of how to incorporate readings, speakers, and student-led discussions. In general I think Amy and Bill are trying to fit too many things into this class, and that leads to a lack of coherence. I think if the student-led portion was downsized it would free up time for the professors' key takeaways and post-speaker discussions, and help bring together everything else into a more coherent semester-long experience.",
    "The course was basically either students presenting on topics they don't know much about or guest speakers. There should be more courses when Amy and Bill teach us about conservation. I think that if student presentations only took half the class and then Amy and Bill actually taught us about the topic for the other half of the class, we could learn a lot more. I did not get that much from the student presentations because it did not feel like my classmates knew enough about the topic."

We kept arguing based on our own knowledge of things but we didn't do too much learning since it was all student-led lectures that did not cover anything very deeply. Maybe their other course is more applied."
