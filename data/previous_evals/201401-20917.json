    "ENAS 194 is a class to help provide engineers and scientists with the mathematics needed for higher level classes more specific to those majors. I would absolutely recommend this course to another student, because the math is very relevant to my field of study and it is well taught.",
    "You are probably taking this class for a requirement and not purely for fun, but it actually turned out to be much more enjoyable than I anticipated. Please take it with Professor Ahn, he did a great job and tests in a manner that is a fun way to just barely stretch your thinking from the material that is taught in class.",
    "This class is awful. Do not take it unless required.",
    "If you like math, take this class. If not, I wouldn't take this for fun. I enjoyed the class overall, but it was also required for my major.",
    "ENAS 194 should only be taken by those with a great passion for math or those with it as a prerequisite. This isn't because the class is terrible - it's simply because it's very difficult. Problem sets are very time-consuming, and often require collaborative groups to complete successfully.",
    "I would not recommend the class. It is extremely difficult and not worth the time. I only took it because it was a requirement",
    "ENAS 194 is one of the most rewarding classes I've ever taken. To be honest, I was quite afraid of taking this class at the beginning of the semester based on all of the reviews I read. However, it's actually not as bad as it seems. The problem sets are pretty long (~10 hours each, although the psets due during a midterm week take 1 hour) but if you have a pset group and start early, it's very manageable. The midterms and the final are fair and straightforward. I learned so much from this class and I think the material is much more interesting and applicable than most that of other math classes I've taken. Take this course with Professor Ahn if possible!",
    "I would NEVER recommend this class to another student unless it is required for your major. This is not a class to take for fun. It will be awful, and it will be miserable, but you will get through it together.",
    "I'd recommend taking it with easier classes\/less credits in a semester. The psets are killer and take a very, very long time.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to anyone who likes to solve problems and who wants to see a lot of beautiful relationships between different math courses come together. It was pretty cool seeing everything I learned in math consolidate into this course. I know it's required if you are an engineer or mathematician. However, if you don't have to take this course, but are interested, I would think twice. This course is extremely difficult and can be very stressful (the amount of time spent on homework is unbelievable), so I don't recommend it if you aren't too confident in your math skills. In general, it's not worth taking unless it's required for you.",
    "If you want to learn differential and partial equations, take this course. You learn the material with context to real world applications. It's a lot of work and pretty difficult, but well taught.",
    "This was by far my most time consuming class at Yale thus far, it was very difficult, slightly disorganized (in that pests were due on Thursdays but often we didn't learn the material until Tuesday), and it easily took over my life for a few days each week. That being said, I without a doubt learned differential equations. With a topic that many find so difficult, in retrospect, I realize that this was the way to really learn the material. But by the fact that this was easily 2-3 times the workload of a normal course, I often wondered why it wasn't more than 1 credit. I don't know who teaches this in the Fall, but I would suggest taking it with Ahn.",
    "Challenging but rewarding if YOU put the time into it. The professor and TFs are awesome, but you have to be willing to do the work.",
    "It's a lot of work but will pay off. Very interesting material.",
    "DiffEQ is not a very elegant form of math. It involves a lot of guessing and verifying.",
    "I greatly enjoyed this class and felt as if I learned a lot. The course presents challenging material in a very organized and predictable manner. The problem sets were never too much for one week and were balanced throughout the semester. The two midterms were fair, as was the final. Definitely take this course with Professor Ahn.",
    "Take this class. I wouldn't go as far to say that it's the best course I've taken at Yale, but definitely the course in which I've learned the most so far (I'm a freshman). It really makes you feel so powerful because you can solve equations that were gibberish to you before. Everyone says the course is very challenging, but if you go to class and stay on top of the problem sets, it's all completely doable. The only problem I had with the exams, especially the midterm exams, was that a lot of the problems required a lot of math intuition in addition to just being able to solve the differential equation. Also, don't drop problem sets. They get much harder in the end of the course, and doing the problem sets is by far the best way to learn the material. The one problem set I skipped, I had to spend forever studying for the midterm because I didn't understand that week of material.",
    "If you are looking at this, you probably HAVE to take it. If you like Math\/Physics, it's great. Differential equations are a whole new realm of knowledge, and the math is beautiful. Gear up though, it's hard work.",
    "Definitely came into this course expecting it to be impossibly hard, and while it was the most difficult course I've ever taken, it was manageable with a really great pset group. Homework took really long to complete. Like really, really long. But it's necessary to actually learn the material. The beginning of the course is really well taught, but towards the end nothing makes sense. The material gets harder and harder as it goes along, and if you don't continuously study, the midterms are going to suck. Overall, it was pretty enjoyable except for the class being at 9am, and while it was very challenging and difficult, I never hated the class or considered dropping it. The last few weeks of class really don't make sense at all though.",
    "If you have to take it, you have to take it. Find, a group of students to work through it with. It is hard, but in retrospect it is a very important course that teaches you the power of math. You won't think that while you are taking, though, so best of luck!",
    "Can't really get around this one if you're looking to pursue engineering. Definitely a lot of work, but if you enjoy math, this class is really interesting. If you put in the work, it's possible to do very well in the course.",
    "You learn a lot but it is very difficult. Only take it if you really need to.",
    "YES! This is class is sure to be very useful in engineering majors and it's also very interesting to learn how to solve these differential equations. Although this class is really hard I enjoyed working on the psets and studying for exams for this class a lot more than other classes because of my study group. The difficultly of this class pushes people to collaborate more, which is really fun and really helpful for learning.",
    "ENAS 194, taught by Professor Charles Ahn, is a great course. It is a difficult course, with problem sets that can be very long, but as a STEM major I enjoyed it. The concepts of this course are not super hard to grasp, but you can get caught up in all the arithmetic\/computation for certain types of problems, which can make it difficult. The problem sets get harder along the way, so don't be so sure about dropping any problem set.",
    "A great class. Ahn is a great lecturer and you get lots of help from the TAs if you want. Not as hard as people say it is. If you do all the homework assignments you will be fine.",
    "For a computational math course, the material is taught well and has greater significance beyond just solving equations. Definitely take it in the spring with Professor Ahn as the lectures are engaging and you learn a lot in one semester.",
    "As hard as they say. Start the psets early and make use of office hours. It's a lot of work but you'll learn a lot.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student. Coming from someone who barely made it through Math 120, I understand the struggles of math at Yale. However, this class is so well taught and the information is so clearly organized, any student can make it through this class if they put in the right amount of effort. It isn't easy, you will spend hours and hours on the problem sets, guaranteed. But if you want to learn it, you've got to practice. Don't let the amount of work you have to put in scare you away from engineering.",
    "Would recommend. Even though you are probably taking this as a requirement, it's a solid course with Ahn. It's mostly a fast introduction to many methods of solving DQs analytically (by hand). If you're new to the material and not a math genius, then success is obtainable by a relatively simple formula: go to all of the review sections (office hours if you manage to start the homework soon enough - a good idea in general but let's be realistic) and work in groups. Doing every pset (even though you can technically drop 3) and understanding every question (even if you're working in groups) is critical preparation for the tests. Look forward to some very late wednesday nights.",
    "I recommend it if your willing to put in the work. The material isn't too bad with all the practice you get doing the problem set. Each regular problem set took around 10 hours. Make sure to find a study group.",
    "ENAS 194 was an exceedingly well-taught class. Professor Ahn was wonderful; he explained concepts clearly, he always provided plenty of examples to aid instruction, he had impressive patience and willingness to answer students' questions, and he exhibited a palpable excitement and enthusiasm while teaching. As far as the course material goes, it was extremely thorough; I even feel as though, towards the end, the curriculum went further with ordinary differential equations than your usual diffeq class (i.e, the internet couldn't help me). The partial diffeq portion of the class was a little rushed, only a couple weeks at the end of the course, but covered many of the most significant equations (heat equation, wave equation, Laplace). I am very happy that I took this class; I feel like it did a great job of introducing me to advanced math techniques I will need in higher-level physics courses.",
    "This class is an enormous challenge but can be fun if you approach it with the right mindset. You will have to spend a lot of time doing problem sets and studying for exam, but if you do put in the time, you will do well. Overall, the class was what you put into it.",
    "Go to the review sessions! They're very helpful. Professor Ahn is also very nice and super approachable.",
    "The psets are long and hard, but the information isn't too conceptual or difficult. I found the tests pretty hard but I think if you really take the time to grasp every concept in the pset it is worth it when the test comes. I didn't find the information incredibly riveting, but if you need\/want to learn differential equations, this is a good way to go.",
    "This is a really challenging class. Its necessary for engineering, but dont take it if you dont have to",
    "If you're interested in Applied Math\/Engineering, take it for sure, and take it with Professor Ahn. He's a great lecturer, and tests fairly.",
    "I highly recommend this class to any student. It has such useful information and is taught so well by Professor Ahn. It is a difficult class, but it has been one of the most rewarding classes I've ever taken at Yale as a sophomore thus far. Please take it - it will teach you the meaning of hard work and you will learn more in this class than you probably will all semester in all your other classes combined.",
    "Very hard but essential math class",
    "ENAS 194 is challenging and the psets are very long and usually quite difficult. The midterms are fair but also difficult. Only take this class if you ahve to because its hard, Proefessor Ahn is a good teacher but the stress of the class is just not worth it if you do not have to take it.",
    "#ahnmagic",
    "Obviously, don't take it unless you need to, but if you need to take it, know that this class is an enormous time commitment. The problems sets are long and tough, much longer and tougher than any math class I have previously taken at Yale, and the exams are even harder. Be prepared, but don't let what you hear about it scare you too much: it is doable, just not easy.",
    "This class requires alot of work. However it is well taught and fair. If you need to take it, Ahn is a great professor to do it with.",
    "It is a fast-paced, but rewarding class. Prepare to do a lot of work. The one way to excel at this class (unless you're already a math genius or something) is finding a good study group. Collaborate on the PSets and the class shouldn't be too difficult. Beware though: it does get harder ad harder over the course of the semester.",
    "Only because I've heard it's better than the Math department's version of ordinary and differential equations. I would never recommend this class to someone who (a) doesn't have to take it or (b) wants to take it but isn't very very gifted in math, because it is so time consuming. But, if someone had to take differential equations I would definitely recommend this course over those offered in the math department, which I heard are taught very poorly.",
    "This course was quite comprehensive, and I really appreciated the breadth of the material. I feel that the class did a good job of giving enough examples for each class of problem. Sometimes the problem sets were overly long, but having the option to skip 3 of them helped. Keep in mind that this class is a lot of work, and you should prepare well for the midterms and final in addition to starting the problem sets early.",
    "I recommend taking diff. eq. with Prof. Ahn. Problem sets take over ten hours a week, but are manageable thanks to Ahn's well-organized lectures, the TA sessions, and the textbook. A rewarding course!",
    "ENAS 194 is definitely a challenging course that will require quite a lot of time. It is not, however, as intimidating as its reputation, and especially if you take it with Professor Ahn, you learn a lot about how differential equations are used in all kinds of science and engineering applications. Most of the time I actually found working through the psets fun and the lectures are usually quite interesting. I highly recommend forming a good study group for this class and going to section\/TF office hours - it is life-saving right before a pset is due or before an exam.",
    "Contrary to popular belief, this class wasn't as hard as it's made out to be. Albeit, a few problem sets were really time-consuming, but the material was laid out in a pretty straightforward manner. In fact, Ahn was pretty much teaching straight from the book, and the psets borrowed problems from the book. Given that you can drop the three lowest problem sets, the workload is also totally doable. All in all, fairly well-taught class on material that's super important for physics\/engineering. Just don't go in believing this will be a hard class and it really won't be.",
    "ENAS 194 is a difficult class, no doubt, but one in which you easily could excel if you apply sufficient effort.",
    "Don't take it unless you have to. If you're into math, go ahead, but recognize it'll be a lot of work and probably an equal amount of stress.",
    "Alright, it's not as hellish as people make it out to be, but take it seriously and GO TO THE REVIEW SESSIONS and everything will turn out fine.",
    "I would recommend this class wholeheartedly to anyone interested in engineering. Taking this class will help you to realize whether engineering is a right fit for you or not.",
    "ENAS 194 is the hardest course I have taken in my life (and therefore also one of the most rewarding when I came out on the other side). Professor Ahn teaches it well but does have to rush some subjects in order to cover all of the topics outlined. This is why you should attend the review sessions and office hours held by the TAs. They function to clarify much of the material that is covered and provide the tips and methods needed to solve the more complex problems on the psets. Many of the problem sets get around to the 10 hour range in length, and the tests require much preparation. If you decide to take this course, make sure you have a group of friends who are taking the course with you so that you can work on the problem sets together. Try to keep Tuesday and Wendnesday evenings clear so you can attend the office hours (which just consists of asking the TA about pset problems) and the review sessions."
