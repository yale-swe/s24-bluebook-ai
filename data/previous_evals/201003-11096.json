   "comments": [
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to any of my fellow students. This is the best comprehensive history course of the 20th century that I have ever taken.",
    "I will highly recommend not only as a requirement for degree completion but also as a good exercise to think and get exposed to historical thinking.",
    "This is a really interesting course. We covered so much information so quickly that I'm not sure I could necessarily tell somebody one thing I learned--but I feel like I appreciate history in a new way and have developed a different lens through which to examine decisions. And maybe that's the point.",
    "This course is beneficial for those who want to explore the inner dynamics underlying the transformation of the international system as of the World War 1 through the end of the Cold War Era.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to fellow graduate students, though I would let them know that it is quite challenging if you do not have a background in international history already.",
    "Yes I would, but I would suggest because it's a seminar, the student have a good background in international history before taking the course if he\/she is looking to contribute to the class significantly. If it was a lecture\/discussion- style course, I would suggest it to everyone, but since its a seminar, background knowledge (beyond just the readings) may be helpful if not necessary.",
    "I would recommend this course to students seriously interested in international history. I would also recommend it to students considering a PHD in history."

   "comments": [
    "I feel that I now possess a more nuanced perspective of world history, as I feel more comfortable looking at historical events from the perspectives of different nationalities. This course has created an effective \"mental\" timeline for me for this period, and I feel that this knowledge will be invaluable in my future pursuits.",
    "It indeed did, triggering and deepeninig interest in the field.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to anybody interested in 20th century history.",
    "Provided a foundational background on how systems in IR have evolved to the way they are today.",
    "This course helped me think about whether I want to pursue a PHD in history. It also helped me think in a more balanced way about competing historical narratives in the 20th century."
