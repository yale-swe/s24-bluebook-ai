    "Take it if you are interested in the subject. Course lets you take on a big project and learn about something you are interested in.",
    "Request a copy of the syllabus and see for yourself. It is what it says it will be: cost-benefit analysis and its discontents, issues of federalism, issues of legal interventions in the environment. There is less material devoted to public opinion andthe process by which lobbyists and others distort or oppose common-interest decisions.",
    "The reading is ok, the concepts good to know about, but the seminar is not run very well. I often felt like we were just wandering about the topics instead of really delving into them. Professor Rose-Ackerman didn't seem to come into class with a point to make; she would lead discussions based on reading responses, which made class seem disjointed. She also wouldn't allow students enough time to talk (sometimes semi-cutting them off even) and would usually talk between students, making student-student responses rare. Topics are interesting, but I would find another class to cover them in.",
    "Not really. If you've done the prereqs for the class you're not going to learn much that you don't already know. The term paper is also a pain write.",
    "Take is if you're passionate about policy, economics, or the environment. I wrote my senior essay in it for political science. SRA is a wonderful professor and can certainly push you if you go to office hours.",
    "The professor dominated discussion. The readings were interesting, but the discussion was impossible to enjoy because it the professor talked so much. Pretty low workload for a seminar."
