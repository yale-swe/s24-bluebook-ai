   "comments": [
    "Bad. This was my least favorite anthropology class (and maybe just least favorite class) at Yale. It was stressful, heavy, and boring.",
    "Very essential for anthropologist, as time is always a factor in how people perceive the world. Also, the class examines some theoretical shifts in anthropology as a discipline.",
    "I would recommend this to Anthropology or Philosophy majors but never to Political Science or History majors. The level of abstract material is mind boggling and the reading is very heavy and dense. I would recommend this to a grad student, but not to an undergrad with more than three classes to take simultaneously.",
    "This is not an easy class. The reading is difficult, and the presentation system (he draws two names out of a hat at the beginning of each class, and they present) is really scary. But ultimately, it's totally worth it. The reading, while hard, is really thought-provoking, and the class discussion is really interesting. And the only written assignment is the final paper (you have things to turn in for it along the way though). As long as you stay on top of your reading and come ready to class, you'll be fine. If the topic interests you, take it.",
    "Definitely! Understand that there is a lot of reading and class participation is unavoidable so if you're looking for an easy seminar this is not for you. The subject of time is incredibly interesting and the readings not only provide theoretical and empirical explanations\/examples for the themes of the class but also provide a basic understanding of many anthropological themes. Probably the most interesting class I've take at Yale.",
    "It's a lot of work ('Russian roulette' style of choosing that week's presenters means that you have to be reading every week to present on the readings), but it's pretty rewarding at the end. You are bound to run into some of those people who just like to hear themselves talk, but Prof. McGovern is good at calling people out when they get too far into orbit.Difficult, but rewarding. (Though I still dreaded the prospect of being called on to present every week.)",
    "Really difficult and theoretical with lots of reading. Be careful taking this class unless you're really really interested in Anthropology"
