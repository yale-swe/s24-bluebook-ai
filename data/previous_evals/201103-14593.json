    "Regarding question 3 on out of class assignments = weekly reading commentaries and the final paper. I believe weekly reading commentaries contribute very little to learning. I did not like the selection of readings, much less having to comment on them. Some readings were too much theory. The final paper was very helpful to my learning.Regarding question 5 instructor responsiveness: students don't reach out to Dr. Pachauri, because he is not around during the week and he is too busy with his worklife to attend to student inquires. The TA had to fill in this gap.",

    "Wish the course readings were more tied to class discussions. In terms of topics yes. But, we never really discussed the readings. Also, too many readings were assigned for each class.Even if the classes were only for about 6\/8 weeks, it was a substantial amount of work. Especially with the final paper. Sometimes I felt like this was a 3 credit course except for the duration and work involved.",
    "More clarity needed in syllabus regarding scheduling, due dates, and assignments. There was a lot of confusion.",
    "The class invited guest speakers every week - however, quite often the speaker would just walk into the room and we would go straight into questions. I think the class needs to make sure students do background research on the speaker. This is not mandated in any way and it's up to students to go dig up the speaker's bio and accomplishments. It would be helpful to get a bit more guidance from the professor\/TA on reading background materials about the speaker, so we know what to ask him. It seemed awkward for the speaker to just walk in, and for students to start asking questions without having had any kind of conversation on why this speaker was invited and what his\/her expertise and professional accomplishments are.",
    "It was taken for granted that many concepts may have been new to students. It was so cutting-edge that the background got overlooked.",
    "Better communication and coordination with students in the class. There was confusion about when assignments were due and when we were having class. The grading scale for the weekly reading assignments was also confusing. Although certain criteria had been given for the assignments (length, spacing) it seemed like these criteria didn't matter. It was also a bit frustrating that students were graded on whether or not they asked questions in class, because the TA would compete for already valuable question time and ask questions to the speakers. If the TA wants to ask questions during lectures, don't grade students on whether they speak up or not. Pachauri's presentations were also really generic. Students already knew a lot about the topics he was presenting on, so we didn't really learn anything knew during his presentations.",
    "Reading list could be much improved as there were many superfluous readings or readings that were simply not the best available.",
    "This class needs to be a 1 credit course with reading and reading repsonces. The 20+ page paper at the end of the class was not need and did not add to my learning experience.",
    "It should be made a full 3 credits course",
    "Maybe more interaction between students and professor. The presentations of the final project was not very well organized, and the instructor was not there, only the TA.",

    "I highly appreciated the detailed and thoughtful grading of commentaries.",
    "Recognize that the TA had a lot of work in this class, more than other TAs in other classes.Many emails sent out throughout the semester, most of them were unclear and required additional clarifications which were confusing.Many versions of the syllabus with date and schedule changes that were hard to plan around.Comments on graded reading responses were contradictory and confusing:Example 1. When I wrote a response that was 2 pages, I was told to stick to the 1 page limit. For the next one, I stuck to 1 page and was told to expand my thoughts, it wasn't long or in-depth enough (you can only go so in-depth in 1 page double spaced). For the following one, I wrote 2.5 pages and received positive feedback.Example 2. In one response, I talked too much about the readings. In the next response, which was fairly similar in terms of my mention of the readings and my own thoughts\/analysis, I got good feedback.",
    "TA was fairly available to provide guidance with final paper.",
    "Prof is too busy\/uninterested in actually connecting with and teaching students. The TA was left to administer the entire class, and seemed to start to think that she herself was a professor. She graded our one page \"reading responses\" as if there were expected to be of publishable quality and to contain entirely novel analyses and perspectives on climate change. No one on the planet can accomplish that in one page. Expectations for the 20 page final paper were exceedingly unclear. And that assignment itself was far too substantial for a two credit class. This was a heavier work load than most 3 credit classes. I didn't take a course with the head of the IPCC to do a huge independent research project. He needed to be more involved and invested in the class. I doubt he'll even read our final papers.",
    "Jasmine was accessible and responsive.",
    "The TA never got back to me immediately over email, but she would respond within a few days.",

    "I was pleased with the selection of speakers. Some shared innovative and challenging thoughts.I am largely disappointed with the part of the class taught by Dr. Pachauri. In fact, he is not in a position to teach. The reason for this is that given his appointment as Chairman of the IPCC, his opinions and messages in class are much too conservative. This is just like every public speech that I have heard him give - he is unable to be provocative and to truly speak his mind - he must be \"careful\" in what he says (as if there was always a journalist in the room). This leaves me disappointed, feeling like he needs to push the envelope and say things as they are, rather than saying them in politically correct and cautious ways.",
    "No.",
    "Not quite. The readings never got discussed in the class in depth. We don't know what our peers responses were so no learning there. The class presentations were very superficial and did not delve deep into the fascinating complexities of sustainable development. The speakers were good though, but for that there was no need to take the class.",
    "Yes and no. The guest speakers were great, but Pachauri's presentations didn't really teach us anything new. I really appreciated being able to ask him the and guest speakers questions, although I wish he could have been a bit more candid with the class.",
