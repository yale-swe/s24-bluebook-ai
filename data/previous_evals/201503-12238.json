   "comments": [
    "Great class, professor schwartz is a great lecturer. A lot of reading so be prepared.",
    "Take it!!",
    "Pretty easy, good pre industrial credit. If you've taken a few history classes before this, this class will be a piece of cake. Professor Schwartz is nice and Tim was a great TA (if he's still TAing). Would recommend!",
    "Definitely take this course if you are looking for an interesting history course on a very important time period in Latin America. You will also get an intro to European history as it relates to colonization in the New World. Exams and essays are fair and although some of the reading is dense, delightful lectures make the class worth it.",
    "Great class, Schwartz tells history through stories which I love so it's always engaging and you'll never want to miss class.",
    "Take this class. Prof Schwartz is an amazing professor and THE expert in this field. His passion for the subject is infectious. The workload is very manageable, and the subject itself is really interesting.",
    "A good overview of Latin America from the first encounter to independence. Focuses mostly on the earlier period. The professor is very charming and the material interesting, although the lectures tend to get a bit disorganized. The readings were fascinating, although heavy. I did not expect to read a book every week, and found it hard to keep up.",
    "Great overview of colonial Latin American history in an intimate lecture setting. It's a niche area but if it's your thing, there's no better person to learn it from than Professor Schwartz, who's really the world expert in this field. The workload is on the heavier side for a lecture course (final, midterm, 2 papers) but the instructors are reasonable about spacing out the readings.",
    "This course is a crash course on three centuries of colonization and development in Latin America and on European factors that affected Latin America during this time. Overall, I would highly recommend this course to anyone wanting to learn about how Latin America came to be. The exams are straightforward but do require a bit of studying. The two papers do take a lot of time but are not terribly difficult if you plan ahead well. It was not necessary to hardcore read everything assigned but to get at least a gist of what was going on in each book and article. Schwartz is an excellent lecturer - just starts talking and (literally) doesn't know when to stop.",
    "This course is a survey of colonial Latin America up until the independence movements. Professor Schwartz is an expert in this field, and this class could be a wonderful starting point for study of the region. I would recommend this class to anyone interesting in LA studies.",
    "BEST class I have taken. It starts with the indigenous\/european encounters and ends at the time of independence in Latin America. Definitely recommend this class to all students of all majors.",
    "This class takes on a large amount of time and a huge geographical region to cover, so be prepared for a lack of depth. It is very much a patchwork quilt in what it addresses, so don't take this if you are only interested in one country\/time period\/theme. Also don't take this class if a disorganized syllabus bothers you. Otherwise, it's a very good intro to the region and it addresses interesting themes of colonization, demography, race, class and government. Evaluation is pretty heavy for a history course-- a 6 page paper, a 10 page research paper, a midterm and a final. I particularly recommend this class if Tim Lorek is TF-- he is great!",
    "This course covers the history of Latin America during the colonial period. It goes into more depth and detail than any course you can take in high school. If you are interested in learning about the colonial period, then I definitely recommend this course.",
    "A great survey on Latin America, Europe in the age of exploration and colonialism, race and gender issues... lots of things. Prof. Schwartz is awesome, basically encyclopedic on the subject, and funny. Lectures are engaging, workload is manageable."
