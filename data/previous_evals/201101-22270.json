    "Type II has a similar format to other advanced graphic design courses available to undergrads. One of its strengths are that you are introduced to a new medium: the video. You have a lot freedom with the three projects over the course of the semester, too, so you can really tailor it to your interests. I would recommend it. Also, it's called \"Typography II\", but it really felt more like another advanced graphic design course since Yale already puts so much emphasis on typography in graphic design.",
    "Typography II is a must for all graphic design majors and for those that took Typography I. The class consists of three major assignments all of which were a joy to construct and produce. There are various assigned readings that will help promote learning and understanding of more critical type.",
    "Typography II allows you to evolve as a designer as the projects become increasingly complex. I finished the course able to use typography much more confidently and eager to explore its potential further.",
    "Yes! It's a great class."
