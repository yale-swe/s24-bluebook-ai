    "Take it the second you are done with L4",
    "It is a good course to improve your writing, though it does demand a lot of time and focus.",
    "I would definitely recommend it! If possible, take it with Andrea because he is AWESOME. This class will really improve your speaking and writing skills. Be prepared for a lot of essay assignments though; they're not long but you'd still be surprised at how much you feel like you're writing. Still, since there are no tests or anything it's a fair trade-off, and writing so much really helps you improve. Fun, great class!",
    "DEFINITELY.",
    "If you want a class to keep up momentum from L4 Italian, I would really recommend taking this class - it's not too much work, not too bad of a commitment. It's not going to improve your Italian by a lot, because it's just not a lot of class time, but it's worth taking.",
    "If you want to improve your writing and speaking sills then I highly recommend this class to you. However, don't underestimate the workload.",
    "Italian 150 is a bridge course between level 4 Italian and a more difficult literature or culture course. I would recommend it as a way to refine one's understanding of the language before venturing into a course that requires true mastery of the language."
