    "If you're looking for a class with a small workload (just reading, a presentation with outline, and a short paper) then go for it. If you want something a little more stimulating though you might want to pass this one up.",
    "Good, easy class. More like a lecture than seminar even though the number of students is more like a seminar. Good fifth class if need be",
    "This is an interesting, laid-back seminar that is definitely worth taking! The only real work during the term are class readings, which were sometimes dense but always interesting (and explained well in class by Prof. McIntosh), plus a short presentation and paper at the end. Prof. McIntosh is an engaging and funny lecturer teaching something he's passionate about. If you have a little extra time, it's definitely worth taking this seminar!",
    "This should really be retitled \"Paleoclimate\" because the Anthropology part is basically entirely missing. The subject material IS interesting, but only for a select few involved in the niche subjects - and, without a basic knowledge of earth\/climate sciences, the first few weeks are pretty difficult."
