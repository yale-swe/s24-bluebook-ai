    "This course is an excellent way to think about psychopathology at a different level. It fits well with the coursework offered in the department about the theoretical models of psychopathology. I would recommend students take this course given its breadth and depth regarding issues that are essential for research in clinical psychology.",
    "I would recommend it. First of all, it fulfills an APA requirement. But second of all, Professor Cannon is a good teacher.",
    "Psych 513 is provides a great survey of the biological underpinnings of various psychopathologies. What is more, it provides a basic introduction to many biological research methodologies for those who may not have as much experience in that research domain."

    "This course provided me with an understanding of the field at a new level. I am more well prepared to conduct research and seek funding because of it. Understanding the biological mechanisms of psychopathology is essential for my future work.",
    "I wrote a final paper about a topic related to my own research interests, which allowed me to explore the biological bases of processes of interest in a more in-depth way.",
    "The final project for this class provided me with an opportunity to examine the existing biological literature related to my main research topics."
