   "comments": [
    "If you are interested in learning more about the Third Reich and have any interest in music history, I would strongly recommendation this course. The readings were almost always really interesting. Dealing with music and culture in such a fraught political context was fascinating. Since the backgrounds and interests of everyone in the class were so varied, I always felt like there was something I could add to the discussion.",
    "I would recommend MUSI 380 to students who are interested in music, even if they have little background in German or history. I think there's lots to be learned about this topic and Prof. Kreuzer does a great job of making the class work for a diversity of backgrounds\/interests.",
    "I really enjoyed this course; Prof. Kreuzer does make an effort to make the class somewhat interdisciplinary based on people's interests even though she is primarily a musicologist. I would strongly recommend this course if the material interests you. Also, a significant chunk of the work for this class is researching a topic of your choice for the final paper, and she gives you a lot of latitude and helpful guidance in picking a topic."
