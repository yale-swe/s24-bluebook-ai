   "comments": [
    "English 120 is pretty much everything you'd expect it to be. It's completely doable, with a drat every week and the final paper the next. If you have Stuart, I 100% recommend going to her office hours for the most intensive feedback on your papers.",
    "Great experience! Way to open up eyes to different styles of writing and learn about creative ways to express yourself. Refining the way one expresses thoughts is always a plus!",
    "Lots of work, but you get into the groove and actually learn how to write better without stressing as much. I am no fan of English, but I had to take a class for pre-med reqs, and this was actually enjoyable and helpful. Stay engaged and you'll learn a lot.",
    "This is overall a good course if you want to learn how to write a particular type of essay--think of the New Yorker. If you take it, realize that it's not about what you say but how you say it, and you'll approach an essay as a work of art rather than a logical argument. This class was a bit of a headache for me at times, but I guess I'd recommend it if you're willing to put in the time.",
    "A very solid course. This is a great class with solid readings, enjoyable discussions, and wonderful assignments. Barbara Stuart is a great, caring teacher who really works to make her students better writers. I really appreciated her effort, her humor, her Southern charm, and her help. The only issue is the grading system: it's not the fairest, and it is rather difficult.",
    "English 120 is all about learning how to write. There are two components to this class: 1) Reading example essays (from the New Yorker, the Atlantic, Rolling Stone, etc.), and 2) Writing! There is a huge variety in the types of essays you read, and every week those example essays correspond with that week's prompt. You have one week to turn in a first draft of the essay and the final draft the next week. Overall, the setup of the class works extremely well for you to get your thoughts together and then actually produce your essay. If you do the work, you'll feel yourself become a better writer! Sometimes it's hard, but it's completely worth it.",
    "Highly recommended. Overall, a great course that would be useful for anyone to take. The readings are really interesting and the course will help you improve your writing and develop a voice. Just beware that the grading isn't the easiest and you will have to write a paper every week. That being said, you get a rough draft for each paper, which is amazing.",
    "ENGL 120 is the quintessential (sorry, I had to use that word!) \"you're not in high school anymore\" writing class. While I would recommend it, I would caution that I did not have a \"life-changing writing experience.\" I would also not say that it is a course you MUST TAKE BEFORE YOU GRADUATE (as other comments probably suggest).",
    "Definitely. A great way to explore yourself as a writer and read some great essays.",
    "This is one of my top three courses at Yale. How awesome. The readings are great - and never too long, the essays are fun to write (so glad we don't do the humor essay in this class), and the classes themselves are fun as well as helpful. We either discuss the readings, and talk about small blog post that people post on the class blog (with pictures, videos and all). Yes, expect to put in some work for this course, but it will come to you easily, just because you will learn a lot and get to choose your own topic. I used to postphone writing my thesis just so I could rewrite my essays for English 120. Hard work will pay off. Make sure you get your essay read by writing tutors and go for office hours. Professor Stuart is the best. Fun, intelligent and a great leader of discussions, while at the same time very human. I am so glad I took this course. I think had I taken it sooner I would have strongly considered being an English major. Take this before you graduate and with prof stuart.",
    "Take this if you love writing about personal stories and learning how to make a singular point by carefully spreading details throughout the text\u00c2"
