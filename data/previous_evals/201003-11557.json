    "Question 1: As the instructor is already aware, several students (myself included) were unhappy with the primary text, Zhang's Fundamentals of Environmental Sampling and Analysis. The book was poorly written - so poor, in fact, that it was clear several later chapters had been written by a non-native english speaker and then barely edited. This was disappointing and made gleaning useful knowledge from the text difficult. The optional Harris text proved to be much more useful.Apart from this criticism, I found the course extremely useful. I would highly recommend it to anyone planning to use analytical methods in his or her research at F&ES.",
    "Some of the wet-chemistry labs could have been consolidated in the beginning of the course.",
    "the instructor seriously lacks the necessary skills for teaching and efficient communication. Without any exaggeration, I could not understand most of what the instructor said during classes, and had to spend many more hours reading the textbook to understand the basic concept of class materials. While his skills for supervising lab sessions are superb, his teaching skills were found to be worse than the TA."

    "My only regret is that I did not take this course in my first year at F&ES - the first-year students in the course will benefit from the exposure to the analytical methods available for their research.",
    "This course was invaluable for my summer research.",
    "This class is somewhat fundamental to students who study biogeoscience, but the poor teaching skills of the instructor make it impossible for student to fully utilize the class. I suggest developing a new 4-5 credit class where another professor is responsible for more indepth lectures and the current instructor responsible for lab sessions.",
    "This course was an excellent addition to my program. However, I do recommend taking this course in one's first year as opposed to second as it would have been nice to be aware of the chemical analyses available prior to conducting my research."
