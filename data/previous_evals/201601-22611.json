    "There are three types of students who would benefit from this course: 1. Students with a specific statistical research question in mind that they would like to answer. 2. Students who plan to use Stata frequently in their future jobs. 3. Students who have little training in being a consumer of statistical information and would like to expand their understanding of methodological practices. If a student falls into one of these three categories, I would recommend the course. If not, I would probably say pass. The course is designed to teach very specific things, and if that is not what you are looking for, you will likely find the class frustrating. That being said, the course does address the above issues very well. The class, however, is NOT a continuation of GLBL 802. Don't expect it to be. The professors\/advisors at Jackson should do a better job of explaining that.",
    "If you want to learn Stata this is the class."

   "comments": [
    "I learned more about statistical research methods. It would have been nice if we could have talked more about choosing appropriate research questions at the beginning of term--that part of the instruction felt a little haphazard. I know a lot of that instruction was supposed to come from one on one interactions with Justin, but because he often did not respond to emails, it was hard to get that learning experience.",
    "Definitely improved my Stata skills, and great that the course finished with a project using actual data from the real world. Could have benefitted from more \"big picture\" explanations of certain methods -- I still feel fairly uncertain about a few topics that I think we should know better, e.g. when to use weights or how to interpret logit coefficients."
