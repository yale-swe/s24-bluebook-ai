    "This is a course on 'repetion' not in the sense of a critical history of a concept or a history of a literary period or genre. Instead, it brings diverse but related texts together and solicits reflections on what is at stake in literature and philosophy with repetition. I would recommend the seminar.",
    "A meaningfully repetitive reflection on repetition, as it occurs in the 19thC literary& philosophical tradition,& elsewhere. I would recommend it.",
    "Absolutely - very different teaching style to any other class I've taken at Yale, but one I loved. Very manageable reading load, also."
