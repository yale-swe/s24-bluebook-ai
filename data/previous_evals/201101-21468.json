    "Writing in Spanish is a good course for students highly dedicated to learning Spanish syntax, widening their vocabulary, and reviewing complex grammar concepts. The workload is very manageable, but you will be able to make significant improvements nonetheless. However, the course is really what you make of it. If you do not dedicate the time and energy to reviewing your mistakes and actively widening your vocabulary, you will not improve much. So I would recommend this course to dedicated students only.",
    "Not difficult but quite boring.",
    "Writing in Spanish is a basic overview of writing styles (like autobiography, expository, descriptive, argumentative). I feel that my writing somewhat improved through the numerous exercises. IT was a bit tiresome to go through the whole editing rough draft process for every assignment, but I don't regret taking the class. The professor is awesome and seriously one of the nicest people I have met at Yale. She is extremely hardworking, knowledgeable and full of interesting stories to tell. I'd definitely recommend a course with her!"
