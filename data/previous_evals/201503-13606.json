   "comments": [
    "Yes I would recommend the course. The workload is concentrated in a few large assignments but there is not a lot of smaller work due each week. The field trips are amazing!",
    "Take it, lab assignments are long, but are spaced out well. Good introduction to lab\/field ecology based coursess.",
    "Great class, takes a lot of time on fridays with the field trips. also the lab reports are not easy and they take a lot of time. the grading was considerate but not too generous so don't take if you are assuming an easy A. Overall the material was really interesting and the teachers were great.",
    "YES I would whole-heartedly recommend EVST 244 to a fellow student. This class is basically a 12-episode season of the Magic School Bus.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this EVST 244 (Coastal Environments in a Changing World) to any student who is looking for a science credit and is at least somewhat interested in geology and ecology. You get to be out in the field in the New Haven area almost every week, which is a great alternative to other courses. The trips are fun, diverse, interesting, and not too burdensome concerning workload. I also felt like I got to know the environmental history of the Connecticut coastline and Quinnipiac River watershed much better. This class cuts across several scientific disciplines, but was taught in a way that was accessible to students who only had high school background in biology and ecology. Professor Decker is an amazingly approachable, knowledgeable, and patient teacher. Her lectures can get a bit dry, but they usually contain necessary information for understanding the fieldwork we do. The class is small, so you'll get to spend a lot of time with your peers during field trips; I got to know everyone who attended the Cape Cod field trip during Fall Break. About half of my peers were non-EVST majors, so there was no pressure to be a very knowledgeable science student. It is definitely worth waking up for a 9 AM class every Friday!",
    "Great class! You learn about coastal systems and get to spend lots of time outdoors by the water.",
    "EVST 244 was a great introductory course to issues in coastal environmental science. The class was well thought-out and well-planned, with labs that specifically closed in on major issues in the field. The academic backgrounds of the students in the class were diverse, and Professor Decker and Lisa Weber did a commendable job making the material relevant and accessible to all. Assignment expectations were both fair and clear, making the class educational while still attainable and enjoyable. Altogether, the workload was not bad as there were only a few assignments; however, each of these required a substantial amount of quality work. For students who have never written a lab report, this course will ease you into the process and expectations, while still being demanding even if you are a pro. I am also grateful for the research proposal component of this class, not only for the skills I learned but also because of the opportunity to hear about my classmates' proposals, which were eye-opening and impressive. The field-based nature of the course made the lessons particularly memorable and makes this class stand out among many others. The small size of the class allowed the course to feel personal and be highly interactive, in a way many science classes are not. The material itself was very interesting and timely and the field trips were directly related to the class topics and similarly fascinating. Professor Decker did a wonderful job with the structure of this course. Her lectures before the field excursions were always relevant and up-to-point, and enriched the educational quality of the experience once we were in the field. She was clearly very knowledgeable both in regards to the material of the course and environmental science in general, and I enjoyed the information she shared when we were out in the field. Professor Decker is also very supportive and approachable both as an instructor and a mentor figure; she always made herself available to us and made time to discuss any concerns or issues we had. She made the class atmosphere feel collaborative and safe for asking questions\/exploration."
