    "It's really hard, but if you want to learn Spanish you have to take it.",
    "Spanish 120 is a well-organized course that finishes up basic grammar structures and necessary vocabulary. I would recommend it to other students.",
    "Great way to fulfill a foreign language distribution. I recommend this professor for Spanish. He is very understanding and reasonable.",
    "Oscar is great--very engaging and always makes sure to call on people fairly. The class is hard--graded strictly to a rubric, which is nice because it makes it easy to know how you're doing, but also scary in that there's no wiggle room if you bomb a couple tests.",
    "Sure, why not? How else are you going to learn Spanish?",
    "I think that it is a great course, It is very well-structured and planned out and the instructors and format of the class is amazing! It is not hard to get a grade on. I took the class with Oscar Gonzalez. He is an amazing teacher. He is very funny, helpful and uses a lot of interactive media which makes the class more fun. If you get a chance, do take it with him!",
    "I would recommend this class to a fellow student. It has homework every night and more exams then in L1, but it is very managable.",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend L2 spanish to another student. I learned so much between L1 and L2 spanish.",
    "Yes I would. It helps you better grasp the spanish language.",
    "I would highly recommend taking Spanish 120",
    "I would recommend a different instructor."
