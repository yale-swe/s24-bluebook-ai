    "I took it for the language requirement, but I am so thankful for said requirement because this class is awesome.",
    "Yes I would recommend ITAL 130 04 to another student. Great at furthering understanding of and utilizing concepts.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class to another student because it is an interesting and challenging (but not overly demanding) language class. I particularly loved this class because I want to study abroad in Italy someday and because Italian culture is really fun to learn about.",
    "Chris is a fantastic italian teacher. Very dedicated and good at what he does. Try to get in his section if you can.",
    "Fantastic course. Loved how Chris Kaiser tailored the course to our class. Absolutely fantastic teacher, very easy to understand and clearly loves the language and culture and made lessons exciting and interactive especially when he would bring in props or pictures or an anecdote about Italian culture. I love that L3 involves analysis of Italian movies. Chris didn't make us do all of the workbook which was an absolute godsend, because I find it just sucks up time after a few excises and if we struggle with a topic there's nothing stopping us from doing them all of our own accord. I think that system treats us more like adults who can manage their own Learning. I can't recommend Chris enough. Thanks Chris!"
