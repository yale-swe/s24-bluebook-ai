    "this is a really great class. i fully recommend it. it covers a lot of material and the discussions are really fun.",
    "It was an amazing seminar. You really learn a lot about modern China from a sociological standpoint rather than a political or historical one.",
    "Yes",
    "INTS443 provides an overview of contemporary topics pertaining to civil society and the public sphere in contemporary China. We covered a variety of topics in depth through the use of case studies, and the course also included a number of contemporary newspaper readings pertaining to ongoing developments in China. If you are interested in China, interested in civic life, or interested in both, you should definitely take this class.",
    "A very interesting class which gives a different perspective on modern China than other classes might give: both of the top down perspective and on the grassroots level. Quite a bit of work, but worth it if you have the time.",
    "Fascinating material, well structured syllabus, extremely well-informed and involved professor. Lots of reading, all interesting. However, the downside of this was that class discussion was fragmented, often superficial and rarely rewarding. Though Professor Davis provided helpful and interesting questions to direct discussion, the class still seemed to struggle with having a coherent conversation. Perhaps isolating a particular article to discuss for each class and\/or one particular topic would make class discussion more beneficial.",
    "Definitely yes."
