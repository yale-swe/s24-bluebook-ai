   "comments": [
    "I would enthusiastically and overwhelmingly recommend this course for anyone that wanted to take it. It was my favorite class of the semester.",
    "I would describe this as an intensive introduction to philosophy. I would recommend it even though it completely blows my mind and befuddles me.",
    "Professor Kronman speaks in poetry. Good poetry, at that. His knowledge of Plato and Aristotle in particular is so thorough that you always feel safe in section - even when you don't know what your readings mean, you know that he's the man to help you out. He really cares about his students too. Under no circumstances should you swap out of his section. The week-to-week philosophy lectures are a little variable - sometimes the lecturers are just too ambitious with their material. The best lectures are those that deal with one or two discrete philosophical arguments thoroughly, and when the lecturer takes this stance, it's wonderful.",
    "DS Philosophy in the Fall is a survey of Western (including some Near East) Philosophy from ancient Greek to medieval times. More than half the semester is spent on Plato and Aristotle, and you'll see the profound influence they have on thinkers thereafter. As a sort of survey course, you get a taste of different areas of philosophy, but focus primarily on metaphysics (though there's also some scattered epistemology and ethics). If you're really interested in philosophy, you might want to take a course like Intro to Ancient Philosophy to delve even deeper into the crevices of philosophers like Aristotle and Plato, but with DS you get the broad strokes and then some meat. Also, in conjunction with the other DS courses, you can come to holistically view the development of Western Thought.",
    "Take this class. Do not switch out of this section.",
    "Pray to the lord you get a good professor, or else you are going to have serious trouble getting through the philosopher-ese that all of the texts speak in. Kronman is an incredible professor. I know that I will remember this course forever.",
    "This course provided an excellent overview of the major philosophers that have contributed to Western thought. I would definitely recommend DS Philosophy; it has broadened my understanding of the key philosophical issues that continue to shape our culture and thought today.",
    "Directed Studies Philosophy is my most enlightening DS sections, especially since I had never taken philosophy before. From this course, you grasp the deeper meaning of the works of the greatest philosopher, especially if you have Kronman. He really elucidates the real point of the works we read, and just leaves you at the end of each class in awe. Definitely take it with Kronman if you get him.",
    "I would compare this course to a round of speed dating with the highlights of Western philosophy up to the thirteenth century. Part of the nature of Directed Studies is that students are exposed to many different ideas and philosophers and one does not have much time to really focus on any single philosopher in particular.. Part of the point of this, besides understanding how philosophers reacted to one another\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ideas in the greater context of Western thought, is to come upon philosophies that you would be interested in pursuing in more depth later in your Yale career. It is for this reason in particular that I would highly recommend this course as instructive and useful in its own right, but also as a sampling of possibilities of what one might want to eventually pursue further.",
    "I would highly recommend it. The DS philosophy portion is particularly strong, especially for someone who has never encountered these works before.",
    "I would definitely recommend DS Fall Philosophy. It is a fantastic and well-organized course. You are very lucky if you can get Professor Kronman. He is an amazing professor!"
