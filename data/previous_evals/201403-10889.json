    "ENGL 990 is an introduction to many of the issues in teaching English at the college level. It offers practical advice as well as theoretical readings and in-classroom practice.",
    "I would say that this course won't -- and can't -- fully prepare you for teaching, but that you'll feel better for having taken it.",
    "Worthwhile to think about the challenges of teaching before one is in the midst of them.",
    "Yes, I highly recommend this class!",
    "yes, I definitely would... Alfie makes people comfortable doing things like giving presentations and doing teaching demos and that's really important... has to change the out-of-date (i.e., racist, sexist, classist) readings but they weren't that central anyway and I think they're also a product of their time... well-intentioned but bizarre"

   "comments": [
    "I believe that teaching is a really important part of becoming a professor--while many Ivy League graduates may feel that research is the central part of their work, teaching will always be an important part of our responsibilities as we go on and take university jobs (hopefully). This course prepared me for that reality. Even though it will not contribute to my dissertation, it will help me become a teacher and a scholar. That is incredibly important to my future.",
    "The course made me more aware of modes and styles of teaching; it also put the Writing Center, a wonderful resource, on my radar.",
    "I am glad the department requires this course, as I foresee teaching being a primary focus of my professional life.",
    "helped so, so much to get teaching experience--both in terms of getting more comfortable about the idea of teaching Yale undergrads next fall and in terms of thinking about what kind of teacher I am, what things I need to get better at, etc"
