    "The improvization exercises were incredibly useful. The instructors from the drama school who facilitated the exercise were clear and articulate and while I was initially timid in the first round of improv exercises, I quickly built confidence and was able to perform a marketing improv which required on the spot thinking very well. I also enjoyed the open and relaxed class atmosphere that was generated in part by the nature of the course, constantly requiring in-class public speaking exercises. I gleaned and gained tips on how to be a better public speaker from just observing fellow classmates presenting. I enjoyed the 2 speaking events that were organised as part of the course and especially enjoyed the P&G talk on how to make an effective pitch.",

    "I was hoping the course would have provided exercises on voice projection and articulation as I feel that as much as confidence in public speaking is critical, it equally requires an accompanying voice structure. Voice exercises on pitch and in flexion would have been very useful for me. The instructor only gave tips\/ corrections on this in the last exercises and I was hoping it would have come earlier to give me enough time to address this area while class was still in session.",
    "Practice speaking about more professional topics would be helpful. We did persuasive public speaking, but it was more personal in nature.",
