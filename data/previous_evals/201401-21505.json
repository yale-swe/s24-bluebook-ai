    "I would absolutely recommend this course! Professor Kocher is a fabulous lecturer, the subject matter is engaging, and the workload is minimal. If you attend lecture you're sure to do well and have a great experience.",
    "I would avoid this class like the plague.",
    "I thought it was a great class and I would recommend it to another student. Good if you are interested in international affairs and the way countries interact with each other.",
    "Awful. Boring, both the professor and the teaching fellow are really pretentious. Don't take it.",
    "It was a great class and I would definitely recommend it. The workload is very manageable and the reading is extremely interesting. Take if you want a great introduction to international security and international relations.",
    "Great course, I would definitely recommend it to my fellow students.",
    "Coming off of Intro to IR, I chose to take this class as it seemed like a more in-depth look at the cause of wars, regime types and so forth. I enjoyed the class and recommend it if you would like to learn more about current events and the way that wars have and will continue to shape the political world dynamic.",
    "There is not a lot of work for this class but you have to focus on the assignments and tests you do have. An interesting class but didn't knock my off my feet or anything",
    "Great overall class. Very fair if you go to class and do the work."
