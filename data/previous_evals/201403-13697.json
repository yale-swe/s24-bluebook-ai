    "The topics were clearly laid out in the syllabus, although I think we quickly deviated from the syllabus due to a lot of in class discussion, which was not a bad thing, but did mean we had to cram quite a bit of information into a few days of coursework."

    "There was a fair mount of confusion about when things where do and some of the assignment guidelines\/instructions where hard to follow at times.",
    "The assignments were pretty well spelled out in the syllabus, I would have appreciated a little more in class explanation of a few of the assignments, especially the final presentation seemed to be left very open to interpretation which was somewhat confusing only because of how open ended it was.",
    "The course outline was clear in terms of topics and reading. It was changed a few times, but re-issued which was very helpful.",
    "The expectations were clearly laid out in the syllabus.",
    "The syllabus is a little cluttered. I think the layout is working against clearly conveying the information."

   "comments": [
    "Some classes got off track.",
    "The information was always interesting but It was a very long class. I think it would be more effective if broken into two shorter class periods",
    "Bill knows the material so well that he does not necessarily need to follow the powerpoint. This is only a problem when trying to take notes in that the slides are gone through so quickly you cant really take notes from them and absorb the information\/listen at the same time.",
    "I felt like some lectures were rushed, and that Bill sometimes moved through the material too quickly. He is clearly very knowledgeable of the subjects and so sometimes I think he rushed through things that are common knowledge to him but aren't to all of us. It also made it difficult to take notes because he did not linger on any single slide of the power point for long enough to take down notes from it.",
    "The class sessions were very well prepared, but they often ran over the class time. I found this to be incredibly frustrating, as the 15 minutes following the class was my only break between 9 am and 2 pm. It also meant that there was less time at the end of the presentation of the lecture during class time to discuss and respond to the topic and share ideas. I think it would create a more engaging class structure if the lecture portion were shorter, and students had more time to talk about the topic with Bill present to inform and guide.",
    "There was a fair amount of juggling the schedule and content based on falling behind, but I don't think it really detracted from the class.",
    "It seemed like we never quite had enough time."

    "I found the workload to work well with this courses expectations and discussions.",
    "The projects got a little jumbled and so we ended up with a few due right in a row, but the intention was clearly to keep them evenly spread, and I think it would have worked well if not for outside events complicating the process.",
    "The assignments were great because they often had us look at the work we were doing, which made the course material relevant in our day to day.",

    "the hands on activities were good, i felt the final project was a little too open ended and I'm not sure I got as much out of it as I would have liked to, but I think that was more a matter of trying to come up with a topic and not having a great one in mind.",
    "I really enjoyed the final presentation specifically. It was great to take what we'd learned over the semester, and then apply it to a topic that we were specifically interested in, and then present it to the class.",
    "The presentation is an exception, which I would rate a 5."

  {
   "question_id": "DR385",
   "question_text": "If tests were given, how fairly did they measure knowledge gained?",
   "comments": [
    "They measured our ability to find the information more than necessarily retain it, which is sort of how this would work in reality I think. It doesn't have to be memorized, but we do have to be aware of it and be able to reference it when needed, and i think it served well in that regard.",
    "I like that they were take home exams, because in the real world you would go and look something up if you had questions. For the most part you would know the answer but you would want to go check. The important thing is that we learned where to look to be sure (Teach a man to fish, etc).",
    "The open book tests didn't really measure knowledge gained, but they did measure your ability to find the needed information as might be required of you in the real world.",
    "The first test felt spot on, but the second test covered a lot of material that only appeared in readings outside of class."

    "It made me much more aware of codes that must be met",
    "I learned I have done many many MANY unsafe things in my previous production work, and I now know that I should probably not do those things again. So that's good.",
    "It's health and safety. It's super necessary.",

   "comments": [
    "Fire extinguisher training could have been more comprehensive. It would have been nice to do one of the practice extinguisher exercises. Other than that, safety was a very useful course!",
    "Some practical issues, common to theater practice, were not addressed specifically. For example, what respiratory protection is needed when working with XPS Foam? What respiratory protection is needed when using HVLP spraying equipment? There are several, extremely common examples of this common to theatrical production. Scaffolding is another example, and in fact, one of the first classes was on assembling and disassembling the scaffold at 1156. Practical application should be consistently integrated into the course.",
    "This course opened my eyes to an aspect of theater that I wasn't very considerate about before coming to Yale. The powerpoints were thorough and helpful in communicating the topics of lecture. The mixture of topics was also very comprehensive and enjoyable. The homework assignments were appropriate and were relevant to the topics that were covered. The assignments were not challenging but perfectly practical and applicable in the duties that a TD might perform in the future.",
    "Overall a very informative class. My only suggestion i breaking it up over two class period. Its a lot of information to take in when you are just sitting for two hours. I really enjoyed the speakers that came in and the hands on exercises like setting up the scaffolding",
    "I would almost suggest breaking the class up into two 1.5 hour long sections a week. This allows for a greater amount of material coverage a week, but in a less dense format as you have two classes to digest one weeks worth of topics. Two hours was a long class to sit through and actually absorb all the information being presented.",
    "Amazing class.",
    "I was really interested in everyone's presentations. There's really no reason they all need to be grouped together. I'd suggest spreading them out through the semester if people are willing to take earlier slots."
