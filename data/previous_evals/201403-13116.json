   "comments": [
    "This was an amazing English class. I have taken other, discussion-based English courses, but the focus on the \"essay\" was a different but fascinating change for me. I learned a lot in a short amount of time, and I grew more as a writer than I honestly thought was possible in such a short time. I really believe that Professor Emre is one of the best instructors Yale has to offer.",
    "If you are interested in writing or enjoy reading creative non-fiction, English 120 is the best class to take. The classes are so fun, and the readings are relatively short. The workload is also very manageable. Merve Emre is the best: she is a great professor and really gets the conversation going so that all of the people in the class want to participate. She is also so nice and helps tremendously with the essays.",
    "I would definitely recommend 120 to another student. Every class is fun and interesting. You will see serious improvement in your writing by the end of the semester. Make sure that you have a good group of people taking the class with you and try to take it with Merve if you can!",
    "Great class, definitely try to take it with Merv. She makes a real effort to ensure that all of the readings are interesting and helpful for the papers, is a fair grader, and is great with meeting with students and helping you figure out how best to improve your writing on each piece. Really enjoyed taking 120 with her.",
    "English 120 is by no means the \"Quintessential Yale course that every Yalie should take\" (this was a review I read which made me take this course). The class gives you the skills needed to write creative articles for publications like the New Yorker. As a science major, I don't see this skill being particularly handy in the future. Nevertheless, it was enjoyable to explore other avenues of writing and churn out a couple pieces I am really proud of. If you are taking this course, do yourself a favor and take it with Merve Emre. I think I would have regretted taking 120 if I didn't have Merve, but having her as my professor made me enjoy a course that I otherwise wouldn't have been too interested in.",
    "I would highly recommend the course. This class was easily the highlight of my first semester.",
    "A great class that exposes you to a wide variety of genres and hones your skills of close reading.",
    "Take it with Merve Emre. If you are looking for a course to develop your writing abilities in any area, 120 is it. You do not need to be invested in writing personal essays to glean something of value from the course. The five essay format allows you to spend a lot of time with your writing. The essays you read for class each day are topical and timely--something you'd want to be discussing outside of the classroom anyways. Overall, a thoroughly enjoyable course.",
    "I took the class with Merve because one of the evaluations I had read said: take the class with Merve Emre. I did, and I never regretted anything. So I will say the same thing here: take the class with Merve Emre. Yes there are other great classes and great lecturers from the English Department, but you'd be silly to pass up ENGL 120 with Merve Emre. She's that good, and you'd be amazed by how much you learn from this class.",
    "I would highly recommend ENGL 120, especially with Merve. She's incredibly funny, kind, and engaging in her teaching. The style of writing that the course teaches is creative nonfiction, which I was quite unfamiliar with going into the class. However, over the course of the semester I became much more comfortable with both writing and analyzing essays\/articles of this style, which has led me to have a stronger appreciation for good writing.",
    "I would absolutely recommend English 120. It is my current favorite class. I would summarize it as mastering the personal essay by exploring a variety of incredibly entertaining essays written by established authors.",
    "ENGL 120 is a course designed to improve your writing stylistically. You write 5 short essays over the course of the class, at least one of which is workshopped by the class, so you get lots of feedback about how to improve your papers. Each essay is about something different (profile, cultural critique, a place, etc.). You read published essays in order to get ideas and evaluate what does and doesn't work for your own piece. I would absolutely recommend that anyone who wants to improve their writing take this course. It is designed for people who enjoy writing, and it can be a lot of work, but the payoff is definitely worth it. I walked out a much better writer than I was going into the class.",
    "English 120 with Professor Emre is a great introduction to the art of the non-fiction essay. Professor Emre is a very engaging teacher and really keeps the class-discussion going. She also does a great job breaking down the structure of essays and teaching you how to structure your own. Beware though, this class is not an easy grade. Professor Emre is a hard grader and each essay takes a lot of work. The essays are really the bulk of the work in the class while some of the readings are fun, but Professor Emre is great about meeting for office hours to go over ideas. Note: a lot of the readings in this class focus on writing for the digital age and pop-culture, this may work better for some people. Although, she does balance it out with more classical essays in the beginning of the course. Overall though, a great course with a great teacher worth taking no matter what you want to study."
