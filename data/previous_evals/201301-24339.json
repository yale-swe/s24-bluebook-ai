So long as you're comfortable with being endlessly flexible, and so long as you have an interest in this period of Indian history, go ahead and take the course.",

    "Oh yes! Take the class. Do the reading sin advance, read them well and class will be a very rewarding experience. It will be like walking through history in slow motion!"
