   "comments": [
    "I got to see a broad overview of religious writing across many genres, and especially how diverse the body of writing can be. I don't know if my writing improved throughout the course, but I think I can more clearly recognize when I've written badly now than before.",
    "I really felt like this class helped me to take my academic writing from being structured and component-based to argument and style-based. I'm hoping this takes my papers in other classes from average to very interesting.",
    "I came into the class really looking to be able to talk about religion in a academic setting. Although the class did not really delve into the meat and bones of religion, I expected that going in. Still, it was very interesting to use religion as a subject matter and really focus on writing about a topic that has been so hard for me to put into words over the years. I enjoyed that I was really able to explore my own feelings about religion in this class as I wrote about my own experiences in all three of my papers. I also liked the heavily journalistic path that I chose to take with the course's biggest paper. As a prospective journalist, I really wanted a class where I could do interviewing and sourcing and turn in a longer feature piece. Although the paper didn't turn out to be a fully journalistic piece, it was really eye-opening to do all the work that goes into a lengthy feature piece.",
    "My writing skills improved and I was able to write two personal essays which allowed me to self-reflect, as well as a research essay through which I learned about a new topic.",
    "I learned how to right in many different writing styles including academic papers, journalistic papers, as well as personal essays. I learned about how to construct my voice within the piece and how powerful it could be.",
    "The course encouraged us to think critically and extensively about the complexities of religion and culture. Readings were informative and very thought provoking.",
    "This course taught me mostly about the craft of expository writing, but a strong secondary focus was how communities in the past and present have engaged with religion and belief. I learned different approaches to writing, including academic, journalistic, and personal. I also learned how better to interweave elements of style with those of argument."

   "comments": [
    "A lot of interesting readings! The visits to the Beinecke and Art Gallery were also really fun, and was a great chance for us to interact with writing in a tangible and proximal way. One thing I would've liked is more guidance in class on writing and more direction in terms of essay topics. I sometimes felt lost and just had to press forwards with writing an essay. The help provided during office hours was really useful though!",
    "We read a lot of different styles of pieces, which broadened my horizons for how to do the assignments. Expectations were clear and the class was generally engaging. One suggestion for improvement would be that I feel a class like this should have more smaller assignments (1-2 pages) that we get feedback on throughout, as well as the longer ones. This would allow frequent writing in between the major essays and even more chances to hone skills.",
    "I think one of the strengths of this course were the discussions that took place in class. I think this semester there was a really vibrant mix of people from all different kinds of religious backgrounds that were really able to bring different perspectives to the class. I think the class could've improved in maybe giving more direction in terms of topics. Of course, I liked that we were given pretty much free reign to talk about any topics pertaining to religion, but that made it hard to discuss others' papers from a content standpoint as I had very little background.",
    "The course didn't seem to have a deliberate trajectory-- we went from reading to reading with no apparent underlying sequence.",
    "I thought that more of the class discussion could have been centered around stylistic and structural techniques specific to writing about religion. I felt that a disproportionate amount of time was spent discussing the actual religious beliefs presented in the texts we were assigned. While this type of discussion is important in general, I did not find it helpful as I worked to improve my writing skills. However, I did think that the texts we read were well-chosen, representing a variety of religions, time periods, and writing styles. I especially enjoyed our guest visits and our trip to the Beinecke Library.",
    "A strength of this course was the fact that we got to write about religion through various genres. We learned how to do this by reading lots of writing on religion in a plethora of genres.",
    "Can honestly not think of improvements Readings were incredibly interesting Class was structured very well Paper topics allowed for creativity",
    "I really liked how open-ended the assignments and materials were. The class felt more like an exploration of religion and writing than a training ground for writing skills, which is a good thing."

    "I enjoyed this class. I haven't taken 120, but from what I heard from other classmates, they seem kind of similar (but don't quote me on that). I would recommend it as a pretty chill writing requirement that will help you expand your horizons from just academic writing.",
    "I think I would recommend this class to someone if they are generally interested in exploring religion in his\/her life. I think it provides pretty much the same english instruction that you can find in other English 121 classes but the topic matter is really what separates this class.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student interested in nonfiction writing. I feel that I have a better grasp of how to represent other people's traditions and beliefs in writing, while remaining objective, sensitive, and accepting. I think that this understanding could easily be applied to many other topics in the field of nonfiction writing.",
    "I would definitely recommend taking this course! It was super interesting and fun. I also learned a lot about writing on religious topics.",
    "Absolutely! Professor Hopper is an incredible and brilliant human being. Everyone should take a class with her",
    "This is a great writing class! A lot more free-form than 114, but still more focused than 120. You get a chance to break the mold of that overused 5-paragraph format and try your hand at more exciting and innovative argumentative structures. Dr. Hopper is also really kind and generous. Overall a really positive experience."
