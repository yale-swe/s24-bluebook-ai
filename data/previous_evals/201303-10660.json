    "I would not recommend Music 210 unless a student is financially unable to take lessons not for credit.",
    "An excellent introduction to mid- to upper-level theory. Gives a good overview of analysis concepts and an introduction to composition. Moderate workload, not overly difficult, but challenging.Yes. Because it's the kind of class you really need to take if you want to do anything with further music theory, and it's a good class.",
    "Basic and tedious analysis of music. If you like turning music into a scientific and sterile process that can be broken down into tiny meaningless bits, this class is great. If you don't, study up beforehand and test into 211.",
    "You'll come out of it with a solid understanding of music theory concepts, but it is a lot of work outside of class.",
    "Music 210 is a great course for learning historical fundamentals of tonal theory. Prepare yourself for the fact that it is not about making music. It is rather a class about getting under the surface of the music. With that in mind, you will be fine.",
    "A class which teaches you how to analyze music. You're not going to get much out of it for your compositions. In fact, i think the only thing I learned about composition was that Deceptive cadences sound cool.",
    "I took Music 210 mostly so I could get lessons for credit. That being said, I enjoyed the class enough and thought I learned enough from it to make it \"worth my time\". Grading is fair, and classes are rather interesting with a fair amount of discussion\/student participation -- I would recommend this to another student.",
    "I would recommend this course- a good overview of theory in the common practice period, involving both theoretical and hands-on aspects. I would recommend taking it with Professor Poudrier; she is great. It is definitely a good amount of work though."
