    "The class was centered around performing research for another lab, with the pertinent principles and techniques along the way. I would highly recommend this class.",
    "Great lab course! As with the first half, it is a great lab to complete requirements, low stress, great learning experience, and lots of fun. This session has traditionally been characterized with shorter lab days, but with the experiment change this year, that was certainly not true, though the course was definitely still enjoyable and manageable. At the end of this semester, you give a presentation as opposed to write a paper, which was more straightforwardand also fun. However, the grading could have been a bit arbitrary because it ended up being peer graded.",
    "Absolutely take this class, it is one of the best-kept secrets at Yale! Fantastic material, teaching, and experience.",
    "Definitely, definitely take this if you've already taken the last lab. Some students in the class went to different labs, such as biochemistry, and I personally believe they lost out. Professor Nelson is amazing and the experiments are always interesting, so this is a no-lose situation.",
    "Highly recommend the course.",
    "Yes. Light workload, great learning experience, definitely one of the best labs at Yale.",
    "I would recommend it to any science majors in related areas--you really don't want to quit an awesome lab course in the middle of the semester, so definitely take both halves.",
    "Basically the same as MCDB 342L except with a different project and a presentation at the end instead of a paper. Although this is optional after MCDB 342L, I figure you might as well just take both since they're both enjoyable and a great way to get science lab credits."
