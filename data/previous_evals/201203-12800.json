    "SEBASTIAN DIAZ IS AMAZING! If you don't take this course with him you are missing out. There is never a dull moment in his class. He is so invested in helping his students learn and by the end of the semester you have learned so much. He encourages everyone to speak and switch partners everyday, which fosters a close group of friends. My best\/favorite class of the semester - BY FAR!",
    "I would only recommend this course if you have taken spanish sometime in your life beforehand.",
    "This class is great and relatively low-key if you want to learn Spanish. Your professor really matters for this class, so definitely make sure to ask around about who's good. Professor Diaz is especially wonderful if you're lucky enough to get into his class! He's very friendly, engaging, and encouraging.",
    "Spanish 110 is a fantastic introduction to Spanish. It may be difficult to keep up with the professor in the beginning of the semester (since he only speaks Spanish), but it gets more and more manageable throughout the course. There is homework every day, but it's very helpful. The course overall is solid. I would recommend it to anyone who hopes to begin learning Spanish.",
    "Daily homework and frequent assessments. A great way to learn a new language. Take the class with Sebastian Diaz for sure. He is an amazing professor.",
    "If you're lacking a language and want to learn a language that might be potentially useful to you in the future, you should take this course.",
    "take it if you want an easy class but useful knowledge of the language. covers vocab, grammar, and culture. focus on listening speaking and writing. only annoying part is that the class is every day for an hour, which becomes a bit repetitive and restricts you from signing up from other classes of interest",
    "It's a good course. Do the homework, spend some time studying for the test, and you'll be fine. Take it with Sebastian if possible-- he's great!"
