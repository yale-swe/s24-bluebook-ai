    "One of the best classes I've taken at Yale. Concrete skills learned.",
    "I would definitely recommend that you take this class. You'll be exposed to a wide variety of negotiation techniques and you'll become better at handling difficult conversations. In other words, you'll finish the semester with two extremely valuable skills. Typically, you'll cover new material at the start of each class. Throughout the lesson, you'll be able to participate in interactive exercises. Then, toward the end of the lesson, you'll have a chance to try out some new skill or technique in a case simulation. Justin and Lesley were phenomenal instructors. They made each class fun and engaging and they genuinely cared about their students. They also always took the time to provide feedback and coaching. Lastly, the assignments were very rewarding. Through them, you'll discover new ways to develop habits and you'll learn more about why someone might say \"no\" to your requests. The assigned readings were also very reasonable and often enjoyable. I even hope to come back to the books we read and dive into the chapters we didn't get to. Overall, the class is a fantastic experience. If you get a spot, take it for sure.",
    "Do NOT take this class. It is a lot of busy work and the entire curriculum is bullshit. Waste of a Yale credit.",
    "Absolutely. This course is amazing and you will learn so much about yourself. It changes the way you approach every conversation, and some of the assignments that we do involve contact with the outside world (beyond just your friends) that will force you to do things you never thought you'd do.",
    "One of the best classes I've taken at Yale (like top 3 out of 36). A must if it's still offered and you can get in. Justin is an incredible instructor.",
    "Take it if it's offered again. Interesting reading and classroom activities. Might be harder if you're super shy, but will help you with that.",
    "Essentially, this course offers an opportunity to negotiate a written case every Monday morning. If you like performing and\/or talking in class, this course is for you. A little more \"doing\" than I had imagined, as the readings were rarely relevant (which was clear from the fact that many people stopped doing the readings toward the end of the semester). Grading was a bit arbitrary, but the more you talk in class, the more the instructors will like you.",
    "I would recommend it to a student who is interested in improving as a negotiator. It is an excellent course that makes sure not to just teach you about negotiation but to improve you as a negotiator. It was one of the most interesting classes I have taken at Yale. However, be warned that the grading is quite difficult and seems to be somewhat arbitrary at times.",
    "Negotiation is broken down into main parts. which this class goes through part by part. There are some readings and assignments week to week, but it's not that heavy (at most 50 pages + an assignment that might take an hour). Just a good class overall.",
    "Class was kind of stressful bc of the negotiations and because the schedule of readings and assignments was so confusing. Very interesting readings though. Get the books if you can't take the class. This class WILL infiltrate other parts of your life and how you think about you conversations\/relationships. That enhanced self-awareness and analysis was kind of frustrating bc I coudn't turn it off when I left class.",
    "This class pitted student against student in a way that I thought was unhealthy. Making two students negotiate for one passing grade might be fun the first time, but over the course of the semester it built a lot of tension in the class. In fact, there was a moment in the middle of the semester where two students offered real collateral over the course of a negotiation exercise and one screwed the other one over and the whole class got involved (angry\/passive aggressive emails, picking sides, etc.) It felt a bit like the Stanford Prison Experiments. Although both of the course professors were obviously skilled and knowledgeable about the subject matter, in comparison with my other Yale professors, these course instructors were less available outside of class and were slower to respond to student emails. The grading for many of the assignments also felt arbitrary, as they were slow with the comments on each assignment so it was difficult to show improvement over time.",
    "One of the best courses I've taken at Yale. The course has many hands-on assignments, for example developing a new habit. This class completely changed the way I think about life and my own habits. The negotiation tactics are applicable and taught in no other way than practicing them. Take this class if you can - you won't regret it."
