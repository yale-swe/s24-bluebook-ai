    "This is such an underrated class. I highly recommend it to English majors looking for a fun and unique junior seminar. The material is extremely interesting and provides a great mix of Victorian and contemporary texts. It's probably the best English class I've taken thus far at Yale.",
    "Fantastic. Enjoy anything Victorian? Take this class. Enjoy art? Take this class. Enjoy books? Take this class."
