   "comments": [
    "If you're coming at this from a Math\/CS background, you've probably taken Algorithms, and so you should be able to handle this. It was pretty topical the semester I took it, and it may begin to feel a bit tedious, but it's still pretty interesting, and it's nice to apply CS to economics, although you might wish you would cover more in the course of an entire semester.If you're coming at this from an Econ background, you should probably be careful since the economics in this course are really pretty basic (limited to game theory and incentive theory), whereas the text assumes some familiarity with algorithm design, so it's not inaccessible, but you'll certainly have a lot more background reading to do.",
    "I am really glad I took this. I was hesitant at first since it was an econ class, and I am more interested in the CS aspects, but what convinced me to take it was the name of the textbook: \"Algorithmic Game Theory\". Really interesting topics. The class is a little piecemeal, but that's more because the subjects are so disjointed, not because it was poorly planned.",
    "This would have been a great course if two things had been missing: the textbook and the professor.",
    "The way this course was taught this semester it was a waste of time. If you're an econ student, there's too much to catch up on to have a fighting chance in the course unless you have computer science or have already taken the Math\/Econ game theory. If you're a computer science major, this course doesn't teach you a new way to think and doesn't give you information that's going to be widely applicable to other stuff you're doing. You learn how to solve very specific problems but that's about it. Go take Econ 351 instead if you want to learn some game theory with real math. Or take another CS elective. Just don't waste your time here.",
    "The idea behind this class was a good one. It attempts to give a a survey of some of the areas that have been studied or are currently being studied in algorithmic game theory. The topics covered are generally really interesting. Problem sets and exams were pretty fair.However, this is the worst class I have ever taken at Yale. This is mainly because, all considerations of blame aside (I don't know if anyone or anything is really to blame here), Professor Feigenbaum is the worst professor I have ever had at Yale, and the textbook was the worst textbook I have ever used.Professor Feigenbaum definitely has good intentions and wants her students to succeed. However, her lectures are extremely disorganized, they always made simple concepts confusing, and she herself seemed unprepared to give her own lectures.The first lecture should have been a red flag: she gave an introduction to the course and covered basic concepts in game theory and algorithms. I had already taken game theory and CPSC 365 and understood the basic underlying principles pretty well, but after listening to her try to explain concepts like auctions and NP-completeness, I was somehow now confused about things I already understood. Confusion was apparent on the faces of all the students, so in her attempt to give a better explanation, she launched into a discussion of N-satisfiability without giving ANY introduction as to what it was, apparently assuming everyone had already taken CS365. This whole thing lasted about half an hour, and it was extremely painful.The other major problem was that her prepared lecture notes seemed to either have been 3 years old, prepared by someone else, or lacking due to the fact that she did not actually try to understand them when she copied formulas and snippets from the textbook (which itself was all kinds of awful). It was not uncommon for her to pause in the middle of writing something on the board and say something like \"Hmm... isthat supposed to be an i or a j?\" or \"Now this formula is a lot of notation, and I'm looking at it and I'm not really sure what it means. Can someone help me out here?\". Otherwise, someone might ask something like \"is that supposed to be superscript index or a subscript index?\", to which she would pause and reply, \"I'm not sure, this formula is just copied from your textbook. But it may be wrong, so let's try and figure out what it's supposed to be\" and then take class time to try and figure out the correct form for a formula.Professor Feigenbaum is not particularly good at explaining concepts (she has a tendency to bring in unnecessary related details or otherwise make a simple concept seem extremely complicated), and she also often goes off on tangents, which sometimes led to her insisting that she finish the lecture and going 10 to 15 minutes over the end of lecture.Lectures were mainly formulas with no examples or other words explaining what the formula was used for, or to what major concept the current material applied. The notation completely obscured simple concepts and was inconsistent throughout the textbook. Professor Feigenbaum rarely used simple headings to precede her lecture material; in addition, she would sometimes mention important things but then give them no further attention, and I rarely saw her write these important things on the blackboard.The textbook was just a compilation of articles published in the field, and so had varying notation and were in no logical order. Over the course of the semester, the class and Professor Feigenbaum uncovered many errors\/ambiguities\/inconsistencies in the body of the textbook as well as in the questions at the end of each chapter. This made doing problem sets extremely painful, when after slogging through the unnecessarily complicated notation or ambiguous diction, the problems themselves were ambiguous.Do NOT take this course unless you absolutely have to, or someone else is teaching it.",
    "Feigenbaum is a great professor, so if you can, I would definitely try to take a course with her at some point. Economics and Computation is interesting because it goes over a lot of relatively new work at the intersection of two interesting fields. Sometimes the proofs are not the most fascinating, and in general the work can be notation heavy.Almost all the people in the class were CS and Math people, except for a couple of graduate students in Econ that seemed to know a lot about Game Theory. I sort of wonder how accessible the class is for Econ students. The proof styles are very familiar to CS students and the difficulty level is relatively low. But I don't know if the same is true for Econ or Econ Math students.",
    "Overall Economics and Computation was a good computer science elective. Professor Feigenbaum presented a lot of material that I had little to no experience with, so I felt that I got a lot out of the semester. There was a lot of game theory and auction theory, which are both very interesting subjects. I'm not sure that I was interested enough to continue studying them in the future, but I'm glad to have the overview that this class provided. The problem sets were hard enough to help teach the material, but douable. One complaint that I think will come up in several reviews is that the book used can be a bit frustrating at times - notation tends to be inconsistent and proofs are often presented without enough rigor. However, I think the professor is aware of the weaknesses in the text and will hopefully work to continue clarifying issues when this class is taught again in the future. Overall a yes if you're looking for a theoretical elective."
