   "comments": [
    "Green Design is an interesting introduction to the subject, but after the first few lectures the course runs out of things to talk about a bit. Fun and low-key option but you won't go too in depth.",
    "A great class, much like the ENAS class on new product development class but with an environmental focus. Take it.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student. The material is interesting and there's not an overwhelming amount of work. The final project was fun.",
    "GESD is a course that has the potential to be really fantastic, but for some reason was largely disappointing, mainly due to the lectures. The semester-long projects were a great learning experience, though. If you need to take this class, it won't be the worst decision you've ever made.",
    "Definitely take this class! I had never taken a design-based class, and now I'm hooked on it! I hope Yale opens up a few more design courses. You'll learn tons and getting to critique and make your own designs is great!",
    "A broad overview of Green Engineering and Design. Take it if you've never taken an engineering or design course before, its really introductory. I'd recommend it for the chance to learn and apply the design process, which I'd never done in class before. If you've had any design class before however this class will not be useful.",
    "It's much more about design than it is about engineering, but that's really what makes it so much fun.",
    "This course is extremely useful for anyone interested in environmental engineering. The hands on exercises and interactive lectures helped convey the information very well.",
    "It's not like a typical engineering course in that there aren't really any equations to memorize. It's also not technical. There's a lot of hands-on work and in-class work. The most interesting part is the final project in which you get a few months to work on a environmental engineering problem. But this project is only fun if you invest in a lot of time in it. Our group met about once a week and we all learned a lot from the experience. One of the weaknesses of this course is that some of what we learn seem obvious and something you would naturally come up with on your own even if you didn't take the course.",
    "This class covers general principles of green engineering\/design and attempts to apply them to specific problems (water quality, reducing waste, etc.). You learn about Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) and other tools for evaluating how sustainable processes and products are. The class is easy but it's not easy to score highly on the assignments. Small mistakes or oversights can cost you huge amounts of points on the problem sets and midterm. The assignments are very easy, so with a large-ish class they need to curve the class in such a way as to differentiate the students (a mix of undergrads and grads). It's an easy class but you may find yourself frustrated by THE DESIGN PROJECT which is by far the most important part of the class. You'll be thrust into a random group of students and have all semester to come up with a sustainable design solution to a particular prompt. It's an awesome idea but it's not easy, especially considering your group could consist of virtually any of the students in the class.",
    "if you get a good group project it will be worth it, but the lectures are basically a waste of time.",
    "Yes I would recommend this class, especially if you want a course that offers a more hands-on approach to problem solving.",
    "I can speak only for environmental engineers here, and what I have to say is: Don't take this subpar, silly, superficial gloss on what should be an important and compelling subject unless you absolutely have to. As it turns out, you absolutely have to. Become just a little more jaded.Don't slack off though--grading, while not that frustrating, does have enough of a touch of arbitrariness that the course cannot be blown off, despite the easiness of its material."
