    "Only addressed issues in China Invited guest lecturers were also from China Homework trained us critical thinking of basic epidemiological study design problems",
    "Great course. Dr. Zheng is a great professor and I had a deeper understanding of epidemiology, especially some key points which I was not quite clear about before.",
    "Excellent introduction to environmental epidemiology. Strengths: Caring and devoted lecturer, provides a sound introduction to article critiques, wonderful guest speakers. No major weaknesses.",
    "This course did not provide much helpful information than other Epidemiology courses.",
    "Explained basic concepts of epidemiology by a lot of actual studies.",
    "Many of the case studies were the professors ongoing studies in China. Going in, I didn't expect such a heavy emphasis on China.",
    "I was very disappointed with this course, and feel that it was completely unnecessary for people to take if they had already taken Epidemiology II, as the same concepts were discussed in both. I also felt like the course was thrown together at the last minute, and although Dr. Zheng is a fantastic researcher, he focused the entire course on environmental health issues in China, which is not the only area of the world where these problems persist."

    "Instructor: Tongzhang Zheng \u00a0Half of the classes were not taught by himself, so he did not spend much time on the course.",
    "Instructor: Tongzhang Zheng \u00a0informative, humorous, thoughtful for students",
    "Instructor: Tongzhang Zheng \u00a0He's very passionate about his work. Expects students to have a strong foundation in Epi. It's a little difficult to gauge if he's expecting an answer from you or the question is rhetorical."

   "comments": [
    "Too specific topics in environmental epidemiological studies that only addressed issues in China. Students who are interested in environmental epidemiology are recommended to take the course, but more studies from other countries are expected to improve this course than just focused in China.",
    "Great course to learn how to critique articles from peer reviewed journals using articles about environmental exposures.",
    "I did not learn much from this course, so I would not recommend it.",
    "Our four homeworks, final and midterm were critiquing an article. Although I appreciate the feedback and strengthening my ability to read and dissect research article, this is much too redundant of an assignment. I believe this class has more potential if revamped."
