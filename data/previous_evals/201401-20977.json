    "I would recommend it for anyone who wants to get out of their Western music \"comfort zone.\" Do be warned that it does not becomes appreciably different or varied in terms of subject matter after the first few weeks (though to his credit Professor Scott does try to look at North Indian music from a number of different perspectives), and that the assignments are short but relatively numerous. Grading is not harsh, and the workload is not at all demanding. Don't expect to be able to delve too deeply into the material, but if you reasonable expectations and do the work you'll enjoy it."
