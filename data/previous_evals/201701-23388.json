   "comments": [
    "I gained a lot of insight onto modern political philosophy and the thinkers that have helped shaped these ideas since the Renaissance. It was an extremely interesting and fulfilling course to take.",
    "I developed my critical reading and writing skills and became more comfortable discussing political theory.",
    "This class really pushed me to think about the texts we read, beyond the surface to a deeper understanding of each work and its connections to others in the syllabus.",
    "I learned how to synthesize the works we read throughout the semester in terms of broader questions about history and politics. My reading and writing skills also improved greatly, as did my ability to look for and recognize continuing trends\/themes amongst the authors we read.",
    "I learned so much from this class. Of all the DS classes I had this semester, this one probably was in the most constant dialogue with itself. The concepts discussed were so consistent, and the works so intricate and interesting in themselves, that I feel that I've barely even skimmed their depths.",
    "I developed close reading skills and the ability to understand works in a historical context."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The strengths of the course are the amazing works that we read and the seminar style discussion sections. Out of all of my DS seminars this semester, my HP class was the most comfortable to speak in, and everyone really respected one another, allowing for good discussions in class. Professor Nakhimovsky also made class very interesting and did a great job at steering conversation in the right way. The only weakness of the course was that there was too much reading assigned for certain weeks, which is a complaint of DS on the whole.",
    "The strengths of the course are the readings, which were engaging and challenging. The material is carefully chosen, but very amitious. The readings were sometimes way too long. We had a fun class and I enjoyed our discussions. I didn't enjoy writing responses twice a week, but I found this to be a useful review for the final.",
    "The strength of this class is the style with which Professor Nakhimovsky led the discussions, which were incredibly engaging.",
    "This was my favorite course this semester. It synthesizes history and politics in a wonderful way, and some of the texts we encountered were thought-provoking and wonderful, like Rousseau, Du Bois and Arendt. We also were able to discuss ideas in smaller groups and then bring our ideas to the larger class setting which I think worked well.",
    "See previous responses to DS courses",
    "The amount of reading for the course is high and there is not enough time for full discussion of the material. The course could be improved by giving specific sections for reading to focus in more on and have students better prepared for discussion."

   "comments": [
    "Yes!",
    "I would recommend this course to another student if they really want a thorough introduction to modern political philosophy. The works we read and the class discussions feel very different than first semester HP, which was something I didn't necessarily feel with Literature and Philosophy. That being said, both semesters of HP were really interesting, and students that are interested in the material should really continue with DS if they have the passion for it. The workload this semester is significantly increased from the workload of HP last semester (also because Nakhimovsky requires daily responses) so be warned. Otherwise this is a great class, and Nakhimovsky is a great section to be in!",
    "I would definitely recommend this course because of the amazing books we read. The class was set up to facilitate discussions in smaller groups, which I really appreciated because it gave everyone a chance to engage more deeply in certain topics.",
    "Yes, I would recommend DS to any freshman interested in studying the humanities.",
    "Yes! For any stufent interested in Directed Studies.",
    "Incredible course.I found all of the texts and discussion incredibly engaging. The first semester of history and politics was less interesting to me.",
    "I would recommend this class to another student - in both taking DS and being in Professor Nakhimovsky's section.",
    "Absolutely! This is a wonderful and challenging class, and the moments when the readings from all year come together is incredible. Also, this class allows you to see the implications of the works you're reading not only within the context of the Directed Studies program, but also in relation to the current political state of the world today.",
    "See previous responses to DS courses",
    "I would only recommend DS to a student who is fully committed to spending hours each day doing reading. The more time you put into the reading the more you will get out of it, so if you are unable to complete all reading to a certain level of detail, the class will not be as good as it could be."
