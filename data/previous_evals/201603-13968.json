    "An incisive and comprehensive survey of fascism and right wing radicalism. It offers clear directives on how to think, analyze, and predict a very relevant political phenomenon. I have taken away a wide array of analytical tools to understand and respond to right wing radical politics. A must for any politically inclined student."
