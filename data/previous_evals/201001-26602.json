    "This course is applicable to any stage within the program. It encourages a high level of exploration and this is much desired. The level of theoretical discussion however might be too high for some entry level students of architectural theory, and this should not take precedence over the actual explorative work that this class should be more about.",
    "This course was an elective, and as such could be taken whenever desired. Having this course alongside the building project studio made for an interesting juxtaposition because the scale at which we considered enclosure resonated with the small-scale studio projects from this semester."

    "too many readings and discussions up front without enough connection to the actual subject matter of the course. The readings were very good and interesting, but i felt that more time should have been spent on design and fabrication rather than the theoretical basis for them. still, it is good to attempt to try to meld theory with practice, but one wishes for the focus to be more on the practice side of things.",
    "I thought that the subject matter of the class was very interesting. Approaching the idea of performance in architecture through the vehicle of shading devices was a interesting and very experimental strategy. The syllabus was clear and the readings informative. I also like the loose format of the class discussion. It was refreshing to have an elective in which the instructor was very open to experimentation and encouraged the class to simple \"look\" at what is out there in terms of shading devices and strategies.",
    "The course was organized around ideas of enclosure, its symbolism, and various performance characteristics, all described experientially. The assignments were interesting, requiring us to engage in a bit of detective work in order to locate and catalog structures based on their suitability for a particular term than characterizes enclosure. However, it was not entirely clear whether our discoveries were intended to subvert or to reinforce the idea of such associative characterization.",
    "The course varried quite a bit from the original syllabus. A few scheduled classes were cancelled or turned into optional desk crits; the three small fabrication assignments were merged into one large fabrication assignment; certain readings were skipped and others were added...The class was obviously very malleable and that made it hard for me to take it that seriously. Having the final crit rescheduled to May 12 was also difficult - it was very late in the semester.",
    "Interesting topic - very specific."

   "comments": [
    "To be honest, I was a little unsure about what to expect from this class at first. It did seem oddly specific to study shading devices, but once the class got rolling with the subject, it was amazing to see the variety and amount of information out there to draw from for design ideas.",
    "If this course continues to be one larger fabrication project, it would be helpful if the second half of the semester broke the project down into smaller chunks. Picking a specific site would be helpful, as would studying the site using EcoTech. That way, we could create shading pavilions that really provide shade, and not ones that just look cool or create clever shadows."

    "this course enabled me to improve my facility at design, albeit a simple project. it helped me gain facility at the use of parametric software and fabrication skills, while keeping my mind open to the theoretical discourses that surround making and praxis.",
    "This class was extremely valuable in helping me to broadening both my architectural vocabulary and knowledge pool with regard to contemporary architectural projects. It was also refreshing to have a instructor so open to experimentation and exploration.",
    "I enjoyed this course tremendously, largely because of the readings that Hilary selected for the course. It was wonderful to be exposed to the discourse around enclosure from such a wide variety of perspectives. The issues that fellow students brought to the table challenged the common interpretation of the readings, and made the discussions lively and interesting. Often, by questioning the underlying assumptions of the authors, we collectively got closer to understanding certain key issues surrounding contemporary practice."

    "brandt knapp was exceptional in contributing to discussions, being available for informal discussions and critiques of work, while coordinating the class well. she is extremely affable and willing to help her fellow students as TA of the course.hilary sample was a great personality to have and at times one would wish she would have more to say about the assigned readings; sometimes her comments were more than cursory and did not commensurate with the amount of time and effort put into reading and preparing synopses for these readings. as said before, readings take up a considerable and probably impractical fraction of the curriculum in this class.",
    "Hilary Sample was extremely helpful and encouraging as a instructor. She was very successful at creating a classroom environment in which student explore, debate, and question the idea of shade.Brandt Knapp was also great as a TA. Always willing to meet with students and discuss project both in and out of class.",
    "It was a great experience to study with Hilary. Her class centered on the discussions of the assigned readings, which Hilary facilitated but did not overwhelm with her voice.Brandt, our TA, was a pleasure to have as our assistant instructor. She helped keep us on-track and did a wonderful job of supplying us with readings. Even while working on her portfolio at the end of the term, she took time to meet with us to talk about our individual projects.",
    "Both Hilary and Brandt provided interesting commentary."

    "less readings, more making.",
    "The class was overly ambitious with assigning three project, but I do think that reducing this to one project was a little too drastic. Two would have been better. This would have allowed more exploration into different kinds of shade devices and would have alleviated some of the pressure that came with the final review.Also there were issues with scheduling class, esp. during the last few weeks. Still, I feel that Hilary and Brandt made the best of a difficult situation.",
    "The course would benefit from a heavier hand of the instructor. Hilary did a great job of running the class during the meetings, but some of the original intentions of the course were allowed to slip in the general excitement surrounding the mid-terms. Perhaps if the requirements were reiterated more often during class time, it would help everyone stay on the same page.",
    "At the beginning of the semester, it was hard to split up the readings and the shading topic presentations so that everyone was presenting the same amount. Some students presented two readings, other students presented two shading topics. I don't think those activities are equal. In my opinion, everyone should have presented one reading and one shading topic.",
    "I enjoyed this course overall. I found the subject matter and the combination of theory and fabrication productive. I feel the class could have benefited if there were more smaller fabrication projects throughout the course, so that the class would not be so divided between the readings and the final project.",
    "The course to some degree lacked organization. Although the course was interesting in its exploration of the topic of shading, if taught again perhaps a more rigorous organization would be good.Similarly, the final design assignment would have benefited from more specific design guidelines to evaluate the project on.",
    "A more rigid organization and clearly defined topics\/goals would greatly improve this course. While the weekly readings were interesting and provoked discussion, it was often unclear how they were supposed to relate to broader themes. This course was very enjoyable and I truly appreciate that it wasn't overzealous in it's scope and workload (like so many classes here)."
