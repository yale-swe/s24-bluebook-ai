   "comments": [
    "It's a great class!! Take it! One of the best (if not the best) languages to learn here at Yale. I would highly recommend it. All the teachers care about your learning and progress and you can go on the Light Fellowship after! :)",
    "It's a ton of work (2.5 hours\/night) but if you really want to learn Japanese you'll be in great hands. The teachers are all so dynamic and hilarious. And you will get close with your class because you meet every morning for the whole year. Take it if you're ready to work hard. There are a lot of assignments.",
    "I would highly recommend this class to anyone who's interested in learningan Asian language. Japanese is very interesting, and I think it helps one develop a new perspective by viewing the world through a different lens.",
    "Japanese at Yale is simply the best. Obviously you'll be taking this if you want to see your credits from fall semester, but that won't make it less fun. There's a lot of nightly homework associated with the class, but it's definitely worth it in the end. I'm not sure there's a single person in our class who was dissatisfied with the course. If you're looking for more practice, go to language table; it was one of the highlights of my week!",
    "The teachers for this course are very friendly and approachable. It is a lot of work, but so is studying any language. By the end of the term, you will have learned much more then you would have thought possible before.",
    "This is a very very hard class in terms of workload, but it is also very rewarding when you see yourself improving, and the Senseis are some of the best professors yale has to offer, hands down. Its a great class, take it but be prepared to put in work.",
    "If you took 110, you might as well stay in 120. Japanese is fun (the one class I looked forward to going to everyday) but it is everyday (with everyday homework) so be prepared to put in the work.",
    "Introductory Japanese II is a continuation of an intensive East Asian language track. Compared to studying Japanese in other universities, Japanese learners at Yale know greater amount of grammar and vocabulary. The coursework, of course, is quite demanding. Looking back, the amount of Japanese that I've learned is incredible. It was not easy, but it was worth it every minute that I've studied for this course.",
    "I strongly recommend this class to other students.",
    "Amazing language course! It's very well-organized and you learn a lot of material. The instructors are the BEST - so kind, funny, and helpful. Great class to wake up to each morning.",
    "Japanese 120 is the best! The professors are absolutely amazing and personable, and this course was mine (and many of my classmates') favorite course all year. Japanese at Yale is just phenomenal and I would (and do) recommend this class to everyone. You learn so much in such a short span of time. Keep up with the daily work and you will be fine in the class. You meet some of the coolest people ever, and are given so many amazing opportunities because of Japanese.",
    "I would definitely recommend the class to my friends. It was a wonderful wonderful experience! It has a certain rhythm of learning because it is an everyday class. But the class and homework is always dynamic and interesting.",
    "It is a good sequence to Japanese 110 and has basically the same structure. The workload is still very heavy and the daily homework assignments require a lot of time. The tests are not too difficult, and there is a visible improvement in our language skills. I recommend it to anyone who wants to take Japanese seriously."
