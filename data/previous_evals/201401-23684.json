    "This was a great class, I strongly recommend it. The material is really interesting, and is a different approach to biology than many other classes take. It will help you see things like transcription and signal responses from a whole new perspective. The math level is not very difficult, and the workload is very manageable. Both professors are fantastic, really interesting and engaging. The evaluations were through problem sets, which were not too difficult or stressful. I really enjoyed this class, and learned a lot.",
    "MCDB 261 is an introductory course to Systems Biology. We looked at cases of transcription and translation, gene regulation, promoter activity and cooperativity in the context of systems modeling. Though not intensive or extremely informative on the usage of MATLAB, we did use the program to create cool models and to understand behaviors and analysis in a computational and graphical manner which was great!! Not super intense overall and the professors and TFs want you to understand, learn and enjoy the material so they will be there to help or explain! Good intro course!",
    "Don't be scared by the math or the Matlab. This class offers a great way to see biological processes from a different angle, and it goes amazingly well with MB&B301. I would definitely recommend shopping the class if you feel like you have any interest at all, as I feel like it's really worth taking if you're majoring in any kind of biology. This was a really small class, and it deserves more students.",
    "This is a tough course, tons of work, but it will help you learn to use Matlab and get your familiar with a rising field in biology."
