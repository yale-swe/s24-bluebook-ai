    "Yes. Even if it seems like you won't get that much out of it at first, if you put in the time to read and participate, you'll get so much.",
    "Yes, talk the class if you are looking for something interesting to throw into your schedule. It will really make you think about different ways people make\/do theater-- and will want you to try some yourself!",
    "Politics of Performance looks at theories of politically engaged performance from the early twentieth century through today. Dominika brought in a slew of guest speakers -- specialists in Boal, the Visible Collective, Grotowski and the Occupy movement -- who enriched our discussions incredibly. Would definitely recommend to people. However, be prepared to digress a lot: this is where a lot our best discussions came from, but I can imagine people becoming frustrated with it.",
    "This class provided the opportunity for in-depth discussion of the intersection between theatre and politics and the many ways in which the two are interrelated. I would highly recommend this course for another student who is interested in theatre, political thought, or both. This class challenged preconceived notions I had about both theatre and politics, made me think more deeply about both disciplines, and has piqued my curiosity for future research and exploration. Take this class!"
