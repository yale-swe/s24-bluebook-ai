    "This course was great. It was a light course load for a writing course, 2 5-page papers and a 10-page paper for the final. The readings were really enticing and the discussions was always interesting. I would totally recommend this course.",
    "Yes! The topics are very interesting, but I think this class may disturb\/emotionally scar\/be a source of conflict for people with certain strong beliefs. Therefore, I would recommend it to those who would describe themselves as not judgemental.",
    "It covers different ideas about bodies in law, literature, film, and pop culture. It is not a class for the faint of heart. The reading is pretty average for a Yale class and the papers were fine. Dean L is great.",
    "I would highly recommend the course as an exciting way to read literature and law. It provides an interesting and integrated look at a concept through a wide array of materials."
