    "Instructor: Meredith Pearl Martin \u00a0Meredith was such an asset to our class. She was very accessible and made herself available to us constantly for feedback on our work, explanations of concepts, explanations of final project expectations, etc. She was also a good lecturer the weeks that Mark was out of town.",

    "In response to the pace of class question, I feel that we might have pushed harder on our actual management plans towards the beginning of the semester. Had we started the sampling portion earlier, for example, the end of the project would likely have felt less rushed.",
    "Mark is a committed educator and that was evident in the time he gave to this class. The workload was more than what would be two 3-credit courses, but I think that's just the nature of the project of developing a management plan.",
    "I did not find the field trip to deed surveys helpful. Could have been done quicker, in class, or in New Haven and reduced travel time to the site.",
    "This course was so much work but also so much learning. I wanted to curse the workload day in and day out but frankly I haven't learned more in one semester from any other course.",
    "Question 13: Dr. Ashton clearly cares about his students and made it clear throughout the course that his ultimate goal is for this students to learn all aspects of writing a management plan so that we can work independently in the future.",

This course was the most valuable one I've taken at FES, thanks to the high expectations for the quality of the final product and to the incomparable support offered along the way - from readings to lectures to field trips to team meetings with Mark and Meredith.",
    "The landowners! Ours were so sweet. But also being able to be in the forest so much and finally being able to create a product that is actually needed and relevant.",

    "I really didn't get anything out of the last third of the class where we would meet and get updates from each group. That seemed like a waste of time. I think that time could have been better spent by reviewing other peoples actual plans (to improve their plan, and get ideas for our own plan). It was nice to have the class time to ask Mark and Meredith questions, but aside from that, it didn't seem necessary.",
    "This course takes up a huge amount of time. There are many field trips and field work. But toward the end of the class some of the seminar time was not organized. If we had known ahead of class that there was just going to be used for questions and there was no lecture. We could have used the time to work on our projects.",
    "As I spoke of in a previous response, the timing felt slightly off when comparing the workload at the beginning and end of the semester.",
    "Is it necessary to have an in-person mid-term exam and a mid-term take-home? It seems to add additional unnecessary work to what is already an extremely work-heavy course. The practice of both was helpful in the end, but maybe there are ways to pair these down?",
    "Pace of lectures could be faster. More efficient group update\/discussion time. Towards the end of the semester there was a lot of noodling around.",
    "I though all aspects were good. Only input is about the deed workshop above.",
    "Very extensive readings were posted most weeks, and it was sometimes difficult to gauge exactly how much of it we were expected to do - all of it, just whatever was useful to our team at that point, etc.",
    "Time management? There was just too little time to do everything. Also, it is really not good that having a car in the team is the unofficial requirement of the course.",
    "This course is notoriously heavy in terms of workload, but it is a necessary evil. Perhaps finding a way to help students start data-collection earlier in the semester would be helpful especially given the late start to the school year this fall.",

The work load was sort of inconsistent throughout the semester, and was almost too much to handle at the end. I almost wonder if this class should span two semesters (one class each semester) rather than having two classes during one semester.",

    "This was the best client-based course I've taken and I anticipate will be very applicable to future work.",
    "My career plans are in private land conservation and landowner outreach, so this course was the perfect opportunity to build skills in landowner communication, deed surveying, parcel-level mapping, and fieldwork-based assessment and management planning for private land. My background is in environmental social science, so I was nervous that I would not be prepared for the physical science - based parts of the course - geology, hydrology, soils, species identification - but Mark and Meredith were incomparably supportive and helpful and ultimately I got out of this course exactly what I had hoped.",

    "Group work was great. Fantastic how each of us came to together to do big lifts at different points in the project.",
    "Learned from partners and made the class very enjoyable. No disadvantages.",
    "The advantage was the opportunity to divide our heavy workload, often based on our group members' relative talents - GIS, timber inventory, graphic design, etc. The disadvantage was that it was often difficult to gauge whether the workload had been divided fairly - if our group had the opportunity to do it all over again, we might benefit from roughly dividing responsibilities at the very beginning of the course and then adapting as needed instead of deciding as we went along.",
    "Some members of our group were not as committed as others which significantly shifted the workload and for these people there were essentially no repercussions. That is sad. But then again, great experience working with others.",
    "We balanced each other's skills and personalities. Overall, we were able to learn from each other.",
    "Huge project. Difficult to coordinate extensive field work at times, but you work around it.",
    "Sometimes hard to divide up work well, but ultimately allowed us to pass the torch when each of us got very busy. Hard to produce such a big document in a team, but valuable to learn how to do so because that is how it's done in the real world."
