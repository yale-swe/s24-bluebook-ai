    "Crabtree is one of the worst lecturers I've ever had, but he's kinda famous, so that's cool I guess. Perhaps that was slightly ungenerous, but let's be real: 9:00am is really early to walk up the hill. There's very little work for an upper-level chem class... no problem sets, just two in-class midterms and a three-hour final. All three exams are weighted equally, and your lowest score is dropped, so if you do well on the midterms you don't have to take the final.",
    "Do NOT take this course. You will fall asleep every class. The lectures are boring. There are two midterms and a final. The three exams are of equal weight. The lowest grade is dropped. The exams are the only part of your grade. I didn't learn anything in class.",
    "I thought the material was interesting. The first midterm is somewhat of a more advanced version of Inorganic Chemistry but after that it is a lot of new material. Definitely read the textbook and don't fall behind on the material!",
    "This course is very difficult. I took it because the subject matter interested me, and I really enjoyed Inorganic, but this class was not what I wanted at all. Crabtree is a terrible lecturer, and he moves through the material at an extremely fast pace. He is obviously some sort of chemistry genius who just understands OM chemistry on a different level than all of us, which made it impossible to understand him in lecture or on tests. Also, his book is very confusing to read. Overall, you'll get no guidance in this course (Crabtree does not make it clear what we are expected to know for the tests), have no resources to get help (no office hours, TAs, etc), and have no idea where you stand in this course. Undergrads are graded separately from grad students, which is actually a disadvantage for undergrads, since only 4 were in my class, so we'll see how grades go. I learned a TON in this class (all on my own) and still enjoy OM chemistry (surprisingly, after taking this class). Don't take this class if Crabtree is teaching."
