   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend this class to anyone interested in film studies: i took it instead of intro film, and though there was a bit of a learning curve I think it was more in depth and interdisciplinary -- good for someone interested in history and broader themes rather than just straight film analysis",
    "Great class!! Really interesting subject!",
    "Great class. I enjoyed how there was a balance between formal, social\/historical, and industrial approaches to classical Hollywood. This was my first film studies course and I was glad that I had the option to approach the topic in a way that was more comfortable to me (I'm an econ major, so I usually wrote about how industrial pressures and structures influenced movies). At the same time I was forced to learn to approach it in a way that was new to me. I had never thought about really analyzing the formal aspects of movies before, but had to learn what to watch for and the vocabulary to talk about it. The work was not hard necessarily, but the class was a big time commitment. In addition to lectures and a weekly section, you have to go to a weekly movie screening, and there are quite a few readings, some pretty dense. That being said, if you put the time and effort in this class is extremely rewarding and I highly recommend it.",
    "Take it. JD is the best professor I've had at Yale. He takes you through an analytical history of Hollywood in its classical era while relating various trends in American culture. Is as much a history class as a film class."
