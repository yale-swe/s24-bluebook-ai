    "The daily workbook assignments and daily classes helped me to learn French much faster than a class with a lighter schedule. I would have liked to have been able to keep my weekly quizzes so that I could learn from the mistakes I made on those more closely.",
    "The course is well planned out but I wish there were more avenues for speaking French outside the classroom.",

    "Yes, it was very interactive and was great for studying French. It made everything very practical and had a good balance of literature and culture."
