    "I was expecting to learn how to design landscape in a way that was both innovative and readable by an outside critic. Unfortunately, the semester seemed to focus less on the idea of landscape and more of the representation of the diagram of the idea of architecture. Although this course may have opened my eyes to the importance of emphasis that landscape can make on a design, I do not feel that I learned more about landscape architecture than what I already knew.",
    "I hoped this studio would be an insightful look into the development of India, female status in India and the relationship between landscape and architecture. It was none of those.",
    "I expected this studio to put emphasis on issues of identity and globalism (in the context of landscape). How could our projects act vernacularly? Should we embrace tenants of 1950s modernism? When Joel and Diana were presenting their project at the very beginning of the semester, I wish they had explained it in terms of, \u0093This is what the project is NOT\u0085\u0094 instead of \u0093This is what the project is\u0085\u0094 While some of those issues were discussed at the onset, most of my classmate\u0092s final projects looked and performed like they could be anywhere in the world, not just in India. Kenneth Frampton pointed that out in the final review but in our wrap-up Joel and Diana seemed to dismiss his opinions as being old fashioned and irrelevant. Joel expressed that the projects Frampton disliked were actually the good projects because they bred dissension. So by proxy, if Frampton did like our project, it actually wasn\u0092t very good? Interestingly, the projects Frampton didn\u0092t like (the \u0093good\u0094 projects, according to Joel) belonged to all Joel\u0092s favorite students.That being said, the TAs for this course (Chris and Mark) were invaluable.I feel like my project progressed more and more every time I spoke with the two of them. They were able to give me very grounded advice and could relate to my struggles. They made themselves available day and night and I felt they were actually invested in our work.",
    "My expectations for the studio were to learn about the ability of landscape and architecture to co-exist as one in an architectural context. I was particularly interested for this challenge taking place in India, as this allowed for a very unique opportunity from an environmental and climactic standpoint. I am pleased to say that my expectations were met in this studio.",
    "My expectations for the studio were exactly what was promised to us on studio lottery day: that we would approach the theme of \u0091Interface\u0092 hoping to find new, provocative ways of thinking about landscape and architecture. I expected that we would work rigorously without preconceived ideas about what \u0091interface\u0092 would be \u0096 that this studio would be a playing field for testing new ideas. I even have written in my sketchbook from Joel\u0092s presentation on that day, \u0093there is no right answer \u0096 it\u0092s about an exploration.\u0094Instead, we enrolled in the most narrow-minded, aggravating, and indoctrinating studio I have ever seen, led by Joel, the most manipulative critic at Yale. It was very clear as the studio progressed that he had one and only one idea of what \u0093interface\u0094 would be, and if you couldn\u0092t communicate your concept in a one-liner diagram that had what Joel called \u0093moments of uncertainly\u0094 (meaning it wasn\u0092t clear what was landscape and what was architecture), then he would criticize and derail your projects until they inevitably became the same, boring, outdated project as all the others in the studio.In this studio environment, we watched many fresh, unique ideas from the early weeks of the semester get slowly transformed into lifeless projects. The intense energy of the studio in the first few weeks, where all the students were excited to try new ideas, was lost by mid-review, and by the final review the general attitude of the studio was somewhere between apathy and depression. It\u0092s such a shame to think of how many valid, unique concepts and agendas were sacrificed just because Joel didn\u0092t like them, did not understand them, or (more likely) made absolutely no effort to try to understand them.Joel manipulated every single project in the studio into something straight out of the 1990\u0092s obsession with landscape urbanism, or burying buildings into the ground, or treating the building as a landscape. Many of us considered this style of design to be very out-dated (it has become the new \u0091default\u0092 solution for such projects), but it was virtually the only path Joel accepted us to follow. Despite constantly claiming to be open-minded and accepting of new ideas, Joel\u0092s reactions to projects in desk crits and reviews made it more than clear that he was the most narrow-minded professor of architecture I have ever encountered.I feel like I do not have a project that I can claim ownership of. I am not proud of the work I did in this studio.This studio was a complete and total disappointment. I sincerely regret wasting one of my only advanced studios on this class."

    "Although there are many resources available in the school, the persons necessary for teaching the equipment are not sufficient. The DM office is not accommodating to students, in fact many of the fines that come with utilizing the DM office discourage students from getting to know the surplus of resources available. In addition, the milling equipment was extremely back logged this semester. The large mill was broken from before midreview and the robot is miss taught to students so it is constantly miss used. The small mills are insufficient, and the mysterious medium mill never arrived. I would suggest removing the inadequate equipment and encouraging students to learn the more complex systems. We are the smartest students in the country, we should be able to learn the proper use for the tools rather than have the process dumbbed down to the point where we don\u0092t know how to trouble shoot. As for the software, I felt that my computer in the studio was slow. Maybe because there are too many programs that I do not use installed. Please stop clogging the computer memory.",

   "question_text": "Comment on the most and least valuable aspects of the studio",
   "comments": [
    "This semester there were too many pin ups that had the same drawing requirements. It was difficult to express an idea to Joel and Diana in any drawing that was not complete, which is impossible to do every class. This meant that Joel and Diana often felt that we did not complete their requirements and asked us to redo that assignments for the next meeting. It would have been more helpful to see the teaching assistant more consistently and Joel and Diana less. In addition to that, there were too many professors. If we had one teaching assistant who came weekly and was able to read incomplete drawings and give more specific design advice, then having Joel and Diana come would be easier. The whole set up made it difficult to move forward because there was a lot of repetitive conversations.",
    "Joel and Diana, if allowed to teach another advanced studio, should take some time for self-reflection to ensure that the studio is more than an indulgence into their own goals and desires. They need to find a way to respect differences in design ambition and ability if they desire to be EDUCATORS. Perhaps they should find a definition of the word educator as a starting point.",
    "One of the most valuable aspects of the studio was the trip to Bob Stern\u0092s office to hear about residential college typologies and Indian vernacular architecture. Additionally, our trip to India would have been significantly less valuable had we not had assistance from Kanu Agrawal at Bob Stern\u0092s office. He encouraged us to travel to Ahmedabad and was able to gain us access to many modernist projects that are not open to the general public. He was so friendly and knowledgeable and the fact that he spoke the language and was able to communicate on our behalf was invaluable.Personally, I think we needed more Indian architects looking at our project throughout the semester. India is so different from anywhere else that we needed help and advice from people who know the climate and the people.",
    "While I always enjoy a mixture of pinups an desk crits, I think this studio emphasized pinups a little too heavily. This was particularly true in the first half of the semester, when I felt pressured by pin-up deadlines to show \"finished\" looking word (when, of course, all my work was completely un-finished). Therefore, I spent a lot of time producing finished graphic work (renderings, illustrated drawings, etc), when I feel that it would have been much more productive to keep developing the design abstractly. As the semester went on, I learned that a pin-up did not necessarily require these \"finished\" looking drawings, and I wish the exact intention of pin-ups had been emphasized earlier on.Overall, I feel that I work more productively and effectively with desk-crit style feedback, and I wish the pin-ups had not occurred so frequently.",
    "It would have been more helpful to have clearer communications of expectations for any given studio session-- it was often unclear who was going to show up and what they would be expecting."
