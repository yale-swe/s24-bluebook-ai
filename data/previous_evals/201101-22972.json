    "I would absolutely recommend this course to fellow students because both photography and memory studies facilitate an understanding of whatever one may be studying.",
    "Yes, I would highly recommend the course.",
    "I would definitely recommend the class to fellow students. It is great to be in an interdisciplinary setting with students from different facets of the university particularly when learning about photography and memory is a subject of study of students in several disciplines.",
    "I would recommend this course for a student who can take it as a non-categorized experience. It is not a philosophy class in its content, nor is it an art class, but it attempts to look at both with a side-ways glance to better understand what might be forward."

   "comments": [
    "As an art history graduate student, learning about the cultural implications of photography was very helpful in further broadening my understanding of art history as a discipline as a whole.",
    "It opened up an exciting field of inquiry that I'm excited to pursue in subsequent work.",
    "The course was crucial for my dissertation and research and a great start to an orals list!Thank you Professor Wexler!",
    "Fortunately, Laura doesn't seem to agree with a \"banking\" model of education. As such, this course contributed greatly to my humanity, arguably an important element of any research."
