    "I learned how t speak French with greater confidence due to the repetitive,daily nature of the course.",
    "I didn't have to take this class since I have already completed my language requirement but I still took it because I wanted to improve my French and I believe this course helped me do so since now we can read actual written French literature.",
    "I learned more advanced grammar topics in french. I also learned more about what study methods works best for me in languages.",
    "This course was the best that I've taken at Yale. Now I feel so much more comfortable expressing myself in French and have a deeper understanding of French history during WWII as well.",
    "I gained a better working knowledge of French, but I also learned a lot about culture in Francophone countries. Additionally, I got a much better understanding of life in France during World War II."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strength: Passionate professors and the experience they bring to teaching from years of practice. Weakness:Some of the mandatory audio programs felt like a waste of time. They did not help consolidate my grammar. In my opinion, their only benefit was hearing the language.",
    "I think there are certain things that can be improved with the French language classes at Yale. First of all, it definitely expects more of its students than any other language program. We already read more books and actual literature than others. And with that extra workload we have, we still have worksheets every night. It would definitely improve our efficiency to learn if say the audio programs were reduced. The tapes we have to listen to are each 30 min long and some nights there are multiple of those. Most of the time we have to wait for the tape to get to a certain part and we cannot go at our own pace. I do not think these tapes improve our skills given the amount we have to spend on them.",
    "I think the audio recordings and workbook were very helpful, but also could be tedious and unnecessarily long. This course has a lot of busy work that isn't intellectually challenging at all, but takes a while.",
    "I thought that Professor Burton managed this class beautifully. One improvement could be to vary seating arrangements so that students can engage with more than just the people right next to them - to make friends and to vary the conversations.",
    "The course is built around really interesting material, and every unit brought interesting readings and films. I wish that there was more opportunity to practice speaking - while there already are some exercises for practice, I feel that we don't get to practice unscripted speech enough. I also would like if the films were uploaded with both English and French subtitle options. The English really helped my understanding, but personally, I would've liked the practice of hearing and reading French simultaneously to cement my understanding of the language and the movie. I think offering the choice to students would be really beneficial."

   "comments": [
    "French 140 can be quite a bit of work, but very worth it. Your French really improves. The class gives you a lot of opportunity to practice your verbal and written communication.",
    "Yes. If you started French in High school, finishing it off in college is a good idea...just take advantage of the language summer programs.",
    "Take it if you want the time you spend on learning French all these years to pay off.",
    "I enjoyed this course because it's a level of french where we can start reading longer stories and moving beyond just grammar and vocab, so I would recommend this course to someone who has made it this far in the language.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. It challenges you sufficiently but doesn't overload you with work. Professor Burton was so great at teaching that by the time the test came around, you already had most of the concepts very well down and in mind, so studying did not take up a lot of your time. I loved the different exercises we would have to do - writing, speaking and reading\/analyzing texts.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to anyone who wants to improve their French and work towards a higher level of fluency. The material is engaging and useful, and the course does provide a lot of feedback so that students can continue to improve. That being said, it's also a time-intensive course with a lot of day-to-day work.",
    "Having taken 110, 120, 130, and 140, I can say with confidence that my French abilities grew most in L4 relative to the other semesters in which I've taken French. You really start to feel comfortable with the language from this course."
