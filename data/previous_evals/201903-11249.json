    "I think I got a bit better at integrals, and I was exposed to new material even if I don't feel like I grasped all of it.",
    "I believe I learned all of Calculus II. Though I took Calculus BC in my senior year of high school as well, I had felt in that class that we hadn't really covered the entirety of the material, but I definitely feel that we covered all of the material in this class, Math 115. I think that this was a good class for me to start my college learning with, as it was in a subject that I was relatively comfortable with already, and as a result the quick pace of the class was not wholly jarring after my high school experience. On the whole, I believe this class succeeded in teaching me a lot of math and a lot about my own learning at the same time.",

   "comments": [
    "Strengths - psets are fairly straightforward, Nati is nice and clearly cares about his students Weaknesses - exams fluctuated wildly in difficulty.",
    "I thought the course was very monotonous; we never really did anything other than do examples on the board and do \"think-pair-shares.\" But that makes sense for a math class I guess.",
    "Strengths: we worked a lot with one another and it was very interact. I really liked when we would combine with other sections too. Weaknesses: sometimes we went through material fast, and even though I took down notes for everything, I couldnt really study from my notes. I had to rely on review notes and practice exams to teach myself the content.",
    "More learning in the class instead of through explorations",
    "The help from the teachers is quite good. However, there is a lot of content that is covered.",
    "This class made me very frustrated with math content that I had learned in high school. I took this as a review from AP Calc BC and found myself not understanding the material taught in the class, most of which was covered in my high school class. Not all sections moved at the same pace, yet we were all expected to know the same amount for all the tests. In addition, the tests were graded very harshly, even though we were told we would get partial credit for showing our work. Coming out of this class, I feel less confident in my math skills than I did entering the class.",
    "I think that more time should be used to learn rotations and shells\/washer method. This felt very tacked on at the end of the course.",
    "I think the instruction for this course would benefit from more practice questions and example problems, and less discussion about theory. I felt like I semi-understood some theory after lessons, but would have zero clue at all how to approach homework questions, and I would have to teach myself everything.",
    "This course teaches a lot, but it definitely feels as though it's being taught for breadth as opposed to for depth. We sped the material very quickly, and I am not sure that I will retain a lot of what I learned, simply because there didn't seem to be enough exposure to each topic we covered before we moved on to the next one. I recognize that that is probably the case for most introductory courses, however, and that's there's not much that could be done about it.",
    "Questions\/examples in class could be more rigorous\/difficult. Think pair shares are sometimes difficult to engage with.",
    "This course worked well for me because it was mostly review, but for students who were learning it for the first time, Im not sure if it was very effective.",
    "The class format feels very rushed, if you don't grasp a concept right away you feel left behind as the class moves quickly along.",
    "The strength of this course is that it covers all of integral calculus. The weakness of this course is that it is very fast-paced."

   "comments": [
    "Yes, if you think you are going to use calculus elsewhere at Yale. Taking it with Nati was good -- he's really nice. You're basically just learning math, so if you're into that then go for it.",
    "If you want to do anything with math, you have to take this course. If you took Calc BC in high school, it was a repeat of that.",
    "If you have to take it, then yes. Also Nati is a good Professor, so definitely take it if you have him. He tried his best to make class fun, which was a good change from my other classes.",
    "Yes if you need a math requirement",
    "Yes, the class was helpful in building upon previous knowledge while also expanding my understanding.",
    "I would only recommend this class to people who absolutely need it for their major requirement.",
    "I think that after taking a year or two of calculus, this is a great course to strengthen the skills learned in previous classes. I also think that if a student wants to do something data or math-related for their major thy should definitely take this course.",
    "I would not. I don't think I benefited much from the class, aside from a QR credit. My instructor was really nice and kind, but the class itself was poorly designed and I learned little.",
    "If you're comfortable with math but not particularly excited about or interested in it, and are hoping to start Yale with a solid class that will teach you a lot, then I'd recommend this class.",
    "Yes it is a good introductory\/first year maths course.",
    "Unless you have to take it for a prerequisite, then no. The class format and material is not very engaging and most students seem not to enjoy it.",
    "I would not recommend this course to another student because it moves so fast through the course material and it's difficult to feel comfortable with the material during midterms or the final."
