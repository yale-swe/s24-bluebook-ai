   "comments": [
    "I have never taken a class on African History before. Thus, on a fundamental level this class taught be a lot about a part of the world I knew very little about. More importantly, however, Professor Magaziner introduced me to an approach of investigating history with a more critical approach and learning to appreciate the more nuanced version of historical investigation that might make us a little uncomfortable because they force us to question our own bias, but ultimately teach us that history is complex.",
    "a broad overview of modern african history and literature some patterns within colonial history looking into novels as historical evidence the role of narratives in learning about history how history can be politicized and how people tell themselves narratives for understanding the world and for political purposes",
    "WOW I learned so many things I've never even heard of\/encountered before. I feel like an entire continent was put into context that I was sorely missing.",
    "I learned how to write a ten page paper, and also learned a lot African encounters with colonialism (which i previously knew nothing about).",
    "After taking this course, I think about gender in a completely different way. This class taught me a lot about African history and made me want to learn so much more.",
    "I learned think broadly about colonialism, nationalism, sovereignty, and the discourse around \"Africa.\"",
    "Knowledge: Broad generalization of African history Skill: Writing a history paper Insight: Impact of colonialism",
    "Better understanding of a crucial period of history that I knew next to nothing about. There's so much more to learn.",
    "I learned how to think critically and discuss difficult issues and histories. This course also improved my analysis skills, as we worked with lecture materials, talks, novels, and academic article. I feel more comfortable weaving diverse sources together in order to develop a cohesive argument. I grew a lot in this course.",
    "I have walked away from this class with a better sense of historical analysis.",
    "I believe that I learned to think about and understand history in a totally different way by taking this course. As a non-history\/humanities major, I came into this course thinking that history was a lot more about facts and figures than it really is. It's really about ideas, trends and thematic developments as a function of time. The use of novels instead of primary sources really supplemented this understanding, and I felt like I left this course with a reinvented conception of not just African colonial history, but also global history and the ways in which class and racial divides shape and color the everyday experiences of individuals through this day. The very language that Professor Magaziner used in his lectures influenced my writings for this course, and I think that the framework that he uses to understand African history really rubbed off on me, probably forever. I am grateful that I took this course.",
    "I learned a lot in this course -- I gained a new vocabulary through which to discuss certain international issues involving Africa and more importantly I gained new perspective and a lens through which to view the way we talk and think about Africa. I also learned the value and the power of the novel as a form of historical thinking. I loved putting the readings in conversation with the historical material we'd learn in the course and the secondary sources we read because it was incredible to put all of the different perspectives in conversation with each other to produce a meaningful takeaway. A lot of myths we learned about Africa growing up were busted in the process of taking this course as well.",
    "Essay writing has definitely improved and my ability to use books as primary sources for historical analysis.",
    "I learned important, broad themes about the interactions between colonial forces and African societies.",
    "I learned about various experiences of colonialism in Africa, and how to read novels as historical evidence.",
    "A great overview of broad imperial and colonial history of Africa focusing on the 19th and 20th centuries. I learned a tremendous amount about a wide range of countries, and though a broad based course was able to take away larger themes.",
    "I learned how to incorporate works of fiction into historical analysis.",
    "Learnt to think about Africa in a more nuanced way Learnt to use literature to make historical arguments",
    "This is the first course I've taken about Africa, and although I knew the history of colonialism in very broad strokes, I have a much deeper understanding of both empire and postcolonial politics. The major skill I've developed was using fiction as a primary source and integrating it with secondary history research through our papers.",
    "a great survey course on Africa.",
    "It was so refreshing to take my first college-level course on African history. Each lecture was worthwhile because I took away something new each time, and it was interesting to use literature as a way of discussing history in the two papers I wrote. My writing skills improved tremendously as a result of the draft and revision process that the course allowed.",
    "I learned how to more deeply analyze fiction texts and connect them to broader social and historical themes.",
    "I learned overarching themes about life in Africa before, during, and after colonialism; how Europeans were able to establish their control in Africa; changes in social aspects of life including religion and gender; and how the independence movements in colonial Africa came about\/how they worked and did not work. I gained exposure to many great novels by African authors I otherwise would not get exposure to as well.",
    "I learned learned so much about social change in Africa during the 19th and 20th centuries, colonization, decolonization, Christianities, and post-colonial African politics. I also learned how to read novels for their historical content.",
    "A robust critical approach to the history of African people's engagements with colonialism from the 18th century to the present. Appreciation of the major events and historical processes.",
    "If you want to learn about European colonialism, this is a great class. Prof. Magaziner has very interesting lectures and is great at teaching the course material.",
    "I think I really learned how to think critically about novels as historical texts. I also think there's a lot to be said for unpacking the idea of \"how to talk about Africa\" -- there isn't any one way.",
    "I came into this course knowing very little about African history. Now I feel like I have a whole new world of topics that I want to learn more about, and a general understanding of the complex dynamics of colonialism in African countries. Professor Magaziner teaches many ways to analyze colonialism and colonial mindsets that I will continue to think about.",
    "I gained a greater understanding of the nature of colonialism and its afterlives in Africa. I was able to gain a greater understanding of how colonialism continues to have a great affect on countries in Africa and their futures. The use of novels within the historical nature of the course was unique, but allowed me to gain a better understanding of how colonialism functioned in different spaces and affected the ways that people lived their lives.",
    "I learned a lot about a continent, that even though I had lived there for a period of time, I knew little about.",
    "This course completely changed my perspective on the African continent and why things are the way they are today.",
    "I learned how to approach the subject of African history with complexity, nuance, and depth. I learned how to compare narratives across time and space, while simultaneously acknowledging that every society and history is unique.Through reading novels and writing historical essays, I learned how to connect moments in time to broader historical trends and contexts.",
    "I learned so much more about the European Conquest of Africa in one semester of this class than I had ever even heard before in my life, and I live in Africa. This class was far more than a survey course and really delved into the reasoning behind why certain rules were made and what the consequences were. It was well-handled and taught not only a sensitivity, an understanding of Africa post-colonialism, but also emphasized an open mind and threw out many preconceptions. Each lecture was formatted as a thesis, presented clearly and with a unique twist so that I wished they were longer!",
    "I learnt how to think critically. This course really engaged my MIND and your THINKIGN skills because you had to make a historical argument from fiction, which I had never done before.",
    "I learned an enormous amount about the history of and philosophy behind African colonialism and neocolonialism. I became better at interpreting the enormous consequences of colonialism in present-day art, culture, and politics.",
    "A greater understanding of the historical contexts of issues in the African continent today, and how colonial influences continue to dictate terms.",
    "African Encounters provides broad insights into the history of colonization of Africa and the oft-misrepresented history of the continent. It requires students to think critically about history, which is valuable.",
    "Before taking this course, I had almost no knowledge of \"African Encounters With Colonialisms.\" In high school, I had only really learned about Africa in the context of the Transatlantic Slave Trade, and I had briefly learned about the Berlin Conference in European History. However, I had no formal education about 19th century European colonialism in Africa and how that has had such a profound impact on the current state of many African nations still today. In this course, I was challenged to dispel many misconceptions about Africa. I liked how the required reading was all novels because it made weekly reading very pleasant. Also, because of this, I learned how to analyze novels in their historical context and learned how to differentiate specific experiences the novelist experienced from what was actually a common experience that someone from the same town\/region\/country experienced. Because of this course, I can never look at Africa in the same way. This course taught me that it is impossible for any country trying to \"develop\" or improve relations with African nations to ignore the horrors that fundamentally disrupted development, safety, and progress in Africa. Also, because of this course, I decided to declare a history major in the Empires and Colonialism track because I realized that although colonialism seems like it is in the distant past, European colonialism in Africa ended in some countries less than 50 years ago and the scars from such are still very evident and still impact many Africans' lives on a daily basis.",
    "I had never taken a class about Africa as a whole before, or about colonialism, so I learned a lot about those two areas of study, particularly post-colonial theory. I also learned how to use novels as primary sources.",
    "I think that this is a really useful class to expand your knowledge of many important world events. There are some things that we think we know, but this class shows that they might have been very different than we may have thought.",
    "I gained knowledge of a general overview of history in Africa and a particularly insightful framework for considering African history. The professor has a really fascinating way of choosing and presenting material that will make you think twice about things you knew\/ thought you knew. Through reading all of the novels I have gained a real appreciation for African fiction, and also how literature can be used to support academic arguments.",
    "I learned how to use literary sources to make insightful, but not excessive, statements about history. It helped me think about history in a way that I was not used to, having to rely on primary sources and dig more than I would if I were studying a more developed history, such as the Cold War era.",
    "I learned how to think about the world in a new way. I learned the kind of language to use when talking about Africa. I can't even say enough the number of things I learned from this course."

   "comments": [
    "I honestly cannot think of a way to make this course better. The readings were engaging, the lecture was fascinating and my section was vibrant and creative. I would hope that Professor Magaziner continues to teach this course because I whole-heartedly believe it will be the best course I take at Yale.",
    "Awesome course, no complaints.",
    "Course was very interesting, but sometimes the lectures felt sparsely connected, or it was harder to draw broader themes from them (which as history students we've been trained to do). Great choice in making the essays flexible, though.",
    "Magaziner's lectures are amazing. It's like having a really good story told to you (which is what history should be like).",
    "I have a lot of thoughts on this question because the strengths of this course were VERY strong and the weaknesses were... very weak. Please note that while I am going to dwell more on the weaknesses, overall I loved this class and I definitely found it worthwhile. Strengths: 1) It is so incredible that the course reading material consists of novels written by African authors. I am so grateful to Prof Magaziner for structuring the course to include those. 2) Prof Magaziner is a great lecturer and clearly an expert in his field. I always looked forward to attending class to hear how he would tie separate historical narratives together in one thread. He is also an all-around incredible human being and I consider myself lucky to have been his student. Weakness: This course ended up being deeply ironic. The entire point of the course is that we cannot make generalizations about an entire continent, that you have to nuance your perspective according to the experience of each country, etc. But you end up leaving the class with the opposite result. The reason for this is twofold: a) because the lectures tend to be more thematic, I think upon reflection most students struggled to separate out which events happened in which country. The course is not very detail-oriented, so you end up forgetting which story belongs to which country. However, all of this wouldn't be a problem if we were assessed differently, in a way that allowed for us to sort out the different experiences of each nation. Instead, and here is my biggest complaint about this class-- you have to write a paper making a historical claim based on fictional novels. This is cool in concept, but ended up really not working because it forced us (especially in the second essay, when the novels were getting way more abstract) to make crazy assumptions and generalizations about Africa. This dynamic was worsened by the fact that most of the secondary sources available to use for the papers did not easily match up to the novels, so we were forced to draw from secondary sources about one country and apply it to some argument we were trying to make about another country in the continent. I love the fact that we get to use novels as historical sources for this class. But if you are going to make us write a paper on them, please give us the tools to avoid making the generalizations about Africa that this class teaches us to avoid! This could be done by selecting secondary sources that matched better with the novels, perhaps. This is made all the more crucial when the novels are fantasy\/absurd and clearly not trying to be historical accounts.",
    "Strengths: great lectures, especially the second half of the semester. Weaknesses: a little hard to actually read all of the novels in full; especially since some of them are kind of long and hard to follow",
    "I want to start by saying that this course was absolutely phenomenal. I learned so much in every single lecture that it was incredible. That being said, this course put a high emphasis on not generalizing about Africa and then the two papers for the class basically required broad generalizations. I think the class's biggest weakness were the papers. It felt like instead of actually writing a history paper, I was just illustrating a point from class using evidence from the novels, which to me did not seem like a very novel endeavor. It may be more beneficial to students to require them to write on a history that has not been written on yet. Require students to go to the Yale archives, read letters, pamphlets, etc. and place them in conversation with the history of the course and do extra historical research about the context of a particular country at a particular time.",
    "The lecture was remarkably engaging, and the structure of a history course with novels as readings was innovative and excellent. I think that the course might benefit from a lighter reading load-a novel every other week?",
    "Very, very tight syllabus. Lectures were extremely engaging with a great multimedia balance all of which complemented course readings. Absolutely no weaknesses in this course.",
    "The course gave so much useful and needed information about the different encounters with the African continent through history that have lead to many of the problems Africa as a whole is still facing. I think it would be helpful in the future if there was more time either in section or in class where students could take time to actually process some of the information. There were many times I felt like I learned so pretty rough stuff and we never took the time to actually reflect on that. I feel like that in the future can lead to many people leaving the class not fully grasping the importance of historical interactions with Africa making it what it is today.",
    "This class was transcendent, and it could not be improved.",
    "The lecture portion of this course is fantastic. Magaziner offers engaging, clear presentations and weaves an engaging story for each class session. The selection of novels is also very strong and appropriately covers many different styles of writing. The fact that the readings are all from novels makes the course sort of a strange one, though, because it can feel challenging to draw historiographically sound conclusions from fictional prose. I also felt like the reading load was heavy and somewhat unattainable. Maybe spread a few of the novels over two weeks to give us a little more breathing room?",
    "I loved this class. Professor Magaziner's lectures are extremely passionate, engaging and eloquent. The use of novels instead of primary sources is a great move, in my opinion, simply because there is so much fascinating African literature out there that covers themes from colonial and post-colonial Africa, and I thought that making the sections revolve around the books we read made them really enjoyable. I felt like I was in a high school English course again, only better, because the students were so engaged and my teaching fellow fostered a very comfortable and discussion-facilitating atmosphere. Overall, there is very little that I would say needs to change about this class, with the one exception that I think it would be nice to have one, single exam. Maybe at the end. I just felt like I would have appreciated an opportunity to synthesize the lecture material more, seeing as writing the two essays did not really force you to memorize anything that Prof. Magaziner talked about in lecture. But what he covers is really important towards understanding the time periods we discuss, so I think it would have been nice to just have a simple exam (short-answer-based) to make sure that students are actually internalizing the lectures.",
    "I loved studying novels, I gained very valuable historical insight from discussing them in section. I looked forward to lectures, and felt like I learned a lot from each class.",
    "This class was amazing and I learned an incredible amount from professor Magaziner every class. I enjoyed the idea of reading a novel every week that pertained in a way to what we were learning in class, yet the fast pace of the reading schedule made it difficult to truly appreciate all of the great books we were reading. I would have preferred in a way to read a novel every other week to be able to go into them in greater depth, especially during section. However, I appreciated the two major papers as they were appropriately challenging in terms of synthesizing both the readings and class material.",
    "The lectures are excellent and the reading list was very engaging. One thing that could change is that it seems that all 3 TFs were very far from their area of study. If it were possible to find history TFs more comfortable with talking about literature, that would be excellent.",
    "Professor Magaziner consistently delivered engaging, thoughtful lectures with compelling arguments. However, because the course is a survey approach to the continent, it was difficult to track trends and timelines without making generalizations. This problem became particularly apparent when trying to write the papers. Further, I never felt that I had the opportunity to synthesize information because there were no exams.",
    "A strength of the course is its utilization of novels as historical evidence. In my opinion, this, combined with Professor Magaziner's style of lecturing (much like storytelling), made the course more impactful and meaningful than it otherwise might have been. I think the course might be improved by narrowing in scope slightly (either geographically or temporally). The broad reach of the class is effective in communicating major themes of colonialisms in Africa, but it leaves a dearth of specific knowledge or expertise at the end.",
    "The strengths of this course are its readings and Professor Magaziner's lectures. The novels were really entertaining and a welcome break from the kinds of readings that are assigned in other history classes. Professor Magaziner is a wonderful lecturer, who makes the material engaging and presents the information in an ordered fashion. The weaknesses of this course are the two papers, which are incredibly difficult, being a hybrid between a history and an english paper, and the sheer amount of information presented in the lectures.",
    "The lectures are fabulous. Professor Magaziner weaves together really wonderful interesting narratives that are equally insightful as engaging. I did enjoy reading a majority of the novels. Professor Magaziner emphasized, especially at the end of the course, that Western generalizations have compelled us to talk about Africa as a whole instead of the complex, particular, and varying narratives of each country's historical dynamics. Yet, I found the essays, where we were supposed to craft historical arguments out of novels only, to do exactly that. It was difficult to make very particular specific historical arguments about a particular time in place, rather than \"change over time\" in Africa as a whole, when the novels were set in very disparate times and settings.",
    "This course is great for a broader understanding of African history but can be overwhelming at first",
    "Strengths: The course was presented in a very logical way, and it included various African countries, so that the students were able to get a more well rounded idea of African history. The lectures were great; Professor Magaziner was always very well prepared and lectures were always engaging. Weaknesses: The course was far too broad; it would have definitely been possible to have a class called Nigerian encounters with colonialism or Zimbabwean encounters with colonialism. On one hand, it is great to draw parallels between African countries, but on the other hand it sort of blurs into one making it difficult to consider these histories separately (and possibly feeding into the Africa is a country narrative).",
    "This is a wonderful course. Both the lecture and the section were thought-provoking and captivating, and I really enjoyed reading novels that I never would have been exposed to on my own. I think one small thing that would improve the course would be to have a map quiz of modern Africa in section during the first month (I'm bad with geography and I think it would have forced me to learn the geography of modern Africa). For what it's worth, I think it would be useful to have an exam, if only because studying all the material from the whole semester can show you long-term trends. I liked the papers and I think it's valuable to be able to use fiction in a history paper, but maybe there could be two 6-8 page papers and a final exam?",
    "great reading and dr. magaziner is a fantastic lecturer. the information is very interesting and section was engaging. no weaknesses!",
    "None. Dan Magaziner is great!",
    "This was one of my favorite courses at Yale. The lectures were very engaging and the readings were for the most part really interesting. With only one paper due before the final paper, there wasn't a huge amount of TA feedback, but I also did not make a significant effort to meet with my TA for paper advice.",
    "Strengths: The lectures were engaging, stimulating, and fascinating; reading the novels was a great way of learning the history in an accessible way. Weaknesses: Nothing, really. My only real (minor) complaint is that I would have liked if the lecture outlines were uploaded sooner so I would have time to print them out before class.",
    "I loved this course and would change nothing about it! Professor Magaziner's lectures are amazing -- so thoughtful and compelling -- and the TA ran section better than any other TA I've had at Yale. These sections felt more like a seminar than a section.",
    "It was great! Loved the lectures.",
    "I think this course would benefit from one or two tests, even though they're a hassleI would've liked to have more thoroughly committed the lecture material to memory. Also, please change the essay prompt! Having to thematically link two novels, lecture material and supplementary readings in only ten pages is very unsatisfying. I would've much preferred to look into one novel and explore it historically, because connecting two books and extra readings that often cover different cultures, places and times requires pretty broad analysis, which I found less intellectually valuable than a more specific look at one book or one culture. (Especially if we're trying to avoid looking at Africa as one homogenous place.) Also, please give us historical background on the novels and the writers. It would help immensely. We only have 50 minutes each week to discuss an entire novel, and though it makes sense to discuss the books as historical documents rather than as literature, it would be helpful when looking at the novels historically to have a little background information on who the author was, and what they were trying to accomplish in their work of literature.",
    "I think it's wonderful the way it is. Admittedly the novel-a-week workload through the course is heavy, but that can't really be helped.",
    "I thought the lectures were incredible and helped me to learn a lot of history in just a semester. Reading novels along with the lectures gave another perspective and really enriched my understanding of the material. One improvement for the course could be the structure of the assignments. I found the paper prompts to be too vague and there was little guidance when it came to using literature as a source in a history paper.",
    "This course was a very strong and continually interesting course, helped by the fact that Magaziner is an amazing lecturer who always kept time in lecture interesting. The use of novels was very helpful in allowing students to think thoughtfully about the ways in which colonialism has affected the ways people engage with the world in Africa, even through their work as novelists.",
    "I think it would have been better to, instead of writing the papers have a midterm and a final. I think it would have forced me to really learn the material. Alternatively, I think it would be really cool to have each student have to write an original archival research paper on some aspect of African society, politics, or culture. There are so many untapped archives, and in 5 pages, each student could tell a specific story to deepen their understanding of the continent.",
    "This is the best course I have taken at Yale and I can't imagine how it could be improved.",
    "The novels! They are amazing and make the history we learn in class much more manageable and easier to relate to. It was often hard to find time (and motivation) to read the secondary sources throughout the semester. Maybe it would be motivating if we discussed the sources in section - i.e. for just a few minutes at the beginning, if we were asked to talk to a partner\/small group about a source we read (so everyone is encouraged to read at least one source, and gets to hear about other ones from peers). This would make the essays seem more approachable.",
    "The strengths of this course were in Magaziner's superb lecturing, the unique lens with which the course is taught (novels are an interesting way of reading history, the overall takeaway was a new look at Africa and the sequences of events that affected \"development\" and exploited the continent) and the teaching fellows. The course is also very straightforward and easy to do well in: come to section engaged, come to lecture because it's interesting, read and write a thoughtful paper and you will do very well. The weaknesses of this course were some of the readings. The suggested readings are far too numerous to read alongside the lectures on a weekly basis and I struggled with reading all of the novels in time before section that week. There is a substantial workload that doesn't quite correspond to the lectures themselves so you have to adjust to the unique arc of the course. In addition, limiting the sources we could use for the paper forced us to be quite general about Africa, using evidence from Kenya to justify a point about Zimbabwe seemed to be a trap.",
    "I think that Professor magaziner has an engaging lecture style which i really appreciated however, sometimes in the abstract quality of his lectures, I would sometimes got lost- especially at points of transition Also, sections are so interesting but when it came to the essay writing i felt our discussions were sometimes inadequete as we didnt always discuss secondary readings.",
    "One strength of this course was the use of novels to teach about historical context and perspectives. However, I felt that the novels in the second half of the course were hard to use for the paper because the secondary sources weren't that related to them, so we were forced to make generalizations at times.",
    "In describing changes in the political status of African colonies, Prof. Magaziner would often identify historical events that gave Africans reason to demand \"a seat at the table\", or that made a previous political state somehow untenable in the eyes of European colonial powers. Certainly, these powers could not have simply said, \"okay, these Africans are demanding a seat at the table, I guess we have to give it to them,\" or, \"the times are a-changing, we better get with it to keep our images up to snuff\". Considering that civil rights and independence were not granted by the goodness of Europeans' hearts, what were the actual political and economic considerations that forced European countries to reorganize and eventually \"liberate\" their profitable and long-held colonies? This is an important question that could have been better answered.",
    "Fantastic course. Sometimes it was unfeasible to attempt to read entire novels in a week, but that wasn't always disqualifying.",
    "Strenghts: brilliant lectures, wonderful discussion sections, thoughtful instructors, fun novels. Weaknesses: the structure of the two essays left a lot to be desired. They required that students search for a topic that intersected with the novels and the supplementary readings, which eliminated a lot of topics in the novels that students might have been interested in writing about. It was unnecessarily difficult to find a good topic. Then, the essay did not teach much about how to write a good historical argument, nor did it solidify the material we learned in lecture. I wouldn't have minded an exam to solidify the class material, which I likely will not remember. Many students did not have a structure\/context in which to put the lecture information, and therefore are unlikely to remember it, which is a shame.",
    "Some strengths of the course include Professor Magaziner's lectures, great discussions in section, and the required and suggested reading materials. I also appreciated the emphasis on class attendance (40% of the grade was class participation\/attendance) because since the books we read were novels, it was vital that we all attend lecture to understand the historical context and details of the period while also contributing well to section. One way that I think the course could improve is with the graded written assignments. I thought having a 10 page paper mid term was hard and unusual, but had no problem with having a 10 page final paper. However, I did not like that we were restricted to only the provided secondary sources and lectures in addition to the novels to write the paper. I felt like by doing so, it was very hard not to make generalizations about Africa (since we were advised not to focus on specific country, but rather a theme) which was exactly what the class was against. For a couple of my topic proposals, my TF told me to broaden the scope of my argument since with the materials given, I would not be able to support my argument, but by being more general about the topic, I thought I was clumping together decades and African countries together. Also, it was hard to gage exactly how to use novels as historical evidence since they are fictional pieces, so when I was writing my first paper, I felt conflicted as to whether I was writing more of an English or history paper. By the second paper, after talking to my TF, I think I better understood how to blend the novels and history. I did enjoy writing these papers as it was a new experience to write about fiction and history in the same paper and since we were never tested on the historical details from lecture, the papers allowed me to absorb many of the details we learned in lecture.",
    "Magaziner is an excellent lecturer, and the material is all very interesting. Towards the end of the course, however, I found the order of the lectures to be somewhat disorganized. I also didn't feel, at times, that I had enough factual information to fully analyze the novels I was reading.",
    "The main strength is definitely Professor Magaziner. He gives absolutely amazing, instructive, engaging lectures that are fun and informative to listen to. I also loved the format of reading fiction books each week, because I thought it was an interesting way to engage in the class. The one thing that could be changed is just maybe adding in some more factual readings to talk about in section.",
    "there are plenty of strengths: through lectures, novels and articles, we examined a really wide range of ways to examine history and different moments in history. The material is all super interesting, although the novels varied from wonderful to really hard to get through. The professor is a great lecturer. Each lecture is kind of like attending a performance. Attention is mandatory. On the flip side, there is a lot of work and the different materials (novels, scholarly articles, lectures) are almost never on the same page.",
    "I liked the novels we read, but I felt that the class needed more secondary sources assigned. Professor Magaziner did provide us with secondary sources (which were honestly great reads), but I wish we had the opportunity to discuss them in section, as many of them got pretty technical.",
    "The course is amazing at being a survey, in that it covers a wide range of topics and experiences, but also delves into individual stories and tensions within each one. That's why Professor Magaziner is the best history lecturer I've ever heard. He re-frames everything I ever learned about Africa. The course suffers a bit from lack of baseline knowledge. The texts are all novels, and the section discussions were difficult to navigate. You weren't allowed to talk about the novels as texts, but we also didn't have the historical knowledge to really talk about the historical context. So the discussions ended up being a weird limbo of a lot of big personalities making up things to say. The lectures made the class 100% worth coming to, however."

    "I highly recommend this course because it will not only teach you a lot, make you look forward to lecture every single week but, if you are as lucky as I think I was, make you realize some of your own biases and preconceptions and revisit them with a more critical eye.",
    "TAKE THIS COURSE. Dan Magaziner is unlike any other. His course materials were hand-picked assiduously, and the structure of the semester contributed to my gaining an incredible breadth and depth of knowledge. Would highly, highly recommend!",
    "yes",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS. It's outside of my major but probably one of my favorite classes I've taken at Yale.",
    "So good. So interesting. So dope.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS. Magaziner is amazing.",
    "Yes. The lectures were fun to listen to and section was always interesting since we were evaluating novels. There was also a lot of flexibility in terms of what you could choose to write about for the papers.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class, especially if you're interested in themes of colonialism, nationalism, post-colonialism, or African history. This was definitely one of the best history classes I've taken.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course. It is most likely the course that I have learned the most in while at Yale. This history that is not taught in any other class, yet history that all people should know. That being said, it is a highly challenging course. The lectures are fast paced and jam packed with information. Then, the required reading is a novel a week. For me, this often took up an entire day to read. In that way, it felt like I was taking both a lecture and a seminar because the section was a discussion of the novel and not strictly related to the lecture. I personally loved both parts of the class, but it is not a class structure that will work for everyone. Applying literature to history is not something that came easy for me, and I imagine that many people would find it challenging. If you are just interested in learning the history and not wanting the great amount of work, this would be a great credit\/d class. If you decide to put in all the work, it is absolutely worth it.",
    "Definitely! Magaziner is the most engaging lecturer I've had. I fall asleep in class A LOT-not this one!",
    "Do yourself a favor and take this course. Professor Magaziner is an unparalleled lecturer. Don't be surprised if you find yourself with goosebumps at the end of his lectures. The novels are amazing and ones that everyone should have to read. The books and lectured complemented one another tremendously. The workload is extremely fair and consistent. I can't recommend this class enough.",
    "Yes!! I think more students in general should take history courses like this because African History in general is under discussed",
    "Wow. Professor Magaziner is a tour-de-force, and this lecture was nothing short of spectacular. It often left me laughing, in tears, or mesmerized by the material. The books are really great, and Magaziner's words are make you want to cling on to each and every sentence he speaks. Perhaps the best lecture I've taken at Yaleand even the best class at large.",
    "I definitely recommend the course. Magaziner gives great lectures (it's worth going to see him in shopping period) and treats a challenging subject with poise. The part about it that's not necessarily clear from bluebooking is that the reading load is a novel a week. In addition to this being a lot of reading, it's a little weird to use novels as historical sources (though I enjoyed the course nevertheless). Just a heads up. Two papers make for a light coursework load overall, which is refreshing.",
    "Take this class if you have ANY interest in Sub-Saharan African colonial and post-colonial history. Any. Professor Magaziner is phenomenal - awesome and engaging lectures that I found myself literally unable to zone out during. The reading load is fairly intense; you read one novel per week and then discuss it in section. There are two 10-12 page papers that combine material from novels, supplementary\/optional readings and lectures, and no tests. No reading responses, which is nice, but you are supposed to come to section prepared to really discuss (it's 40% of your grade). I really enjoyed this course, but you might not if you aren't ready to read a lot of African fiction (even though it's very good and accessible fiction, for the most part!) or don't quite have the stomach for the numerous atrocities that the course covers. I took this as a non-major and loved it. You'll come away from it understanding not just African history, but all of historical thought and analysis quite differently than you did before, in large part due to the use of novels as primary sources.",
    "Yes!!! An incredible class, amazing lecture, and sections are always exciting because the novels are well-chosen.",
    "Yes.",
    "Yes absolutely. Take this course! As a senior history major, this was one of the best history classes I've taken at Yale. Every lecture was refreshing, engaging, and had a clear thesis. The content of both the lectures and the novels are awesome. It's really incredible to engage with history in this unique way and leads to some really meaningful perspective.",
    "Yes! You get the opportunity to read so many books and be introduced to many great African writers that I've never heard of before. The readings and lectures really expanded my horizons.",
    "Yes, I would. Magaziner is an excellent lecturer and it's incredibly important to learn this history from a non-Euro centric perspective. However, the paper assignments are repetitive and the parameters did not allow us the space to develop nuanced arguments.",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone looking for an interesting humanities credit. Professor Magaziner's lecture style is engaging (he communicates history as a story), and the required readings are all novels.",
    "Take this class!!",
    "Yes, definitely. It is a lot of work though, but if you have any interest in colonial African history this is the best class to take. Professor Magaziner is wonderful. Don't take this class if you're looking to improve your writing.",
    "Would absolutely recommend this history to a fellow student. Professor Magaziner is truly a wonderful and incredibly knowledgeable professor.",
    "Yes I would",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. Although it is very broad subject matter, it offers great insight into African history, and the effects of colonialism. The whole class comprises of two papers and sections participation, so the workload is not too much. If you want to consider specific African countries, this course is not for you. However, if you want to learn about African history more generally, and consider the general consequences of colonialism, you should definitely take this class. Professor Magaziner is great, and my TA was wonderful; it is one of the best taught classes I have taken at Yale.",
    "This is one of the best history lectures at Yale, and I say that as a senior history major. Dan Magaziner's lectures are spellbinding, thought-provoking, and challenging, a joy to attend every week. Even in a lecture, he makes it obvious that he cares about his students and he's incredibly compassionate. Reading novels and learning how to integrate them into a history final paper is a really useful, fun skill and it's a nice change from other history classes' reading. My section was excellent, in part because of my wonderful TF (Keri) and in part because people were clearly doing the reading and engaging with the material. I would highly recommend this class!",
    "for sure. the best lecture course ive taken at Yale",
    "Definitely! It was so refreshing to take my first college-level course on African history. Each lecture was worthwhile because I took away something new each time, and it was interesting to use literature as a way of discussing history in the two papers I wrote. My writing skills improved tremendously as a result of the draft and revision process that the course allowed. Some books are way better than others, but try your best to do all of the readings, because you gain so much from them. Also make time to do the supplementary readings as well. Seek out advice from Professor Magaziner and take advantage of your TAs and write a draft of your paper before submitting it!",
    "Yes, absolutely. It is the only history course at Yale with fiction readings. That alone is enough of a reason for students to want to take it.",
    "Yes!!",
    "Absolutely take this class. Professor Magaziner is one of the best lecturers you will find at Yale, and the lectures are fascinating and moving. Reading novels is a great way of learning social history and making the course material accessible and interesting; I really enjoyed writing the papers using a mix of fiction and nonfiction sources. Definitely take this class!",
    "yes, absolutely, without hesitation. one of the best courses i've taken at Yale, and I hope to have the chance to take more courses with Professor Magaziner in the future.",
    "I would recommend it. Great overview of African history with a great reading list.",
    "I would recommend this course if you like fiction. I was looking for a more fact-based understanding of colonialism, so I was slightly disappointed, but the class was quite rewarding nonetheless.",
    "Yes, would recommend. Would warn about how scattered the intellectual work is, though.",
    "I highly recommend this course! It provides a clear overview of the impact of colonialism on Africa and how Africa got to where it is today.",
    "Absolutely. Whenever Professor Magaziner comes back from sabbatical, TAKE IT. It completely changed the way I've situated myself in my own understand of how history works. Really mind blowing and so satisfying.",
    "Yes! The material is important and taught so well. This is one of the best history classes I have taken, but also one of the most difficult, because it was new material for me, lectures require intense focus and strong note-taking skills, and the papers are challenging. I would definitely recommend it, but I am glad that I took it as a junior and not as a freshman. That being said, I learned so much and Magaziner is an awesome lecturer.",
    "I would recommend this course to any student interested in learning about Africa, and colonialisms effects on how Africa functions today. Daniel Magaziner is an amazing lecturer and one of the best professors at Yale, and an opportunity to take any class with him, no matter the subject matter, will be intellectually engaging, thought provoking and a great experience. The workload was higher, but it was a continually interesting course that leads people to question what they think they know about colonial and postcolonial Africa. It is absolutely one of the best courses I have taken at Yale.",
    "Wow I have very mixed feelings about this class for two reasons: first, the papers were frustrating, and the politics of the class went under-discussed. I'll go into all of this, but that being said, it's an incredible lecture on material that is important to know, if not unproblematic. On the last day of class, Professor Magaziner gave a beautiful lecture in response to one of the evals he got some years ago. The student asked, \"i don't feel like I learned how to talk about africa from this course.\" In response, Professor Magaziner talked about how the history of a continent cannot be simplified - but must remain complicated and intricate - a beautiful elegy to what it means to be a historian, and to the continent itself. And then two days later I was writing one of the papers, making wild connections between books written on different time periods and cultures, and then connecting them with scholarly articles written also on different time periods and cultures. I would write things like, \"As we can see from this phenomenon 1920s south africa, it shows that 1970s Nigeria blah blah blah,\" and my TA would congratulate me for it! It makes literally no sense, and encourages wild generalizations about Africa. The second difficulty I had with the class were the politics. Professor Magaziner is incredibly eloquent and has strong opinions - which I appreciated. But his opinions were stated as fact, in a way that it felt they could not be contradicted, even if they often contradicted themselves. For example, he gave a lecture on how development aid and the clinton foundation is a legacy of colonialism - and in the next lecture he criticized President Clinton for not intervening in the Rwandan Genocide. There was a pervading sense that the West (and the United States) could do nothing right, which given our storied (and often inhumane) history, I don't disagree with. But the discussion lacked the nuance beyond white people continually fuck up. It's true, white people have done more harm than good, but the class could have looked to the future and thought through these contradictions. Moreover, because the discussion sections were spent talking about the novels, there wasn't time to sort through these contradictions to try to piece apart what we can learn from history for the future.",
    "This course was brilliant in every way. It wasn't just classroom learning, but really applicable for looking at the future of the African continent.",
    "Definitely! Everyone should learn about African history (even though taking this course makes you realize how much more there is to learn, so it's really just a starting point).",
    "This is the best lecture course I have ever taken. Magaziner is a spellbinding lecturer and each class I felt stunned with the new knowledge I had acquired in such a short but entertaining time. The lectures often get emotional (particularly about Rwanda in 1994 or the Belgian Congo) and I recommend this course to all Yale students because very few of us truly know the history of the colonial exploitation of Africa. The coursework is tough but manageable and if you come to class engaged it's quite straightforward and simple to succeed. Come to lecture even if you aren't enrolled in the class!",
    "yes, if you want to improve your critical thinking",
    "Yes definitely!",
    "A thorough, engaging, honest, and sensitive survey of a very important region and period that goes largely unnoticed by much of the world. Entertaining, informative readings, and a lot of room for intellectual exploration on the class's two essays. Highly recommended.",
    "100%. Definitely take this course. Can't promise a life changing experience in terms of giving you the ability to 'discuss' Africa colloquially - and in some ways that simplification is what this course critiques. You will emerge with a much more problematized sense of the continent and the history. Professor Magaziner is amazing and so are the TAs.",
    "Prof Magaziner is a brilliant lecturer, and the discussion sections are fun, interesting, and full of thoughtful people. Take this class if you want to be wowed in lecture and to gain insights into the oft-misrepresented history of colonial and post-colonial Africa. However, do not expect to come away feeling that you have learned the history of Africa in a way that you'll remember, because there is no exam and no way to solidify the knowledge. In addition, the essays are structured in a limiting way and I didn't feel they taught me how to write a historical argument.",
    "I absolutely recommend this class to any student. Not only does Professor Magaziner keep students highly engaged during lecture, but sections are so interesting and the assigned novels are actually very enjoyable to read. Also, this is a region and time period of history that most students barely learned about or did not learn about at all in high school; therefore, this class provides a great environment to learn such in both a different and captivating manner.",
    "Yes! Professor Magaziner is one of the most dynamic lectures whom I have had the pleasure of listening to here at yale. The books are all so interesting and so different. Would strongly recommend.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student! It's very engaging, and challenging in a great way; Magaziner is one of the best professors I have had, and I loved the novels I read. This isn't information that is covered in a lot of other courses, so I would definitely recommend it, even if you just do it credit\/D\/fail.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class to other people (and I already have!). I'm also planning on taking Professor Magaziner's next class, because I know it will be amazing, too. The class is a great opportunity to learn about another part of the world that often gets overlooked or is talked about or shown in stereotypes. This class shows how we shouldn't fall victim to those stereotypes and need to fully understand Africa's history to understand the present. The class is fun and engaging, and Professor Magaziner is incredible. Reading fictional books each week for the class also often doesn't even feel like work, because they're so interesting to read. I think that every student at Yale should take this class.",
    "I would highly recommend this class. it's a lot of work, but always interesting, engaging, and never impossible to finish. I learned tons, really enjoyed lectures and the process of putting together essays tying together a lot of varied sources. It's an excellent class, one you will never want to miss, if you can read a novel a week, more or less, for a semester.",
    "You must take a course with Professor Magaziner before you graduate. I wish I had taken this course earlier in my time at Yale, because it made me realize what a course should be like - it should challenge your preconceptions and re-frame everything you thought you knew. I would have taken all different courses if I had taken this sooner. This course taught me how to learn. I feel like it just opened up the world to me."
