   "comments": [
    "I would 100% recommend this class as long as you are ready for the workload. Professor See is encouraging, engaging, and super fun, and although he asked a lot he also put in way more than we did. If you are interested in queer studies, in myth, or in literature this is a great class.",
    "Make room for the class if you're interested in doing something a bit off kilter. What you learn will be applicable to, like, everything ever. Our class was also quite small, so we got to talk a lot, and the class dynamic was warm and invigorating.",
    "A great and fascinating course, but definitely heavy on the English portion. Don't take if you're not strong in that field and aren't prepared to talk about literary terms, tropes, and other writers.",
    "Yes, take it. The material\/readings are fantastic. Prof. See is by far the most \"present\" professor I've had here -- as in, he is always available to help and is extraordinarily generous with his time. I have no idea how he has time to sleep. He's a tough grader but a very fair one, and honestly, if you put in even a fraction of the time he invests in you, you'll do well. Do the readings because they're great (and because none of them, including the secondary ones, are by any means optional!).",
    "A super intense class covering issues of queer theory, identity, and the impact of myth-making through the analysis of various forms of mostly Western literature. I would recommend this class to any student who wants a fulfilling challenge and is ready to read a ton, learn a ton, and work very hard. One of the most satisfying and difficult classes I've taken at Yale so far, and I think it's made me a better thinker\/student\/writer\/person because of it."
