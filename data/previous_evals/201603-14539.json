   "question_text": "What knowledge, skills, and insights did you develop by taking this course?",
   "comments": [
    "This class is unlike any course I have taken at Yale. I think because it was so hands-on and involved a combination of dancing, acting and discussions of readings I got more out of it than I have other courses.",
    "I learned so much in this course. This course allowed me to learn about myself and real societal issues in an extremely safe setting for discussion. This course is a rare course at Yale as it allows you to develop as a person.",
    "This course gave me an insight into dance's history and relationship with gender. The readings were really engaging and taught me to analyse the social messages behind dance movements and specific pieces. As a queer student, I came away with a much broader and deeper understanding of the LGBTQ+ community and feminism's history through the dance we studied. This was a very intersectional course, which gave it an additional depth and relevance to me. I also learned to critique social movements. I came in with no dance experience but left feeling that dance was an accessible medium for me which I could use to express my own feelings and work through my own experiences.",
    "This class gave me an opportunity to read a lot of the academic literature surrounding gender and sexuality theory, which was something I had been interested in learning about in college. It also taught me a lot about dance and movement vocabulary that I was unfamiliar with. Mostly, however, it helped me let go of a lot of self consciousness I had surrounding myself and my body.",
    "How to critically analyze",
    "I developed insights about the effects of societal pressures on the ways people understand their own bodies. In addition, I learned how these pressures differ across a multitude of genders, sexualities, and identities."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Big strength is that Professor Berson was able to teach a room full of kids with compeltely different experiences with dance and still have us all fully engaged and learning something new every day. As, someone with no dance experience I was a little anxious going into the course and could not be happier I took the class. Really took me out of my comfort zone in the best way possible.",
    "This course was great because it was very movement based and had a very safe space for discussion. We also got to enjoy many guest lectures which helped us prepare well for our final project. The differences between the guest lecturers made it so useful and allowed us to first hand exposure of topics we discuss. I do not think there is anything significant that I would change about the course.",
    "I loved this course and how it was structured. The readings we did at home were fascinating and, as an international student, really enlightening. I learned so much about race and gender dynamics in the US, which we then got to discuss productively in class rather than learning the material there for the first time. Doing actual dance in class also helped massively to engage with the course material and with dance as a medium for our own creative expression. The one thing I would like to change about this course, is that I would like to see more discussion of genders outside the gender binary. As a trans* student, it was interesting to read about cis people subverting and otherwise interacting with gender expectations, but it would be interesting to see a greater diversity of gender within this WGSS course. Having said that, I know there isn't much research out there on trans* dance movements.",
    "I think the engagement with the reading could be improved with creating something more than just the posting on the blog once a week, which sometimes results in a rush to finish reading the night before then creating a superficial post. Perhaps requiring two people schedule a meeting to discuss the readings prior to a class each week, which might help improve engagement.",
    "It allowed different kinds of students to interact",
    "A big strength for the course was having guest speakers come in and offer their perspective on how identity relates to dance. These guest speakers brought forth the most important points in our readings and help us internalize the information we read. In addition the final project was an amazing way to showcase what we learned in class."

   "comments": [
    "YES! Loved it.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. It is a great way to learn beyond more standard classes at Yale. You learn so much about yourself and society in it.",
    "Yes. It was so broadening in my social understanding and empowering in my capacity as an artist.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course! It was a great crash course in gender and sexuality theory, and by rooting the theory into performance it made it much easier to engage with and understand the material. This also just made it immensely fun, and it provided an opportunity to do something that you never get to do in almost all other Yale courses; unwind, dance, mess about, etc... It wasn't a class without any work, but the type of work that you had to do was refreshing and it was fun to do. If the topic at all interests you, whether that be dance or gender studies, I would definitely encourage it. Also, theatre studies students who are in the major for the craft and less interested in the theory\/history of theatre; this is a really great class to take, it fulfills one of the theatre history requirements but still allows you to do a lot of actual performance work and practice, including a final project which is a great chance to let your artistic spirit shine! People without an interest in theatre: this is still a great class that I think you would get a lot out of. Enjoy!",
    "Yes I would. Its fun and engaging and uniquely different from most of Yale courses",
    "Absolutely. This course will challenge your sense of self, and force you to question realities that many of us take for granted. While intellectually rigorous, the course will definitely make you a better person by the end."
