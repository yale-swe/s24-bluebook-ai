   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this class to a fellow student who was truly interested in both fields.",
    "Abroadly interdisciplinary introduction to the history and psychiatry of combat stress and wartime mental illness.",
    "Good class! Very narrow focus, but really gives a full picture of wartime mental illness. Not very difficult, but start the final paper early!!",
    "ABSOLUTELY take the class! Why? Because of all I have already said (see supra).Plus these classes do not come around frequently and they are hit or miss. I would recommend this class based on the principle that we live in a violent culture, more than most realize and especially those superficially insulated in an academic environment. I have recommended these classes to divinity students who are intrigued but knew nothing of the class --- and to other students as well. Most importantly, I would recommend because many students are not aware of the class, or type of class and that is a problem that should be fixed--they know because I told them. I especially recommend to students in pastoral care work who believe working with this population of seriously injured men and women, will be an option for the clergy--- a clergy who can pick and choose who they work with spiritually-- I don't think it should be an option and for that reason alone, I have recommended this class (to professors also)."

   "comments": [
    "Contributed greatly with an introduction to broader historiography and an opportunity to historicize the issues of readjustment and combat stress.",
    "I am interested in medicine, and wartime public health, so this class really gave me a historical perspective for many of the issues I have studied previously in only restricted situations.",
    "Please see answer to question 3.I will add that I would never have interviewed Sandrali in Rwanda, or had this type of intellectual freedom. My area of study is ethics and medical ethics --- studying ancient philosophy is useless to me without having some application in reality-- IF-- it can have some application in reality. I think this course has not had the full impact yet and that will come as I shift gears, but they shifted because of this class and one other like it Fall 09."
