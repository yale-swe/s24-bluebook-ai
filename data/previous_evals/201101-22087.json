    "We spent time in the Beinecke looking at beautiful medieval manuscripts! It was fun and very different from most literature-based English courses. Each week had a different theme, with readings and a blog post. We took a mid-term exam and had mid-term and final projects, all of which were enjoyable rather than burdensome. Wonderful and fun senior seminar!",
    "Fun class, very cool to be in the Beineke, and accessible to non-specialists, though you if you aren't certain it's a topic you like, you should be confident you won't be irritated by a somewhat arcane field, as the theory we read could be a bit out there.",
    "If you're into this sort of thing, TAKE IT. One of my favorite courses I've taken at Yale - loved it!"
