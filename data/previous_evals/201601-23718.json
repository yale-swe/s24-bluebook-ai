   "comments": [
    "Definitely take this course! It covers both philosophical and psychological approaches to Moral Weakness, and is probably one of the most immediately applicable courses you can take in philosophy. The professors were excellent, the atmosphere in class was very good (largely owing, I think, to the professors' attitudes, and the way they ran section). All in all, very very good.",
    "Be aware that the entire class focuses on one topic -- weakness of will. So be aware of the possibility that you will get tired of it after a while, but take it if you really are interested in philosophy of action, practical thinking, or psychology.",
    "I would not recommend this class unless you are a pure philosophy major. I took it because I wanted to grapple with a human problem, but really it was just about grappling with dense philosophical texts and not what it means for people themselves.",
    "I would absolutely reccommend this course to another Yale student, but say be prepared to think hard (which is not necessarily the same as working hard). It was an interesting class for sure, and one of the better taught courses\/seminars I've taken at Yale, as David and Evan had a great dynamic.",
    "Probably one of the best seminars I've taken in my 3 years at Yale.",
    "Yes I would recommend this course. If you would like an in-depth approach to a specific philosophical topic with a long philosophical tradition, absolutely enroll in this course. While at times you might get tired with the material, the course's psychological material at the end of the course absolutely re-vamps interest.",
    "I would definitely recommend it with one caveat: know what you are getting into. It is a very specific course for a specific kind of interest group; if you don't happen to find the material fascinting and the teaching methods helpful than it will really do more harm than good.",
    "This class covers a very specific topic, but does so in a way that shows how philosophical accounts build on one another over centuries, and is therefore a very interesting domain to study. The not-quite-weekly reading responses and short papers allowed for a hands-on, critical approach to the material.",
    "I think I will remember this as one of the best classes I took at Yale. The teachers were great facilitators of discussion and the subject matter had plenty of depth for discussion and was really personally applicable. It was a class where I could draw insights from my own experience which made it that much more exciting. The syllabus was good overall, especially the philosophy section. The format of having a student open and make a worksheet and lead discussion was really effective I thought, and the diversity of the students in the class made it such that most of the time the reading that the student was presenting was a topic or author they found personally interesting. It was a great academic atmosphere, where people were excited to talk, would ask each other questions, and learn from each other. Interest (despite the arcane analytic topic of the course) was so high that discussion continued between students and teachers before and after the class. I would often walk out with my friends from the class continuing to debate a point in class that I didn't feel settled about. The paper prompts were well written and of manageable scope, and we got great feedback on them in one on one meetings that I think helped my writing a lot in addition to my understanding of the concepts I was writing about."
