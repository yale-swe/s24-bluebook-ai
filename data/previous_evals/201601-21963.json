    "A continuation of 218 but with chromaticism. It's not an easy half-credit; there is work involved. Afterwards you will be able to identify chords you hear and, to an extent, be able to look at a piece of music and know what at least the melody sounds like.",
    "This course if really good at developing an understanding of common harmonies, melodies, and rhythms you'll come across in music. Even though it focuses on examples from classical music, it builds solid music skills that will serve you in any kind of music. Professor Schartmann is really great and receptive, but you need to be willing to work hard and understand that you're not going to develop a great ear in only 1 semester. This stuff takes time, and this course is a fantastic place to start.",
    "219 is the continuation of the 218 musicianship course. The class is mostly a lot of singing and listening exercises, but Andrew keeps things interesting through different activities, and he really tries to help you improve your ear. Course is definitely a step up in difficulty compared to 218, and things get pretty hectic by the end.",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone who wants to improve their musicianship skills. The workload is much less than normal Yale classes, but make sure that you practice keyboard and sight singing in order to make the most of this class. (For keyboard, its much better to practice for like 10 minutes 2\/3 times a week than to cram for hours the night before the lab exam.)",
    "I would certainly recommend 219 for anyone interested in improving their musicianship. It's a class that you can succeed in with a relatively poor musical ear if you apply yourself, though if you are nervous, you could consider starting the term credit\/d. It's not very much work, though if you decide to put in more than the minimum, your skills will improve a lot more. It's a step up from 218, which is to be expected."
