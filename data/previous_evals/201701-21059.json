    "This course is a great overview into the Salafiyya movement, and I very much enjoyed the approach Professor Griffel took in designing the course. The syllabus is perfect in that it allows for a holistic approach to the Salafiyya movement rather than analyzing sources from the 1870s onwards, thereby ignoring the historical and theological context of the movement. I would highly recommend this course to a student interested in Modernist approaches to Islam and to learning about a movement that has been widely discussed but is poorly understood.",
    "I learned a lot about the tension between reason and revelation in Islam along with how Islam has interacted with the modern age and colonialism",
    "I learned not just about Salafism, but also about its intellectual roots and some of the political history of the Middle East. This was a great expansion on Griffel's Fall term course.",
    "I learned how to think about multiple complex definitions together and evaluate which I thought was correct."

   "comments": [
    "It was a great course. I wouldn't change it, although I would make the importance of strong writing style clearer early on.",
    "Griffel is the star of the show. He is brilliant, and a very good teacher. The class was well-organized and the structure of the syllabus was great. The readings were awesome, and not too unwieldy. However, I wish that we had more seminar style discussions, instead of seminarish lectures, because I think it would have allowed me to engage in class not merely in a receptive way but also in a perceptive way."

   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this course to students interested in learning about current movements within Islam as well as modernist Islam in general. Professor Griffel brings expertise and clarity to the course and provides excellent structure to the material.",
    "This was an important course to take to understand the wide variety of movements in modern Islam. I learned a lot about the tension between reason and revelation in Islam along with how it has interacted with the modern age and colonialism. Every Yale student interested in Islam and politics should take this course following a more general survey about the subject. The Salafiyya movement is important and good to study if you want to understand political Islam.",
    "Yes, TAKE THIS COURSE. JUST SIGN UP. TAKE IT. It is a comprehensive historical enquiry into the intellectual development of the Salafiyya movement -- a movement that is little understood by the media today. We cover Islamic reform movements starting from the Wahhabis, right up to the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt in 2011. Professor Griffel is AMAZING. If you have not taken any of his classes, GO DO THAT RIGHT NOW. He is a superstar in his field, and he follows the Socratic method, so at the end of class, you will get it too. It is a small seminar divided into two sessions of 1 hour and 15 minutes each, which I preferred over the 2 hour 20 minute seminars we usually have once a week. The reading was, on average, about 50 pages per session, so about 100 pages a week. There are three short papers of 500 words each, which together make up the midterm grade. There's a 15-page final paper at the end, and participation makes up the rest of the grade. Being prepared for the seminar is imperative, but the readings are super interesting, so it's not a problem.",
    "This class is great for people who are good, curious listeners. If you have some background in Islamic studies and want to learn about the theology and ideology of one of the most important trends in modern Islam, this is your class. People who want to talk about terrorism should not take this class, nor should anybody coming at this from too Global-Affairsy a perspective. This is sort of a history class, sort of a theology class, sort of a Middle East Studies class, and I loved it, but I don't think that everybody would.",
    "Absolutely would recommend this course! If you are interested in Islamic theology at all, this course is fascinating to understand modern trends in Islamic theological thought."
