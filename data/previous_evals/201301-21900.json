    "Great class, easy grading scheme in that there are so many ways to get points. The topics are so interesting, too- who doesn't want to learn about sex, stress, drugs, and eating disorders? Take this class- you won't regret it!",
    "Take it if you're a psych major. If you're not, avoid like the plague because the professor sucks and the questions are stupid.",
    "It's a run-through of various mental disorders. Professor Klemanski is a great instructor who is genuinely enthusiastic to teach the course. Should show up to lectures though -- he takes attendance\/pop quizzes\/extra credit quizzes.",
    "Decent course, take it if you are interested in disorders and things",
    "Overall a pretty fun class and interesting subject content! A lot of content needed to do well in exams though -- symptoms, types of disorders etc",
    "This class is fantastic!! I absolutely recommend it for anyone, not only psych majors. You will learn a ton by just coming to class, reading the textbook isn't really necessary. The workload isn't bad at all and if you study it's not hard to do well on the exams.",
    "YES - become an expert on mental illnesses",
    "This is a great course if you like psychology. The course not only explores what constitutes a mental illness, but also looks at how they can affect people's lives. Klemanski brings in people with firsthand experience with mental disorders and mental health experts to supplement his already thorough lectures. His use of videos and questions also helps keep the class engaged. The workload of this course is very manageable as long as you stay on top of your work. Klemanski also provides tons of extra credit opportunities. Definitely take this class!",
    "I would definitely recommend it - very interesting subject matter and its a good lecture class.",
    "good course to credit\/d. very interesting stuff but the memorization of DSM lists gets a bit annoying. a midterm, a final, a psych book review, and class participation. the professor has not yet figured out how to perform a lecture, but maybe he'll learn (this was his first year).",
    "I would definitely recommend it.",
    "Definitely take this class! I am not a psych major, but the material is so interesting that you will love it too! Grading is fair and there is not too much work. There are overlaps with some other psych courses but this is to be expected.",
    "Take this class! You'll learn a lot.",
    "YES! Very interesting subject material and easy to do well in.",
    "The material is interesting but the way it was taught made it boring. Go to the first few lectures and see if Klemanski has improved.",
    "This is one of the best classes I have taken at Yale. There's so many people, especially here, who are abnormal in some way that even if you have no interest in pursuing clinical psychology, this is great knowledge. Professor Klemanski was very fair and offered many extra credit opportunities. If you do everything you're supposed to, then a good grade is very manageable in this class.",
    "it is 2 test and one paper. The test are not that hard but do study try not to cram. otherwise i would recommend it very highly as it is interesting and fun",
    "Textbook readings, 2 pretty easy exams. Would recommend if you are a psych major, you learn about many different disorders and get a fairly easy credit towards the major.",
    "I'd recommend the class. They really want to you to do well, there is not a lot of work, and it's interesting.",
    "Professor Klemanski is one of the sweetest, most caring professors that I've ever had. He does a wonderful job of making the students feel taken care of and the class really is a learning experience because he tries to minimize the stress of exams and graded assignments. This is a great core class for psych majors!",
    "Please take this class. It's easy to do well, and the material is super interesting. If you are a psych major and don't take this class you are missing out. I would also recommend to people who are looking for a fun lecture--definitely would take this over Intro Psych if I was looking for a fun psych class to try out. Also, don't buy the textbook. Everything is in lecture!",
    "I would recommend this class if you're interested in learning a lot of details\/facts\/diagnostic criteria about the main psychiatric disorders.",
    "So I think this course is going to get bad ratings\/reviews, but you should take it. Here's why. The following are the reasons why people don't like the course.1) There's a facebook group2) Attendance is taken even though it's a 250 person lecture3) Pretty much everything you get from lecture you can get form the book.HOWEVER! In reality the facebook group wasn't bad at all...you had to post ONE article PER month (literally takes 3 minutes). And the attendance policy motivates you to go to class, which then makes you feel good about yourself. And the nice thing about having the overlap is that it is really easy to learn the material (there's a lot since you cover a huge range of mental disorders), AND you don't need to spend hours upon hours reading the textbook (you could probably get away without doing it at all).Basically, this is a really important course with important material, and don't let a few lazy yalies who didn't like the course policy prevent you from taking it.",
    "GREAT class--take it FOR SURE if you're at all interested in psych, or if you want a social science class! Really enjoyed it.",
    "Everything you need to know about abnormal psychology will be taught in this course. It's a great class and I learned so much because we focused on the major concepts rather than the small details. The exams (midterm and final) were fair, book review was well explained, and there was a lot of extra credit to help us out.",
    "Definitely recommend it. The course was clearly meant for a smaller class size, but still worked out to be interesting and engaging",
    "I would definitely recommend it because the material is just so interesting, but the current structure of the class (facebook group, for example) needs a little work.",
    "This class is all about memorizing the different abnormal disorders and their symptoms, make sure this is what you want to learn about before signing up.",
    "Abnormal Psychology is a survey course of different psychological disorders. This is the first year that it was taught by Professor Klemanski, who is a great guy and really understanding. I thought this class was really easy, like unfairly easy.",
    "Definitely recommend it. The subject matter in itself is worth the lecture. The workload is also split up in a way to make sure students do well if they put in consistent effort.",
    "This is a very interesting class and I would recommend it. It will change how you think about the world and your own sanity.",
    "I'd recommend it. I think it's pretty easy to do well. You get to choose which book you read for your book review which is nice, and the midterm\/final is very doable.",
    "Do not take this class if Klemanski is teaching it. You will learn nothing even and be bored, even though the material is interesting. That being said, if you're willing to put up with a semester of frustration, the class has a ridiculous amount of extra credit and you can get an easy A.",
    "I would recommend this course, but it isn't great.",
    "I'm not going to lie, it's not a good course. Take something else as your core requirement and don't waste a credit.",
    "Abnormal psych was a great class, broken down by lecture by the different mental disorders, even covering substance abuse and eating disorders. I would definitely recommend this course. Midterm and final are relatively doable if you study, and professor Klemanski gives you a good study guide",
    "Abnormal Psych was a LOT more work than I was expecting. I took it Cr\/D\/Fail with the option of changing it to a grade as a senior Psych major. Despite doing well in the class I kept it Cr\/D simply due to the unexpected amount of work I found it entailed. The material is interesting, but Prof. Klemanski sometimes gets hung up on small details that make it difficult to distinguish what's actually important. The exams are fairly difficult but the grading is fair. There are a lot of smaller requirements that become annoying. Overall, I would say that Abnormal Psych is fine, but not the best class that the Psychology department offers. Take it if you are looking to go on to clinical psych or need it to fulfill major requirements, but if you're just looking for a psych class there are better ones for sure.",
    "I would recommend this course for any student interested in psychology or understanding the nature of mental disorders. This is an extremely important topic in today's mental health debates, and any student could learn a great deal from the professor.",
    "I really enjoyed the content, but you can learn most of it independently.",
    "This was a fantastic abnormal psych class - it covered all the topics that I think could be hoped to be covered, was a broad survey but also went in-depth on diagnosis, and used a variety of media to teach. It was really great if you're interested in learning about disorders, diagnosis, therapy, possible careers in clinical psych, or the mental healthcare system.",
    "Abnormal psychology is such a great course!!! Not much work outside of a book analysis and two exams (which were not challenging if you looked over the lecture notes) and Prof. Klemansi is a great professor. Yes, he does speak quite quickly but that's only because there's a ton of material to get through and most of the information is on his slides anyway so you don't have to worry about missing anything. The material is incredibly fascinating and pertinent to current discussions about mentally ill people in the media. He incorporates videos into his lectures and is up-to-date on the current events in abnormal psychology. He's also incredibly approachable. There's no reason not to take this class: lectures are great, exams are fine, book analysis is interesting and Prof. Klemanski is really open to feedback from students. Take this class!",
    "I would definitely recommend this course, it is super interesting and not an unmanageable amount of work.",
    "It's in interesting course, but a lot of work\/memorization. Take it if you really want to learn about diagnoses of different disorders",
    "Yes definitely, I learned so much in this class and recommended it to all of my friends.",
    "It is a very interesting class with not too much work. The Facebook group was an annoying but easy way to get participation. David wanted everyone to do well and I think his grading system reflected that. You need to study and work hard to do well, but you learn a lot and it is definitely worth it.",
    "Take it if you need to or if the subject material interests you. The information is pretty cool, but the structure of the course and the lecture make it somewhat aversive.",
    "Overall this is an interesting course though class can be dry at times. There's a lot of material, but if you're interested and put in some effort to learn, the exams are not hard at all- it's just being able to apply your knowledge rather than simply memorizing a bunch of facts.",
    "Overview of mental illnesses. Good class to take if you are interested in the material but material did sometimes feel intuitive or repetitive if you have taken psych classes before.",
    "A gut. I'm not sure how anyone complained about the workload for this class. The final didn't end up being too easy but there was about 10 points extra credit, so actually it was pretty easy. Good if you want to learn how people have defined mental disorders and how to diagnose people under those definitions. Mostly convinced me that those definitions are stupid. Since we didn't learn too much besides those definitions, it wasn't a productive class for me.",
    "Basic overview of psychological disorders. The professor goes WAY too fast; luckily, he posts PowerPoints online. Interesting, reasonably well-organized class, though the exams focus too much on nitpicky details instead of the important stuff.",
    "I enjoyed the course on Abnormal Psychology. Overall the course did what it was supposed to do: give a thorough and broad sweep of the various mental disorders. My only issue with the course was with the final exam, which I felt relied too much on rote memorization rather than the \"application\" that it purported to test. I think Professor Klemanski did a good job going through all of the disorders. Unlike many students, I did not think he spoke too quickly or unclearly. The only thing that I would suggest is better time management of lectures as Professor Klemanski often went overtime.",
    "All of the material you need to know for the exams is present on the lecture slides. It's a straightforward course, and if you keep up with it, you should see good results on your tests.",
    "Yes, the material is very interesting and Klemanski is an incredibly nice guy who is willing to listen and help whenever.",
    "I would definitely recommend PSYC 180, especially for psychology majors. PSYC 110 is a requirement for the course so those non-psychology majors who have taken PSYC 110 should also be able to take it. The course mainly covers the all the different types of mental disorders, their diagnoses and treatment. Prof. Klemanski is a good professor and his lectures well organized and easy to follow. There is overlap between his lectures and the material in the course book but I personally don't mind that. It ends up being good revision. He often shows videos in class and takes attendance or gives out extra credit questions therefore attendance is a must. The grade for the course is based on: a midterm, a final, participation (attendance), facebook group, and a book review. None of the assignments are too difficult and the reading is easy to keep up with.",
    "I would recommend it. The class should become more organized.",
    "Professor Klemanski was a lovely teacher. He cares a lot about his students and spends LOTS of time preparing powerpoint presentations for his students that are concise, visually appealing, and comprehensive.He teachesvery well, posits questions to the class, and engages the large lecture class in dialogue, even though a lot of times, the students are reluctant to answer due to feelings of inadequacy or apathy.Essentially, the class is comparable to reading, memorizing, and understanding the ENTIRE DSM-IV-TR manual of mental pathology disorders. By the time you graduate from the class, you will have been able to accurately diagnose virtually every mental disorder known to man that is diagnosable. (Personality disorders, mood disorders, psychotic disorders, dissociative disorders, eating disorders, childhood disorders, drug-abuse related disorders, old-age disorders, and so much more)This class is SUPER SUPER applicable for life and for intrinsic intellectual satisfaction.Klemanski is super nice, approachable, kind-hearted. He provides students with ample opportunity to succeed via lots of extra credit.I kinda failed his midterm with a B. Then I did all of his extra credit and studied my butt off and actually got a 101% on my final, and ended up with an A.He answers any questions you have in class and encourages you to ask questions. Overall, I must say I learned an exorbitant amount of information in his class. AMAZING class!!!It's a MUST TAKE for anyone who is premed, likes biology, psychology, neuroscience, cognitive science, or clinical psychopathology\/psychophysiology.",
    "This is a really solid and interesting class. You will learn a lot and get a solid foundation in the concepts of abnormal psych. Professor Klemanski is an entertaining and highly competent professor, who makes lecture really fun and interesting to go to. He does talk fairly quickly, but it is totally manageable and you get used to it quickly (plus he posts all the lecture slides). Although it was a huge lecture course, Professor Klemanski did an impressive job making it interactive by balancing out lecture and in-class discussion. The tests are fair and are highly cushioned by TONS of extra credit throughout the semester (like 8 points out of 100). Just a midterm, final, and book review that is easy to get feedback on. A lot of people will undoubtedly complain about this class and the professor, as people in the class were quite whiny throughout the semester... The facebook participation grade was a bit confusing at times, but they fixed it in the end, and I'm sure it will be smoother moving forward. I would definitely recommend this class, especially if you are at all interested in clinical psychology.",
    "I'd recommend it! You go over mental illness like OCD, schizo, PTSD, bipolar disorder, etc.Learned a lot I didnt know before.Lecture was pretty good, mainly reading off powerpoints. not amazing but not bad either.Average\/below average amount of reading.50% of grade is based on midterm\/final (pretty fair, but need to pay attention to details and lot of material if u want an A), 20% on a book review (they clarify what they expect and guide u through it, and the books are good), 15% on simply going to class (they kept attendance), and 15% on posting an article a month on the class facebook page. Plus lots of easy extra credit opportunities. So the breakdown is very generous.I didn't take this CreditD but it seems like a great class to use it on.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. I am still thinking about the things that I learned in the course. I learned so much about the field from this course. It definitely makes me excited to be a psychology major.",
    "It's a run-down of psychiatric disorders and the available treatments, if ever. The best past (or worst part) is when you start mentally diagnosing your friends and family...",
    "The workload isn't that bad (one assignment, a midterm, and a final) and the professor definitely wants you to do well.",
    "This class is well taught and interesting. It is also kind of disturbing, so be aware that it will make you feel uncomfortable (especially the memoirs). That being said, it was valuable to be pushed out of my comfort zone and I would totally recommend the class. It is graded very fairly and is not insanely difficult.",
    "A survey of psychiatric disorders from a clinical perspective. A lot of the course focuses on the criteria for diagnosing each disorder, and exams included case studies where you were asked to diagnose based on symptoms. Although the lectures aren't always thrilling (lots of learning symptoms off of powerpoint slides), it's a great way to see whether you're interested in clinical psychology. There were several guest speakers and a helpful panel on careers in clinical psych at the end.",
    "A good overview of basic abnormal psychology. I would recommend taking it if they change the format of the course. It's pretty easy and enjoyable.",
    "I would recommend it for someone who wants to learn more about mental illnesses and get a taste of clinical psychology",
    "It is a broad overview of various disorders and a great supplement to intro psych if you enjoyed that subsection of the course.",
    "This class is pretty straightforward - lectures with everything you need to know, and a great textbook that tells you the details you need to know. Klemanski is really nice and engaging - and the material, in my opinion, is SUPER interesting and therefore easy to learn. You learn a lot about a lot of different disorders, so sometimes it does feel like we're just skimming the surface. The guest lecturers are great, especially when he brought in people who have personal or family experience with some of the disorders. Exams were easy this semester and he gives a lot of extra credit. The book review we had to write was also not very difficult. I think this was Klemanski's first time teaching Abnormal Psych as a huge lecture, so the grading might be tougher after this semester... He really made it easy for us to do well as long as knew the material, which was great and encouraging, but it might be forced to change.",
    "I would recommend this class to Psychology majors because it covers information that is definitely relevant to clinical psychology and the major in general. I don't know if I would necessarily recommend it to other students. It was not the most engaging lecture and one would probably find other psychology classes more rewarding.",
    "This class is a total GUT! The material is interesting, and there is very minimal work required. If you want an extremely easy Psych class this one is right for you! This being said, I expect the professor to make the class more challenging in the future, so be wary of that.",
    "Great class, not too much outside of class, LOTS OF INFO (to the point where it can be overwhelming), but very interesting material. Definitely recommend.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. It was an interesting class that provides information useful in daily life.",
    "Would only recommend PSYC 180 if the annoying aspects of the class (attendance for huge lectures\/Facebook group) are done away with or improved; would also recommend as a manageable 5th credit. If you're a psych major, you'll probably need to take this class. If you're not a psych major and want to learn about this type of stuff, I think there are other classes that are probably a little more interesting and less cookie-cutter. I hate to say that, but that's the kind of setup you get with huge lecture classes like this.",
    "If you're interested in psychology, take it. It also does a lot to destigmatize mental illnesses which is important, so taking it would give you a better idea about how to go about creating social change.",
    "Really interesting even if you do not usually take psychology classes.",
    "overall, an awesome class; it's straightforward, informative, and fun. just take it and you won't regret it",
    "If you are, or might be, a psych major, then this class is absolutely essential. For everyone else, it's a fun introduction to the topic of mental illness and clinical psychology. Professor Klemanski was assigned to teaching it super last minute, so the organization of the class was a little shaky at first, but it definitely got a LOT better, so I'm sure in future years it will be great from the start. He's a very engaging and fun lecturer, and is really really genuinely interested in helping students do well. The tests are fair, the book review was fun, and there's not too much work. As a psych major, I definitely recommend it, especially for fellow psych majors!!",
    "Yes, really interesting material. Professor Klemanski integrates lectures, speakers, and videos into the class, which keeps things interesting.",
    "Interesting course, but a lot more about diagnosing and treating disorders (i.e. if you're interested in clinical psychology) as opposed to learning about the actual disorders. Not too difficult, but also didn't feel like I got too much out of it that I couldn't have just read from the textbook.",
    "Definitely recommend this course, especially if you are interested in the Psychology major. You thoroughly explore a wide range of disorders, the work load is not overwhelming, and as long as you attend lecture and keep up with the notes and reading, you will have no trouble on the exams or book review report. Very very interesting class!!!",
    "This sounds ridiculous, but I wish the course was more difficult than it was. I love psych, and I love material\/loved the course, but was disappointed at how points were practically thrown at us. It made the class kind of a joke. You're told in advance literally every piece of material you need to know for the two tests (there's one midterm test and one final test -- 25% each), Professor Klemanski hands out extra credit like it's candy, participation and a fb group is worth 30% of the grade, and you have one 8 page book review (20%). Easy to do well in. Never opened the textbook once and finished the final an hour early. Also the final is the last week of classes so that's one less thing to worry about finals week. Prof Klemanski is a great professor and obviously really cares about us students. He speaks very quickly at times and goes through his slides at a ridiculous pace, but when he got feedback from students halfway through the semester telling him this, he readily improved.",
    "I would not recommend this course. It demands that you memorize unnecessary information and rarely enters any interesting realms of debate or discussion.",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone. The workload is minimal but I still learned a lot and really enjoyed the class. Professor Klemanski is great, the subject material is great, the class is just great.",
    "I would recommend it as it's a genuinely interesting class with more than fair grading.",
    "If you're at all looking to get a broad overview of various disorders (without too much in-depth investigation into any one disorder), this class is great! I feel like I've learned a lot and I'm glad I took the course.",
    "Great class! Professor Klemanski is really invested in his students and their enjoyment of it, which is apparent. Interesting material and good to know!",
    "YES. A great class with a great curve and interesting material. Also Klemanaki is extremely understanding and caring, replies to emails wirhin an hour usually.",
    "It's a really interesting course, particularly if you're interested in psychiatry or clinical psychology. All of the lectures are posted online, which is very helpful if you don't get the chance to write down all of the information from class. The tests are fair, plus there are a lot of extra credit opportunities.",
    "I would only recommend this course to people for whom it fills a major requirement.",
    "A lot of work. A lot of information. I'd only take it out of necessity",
    "It's an annoying amount of work to keep track of at times (with the Facebook group\/books\/participation grade), but the material is interesting. At the end of the day, I'd probably not recommend it though. There are better classes out there",
    "I really enjoyed this class. The material is super interesting.",
    "Highly recommend this course. Interesting information and cool guest lectures. Workload is relatively light (posting in Facebook group, midterm, final, book review).",
    "Yes! Abnormal psych is so interesting, and you'll learn about disorders that you may not have known existed. Professor Klemanski can talk quickly, but after a few lectures you (mostly) get used to it. Would recommend for both psych and non-psych majors.",
    "Very interesting class, especially if you're a psychology major. Fair amount of work, but easy grading. Take it!",
    "boring. don't take it.",
    "Don't take this class, unless maybe you're a psych major. Professor Klemanski is incredibly hard to follow, lectures are dry and boring (read straight from the slides). Class drags on forever and you have to go because they take attendance despite the fact that the class is a very full lecture. Tests are unfair and seem intentionally tricky.",
    "I would recommend this as a core class if you need the credit- great and interesting topics!",
    "Psych 180 was really a very easy course. The exams were not difficult, the workload was small, and there were many extra credit questions. That said, the course was not incredibly interesting either. The slides were often almost verbatim from the book. Still not a bad course if you're interested in the topic, though.",
    "I would recommend it if you are interested in the material. But, it is not the most fascinating lecture.",
    "Yes if you want a low stress, interesting class, especially if you are NOT a psych major and want to learn a bit about some fascinating disorders",
    "I would recommend this course if you are interested in clinical psychology and\/or are thinking about becoming a psych major. Otherwise, I couldn't really imagine the information being that interesting to anyone else...it's a little dry in the way that it is presented.",
    "I would recommend PSYC 180 to a fellow student with some reservations. It's a fascinating topic, of course, but Prof. Klemanksi's style of speaking (seriously! he is the absolute fastest talker--to the point where quite a few students felt obligated to say something about it to him!) did detract from the quality of the lecture. That said, he was a really generous and helpful professor, there are a number of AWESOME guest speakers, and the textbook is fine and the extra books are great. Grading is also very fair: you're required to post one topical article a month in a private Facebook group as well as comment on a few articles posted by fellow students, and if you do this you're basically guaranteed a perfect participation grade. There are also abundant opportunities for extra credit!!In short, this is not the most enthralling class you'll take, BUT if you're interested in the material, and maybe if you're looking to do something of a self-study of the material anyway, you'll absolutely enjoy this class (and probably get a good grade).",
    "Really interesting material, and looking at abnormality on a spectrum challenges you to reflect more.Klemanski will learn how to teach this better over time (it was his first year, and an okay start), especially because he very thoughtfully considers feedback.Facebook post requirement worked very poorly - people just did it to get it done for the most part, and little self-motivated discussion (or reflection on others' points with which you were supposed to engage) occurred.Medium- to fast-paced textbook readings, interesting lectures if you paid attention (which took intentionality to do - worthless if you didn't pay attention) both because he tries hard to make it engaging and because the material is really cool, TFs were helpful, tests were fair, book for review was great but review grading was unnecessarily harsh and didn't make a lot of sense (rubric wasn't available ahead of time and still seemed rather arbitrary).Would be a great class to take just because it's interesting or to contribute to a strong foundation for further psychology study.",
    "Shop it and see if you'll like it. It should get better in the future, but it's up to your discretion.",
    "Great material to know. Especially the diagnostic-based approach in psychology, which is very different from most other psych classes.",
    "I would recommend this class. It's really interesting, and Professor Klemanski is very engaging. The work is very manageable, and there are fascinating guest speakers. It made me want to study clinical psychology.",
    "Take this course if you have any interest in psychology. The assignments were fair, the books we read were interesting, and the professor was one of the best I've had at Yale. This course was a really good introduction to clinical psychology.",
    "I would recommend this class, because I think we were the guinea pigs for a new professor. However, I make that recommendation with a slight hesitation, just because I can't know what Prof. Klemanski will do next time around."
