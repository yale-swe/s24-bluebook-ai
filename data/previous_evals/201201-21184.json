    "The entire PoliSci, History, IR, and Global Affairs departments should have been required to take this course. It's actually depressing that there were only six students this semester, because it's not being offered again.",
    "If you really want to know about islam in pakistan, then Take it!",
    "This is a great course that critically evaluates how Islam has played out in India and Pakistan. The subject matter is very accessible though to anyone who's interested about the interplay between religion, politics and socioeconomics in general. Definitely a win.",
    "It's a wonderful overview of Pakistan history\/issues in contemporary Islam. Professor Haroon is knowledgeable, kind, approachable, and she worked very hard to make the seminar experience as engaging and fruitful as possible. All in all, a very satisfying course.",
    "This is a great class. It effectively teaches you pretty much all there is to understand about Islam in Pakistan and does so in a way that really makes you feel as though you are mastering the subject, which is really nice."
