    "This is a must-take if you want to learn more about philosophers!",
    "Take this course as an alternative to an introductory political science survey. The reading list is similar, but your discussion and papers will benefit from the focus on freedom. Really an excellent way to engage with these writings more thoroughly than you would otherwise!",
    "Freedom in Western Political Thought is a great class, and one you should definitely take if you are interested in exploring questions regarding freedom, or simply looking to get an overview of the foundations of political philosophy. Professor Ilhan is also a great professor.Much of the class was devoted to getting an understanding of the texts, and the class does a good job at this. I wanted this, however, as I had not read any of the books on the syllabus (although I have taken several philosophy and political science classes). In fact, I found the class very helpful to explain the foundational ideas of each text and of each school of thought (western liberal tradition and german tradition). This is to say that a lot of the class was devoted to making sure that we would understand the main argument, as well as the texts' subtleties.The class does not discuss freedom as much as one would think. We always touched on freedom in each class and Professor Ilhan discussed freedom at the end of the course. However, each class was devoted more to developing an understanding of each text. Each of the essays concerned freedom in some way, though, which made them hard to write as this had not been too much of an emphasis in the course.Professor Ilhan is an awesome professor. She does a great job in teaching the concepts, she puts in a lot of effort, she gives great feedback on papers to improve your writing and philosophical abilities, and she is just nice."
