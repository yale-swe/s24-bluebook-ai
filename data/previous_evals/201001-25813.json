    "You probably have to anyway, but I would definitely recommend it. Great, fun class.",
    "Amazing class, easy to learn, beautiful language and interesting topics related to italian class. A must take class.",
    "It's just your basic Italian grammar class, and it covers a lot of material thoroughly. I'd absolutely recommend it.",
    "Yes because it allows you to learn a new language while learning a completely new and unique culture.",
    "Italian 120 is a continuation of Italian 110. You finish up the grammar and then begin learning about Italian culture and history. This makes the class very fun because just pure grammar can be difficult at times. However, you begin actually to use what you have learned in the textbook to do research and culture exploration in Italian. I found this a very fulfilling process. I would recommend this class to another student.",
    "Take it! Italy rocks.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. Take it with Anna!",
    "I would definitely recommend Italian 120 while Professoressa Iacovella to another student. As far as intstructors go she is the best, and the class is very managable."
