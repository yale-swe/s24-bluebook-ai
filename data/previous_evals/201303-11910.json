   "comments": [
    "50% of lectures interesting, psets average (1hr)\/(2wks), very light work, best feature about class is meeting fellow science nerds",
    "This course isn't great, but it's not an inconvenience. The section discussions can be pretty enjoyable as well.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone interested in learning and discussing about research that is currently going on at Yale. It's also a great way to meet other freshman who are similarly excited about science.",
    "I would summarize SCIE 198 as a valuable course because of the people, not necessarily the material. I would recommend this course to another student if they want to be involved in research at Yale.",
    "No.",
    "PSE consists of a lecture one week, followed by a discussion on the lecture the following week. There is a problem set due for each lecture, which is usually manageable, but has the occasional question that will require substantial outside research. Most of the lectures were very good; I think it depends on your interest level, though I found most of them engaging. The quality of discussion depends on the section; I had a great section, and we had productive and interesting conversations. It was also a great way to meet other students in science courses. The class also makes you think about what areas you might want to do research in, or possibly even study. Overall, if you are interested in learning about science and research at Yale, this is a good course to take.",
    "The way that Perspectives works is every other week, a distinguished science mind at Yale will give a lecture about their research, and then the next week, you'll meet in a small section to talk about the lecture. The lectures are usually pretty interesting, although the sections can sometimes be less interesting depending on who's leading the sections (they're student led). There's barely any work, just a short problem set every other week. You have a bunch of opportunities to mingle with Yale's top science minds, which is a really cool experience, and if you want to do research at Yale during the summer after your freshman year, Perspectives is probably the best route to get funding and get set up with a lab.",
    "This class only gives one lecture on each topic, which makes it very shallow and I'd say bland. However, there is ridiculously little work (one p-set every other week and one paper for both semesters) and you do gain some insight into various research topics.",
    "A survey of many scientific issues. This helped me narrow down what I don't want to do. I would recommend it as a way of seeing what it's really like to be involved in hard lab sciences.",
    "YES!",
    "A Yale version of science (i.e. heavily biased towards pure sciences\/bio). I loved the people and the class gives you great incentive to do research, but the lectures were definitely not what I expected. If you're into Mech E, EE, materials, etc, you might not feel satisfied with this class.",
    "You're probably going to read a lot of negative comments about this class. Truth is, it's not that bad. Lectures are fairly interesting and discussions can be fun. You won't explore any topics in any particular depth, but it's still pretty cool to learn about bio\/chem\/physics topics in one course.",
    "A bit disappointing, honestly. The biweekly psets were not engaging or informative, and just required mundane out-of-class work that yielded few answers. They obscured the science. (Except for the fractal geometry one, which was fun.)Discussion section was rather pleasant, depending on who's in it and who your leaders are. Lectures are alright enough.",
    "PSE is a great way to learn about current research conducted by professors, and it emphasizes student discussion.",
    "Perspectives on Science and Engineering is a great course! You should take it if you're interested in hearing different lectures and then having discussions about them in small groups. It's a nice class to have on a Friday. I really enjoy it!",
    "Lectures every other week and discussion sections on the preceding lecture in the intervening weeks. There are homework sets following each lecture that vary in quality and relevance. Discussion can be very good depending on how much effort you are willing to put in. Homework can be helpful in understanding the material, but it can also just be a total pain to complete since the answers or even ways of getting to the answer aren't in the presentation itself. Your experience depends on how much effort you are willing to expend.",
    "Perspectives is not really what you expect; over the summer when you apply, you think you're going to meet a bunch of different professors and learn which lab you want to work in; in reality, you only find out about 5 different professors in the first semester and 5 in the second, but their research is definitely mindblowing. Don't expect to find what lab you're going to work in, but do expect to learn about cutting-edge research in every aspect of science, with little work involved.",
    "I am mixed about whether I recommend this class. The class definitely provides an overview of the various fields that scientists are pursuing at Yale, and if you are lucky enough to have a good section, discussions can be enlightening and very engaging. However, lectures are often boring, especially when materials flies over your head, and the class can sometimes feel like an unnecessary weight on your Friday afternoon. Luckily, for first semester, work is minimal albeit one presentation that students must do per semester, giving discussion section a hit-or-miss quality.If you truly have an interest in all the realms of science and are trying to find ways to fill your schedule, this class is a good choice. Otherwise shop it, and decide from there.",
    "PSE is a great class especially if you don't know what field of science to go into. It does an excellent job of giving a comprehensive view of different fields of science. There is also not a huge work load.",
    "This course provides an excellent survey of research in various fields of science. Every other week a Yale scientist provides a presentation of the research he\/she is involved with. I would definitelyrecommend this course to anyone who is interested in science in general and might be unsure of what specific field to pursue.",
    "A series of lectures and discussions on a variety of topics which professors do their research on.I would recommend this course to a student who has an extra 0.5 credit they need to fill with something and already has a heavy course load. Otherwise, I think the enrichment from this course could be obtained from other sources (extracurriculars, talking to your other professors about their work, etc).",
    "PSE is a good class that you should take if you are interested in hearing about and discussing others' research. The lecture weeks can sometimes be a little dry, but the discussions are usually good since there is such a wide range of perspectives among all the students. The problem sets are manageable, and since they are only due every other week, the workload is manageable.",
    "You get to see some great lectures and then maybe (or maybe not) have a meaningful discussion about them. It's a cool way to get interested in new types of research, but don't expect the experience to be life-changing. Quality of the class depends heavily on the students in your discussion section. Overall, it's a neat opportunity and not much work.",
    "Amazing course. Eye-opening and helps you explore many science topics. Get to meet lots of professors and it's easy to get a lab position from PSE. Finally, it's a great environment to be around so many motivated people.",
    "Perspectives is a great class for teaching you about various topics in science that you probably would not be exposed to until much later, if at all (unless you choose to specialize in it). Sometimes the lectures are a bit over your head, but they're generally pretty interesting nonetheless.",
    "PSE provides a bit of insight into unique topics, from exoplanets to fractals. While I enjoyed all of the lectures, discussion sections (lasting 1 hr 30 mins) can be monotonous. Psets are generally reasonable, though can be difficult for some topics - especially after only a single lecture on the material!",
    "The homework was really challenging and took up many hours per homework. You will learn a lot and everything will be clarified in the discussion sections, but the lectures are very difficult to understand.",
    "PSE is great for anyone who loves science and want to get a taste for everything. With topics ranging from fractal geometry to the evolution of beauty, you really can't go wrong",
    "My summary of Perspectives would be \"It's like DS but for science.\" I would then go on to explain that Perspectives is a lecture course where guest speakers who are experts in their field come to talk about their field of science. I would definitely recommend this to other students, especially those who are interested in science but do not exactly know which area.",
    "Summary:PSE is a class that allows students to explore many different fields of science in greater depth. Every two weeks, a different professor comes in to lecture about his or her research, and every other week, students convene in discussion groups to discuss the previous week's lecture. As a result, students are offered glimpses of each professor's research, and can get a better idea of what research in each particular field looks like.I would recommend SCIE 198 01 to any student who has not yet committed absolutely to a particular discipline of science, because it gives a greater understanding of different fields that students can potentially choose to enter.",
    "The lectures are very interesting and fun to listen to, but the discussion sessions are not. They are almost always derailed and (at least in my section) we even ended up trying to debate facts a few times. It was frustrating to say the least. Overall, the course isn't a lot of work, but you will probably not look forward to your Friday afternoons, at least on discussion weeks.",
    "This class is sometimes interesting, sometimes not. If you like hearing different lectures and having discussions, you might as well take this class-it's not a lot of work. Otherwise you're not missing much by not taking this class either.",
    "Low course load, but you must have a very strong interest in the natural sciences to enjoy this class. Discussion sections can be very contrived, so beware. Would not recommend.",
    "I recommend PSE to someone who veritably wants to explore many different areas of science. However, for someone just looking into it for kicks and giggles, I don't think the positive aspects outweigh the negative. The biweekly assignments are sometimes overly difficult, especially considering we have just an hour-and-a-half introduction to the material. The discussion sections, while a good idea, are often just very awkward, as I feel most of the lectures do not warrant a whole hour-and-a-half long discussion. However, the lectures are truly intriguing and rewarding for someone who has an honest interest in knowledge.",
    "A chance to open upa share your thoughts on many different fields of science. Although, your enjoyment in the course relies heavily on the fact that you get an energetic and collaborative discussion section.",
    "I think you should take it since it's not too much work, and you gain valuable insight about the kinds of research going on at Yale."
