   "comments": [
    "The course is an opportunity to learn a lot in a single semester, and has a very reasonable workload. As with learning foreign languages more generally, it is what you put into it. I would definitely recommend it.",
    "This is not a standard language course: students thinking they'll be doing any kind of speech training will be surprised to find that that's not the case, although the professor does not limit class to talking about classic literary or historical texts by any means. It's a great course, but it's also important not to have illusions about how well you'll be able to deal with conversational Spanish after the course; it really does not prepare one to produce Spanish-language phrases at all.",
    "The class moves swiftly and practice on one's own is imperative for success. I would recommend it if you need to brush up on existing skills, but I'm not certain that one can be successful with absolutely no background in Spanish."

   "comments": [
    "I definitely plan to use what I learned in SPAN 504 in future research. It was big first step in accessing a whole new body of primary sources and secondary scholarship.",
    "I am an undergraduate who wrote his senior thesis on Julio Cort\u00c3\u00a1zar's Rayuela in the Spring semester. Auditing and subsequently taking this course for credit massively improved my ability to work with the original text of the novel I was writing on, and essentially saved my thesis, so I am very glad that I took the course.",
    "Though I rarely work from sources in Spanish, I am certain that in the cases where I need to I will have much better results."
