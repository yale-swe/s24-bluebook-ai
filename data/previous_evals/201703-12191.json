    "I learned Russian. I walked in not being able to say even \"I study at Yale\" and now I can carry a good conversation, read short stories, listen to music, and watch videos.",
    "My Russian went from almost zero to decent conversation.",
    "You will quickly learn the root grammatical and semantic constructions of Russian. Russian is very different than English and most other west European languages so be prepared for a new grammar.",
    "I gained an understanding of the fundamentals of Russian grammar, basic conversational skills, and a taste of the beautiful complexity of the language.",
    "I gained a good understands of the basics of russian grammar and vocabulary.",
    "I learned how to read, write, and begin to speak in Russian.",
    "I got very good instruction on basic reading, writing, and speaking skills in Russian."

   "comments": [
    "Very strong course. Good pace.",
    "The strength of this course is the teaching. Prof. Muravnik and our TA Svetlana were incredible and very willing to engage with us. Constanine is very knowledgeable and wonderful at language teaching. Really no cons here.",
    "Strengths: Constantine is an expert at explaining difficult grammar topics in a way that is easy to understand. The pace of the class is quite fast, so we covered a broad scope of the Russian language in just a semester. When our teaching fellow led the class, it was fun to do the exercises that she prepared herself (games, Soviet memes, conversation topics). Weaknesses: The weekly schedule became pretty repetitive after a month or so, and we could see there wasnt the best communication between the instructor and the teaching fellow. Most of class ended up being either a casual Q&A session about grammar points we didnt get from the homework, or simply going over the exercises in the textbook. I wish we had more opportunities for reading, writing, and speaking, not just doing textbook exercises.",
    "This course is taught very well. The small class size lead to a lot of verbal practice that really helped to improve speaking and listening skills. A defined list of vocabulary for the term would have been helpful.",
    "A strength of the course is the weekly tests. Having a test once a week meant that students really had to keep up with the content matter, especially considering there were two semesters of content to cover. This kept me from getting behind. Receiving graded homework back is an incredible resource because it revolves if we are struggling with a particular topic from the unit before being tested on the material. At times, homework assignments are returned after the unit, though, which might be a weakness because it takes away that resource from studying."

    "Yes.",
    "Definitely if you are good at languages or have experience with Slavic langauges. This was amazing.",
    "Yes! If you want to learn Russian, take this intensive course. Constantine and your TA will help you along the way and you will learn Russian in no time.",
    "You get from this course what you put into it. If you are sure you want to take Russian, then its worth the time and effort to take this class and build a strong foundation for your Russian studies in the future. If you are on the fence about taking Russian, this might not be the best class for you because you still wont be able to speak very much Russian after a semester.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course. It is by far the best way to learn a language.",
    "Definitely recommend this class. The course is organized in a way that makes learning Russian almost effortless, and the instructors are awesome!",
    "I would most definitely recommend this course to another student because it is amazing how much Russian we were able to learn in a single semester, and the program is well run.",
    "Yes, the Russian language professors and instructors are amazing at their jobs."
