    "A thorough understanding of the economics of poverty alleviation, particularly its social, political, and cultural groundings.",
    "I learned a lot about experimental design and the value of randomization in determining impact of a program.",
    "Critical thinking about the benefits of RCT and other methods of evaluating programs using data.",
    "This class really makes you think about the world in a different way, as it raises awareness about NGOs and poverty. It also helps you so much in understanding social research.",
    "You learn how to think about development economics and behavioral economics.",
    "By far one of the most interesting economics classes I have taken at Yale so far. Learned the importance of evaluating NGOs and how to evaluate them through RCTs and other methods.",
    "I learned how to make a proper evaluation and how to identify different explanations to people's behavior. This class made me question everything that I read now in NGOs websites and gave me the ability of finding alternative explanations other than the obvious ones for certain change in behavior. It gave me perspective on how poverty should be address and how developed and developing countries are very different to begin with.",
    "How to evaluate non-profit projects, their theory of change\/feasibility, and how to run an RCT",
    "I learned about how to design RCTs to obtain good evidence of a program's impact.",
    "None. I took GLBL 225: Approaches to International Development and got a better and more comprehensive introduction to international development methods and research.",
    "I learned how to effectively analyze a large amount of data and material to synthesize a paper. I actually thought this was better than any english or otherwise writing class I have taken for learning how to effectively communicate an idea.",
    "I learned how to evaluate NGOs, analyze RCTs, determine how to evaluate data, find market failures, and more.",
    "A solid foundation in the critical thinking skills necessary to evaluate development programs and organizations. Knowledge of the experimental methods used to evaluate development programs and organizations.",
    "Learned how to rigorously conduct and evaluate RCTs in a variety of settings for the purposes of improving various outcomes for the impoverished",
    "It was really helpful in exploring the present research on poverty alleviation and how to properly evaluate these measures.",
    "This class is too easy for its own good. As it currently is organized it should be marketed as a introductory class instead of a 300 level class.",
    "You learn a lot about RCTs, randomized evaluation, and their application in the field.",
    "I think this was one of the most practical and useful classes I've taken at Yale. I learned how to diagnose a problem (market failure), develop a solution (theory of change) and then evaluate whether the solution solved the problem."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Dean Karlan is a professor who succeeds both as a professor and a researcher--in other words, there are many professors here who have done extraordinary career work but fail to translate it to teachable moments. Karlan is not like that. He integrates anecdote with scholarly material for a very well rounded class. Unfortunately, it can sometimes get TOO anecdotal, and students become more reliant on the syllabus optional readings for a firm understanding of the topics expressed in class.",
    "The lectures are interesting but repetitive. The reading is incredibly tedious and I doubt anyone in the class read more than a few days in the semester. More, smaller assignments and less reading might be necessary to increase engagement.",
    "The class covers a lot of material but it is sometimes redundant and the lecture notes are pretty bad, but if you focus in class it is so interesting you remember most of it.",
    "The lectures lack substance. The first ten lectures were really interesting, but after that they just became incredibly dry and repetitive.",
    "Great class. No need for improvement. I would suggest just having papers and no final.",
    "I wish this class was smaller to have more discussion and engagement with the professor. The content is terrific and very interesting. The professor makes the lecture very interesting and the readings are great as well.",
    "Lectures should focus more on theory and conceptual issues and have a lesser focus on individual case studies.",
    "A strength of this course is that it allows you to revise papers for a new grade. This was important to me not because it helped my grade, but because I learned more from it. Usually when I get a paper back, I barely look at the comments, so I don't improve much from them, but rewriting papers made me look at my TA's feedback and internalize their lessons more.",
    "Strengths are that you don't have to go to class to do well in the class.",
    "I think a huge strength was the clarity of assignments and the expectations.",
    "The lecture format made it hard to be super engaged in the class. However, material was interesting and Karlan is very knowledgable and a leader in the field.",
    "This course, by focusing on current economic research and case studies of development programs, made it clear how economics manifests itself in the real world. It managed to make the material accessible, informative, and relevant.",
    "Strengths - Extremely interesting content and readings - highly accomplished professor - very forgiving grading; you can resubmit assignments which also really encourages you to learn from your mistakes - sample paper given for each assignment facilitates learning Weaknesses - lecture slides are disorganised - could have more sample papers from previous years or from this year, after each assignment is graded to allow us to learn more from each other",
    "Weaknesses: got very repetitive by the end of the semester, slides could be unclear at times Strengths: made sure we had a good understanding of the most important concepts",
    "Strengths: - Very strong reading list - Lectures clear and insightful--complemented the readings well - Good combination of theory and practice: explanation of econometrics in the beginning of course extremely sharp - Great amount of material on the limitations\/unsuitability of RCTs: this is just as much an area where Prof. Karlan's expertise is valuable Weaknesses: - I wish we dove deeper into the \"theory\" of RCTs - It was remarkable that we had three papers and a final! Seemed like a lot.",
    "The content of the class is very interesting and I think the structure of the assignments (papers, in class essay, final) is good. However, I wish there was more guidance and explanation of the assignments. The prompts can be a little vague."

   "comments": [
    "Absolutely recommend. Had little understanding of the course topic before enrolling and have come out of it with a far better grasp of fundamental economic applications. Take if you are looking for a writing\/reading-heavy economics course (comparable to American Economic History) that will allow you to understand the economics through a palatable lens. Reading volume is a bit inconsistent week-to-week but very helpful. Writing assignments build up in demand over the semester but, if you seek out the help of your TA, it is very easy to do well on.",
    "Great class if you're looking for a writing credit that isn't an english class. Lectures were pretty interesting and the papers were all direct applications of what you learned in class to a poverty alleviation program.",
    "If you want to take an Econ credit that is low work but low learning, take this. Horrible amounts of reading, but largely unnecessary as well.",
    "Great wr credit and an interesting class in general, definitely recommend especially if you are an econ major.",
    "Not really, I am sure there are better classes out there. If you're an econ major looking for an easy WR, take it I guess.",
    "A must take econ class. You learn so much about evaluating NGOs. Low workload with three short papers (one in class) and a final. Every paper you have a chance to rewrite for a 10\/10. Easy writing credit!",
    "Yes. It is an excellent course in development economics that gives you a peek into the work that has been done in developing countries. It makes you understand basic issues in a different way and it gives you the ability of finding alternative explanations.",
    "Yes if interested in the topic, although this class has a stronger focus on running particular RCTs and not as much of a focus on the theory around poverty alleviation (other classes on that).",
    "I would recommend this course if you're interested in development economics. The first part of the course focuses on designing solid RCTs to get good evidence of a program's impact, and the second part of the course provides evidence regarding specific programs. The reading was very interesting, and Dean Karlan is a good lecturer. I enjoyed being in the class, and it made me think more deeply about program impact.",
    "No. Try to take GLBL 225 instead if you're interested in the content. If you want a writing credit, I'd recommend doing a seminar of some sort that actually can engage you.",
    "Definitely pretty interesting. Take if you are interested in developmental econ and how to evaluate NGOs.",
    "Yes! This is a great class for both enjoyment and workload. I genuinely enjoyed writing the papers, and I think the class is something you will take with you your entire life for intrigue.",
    "Definitely. Interesting material, fair grading, and not too much work.",
    "For any student interested in development, this course is a must take. Beyond that, however, the information would be useful to any student that plans to donate to charities or think about evaluations critically.",
    "Yes, but only if you're really interested in the topic",
    "Yes!",
    "Great writing credit for Econ majors. Not too much work and interesting material.",
    "Yes, I would. It's a fascinating Econ elective, not too labour intensive and really interesting material.",
    "I would strongly recommend this course to anyone interested in development and poverty alleviation. Whether they fascinate you or not, RCTs are such a valuable tool in development it is worthwhile trying to gain a strong familiarity with the literature. This class will provide a student with the skills to understand, critique and contextualize work in a fairly dominant branch of development economics today.",
    "If you want an easy last class, go for it. But don't expect to learn much if you have an existing knowledge of economics or development.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone interested in learning more about impact evaluation or economics in non-industrialized parts of the world. Professor Karlan is an expert in an emerging field, and through this course, you get a solid introduction to that field.",
    "This is a great course for Econ majors, especially if you are burned out from all the psets in intermediate micro\/macro.",
    "To be honest, the main reason I decided to take this course is because it fulfills both Econ and WR credits. But looking back at the entire semester, I left with a very positive overall impression of the course. Even though some of the readings and lectures could get a bit too technical, with a lot of focus on experimental approach and randomized trial design, I found the material to be very interesting. Professor Karlan is one of the world's experts in the areas and any shortcomings of the course were made up for by the opportunity to listen to his experience with NGO interventions and the way of thinking in experimental design. The workload for this course is very reasonable and all of the NGO evaluation assignments and pretty straightforward and nicely fit into the flow of the material covered in lecture."
