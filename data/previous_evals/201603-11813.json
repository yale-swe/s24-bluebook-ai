   "comments": [
    "Obviously we learned about Greek history from the Minoans to the rise of Phillip II, but more importantly we were taught to be able to view history in a different way, viewing different perspectives and see the recurring themes. Professor Lamont helped illuminate Thucydides words that history is a possession for all time. I took Ancient Greek history because I find it interesting, but Professor Lamont made me realize how relevant the topic is even today with its themes repeating themselves over and over again.",
    "In addition to learning a substantial amount about Ancient Greek History, I also better prepared myself for speaking in a formal setting in a debate format and worked to strongly enhance my writing and arguments.",
    "This class gave a good prospect of the overall changes within Ancient Greece and provided a big picture point of view. Very helpful!!",
    "This class taught me to think about the Western world and our foundations within a classical space. Because of Professor Lamont's lectures and additional practice within section, I learned how to find historical patterns within our own democracies of modern times in order to better understand the fundamental philosophies upon which our globalized world is built. I was able to better draw upon my political knowledge of today to see its counterparts throughout ancient Greek history. This class definitely taught me how to think not only about the material but also how this material can relate to the world around me!",
    "In this course, I gained an incredibly comprehensive knowledge of the Ancient Greek world, from the Minoans to the death of Philip II of Macedon in 336. I was actually amazed how much incredibly interesting information Professor Lamont successfully managed to cram into the course - the rate of information she managed to include in the course was literally two to three times the amount I learned in other history lecture classes. In particular, I gained a really solid understanding of Ancient Greek political, diplomatic, and military history. Emphasis on these types of history definitely meant that we were forced to focus less on economic, social, cultural, or religious history, but I think that that was ok and was necessary in order to comprehensively address the political, diplomatic, and military history of Ancient Greece - one cannot comprehensively cover all types of history after all, and what Professor Lamont managed to do was remarkable!",
    "I learned truly a lot about Greek history. Not only that, but I am now able to better comprehend and understand just how important history is. I am now able to appreciate history better because at the beginning of the course we learn very little of the Minoans and Mycenaeans because they never kept records nor wrote history, thus we don't have much information on them.",
    "I learned so much fascinating information about ancient Greece.",
    "I learned a great deal about ancient Greek society, which was an area where I wasn't too familiar with. Ancient Greece is iconic for so many reasons, and Professor Lamont helped us gain an appreciation for it.",
    "This course covered a lot of material fairly effectively; I definitely learned a lot about Greek history that I felt necessary to complete my background as a classics major.",
    "This course provided a thorough, comprehensive survey of Greek history, with special focus on primary sources. There was a strong emphasis on ability to critically analyze primary sources in addition to supplementing historical knowledge with secondary scholarly sources.",
    "This course provided a great background to Greek history. I gained insight into the motivations and biases of our sources, namely Herodotus and Thucydides, and how these might have impacted our understanding of Greek history. Moreover, I feel I better understand the Peloponnesian Wars, especially their motivations and events."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "All of the material was well explained and covered; however, more writing could have been beneficial, leading to more interaction with the sources and works. Best part of the class was the paper assessing a claim about the Athenian empire. More work like that or having that essay be larger\/more important would have been nice.",
    "The material and lectures were very engaging. Professor Lamont did a perfect job of explaining the movement of history between time periods and events and perfectly captured an optimal learning environment in her class. The visuals and power points were also very helpful and she spoke very clearly.",
    "Taught really well and interactive. Amazing teacher and engaging material.",
    "This class was incredible. Especially for an introductory class, Professor Lamont made sure that every student was engaged and learning in their best way. She reinforced the material from the readings in lecture and was able to throw in other fun stories from history to keep everybody interested. Professor Lamont is a dynamic lecturer which made this class so much fun to be in! I thought adding section to the lecture was crucial in being able to engage with lecture at a deeper level! I wish that there was a larger paper in this class because Professor Lamont brought up so many topics that I think would have been extremely enjoyable to write about!",
    "This course really only has strengths, no weaknesses. I frankly can't even do justice to this tremendous course in a short evaluation. Professor Lamont is brilliant and energetic; she clearly loves what she teaches about, and that enthusiasm rubbed off on me and the other students. My teaching assistant Kevin is also incredibly bright and was kind of a humble, clever goofball in section, which made sections very enjoyable. Perhaps what I enjoyed most about the course was its content though - the textbook was incredibly comprehensive, and I loved having the opportunity to read excerpts from Herodotus and Thucydides to supplement the textbook, along with about ten Plutarchian biographies and numerous other supplementary primary and secondary sources. And then lectures were just amazing - I sat there interested in almost everything we learned, and several times thought to myself how lucky I was to be in this class. The class had no weaknesses that I can think of!",
    "The strengths are the variety of sources plus the two TF's were very good and helpful in complementing what Professor Lamont taught in lecture. I can't really think of any weaknesses.",
    "I very much enjoyed this course. It was very well taught by both Professor Lamont and my Teaching Fellow Zach. The readings were very interesting and informative. I liked virtually every aspect of this course.",
    "The course itself was very interesting, and covered a wide range of material. It was especially helpful as a Latin-focused Classics major to round out my understanding of the classical world.",
    "The strength of this course was in giving a detailed account of the major political and military events in Greek history. The readings and lectures were both very engaging. A weakness was a lack of sources on culture and the role of women.",
    "I think the strengths were interesting subject material, methodical and chronological instruction, and engaging sections. The weaknesses might have been a slow start, both because of general lack of sources for Minoan and Mycenaean Greece and due to a certain repetitiveness between lectures. Speeding up the first portion might allow more coverage of the later, more detailed periods."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "Yes! Professor Lamont is extremely nice and engaging. The readings were very doable, just the right length to provide understanding without becoming redundant. Half way through the semester the urge to nap found me in everyone of my classes besides this one. Every single lecture was interesting.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student if they were interested in studying history. The time period is very interesting and there are many parallels that can be drawn to the modern day.",
    "Take it! Provides a good overall background of Ancient Greek history!",
    "This class was INCREDIBLE! I know that Professor Lamont was here for this year, but I wish she could stay forever. Professor Lamont made the material interesting and fun, and the readings never felt overwhelming (though there was always a chunk to read every night). Section was extremely helpful, and both of the TF's were nice. There are only small assignments and a midterm and a final which makes the class extremely accessible to anybody that wants to take it! I would highly recommend this class to anybody that wants a comprehensive overview of the Ancient Greek world in which our own modern democracies are built from! Professor Lamont made the course material interdisciplinary which really helped me better understand many of the international problems of the world today!",
    "I would highly highly highly recommend this class to another student, no matter what he or she is studying, but especially if he or she is interested in history, ancient history, or international relations. I can't even put into words how incredible this course was. Professor Lamont is brilliant and enthusiastic, and her love for and fascination with Ancient Greece is visibly manifest when she lectures, and that enthusiasm is contagious and rubs off on all the students. My TA Kevin is very bright and knowledgeable, along with being very kind, humble, and funny, all qualities I value tremendously. The content of the class was simply illuminating, and I was somehow pretty much never bored during lecture or while doing the readings. It was easily one of my favorite classes I've ever taken at Yale. Frankly, this semester was by far my hardest thus far at Yale, and looking forward to the lectures and readings for this class was actually one of the main things that got me through it. I will really, really miss this class.",
    "I would, I really enjoy history and I am particularly interested in Greek and Roman history and I think this class really helped me better understand Greek culture and history. It really enlarged my knowledge about ancient Greece and other neighboring countries in that era.",
    "I loved Professor Lamont and thought she did a great job in lecture. It was a very enjoyable class, and I would definitely recommend taking this course for anyone interested in ancient Greek history.",
    "Yes I would absolutely recommend this course. It is very well taught by both Professor Lamont and the Teaching Fellows. This history of Ancient Greece is so very intricate and interesting, and this course made the process of learning it very enjoyable.",
    "As this is an introductory class, I would recommend this course to someone who has little knowledge of Greek History. As it counts as one Classics Major requirement, I would definitely recommend it be taken in freshman or sophomore year.",
    "A necessary background for students of Classics and Classical Civilizations!",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone looking to pursue a classics or history major. Understanding ancient Greece is key to understanding Roman and western history."
