    "Take this class if you want to take an interesting seminar that does a lot of extremely sort of random things",
    "The Grid is one of those classes that makes you see the world in a new way. The readings are extremely worthwhile and while the class struggled a bit with organization, it was one of my favorites. It was a perfect example of interdisciplinary studies actually working extremely well.",
    "The course was an interesting examination into different manifestations of the grid. If you have an open mind and want are interested in this topic, it was a fantastic class that should not be overlooked.",
    "Absolutely amazing class. It was such a mind-blowing semester with HUMS 304. Since it is heavily interdisciplinary (in a beautiful and inspiring way too), this is the kind of class that would make anyone interested. (I'm a STEM major but this was my favorite class of the semester! *good distributional req. credit alert*) Not to mention, the load is decent and the requirements were nice. Throughout the semester, whenever people asked me about this class, or saw what I did and read in this class, they were all more or less in disbelief. This is a class that one must take. No spoilers, but people in this class have worked on stuff like strange architecture, comparisons of computer languages, and even dynamic origami!",
    "Very experimental and interdisciplinary class that covered everything from urban planning to architecture to statecraft to literature to programming. Kind of all over the place, but I learned about a lot of cool thinkers and movements I had never heard of.",
    "This was a delightful course that could only have existed at Yale. If you're interested in the interdisciplinary pursuit of the intersection of arts, design, culture, and technology; this seminar exposes you to a wide breadth of readings and people interested in similar fields."
