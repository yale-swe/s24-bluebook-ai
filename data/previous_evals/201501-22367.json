   "comments": [
    "Absolutely recommend taking Italian. Very straight-forward and interesting, especially for students who took other romance languages in high school.",
    "Well if you took ITAL 110, you don't have a choice. Exempting this, I would say take it, especially if you already speak Spanish. Not because it'll make it easier (although it will), but because if you have an interest in the southern peripheral countries of the EU (so I guess what I'm saying applies particularly to Spaniards) it's a really fun and interactive way to learn more and exercise your language learning skills.",
    "ITAL 120 is a very fun course to take. It is a continuation of ITAL 110 (L1), so if you are not placed into L2 or above, definitely start with ITAL 110. You learn a lot of the Italian Language to the point where you can probably carry on a good conversation with a native speaker. If you want to learn a language, Italian is a relatively easy one to learn, and there are so many great professors in the course to teach the material to you in an easy and effective way. I highly recommend this class to every student at Yale.",
    "Excellent class to build on the first semester's foundation.",
    "A great class. Giulia is talented, supportive instructor who really wants to help her students. I highly recommend the Italian department!",
    "Take it!!! You'll love the language, especially if you have any experience with a romance language. The class itself is very fast-paced, but it is very rewarding at the end of the course when you see the results and how far you've come since you started. You honestly come out of this course learning something and be able to speak a good amount of Italian.",
    "This is a great class. Definitely take it with Giulia. She's fantastic. Though fast-paced, the material is pretty easy to understand and the textbook very comprehensive. There is a lot of written work, but if you put in the time you will gain a great understanding of the language and do well.",
    "I would definitely recommend Italian to anyone looking for a new and exciting language to try. The Italian department is extremely helpful and they make learning the language a blast. All of the instructors are kind and enthusiastic, making for a comfortable classroom environment even with the full-immersion teaching style."
