   "comments": [
    "I would recommend the class, but be aware that it is more of a combination of food and British history than strictly food. Hopefully in the future the classes will be more discussion-based than lectures, but overall I found it to be a fascinating course and really enjoyed writing my final paper (you can pick any topic within reason).",
    "Great class - take it!",
    "Wonderful and eccentric. You get to learn kooky facts about Britain and analyze a different side of history. It's a relaxed class, except for the 20-page paper, which is kind of fun to research too.",
    "I would recommend it as long as the student understood what they were going into, and took it as a history class rather than a food class.",
    "It was also too much work. You just have readings every week. If you know what you might like to write on for the final paper, start early, so you can get advice. It was really an interesting and different course. If you like food it's perfect. If you are not a history major it is also approachable and doable.",
    "Different angle to studying food history. In regards to British Cuisine, everything is covered from: urbanization, the technological age, social classes, medieval hierarchies, food as societal rank, globalization, etc. I've never taken a British history class before, but this was a great way to become introduced to it.",
    "I would recommend this class if you want to take a class about English food, not if you want to take an English history class that uses food to trace the path of English history."
