   "comments": [
    "It can be a lot of work, but if you like French, you'll like the class.French books and films tend to be full of depressing stories, and they're always a little melodramatic and profoundly emo.But I loved them. ;D If you like that kind of thing, take it I guess.",
    "If you want to consolidate your French grammar and get some practice for your oral French, do it. The reading in the latter half of the semester, specially when we get to the book Un Sac de Billes, could be pretty intense: You are expected to spend about 3 hours on French every day.",
    "This course improved my French very little and, on the whole, seemed to be poorly conceived and structured. Most of class time went to studying minute and fairly trivial points of grammar and doing endless practice worksheets to little effect. (I didn't take French 130, but I get the impression that it's the same as in that class.) The vocabulary is haphazard and unthematic, making it more difficult to learn, and seemingly arbitrary. Generally, the course lacked focus and had no means of cultivating an intuitive grasp of the language, only temporary knowledge of unconnected grammatical minutiae and usually irrelevant vocabulary. I would not take this class unless it is necessary; if you want to learn French that badly, study a grammar with vocabulary on your own. That at least will be a coherent approach. That said, Madame Duval is a thorough teacher and the faults of the class are its own, not hers, so if you must take it then I would recommend her section.",
    "This course has a lot of reading and grammar review. It's a good review of things brushed over in high school courses (le subjonctif, les pronoms relatifs, etc.) , with fairly challenging and interesting readings to help. The essays aren't terribly difficult, and many of the topics are legitimately interesting. There's not too much of a focus on culture or France today and almost all of the readings are tragic, but the course is overall very solid. Mme Duval is a great teacher; she does a good job explaining and is very approachable and understanding.",
    "Yes, felt like I improved but can't say it was the highlight of my day.",
    "The course is a reading-focused course. You first read short stories from the textbook Diversit\u00e9, what I'd say is the easy part of the course, and then Andr\u00e9 Gide's \"Symphonie Pastorale\" and Joseph Joffo's \"Sac de Billes\". I enjoyed both books immensely, and most short stories were pretty good. Each reading also accompanies vocab and comprehension exercises.Besides that, there's grammar (easy!) and written assignments (hard hard hard). It's an interesting class, especially with the right people.Tests involve dictations, grammar (biggest part), passage identifications (listening), and a spoken response (hardest part).I wholeheartedly recommend the course if you've been placed in it.",
    "Formidable!",
    "Not unless you need it. There was a lot of work, most of it not well-defined, and the class discussions were usually kind of weak. Try to find a different professor if you can -- Mme. Duval means well, but she corrects pretty overzealously."
