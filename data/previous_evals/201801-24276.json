    "It was a good complementary class to the first semester CPE class. It went deeper into the models and the maths, allowing me to get to a better understanding of how PE models are built and analyzed.",
    "Knowledge: A great deal of comparative political economy Skills: Reading long\/complex formal CPE models",
    "One of the best social science classes I have taken at Yale. I learned so many concepts\/theories\/models of political economy, and we gained a lot of what the research process is like for academic political economists.",
    "I learned about dynamic game theory, recent papers in comparative political economy, and common critiques of formal theory models. I also learned more about the field of state capacity."

   "question_id": "GS403",
   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The course would benefit from a visual support (slides, etc.). It would make it easier to follow where we are in the paper and the maths we are dealing with.",
    "Strengths: Broad overview of formal CPE. Lots of content covered. Weakness: Sparse feedback (because the grade is almost entirely based on a final paper)",
    "Strengths: great content, good explanations of complex issues, key papers in the field discussed There weren't any weaknesses in particular, but I imagine the class will only get stronger if Professor Vindigni teaches it again.",
    "The papers selected for discussion were excellent. I also enjoyed are discussions, particularly the substantive critiques of the papers. When Andrea used prepared slides, I found the models easy to follow. However, sometimes when we skipped around, it could be more difficult. I did like the level of engagement with the formal models, as political science classes often consider models only artificially. I believe some students struggled following the material. It would have been useful if Andrea had spent more time reviewing dynamic programming \/ Bellman equations during the first few classes. Moreover, it may be necessary to require that students had already completed a game theory course and\/or open the class up to more economics PhDs."

    "Yes I would to any other political economy PhD student.",

    "Yes, I think this is great material that is missing in the other political economy courses offered by either the economics or the political science departments."
