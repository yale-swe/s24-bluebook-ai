    "Yes, but make sure you are interested in the themes of the class. Check the syllabus and be aware of what kind of class you're taking because if it's not 'your thing' or you're not willing to engage and commit to this 'something new,' then you will definitely not enjoy it as much.",
    "I would recommend it if you are interested in the topic. The readings and discussions can be fun but some readings are lengthy and borings. It is a good way to get a writing credit. We wrote a 500-word essay every week. The assignments were very open, so we could write about things we liked or cared about.",
    "An intense but worthwhile course. Totally opened my mind for whenever I see a novel cultural image or gesture- its a lot of reading but I actually think taking this has improved my quality of life and forced me to think deeply about what brings people together.",
    "Engaging class that helps to develop both visual literacy and writing skills through the study of communities. Definitely the class I looked forward to every week."
