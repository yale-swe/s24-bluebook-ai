   "comments": [
    "A class in which you will study WWI literature with a specific focus on women's roles in the war. TAKE THIS CLASS if you have interest whatsoever in WWI.",
    "Great course about the way that World War I impacted gender relations and how gender relations affected perceptions of the war. I would highly recommend this class \u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00c2\u00a0there's a lot of reading but it's worth it.",
    "Honestly, I would recommend this class to anyone. If you're interested in american history - take it. Gender studies - take it. English major - take it. It has a lot to offer in any one of these capacities.",
    "Absolutely take this class! Such an interesting period, and Professor Homans is great.",
    "No matter what your major is, this is a great class to take. Our seminar was a blend of English, WGSS, psychology, and American Studies majors, and we all brought something different to the table, which made for some really interesting discussions. World War I is such a fascinating time period, both for history and for literature, and if you've ever wanted to learn more about it, you should definitely take this class.",
    "This course is great, but only take it if there are a few guys in it. Discussion just seems to fall flat if every member of the class is a female. The reading list is intense, so try to keep up, but much of the criticism that is read at the beginning isn't particularly helpful or discussed. There are some gems on the reading list, though, so enjoy those! Professor Homans is fabulous but tends to scatter the discussion abit--topics are kind of strewn about all over the place sometimes. Overall, though, a pretty good course.",
    "Learn about the women of WWI--not an often-told story. Be prepared for lots of reading.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student. It was a really interesting way to study the WWI period; you learn about it more on a personal level rather than a historical level. There is a fair amount of work-- a book a week plus semi-long critical essays for each class, but the work is definitely worth it. Professor Homans is great about giving feedback on your essays and being available to read drafts or discuss potential theses. If you're curious about WWI literature, especially from women's perspective, then you should take this class."
