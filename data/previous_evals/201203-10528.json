    "Yes. Basic ethics for one conducting research.",
    "Course does what it's supposed to do. Instructor is funny and engaging.",
    "I got the idea that how important it is to be honest.",
    "Applicable in terms of what not to do and raised awareness about things that can be happening around you.",
    "This course opened me to a part of the chemical field that I was previously unaware of. I now know how to prevent misinterpretation of my own results, while keeping a watchful eye for results from others that may be incorrect, misinterpreted, or even fabricated. This course will be highly beneficial toward insuring that my future research remains accurate and ethical."
