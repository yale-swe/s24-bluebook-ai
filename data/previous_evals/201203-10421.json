    "Lots of real talk about the kinds of professional issues we don't usually discuss: career trajectories, publishing, grant-writing, IRB applications, etc. Plus, I am much less likely to have a catastrophically disorganized grant-writing process next year thanks to the practice NSF assignment in this class. It was so so helpful to understand this far in advance what will be required to submit a successful proposal."
