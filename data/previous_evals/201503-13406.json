    "I feel frustrated regarding the range of topics for the seminar, or lack thereof. You could guess who was organizing the talks just from the speakers that were brought in. I think student feedback would be really helpful in choosing speakers. There was a huge emphasis on the social side of social and behavioral science, and very limited speakers in behavioral science. I think many of us would appreciate if we had some say in it or if there could be a bigger range of topics covered",
    "It was really cool to hear about work going on in the field and see opportunities for research and collaboration. Love it!",
    "Nice presentation from researchers and professors.",
    "Great opportunity to hear from professionals in the field of Chronic Disease Epidemiology.",
    "I enjoyed the talks",
    "Good for learning about research interests of CDE faculty members.",
    "I thought the speakers who came to YSPH were really wonderful, and I thoroughly enjoyed the seminar series.",
    "Interesting lectures - loved the one about Mexican Romances\/Sexuality and the one on TransgenderHealth",
    "Wonderful! Very interesting lectures.",
    "This course hosted a nice range of seminar speakers.",
    "good; would want better communication with students about guest speakers and their topics prior to session",
    "It would be nice if it were better organized. Since it doesn't meet every week, it would be helpful to have an accurate schedule with all the talks ahead of time (even though they are all mandatory).",
    "Good way to listen to professors from different schools talk about their work.",
    "Seminars were thoughtfully presented. One suggestion I have would be to continue to promote the variability is topics.",
    "Strengths- didn't meet very often, some pretty interesting speakers. Weaknesses- zero accountability as for whether we actually got anything out of the lectures, zero credit.",
    "Great course! It was a little confusing as to which seminars were SBS required versus CDE required. If that can be conveyed clearly, it will be helpful."

    "Interesting speakers and seminar series. Very limited in scope, and I feel behavioral sciences was underrepresented.",
    "Recommend it",
    "It's required but the content is narrowed and limited. I'd rather go Grand Rounds",
    "Great opportunity to hear from professionals in the field of Chronic Disease Epidemiology.",
    "Interesting seminars. I enjoyed learning about people's research within the field of public health. It was really neat and the food was good.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to another student. I think this seminar series was a great way for the SBS and CDE tracks to come together and learn more about current research and practice that is going on within the field.",
    "Loved it - free food and interesting talks!",
    "This course brings in speakers from the field of public health to discuss their research and answer questions from students. It is a wonderful way to learn about some of the research that is happening in the field of public health today.",
    "This course hosts speakers that present on a wide-range of public health topics. I would definitely recommend attending the seminars. Speakers come from around the country to discuss their research. Additionally, it provides an intimate environment to connect with speakers.",
    "Was a nice opportunity to hear very interesting projects and topics",
    "It was a great opportunity to be exposed to so many different fields of research and study",
    "Overall the seminars presented a range of topics and current research related to fields we're studying.",
    "Not the worst way to spend Thursday afternoons. Make sure you show up early for food.",
    "Great topics and lectures. I would recommend."
