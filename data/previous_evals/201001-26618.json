    "too much subject matter to be squeezed into a single semester, however Joel Sanders was able to somehow orchestrate this and distribute this in a coherent fashion; not without the help of David Sadighian as his TA.One would hope that there wasn't so much to squeeze into each class, coming off a session feels like getting off an intellectual roller coaster - exhausted and overwhelmed at times.But the subject matter was very interesting.",
    "The material presented was often provocative and open-ended, leaving plenty of room for debate on the part of the students. Week to week, there sometimes was little overlap, making the course feel at times like a series of smaller seminar studies, which I suppose is the nature of the material itself. As a wide-ranging survey course, the material covered was diverse and rich, with samples from the best of the best in each sub-topic the class addressed.",
    "This has been the most enjoyable class I have taken at Yale. The material was broad, but well directed. I like that our presentations were able to explore unique interests yet somehow tied to the overall structure in a loose, yet provocative manner. I appreciated Joel's lectures, especially for those of us who have not had a comprehensive art history class. Overall a great experience.",
    "The course was on a broad topic, because of this the organization of the material had to be by the week, sometimes material slipped from one week to the next, overlapping, this did become a little confusing but somehow enriched the course by exposing the links between the material discussed. The assignments for the course were extremely helpful, the in class presentations were a great way of doing preliminary research for the paper at the end of the term.",
    "The course had a rather broad subject area, but the syllabus was rigorously catagorized into different themes of \"Human\/Nature.\" I think the sequence was appropriate - we started out looking at ideas of \"wilderness\" and ended in the digital. We diachronically explored different ideas, but it happened to in a broad sense be chronological. I liked the order, sequence and content. The assignments were to a. lead a reading discussion, b. present on a topic that was outlined in the syllabus, c. produce a final project (whether paper, catalog or otherwise) - which, I thought worked really well with the material studied.",
    "Fascinating topic, great readings."

   "comments": [
    "I was unsure of what exactly to expect, other than that the course would study the general relationship between humans and their environment. Given the diversity of material and the complex issues they evoked, the class exceeded my expectations and was informative and enjoyable.",
    "The expectations were high, Joel presented the class very well in the first session and the outcome of the course met my initial expectations.",
    "The class met my expectations - to have a further understanding of theoretical, cultural and specifically architectural ideas of the relationship between humans and nature.",
    "My expectations were surpassed. I got much more out of the discussions than expected."

   "comments": [
    "Great introduction to a wide range of texts, artists, and ideas that I had never been exposed to before.",
    "The course provides a great deal of value as a rich supplement to the architectural curriculum. Touching on issues as vast as creationism, transcendentalism, landscape architecture, and prosthetics, the seminar provides supporting material to a wide range of broader issues that impact the architectural discourse.",
    "Having been interested in this subject matter for some time this course was a great way of gleaning new resources and ideas about the subject.",
    "The course was of great value - I know I will refer to the readings discussed and I learned a lot from my peers presentations as well as the lectures presented by Prof. Sanders."

   "comments": [
    "Joel was extremely forthcoming with suggestions to improve teh students' projects and often took more time than he should to add to his already precise and encompassing critiques. His energy and enthusiasm for the subject matter showed in his mastery for the subject and his leadership is much appreciated.David Sadighian, apart from being extremely knowledgable in the subject matter was also very available to help the students and would always be one to contribute to the discussions in the class. The class would have been less alive without him.",
    "Joel is a dedicated, passionate teacher. David was a helpful TA.",
    "Professor Sanders brings an energy and passion to the class that is rarely matched within the school. He presents material that is rich and complex in a clear and comprehensible manner. His choices for readings were always relevant and furthered the discussions in the class, while also remaining sensitive to the workload required in studio and the other seminar courses. As a professor, he constantly made class entertaining and informative. If there is one complaint, it is that he seemed to have the presentation topics for students a bit too predetermined before the class began. Though it is understandable that he wanted to ensure that the relevant topics were covered, the ability to explore beyond these concepts became a bit challenging, and as such presentations at times became a repetition of concepts already debated and studied in class. Otherwise, Professor Sanders offered a compelling and informative seminar that was quite enjoyable.",
    "All were good, David is an excellent TA, he contributed to the discussion tremendously.",
    "I think that both the Prof. Sanders and TA, David, did an amazing job organizing the content and sequence of the course and so the course was very effective and successful.",
    "Both Joel and David were great at leading the discussions."

    "less readings",
    "Please be aware of time in terms of presentations, class end time, and in balancing all that needs to occur during a given class period.",
    "Better time management.",
    "Other than being more receptive to a broader scope of presentation topics, the course was well organized, informative and enjoyable. It was a pleasure to take this seminar, and my overall architectural education will be enriched by this experience.",
    "More comparative discussions about how this ties with architectural design.",
    "The one suggestion I would have is to maybe concentrate more on contemporary ideas about Nature. While I felt the course was very strong in bringing readings and projects from the 1990's and before, it seemed lacking in contemporary thought and case studies.",
    "too much class time was eaten up by student presentations. discussions would have been fruitful, but there was rarely the time to engage in anything meaningful because we were always trying to cover too much"
