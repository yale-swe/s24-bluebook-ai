    "Obviously, if you have made it this far in screenwriting, you should go for the whole thing and write a feature. Not for the un-initiated though...",
    "Excellent class. You will have to write a full length screenplay so be prepared for that. Script pages are shorter than essay pages but with the word count of my screenplay it's equivalent to a 65 page essay so don't sign up for this class thinking it will be easier than a senior essay. Plus you have to come up with a story that lasts an hour and 1\/2 to 2 hours so it's difficult.",
    "Basically you spend the entire school year writing a full length screenplay. You also read and critique your classmates' screenplays as well as a few feature film screenplays.",
    "Take it. It's the best.",
    "I would recommend this class to someone seriously considering going into screenwriting."
