    "Highly recommend, Ariel was a great teacher.",
    "American economic and development history in 19th century.",
    "I don't think this course will be taught again, but if it were I would always recommend taking it. It's not an easy class, but the readings are entirely surmountable and often very interesting, and you will learn a lot.",
    "Worth taking for anyone interested in economics, history, or both, even in conjunction with other\/previous coursework in economic history.",
    "Great course though i think Professor Ron said it best: America as a developing country is an interesting concept that deserves more investigation but in the end the course didn't quite come together. The readings are at times very interesting (beckert, jones, andrews) and at times painfully tedious (transportation, information, i dont even remember the authors names...). Best part of the course is professor Ron though. He is incredibly brilliant and very good at summarizing arguments in the books or telling you your own argument back to you except making it way more articulate. Very glad i took the course!"
