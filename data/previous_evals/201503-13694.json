    "I would recommend this course to any student interested in Baroque italian art. If you are interested in the development of that style (who isn't?) then I absolutely recommend this course. I would say that some experience in art history would be helpful, but not necessarily required for success.",
    "Easy class for non-majors looking to take a lecture beyond the intro surveys. Low workload and good lectures.",
    "An overview of baroque art in rome. The first half if about painting, then second half about sculpture and architecture. I personally liked the first half better, but overall it was an interesting course to take if you have previous interest in the area.",
    "This is a truly incredible course on Baroque Rome. Professor Suthor is a wonderful instructor and person! The class is divided into three sections--the first on painting, the second on sculpture (Bernini!) and the third on architecture. All of the art is wonderful, and the texts are fascinating! And, we took a field trip to the Metropolitan Museum with Professor Suthor to discuss many of the paintings we'd seen in the course, which was a blast. There was a weekly discussion section, but it was optional as it was impossible to find a time all students could attend. If you like Rome and Bernini and Caravaggio, TAKE THIS COURSE!",
    "This is a fabulous course to take if you want a lighter art history course. It's a rarely studied period of art and you learn so much.",
    "Take this course. Geared towards art history majors--a fairly high level of discourse. A fantastic introduction to the Baroque period in Rome, approx. 1590-1660. Profesor Suthor is unlike any other, a true expert. Light readings, about 20 pages of criticism for every lecture. You need to do them, though, as sections revolve around their ideas.",
