    "I would highly recommend Spring HPT. Professor Slanski is difficult, but an excellent professor and you will improve your writing and thinking.",
    "We read major political works from Machiavelli to Arendt. We write three papers and have two sections meetings a week. I definitely recommend this course! You will love it if you plan to do all the reading and engage seriously with the ideas.",
    "Professor Slanski was a gift to my writing and critical thinking abilities. She seems cold and distant at the beginning of the class, but don't give up on her! She genuinely cares about her students. She really knows her stuff, and you will benefit constantly from her insights. Do not succumb to the urge to take this class credit\/D; to get the most out of this class, you have to motivated to seek her out and get her help to write better papers. If you aren't willing to do this, you may as well not take the class. Professor Slanski can change the way that you analyze political thought, but you have to be willing to put in the work and possibly to see grades that are lower than you are used to.",
    "yes",
    "Spring Semester Hist&Pol focuses much more on political thought than history, and it explores most of what forms modern political theory (and the competing ideologies). As such, it's fascinating, although the condensed time period necessarily means that the course be more of a survey. Although a harsh grader, Professor Slanski is an amazing section leader who helps disentangle the authors' ideas and their implications. If you've been able to keep up with the workload from the Fall and are interested in modern political theory, as well as the foundations of the Western powers in the world today, then certainly continue.",
    "Professor Slanski really teaches you so much. You will understand the text better as well as improve your writing style, structure, and syntax. You'll learn to write well and clearly. You will come away from this class with a thorough understanding of the text and a feeling of accomplishment only her section can offer!",
    "Continuing on from last semester. You know the drill. Goes to present day.",
    "I'd recommend it with Slanski.",
    "The readings this semester are incredibly interesting and relate to your everyday life much more concretely than last semester. Excellent, excellent class.",
    "Take it- if you can get into professor Slanski's section.",
    "Regardless of your background, DS will help you connect the dots and fill in the holes in your knowledge of the western tradition. I found the readings to be more distinctive second semester and therefore more engaging. As in all DS courses, the pace is quick, but there will be many opportunities to reexamine these works over the next three years."
