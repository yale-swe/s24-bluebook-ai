    "SO much! Conversational skills and dialogues, grammar points, vocabulary characters. You regularly practice all aspects of learning a language, including speaking, listening, reading and writing.",
    "I improved my ability to understand and speak Mandarin.",
    "More advanced grammar patterns and expansion of vocabulary. Slightly greater emphasis on pronunciation and oral communication.",
    "I can say with confidence that I have learned an immense amount of Chinese vocabulary and grammar to form a strong base for future Chinese learning. Furthermore, the teachers really do care so much that we improve our Chinese and help us with our reading, writing, and speaking skills, which I feel I have improved in a lot as well. I feel that I can understand a good amount of a conversation as well as speak some basic Chinese phrases."

   "comments": [
    "The biggest strengths of the class are the small section sizes and the AMAZING teachers. This makes the class super engaging and fun! The course is very efficient and effective, and I believe that I get something out of each assignment I do, including homework and daily quizzes. The teachers care about the students' success and give really great feedback.",
    "The class size was small so there was a lot of interaction between students and the teacher. The teacher was also engaging and passionate.",
    "It is well-taught and the curriculum is designed for high levels of engagement due to the relatively intensive curriculum. The daily quizzes at a certain point can seem a bit ridiculous, because people study for them right before class and don't retain the information. The homework is generally quite good for learning though. I will say that the weekly memorized oral presentations often felt like a bit of a waste of time.",
    "Strengths: the teachers! They really do care so much about you and your Chinese and do everything they can to help you improve. The textbook was also so fun and amazing - great storyline and very interesting! I also really enjoyed my small class size of about 7 to 8; we each got a lot of time to practice our speaking in class. Weaknesses: A lot of work, but also a good thing because it really makes us improve quickly and steadily."

    "Yes! I learned so much, and every professor genuinely cares about you and your growth.",
    "If you're willing to put in the work, the teachers truly meet you halfway. The teachers are amazing, the sections are small, and the course is super structured and well designed for learning.",
    "Yes, the teacher really cared about the students learning.",
    "Yes, if you want to learn Chinese Yale definitely has a great Chinese department!",
    "I would if they are motivated to learn the language and are willing to put in the work! If you don't do the work and are not engaged in class, you won't improve your Chinese and will not have a good experience either."
