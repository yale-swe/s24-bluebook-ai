   "comments": [
    "This course reads the stories of Aeneas and Romulus in 4 texts. It's incredibly redundant, and not worth the workload.",
    "Unless you absolutely are in love with Latin prose, Roman history, and the etymology of words, I would suggest taking another course.",
    "This is a great bridge course into L5 Latin. There is a lot of work, but you will definitely improve in your translation skills by the end of the semester. Professor Solodow is a fun and interesting teacher and can sometimes be a hard grader. This is a great introduction to early Rome with wonderful authors to read.",
    "Latin 411 01 includes text from Livy, Ovid, Virgil, and the Origo Gentis Romanae, which trace the history of the founding of Rome. I would not recommend this class to another student, because the material is extremely repetitive (you read the same story four times), and I did not feel like my knowledge of Latin was improving.",
    "If you enjoyed\/really didn't mind Latin in high school and want an L5 for your language requirement, you shouldn't even hesitate to take this class. If you're a Classics major, get after it. Be forewarned though: the hardest part of this class is the term paper.",
    "I would most definitely recommend Latin 411. Be prepared for a lot of work, particularly in the beginning, but it is a very interesting class, filled with interesting Latin readings and fascinating linguistic tidbits. As the bridge course, it did a good job to prepare you for higher Latin, whether you choose to pursuestudy of the language further or not.",
    "I would recommend this class to any freshman who is considering majoring in classics. This will give you a great feel for the Latin program.",
    "I would describe it as a comparison of various accounts and sources dealing with the nature of early Roman \"history.\" Many of these accounts have several similarities between them, but the differences are very interesting and highlight differences in narrative intention. I would recommend this class to anyone interested in a comparison between different Roman\/post-Roman authors on the nebulous and uncertain realm that is early Roman history.",
    "You read the works of Livy, Ovid, and Virgil about the founding of Rome, comparing the stories found within them. I would recommend Latin 411 to other students as a good way to ease into college Latin, both interesting and not overwhelming.",
    "Summary: Translate ~100 lines for each assignment, and then discuss them in class. I think to enjoy this class you really have to enjoy the whole process of translating Latin-- you can't be in it for how \"interesting\" the material is. I would recommend this course.",
    "This class will definitely augment your translation skills, as the volume of translation expected for each class is quite large, and it will familiarize you with both prose and poetry. Some of the readings themselves were quite boring (especially if you are used to Catullus and the like from high school AP classes), and reading different versions of the same story over and over gets repetitive. But even though it was frustrating at times, on the whole, the course was valuable to students interested in translating and discussing Latin literature. A good way to fulfill the language requirement.",
    "It is a decent course for continuing latin and definitely gives a good perspective on prose. The readings are repetitive and a bit boring. There are quizzes every three classes and translations for each class. This is a fine course to fulfill a requirement, but most of the readings are not the most interesting.",
    "This class is a great start to Latin at Yale, because it covers actual material at college level, but still goes over syntax etc, so it's not too overwhelming. The workload varies depending on which author you're reading, but it does require more attention than most other classes, and the quizzes are an extra pressure. Professor Solodow's a great professor though, and is always willing to offer help if you need it.",
    "If you want to fulfill the language requirement, then take it. If you think you can handle L5 and know you want to keep taking Latin, go for L5. It's probably more of a challenge, but the two classes will probably take up an equal amount of time. The work in this class isn't really hard, there is just a lot of it.",
    "This class requires you to prepare 50-60 lines of very straightforward Latin (some prose and some poetry) for each class period. If you have a good high school Latin background, it will be easy and a simple way to get the language requirement out of the way. It's not especially intellectually invigorating, because you read the same handful of myths from four different authors. Professor Solodow is very nice."
