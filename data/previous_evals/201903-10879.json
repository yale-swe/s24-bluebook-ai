   "comments": [
    "The main strength of this course was the professor Mark Reed: he is an engaging and great professor and breaks down complex concepts and topics into more understandable terms that facilitate learning in this class. Also, he is extremely fair and doesn't really throw you any curveballs on the exams. One weakness of the class I would say is the lack of feedback students get from the labs as it took a long time to get lab reports back.",
    "I thought that the material was difficult, but Professor Reed made it very relevant and engaging.",
    "Labs were tedious",
    "Professor Reed is great: he's very laid back and flexible as a professor and moves at a good pace. The assessments are fair. The weaknesses are definitely labs and the textbook. The textbook is pretty hard to read... I found it *very* difficult to learn from and doing the homework involved way more scrolling through the textbook trying to decode equations than actually solving the problem. The labs often required us to solve for information that we didn't have the necessary values\/information\/background to solve for which made writing the full reports very time consuming. All and all this course was enjoyable."

    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student, and if you are an EE major this is a required course that you will enjoy.",
    "I would recommend this course for a student looking to go into device manufacturing.",
    "Yes, even to the occasional physics major!",
    "Yes, but probably only to a person very interested in device physics. The course is a lot of work and is conceptually really difficult so you need to put time into it if you take it. That being said, I learned a lot and Professor Reed was a good, clear, and friendly lecturer!",
    "Professor Reed is a great lecturer. Its a hard class, but you will learn a lot with him. A great upper level EE course."
