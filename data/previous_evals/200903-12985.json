   "comments": [
    "The sequence of the material presented in the course made sense, centering the architecture around its location. However it brings to mind certain questions about what was omitted in this revisionary take on the period that the course mostly addressed. For instance, we hardly discussed France, and I wonder whether that is because Le Corbusier was the only important architect at that time (a premise I find hard to believe based on the rest of the material of the course) or whether the important work parallel to mainstream modernism simply was happening elsewhere. I sometimes had trouble connecting the readings to what we were being shown in class, and I wish that we had spent more time discussing those. Finally, I thought the presentations were largely successful, especially in terms of learning how to present work in that type of situation.",
    "The course was very successful in laying out a substantial body of precedent and expanding the frame of reference for late 19th\/early 20th century architecture in a straightforward and even entertaining way. This strength was occasionally also a weakness; the quantity of material presented was sometimes hard to digest in one sitting. That said, I am not sure how this could have been improved without compromising content.I also very much enjoyed the student presentations on postmodernism in the 70s and 80s, although there never seemed enough time to do justice to all that was presented. On the other hand, the course seemed less successful at exploring \"the possible emergence of a new synthesis of seeming opposites in the present\" as originally advertised; perhaps this was too ambitious a goal for one semester.",
    "The course was invaluable in terms of introducing great architects that at some point dropped from the mainstream academic discourse. The student presentations at the end were especially interesting, both for their content and for the interpretations of the presenters. Finally, in the course of researching my paper I gained an intimate understanding of my chosen architect that I doubt I would have undertaken otherwise.",
    "I think the lectures were very straightforward and clear. Dean Stern did the class a tremendous service by not trying to force unnecessary amount of jargon or theory into the class...instead, he let the material speak for itself, and speak it did - the works we examined were stunning, and I feel very fortunate to have learned this \"other\" side of modernism.The readings were appropriate in length and relevancy. I should also add that I do appreciate the simple graphic nature of his power points and that he had the architect, building, location, and date on EVERY slide - that is actually extremely helpful and much rarer than you might expect. It made taking notes very easy.",
    "Overall, the structure of the course was ery well designed. I also appreciated the fact that cancelled classes were made up. The sequence was appropriate and seamless from the lecture to the presentation portions of the course.",
    "The sequence of the lecture material was coherent and easily followed. It was greatly appreciated to have the names and dates of the all the projects on each slide. Also, it was useful to have access to the presentations. The student projects were generally enlightening, though I wish that there could have been a greater dialogue between the work of the 12 Postmodern architects that we looked at. One suggestion to potentially aleviate this would be to have each student, at midterm, post images, dates and locations of 5-10 buildings that they will be discussing in their final presentations. This could lead to a greater ammount of overlap or at least understanding of the projects as a whole."

   "question_text": "What were your expectations for this course and how well were they met?",
   "comments": [
    "My main expectation for the course was to learn about architecture that has not been a part of our mainstream education as architecture students. That expectation was met perfectly well. However, I was a bit disappointed that we did not engage in more conversation about the work, especially with regard to the reading material. In addition, I wish that we had spent more time before the student presentations began discussing the work we were looking at with the end in sight; that we could talk about postmodernism while we were looking at Lutyens or Dudok or Plecnik the other influential parallel modern architects.",
    "In addition to the above, I was also hoping to get a sense of the Dean's own approach to the course material and to architecture more broadly, and in this regard I think my expectations were met.",
    "I thoroughly enjoyed the course, though I expected Dean Stern to discuss the \"toward a new synthesis\" part of \"Parallel Moderns: Toward a New Synthesis?\" a bit more himself. (I understand that was the job of the students, but it would have been nice to hear more of the Dean's take.)",
    "I expected to learn about a strand of modern architecture that is not typically thought of as modernism. I also aspired to learn new ways of challenging the \"master narratives\" of history.I certainly learned both of these. In terms of the first of these desires, I almost feel disillusioned when I think that I could potentially have made it through 7 years of architecture school without having learned about some of these masters of another kind. It also helped me realize that that the New Pioneers and the New Traditionalists were actually not that different in some regards. I have a new way of looking at modernism, but also at history at large.",
    "Yes. Although there was decidedly less discussion that I imagined would happen, and this in fact at certain points seemed to be discouraged.",
    "In general, my expectations were fulfilled. This class introduced me to a significant body of work that I had little or no awareness of."

   "comments": [
    "This course was extremely valuable to me, even if only for the fact that I was exposed to architecture that I probably would never have learned about if not for this course. I hope to continue research concerning some of this work, and I hope that Yale continues to teach students about architects who are not just the ones featured in every undergraduate architectural history textbook.",
    "I especially appreciated the opportunity to focus closely on placing the work of one architect within its historical context - a great exercise and one that I enjoyed immensely.",
    "Through the course I gained a considerably more nuanced understanding of Postmodernism than I had been able to gain otherwise--something that will inform my analysis of architecture for the rest of my life.",
    "I think I answered this in the past question, and I know the Dean's feelings on redundancy...",
    "I found this course to hold extreme personal value and would not be surprised if others had the same reaction. I would recommend this course to anyone in the 2nd or 3rd year if it was offreed again. In short, it should be offered again, or at the very least Dean Stern should teach another course in the future."

   "comments": [
    "Dean Stern is a very good teacher and was clearly knowledgeable about the subject matter. My only complaint would be that the seminar sometimes felt like a lecture class, as if he could have delivered the same class to a group of 50 students in Hastings Hall. I think I would have appreciated the class a bit more if there had been more discussion amongst the class, and more focus on the readings that we were asked to do. I also wish to some degree that the lectures could have been more focused, less a barrage of fifty or a hundred buildings by twenty or thirty architects than a concentrated look at few. However I do see the merit in the survey approach, and I did appreciate the wealth and immensity of the task of presenting a comprehensive parallel to the mainstream history of architecture.",
    "I appreciated the instructor's commitment to the class and availability outside class. More discussion would have been great if there had been more time, particularly on some of the more contentious issues relating to contemporary practice that came up during student presentations.",
    "Dean Stern has an extraordinary capacity as an instructor. I had heard from a former professor who studied under Bob at Columbia that he had this amazing ability to teach, and I was delighted to have had an opportunity to agree with this opinion. His teaching style is very rigorously academic, yet I trulyappreciated how much architectural \"gossip\" he would throw in (the stories behind the buildings we were looking at). It made the material seem so much more interesting and fresh and relevant. There was never a time in class I felt intimidated to ask a question, offer my opinion on something, or make a comment. I think it might have had something to do with the caliper of student in the class, but I think that the level of discourse in the seminar was very, very high. Finally, I appreciate that the Dean was so willing to meet with us outside of class time - I know his schedule is very packed, so we really do appreciate this time he made for us.",
    "The greatest strength that dean Stern possesses his his extremely and intimate knowledge of the subject matter. This was absolutely unparalleled and made the course worth taking. Dean Stern was less effect at answering specefic questions or really for allowing any sort of a discussion to take place. This was outweighed by the strengths of the course."

   "comments": [
    "My main suggestion for improving this class pertains to the format. If the class concentrated more on assigned readings, and if the readings had a closer relationship to the architecture that was being presented, I think there might have been more discussion. Specifically, I wish that during student presentations we had had more of an opportunity to discuss the work that was presented, considering how much of it was close to contemporary and how rich so much of it was.",
    "Readings were excellent, but could have been more carefully assembled. I myself would have enjoyed a more explicit focus on theory. And, as ever, I wish we had had more time...."
