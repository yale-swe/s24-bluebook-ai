   "comments": [
    "Yes, I would. Fiction writing is very difficult, but Caz will help you focus your ideas and shape your characters.",
    "A writer's workshop.",
    "Take this class only if you are a serious writer. Though you only write two stories all semester, if you put in the work and don't write them the weekend they're due, you will become a better writer.",
    "If you get into this class, you should take it, absolutely. Caz is great, the workload isn't enormous, and you get to exercise your creativity. The workshops are scary, but they really do make you a much better writer.",
    "Anyone from any major should feel comfortable taking this class. Caz is honest but always constructive. His every-man approach to writing was really refreshing.",
    "Yes, absolutely. I adored it.",
    "I could not recommend this class highly enough. In some ways, I suppose, it depends on who else is in your class, but Caz is an unbelievable professor - approachable, funny, helpful, and very inspiring. He takes everyone seriously but manages to maintain a very free, informal atmosphere in the classroom. The class is what I hoped for out of Creative Writing at Yale - it is all about personal growth as a writer, not about learning the rules of a craft, per se. You do not want to pass it up. Possibly my favorite class at Yale with my favorite professor at Yale.",
