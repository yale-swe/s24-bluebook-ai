   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this course to another student. It is an opportunity to be taught American politics by one of its leading scholars. You can't go wrong.",
    "I really enjoyed this course and would recommend it to anyone interested in getting a good overview of the history and present state of American politics, as well as to anyone who has studied American politics before but wants a refresher course or to go into it in more depth. I'm new to the discipline of political science, and this course was a great introduction to the field - the different methods used and the worldviews of its academics. The reading was broad and we covered some interesting topics, though we perhaps spent more time than I would have liked in covering the finer points of how Congress works. I preferred the broader topics such as the development of political parties, the political economy of inequality, and the role of civil society organisations.",
    "Absolutely! A great course.",
    "Yes, I would recommend it. Great readings plus Mayhew's well-informed and insightful analysis of each.",
    "I would highly recommend this class to anyone. Even if students have only a passing interest in American Politics, this class is a great overview and provides consistently engaging discussion.",
    "I would strongly recommend this course.",
    "The course gives a thorough but manageable introduction to many of the salient questions and texts in the study of American Politics today. I would highly recommend it to any political science student."

   "comments": [
    "This course provided an excellent background in American politics. Professor Mayhew was also very generous with his time, in providing advice and feedback on research ideas.",
    "I think this course will be very helpful in preparation for the American politics field exam.",
    "The reading for this class has helped me prepare for my dissertation research. Both the discussions and the reading list help me prepare for the American Politics exam.",
    "The course gives the foundations for thinking about many important questions in the field."
