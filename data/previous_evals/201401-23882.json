   "comments": [
    "See answer 1. I would recommend this class, particularly because of the way it used Beinecke resources. (I'd love to see more art history department seminar utilize the archives and print study rooms at Beinecke, YUAG, and YCBA.)",
    "This should be a very simple decision: if you are interested in the Situationists or in the history of the 20th century European avant-garde, take this class. There are very few places in the entire world, and almost no places in the United States, where you will have the opportunity to study this material, and certainly not with primary source material such as the kind we have in the Beinecke's collections. Taking this class was a Yale Bucket List kind of opportunity, and I highly recommend it to anyone with the relevant set of interests.",
    "The course provided a comprehensive overview of the trajectory of the Situationist International movement through scrutiny of both manifestos and secondary texts. Each session was heavily object oriented and enabled us to sort through a large amount of relevant, but occasionally unaccessioned material.Competent reading proficiency in French is enormously helpful for this course because many archival texts are untranslated into English, but a student reading on a lower level would still be able to enroll in the course because most of the assigned readings were in English.The course is recommending for students who are interested in 20th century are movements and especially recommended for French speakers working in those areas."

   "comments": [
    "This course was extremely helpful as I begin to think about my dissertation research. I don't anticipate writing directly on the material we covered, but the issues at stake, and which we worked through in our class discussions and in the readings, were very pertinent.",
    "The course gave me a strong foothold in an alternative tradition of History of Art--I'm an undergraduate in Comparative Literature--and allowed me to deepen an already burgeoning interest in the Situationist International and in the 20th-century European avant-garde. I am extremely grateful for this course for having introduced me to the writings of the Lettrist Group, Constant Nieuwenhuys, and Jacqueline de Jong and the Situationist Times. For a long time I thought of Situationism through the singular focus of Guy Debord. This course successfully distended that focus, and I am grateful for it.",
    "The course was useful in helping me gain more experience in working with archival materials."
