   "comments": [
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to any student interested in the theoretical conception of human rights, the history of human rights, and the current developmental state of human rights. The course really covered multiple dimensions of human rights and relevant international institutions, and the class discussions are very fun to participate in. If Pablo is teaching it again, students should definitely consider taking it because seriously the class discussions NEVER stopped.",
    "A really great class where you talk about contemporary human rights issues in an open environment with a professor who is genuinely interested in what you have to say about things. I would definitely recommend this class to another student.",
    "This is a class intent on exploring the development of human rights and the debates that sorrowing its practical application on a national and international scale.",
    "Overview of discussion surrounding HR and HR practice. Moves from theoretical foundations to contemporary practice. Don't be fooled by the title, it's a foundational seminar on HR.",
    "The discussion that took place every day in this seminar was passionate, humorous, engaging\u0097 much of it steered by the soft-spoken but keen professor Kalmanovitz.The readings are heavy and often highly theoretical, but will introduce you to interesting ways of approaching, categorizing, and implementing Human Rights.I fully recommend this class. Take it if the subject interests you. It will become a forum for you to develop your thoughts on the matter.But don't expect to learn concrete implementations, or concrete case studies. It is a place for theory.",
    "If you're looking for a historical review of the formation of the international human rights system (institutions, treaties, organizations, etc.), with normative considerations about what rights have been protected, this is definitely the class for you. It espouses a very balanced approach, mixing history with philosophy and a hint of activism. It could be an introductory course or a nice way to round out holes in your knowledge for someone who has already taken some of the human rights courses at Yale. If Pablo Kalmanovitz is teaching it, you should DEFINITELY take it. Pablo is extremely thoughtful and shapes wonderful discussion. I would absolutely recommend this class to another student.",
    "Yes, but a more dynamic and critical analysis should be implemented in the seminar. Sometimes the discussion seemed vague."
