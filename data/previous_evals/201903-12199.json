    "This class was fascinating. It taught me all about the intelligence community in the United States and covered both its strengths and its shortcoming.",
    "We learned the basic concepts of intelligence, what the intelligence community is comprised of, and how intelligence analysts coordinate and communicate their findings to policymakers. Looking at the nuances of how this relationship between the IC and policymakers also allows students to gain a better understanding of policy implementation and the support received from the IC.",
    "Intelligence",
    "how this secret stuff actually works",
    "We learned about the U.S. Intelligence Community, the historical U.S. intelligence failures, and different aspects of the intelligence process such as cybersecurity, finance, domestic terrorism, etc.",
    "Knowledge about intelligence and key U.S. foreign policy events, writing policy memos, and research skills.",
    "You truly learn SO much in this course - it's amazing! The first half of the course focuses on intelligence failures (e.g. Pearl Harbor, 9\/11, Iraq & WMDs, etc.) and the second half of the course focuses on specific aspects of intelligence (e.g. cybersecurity, financial intelligence, etc.). Professor Wittenstein reads all of his students' assignments and grades them along with the TFs, despite the fact that this was a 70-person lecture. It was amazing and something I haven't seen been done at Yale before! His experience as a previous Executive Assistant to the Director of National Intelligence was incredible to hear about. I took this course Fall 2019, and we discussed current events throughout the course that made it all the more engaging - we got to follow the whistleblower complaint against Trump the entire semester from the time it first came out to his impeachment vote (which was on the same day that our final was due!). So cool.",
    "Great class on the structure, organization, and challenges of the US intelligence community. You definitely learn a ton about intelligence, and the class also gives you an analytical framework with which you can examine US policy and current events. Further, Wittensteins expertise as a lawyer provides an interesting way to viewing intelligence and the government which many others do not highlight.",
    "This course gives you a pretty good insight into the history of intelligence and teaches you how to evaluate current events in a more analytical matter.",
    "learned a lot about big events in US intelligence history.",
    "This course gave me meaningful insights into the United States Intelligence Community. It provided an understanding of how the IC functions, what its purpose is, and how it can be enhanced in the future.",
    "This course is a very interesting look into intelligence and what it is all about. I learned about intelligence in terms of major historical events as well as more current events. I found it to be a great course!",
    "I gained a better understanding of US foreign policy and the role\/ functioning of the intelligence community. I learned about past intelligence failures and the underlying mechanisms and issues that facilitated them, and I learned how to apply past knowledge and analysis to current US intelligence issues.",
    "It provides a great overview of intelligence related topics.",
    "I learned a lot about the intelligence community in the US and how it relates to the 3 branches of the government. I also gained analytical skills as well",
    "Identify intelligence failures, US history from the intelligence communitys perspective",
    "I learned about the intelligence process, about many of the pitfalls and mistakes made over the history of the intelligence community, and about reforms made after 9\/11.",
    "How to efficiently and effectively think through problems, relating to real life \/ historical foreign policy and intelligence community problems.",
    "We learned about the practices, structure, and dilemmas within the U.S. intelligence community. The course works from a historical and legal foundation to help students interpret current events from an intelligence perspective.",
    "I learned about the US intelligence community through various historical and contemporary case studies, intelligence failures, how the IC is organized, and challenges for future reform.",
    "How the intelligence community works (failures, successes) and what the intelligence community prioritizes. Also learned about some of the major events in US foreign policy from an intelligence perspective",
    "I learned the history, failures, and structure of the US Intelligence Community, with a focus on the involvement of the IC since 9\/11 and its relation to American Foreign Policy.",
    "This is one of the best courses Ive taken at Yale by far. TW is such a great Professor and teacher who can actually teach you applicable and interesting things. Yale is extremely impractical and uninteresting in many of its courses but this one is really a example of how courses should be.",
    "A keen understanding of the intelligence process and how it relates to and is incorporated in policymaking.",
    "I learned a lot in this course, from understanding general U.S. foreign policy to the structure of the intelligence community and how they collect information, analyze, and present that analysis to policy-makers. I developed the skills of writing a memo in a short amount of time as a senator's legislative aide. This was a very applicable experience. Professor Wittenstein read through all our mid-terms, memos, and finals, and gave us comments. We also learned about case studies that point to specific intelligence failures, and then moved on to more cyber-related issues within the intelligence community.",
    "the structure and function of the intelligence community, intelligence in connection with foreign policy, analyzed past intelligence failures and successes, discussed current and future challenges facing the intelligence community. learned to write an intelligence memo.",
    "This was a fantastic course, an excellent overview of the intelligence community and how it has affected the United States while teaching students the necessary skills to think critically and analyze current intelligence situations. Ted did an awesome job of incorporating current events and tying them into the material and analysis built into the course."

   "comments": [
    "This course's strengths include the content and Professor Wittenstein's expertise on the subjects. The course also related very heavily to current events in the United States, which was a unique strength of the course.",
    "None.",
    "Strengths: Professor Wittenstein is a really kind and engaging and clearly knows a lot about the subject and is passionate about it. The subject was well taught and the lectures were interesting. Course was well-structured for feedback. Weaknesses: I wish there was more of a common thread of the course or more definitive \"takeaways\". I felt like I was learning a lot but was struggling to understand where it all matched up and how I could apply this knowledge. I also wish there were more assignments or opportunities to apply the knowledge\/ apply the readings.",
    "The course is very well organized, Professor Wittenstein is an AMAZING lecturer, and the content is taught in a very accessible way. You get good feedback throughout the course from both Professor Wittenstein and your TF. As an international student who was not as well-versed with some of the events discussed during the course, there was a bit of a learning curve there catching up on basic knowledge on those incidents, but I wanted to learn more about it anyway so it was a good opportunity. The course provided a good selection of readings to do so as well.",
    "There are so many strengths of this course - Professor Wittenstein is one of the best professors I have had and this was my favorite class that I've taken at Yale. The readings are incredibly interesting, and there isn't a lot of work required. In terms of weaknesses, I can't think of many! Sometimes the readings can be a lot (e.g. the 9\/11 commission report was 900 pages long), and it would've been helpful if Professor Wittenstein had marked on the syllabus which sections we should emphasize more than others because I did not have the time or energy to read the entire thing and didn't find it all that necessary to.",
    "Wittenstein is a great professor, and the guests he invited were equally compelling. No improvements.",
    "Professor Wittenstein is great at communicating very complex ideas into consumable pieces of information. It's great.",
    "i think some more depth in the material could be interesting, but i understand that intelligence matters are hard to study",
    "This course was very intriguing as it covered a variety of recent topics which I found to be simultaneously exciting and intellectually challenging. The syllabus was well curated and I genuinely enjoyed doing many of the readings. Furthermore, the outside speakers brought into lecture added a whole new level of depth to students' understanding. I loved attending the lectures and learned so much from Professor Wittenstein that I would have preferred to experience a similar edition of the class in a seminar format. The quality of the discussions in section were good but I believe the course would be even better if taught as a seminar.",
    "This course is very interesting and the workload is not overwhelming, and Professor Wittenstein is fantastic!",
    "Interesting thematic lectures. Ted is an engaging lecturer who encourages class participation.",
    "This course is very interesting and relevant to today. Lectures are extremely engaging and organized; assignments and grading are clear. The overall structure of the course is logical and it was easy to understand the progression of concepts throughout the semester.",
    "This course is engaging and both Professor Wittenstein and Cara were great!",
    "Very interesting course material, nice lectures, professor knew what he was teaching about and was a great guy. Only complaints are that we didnt get grades back quickly after big assignments and the readings were not very necessary.",
    "Strengths: Ted, the TFs (Adam is great), the material, lecture is actually really fun, guest speakers Weaknesses: If there was a way to have clearer instructions on what a memo should look like, or more opportunities to practice the memo exercise. I found it a bit frustrating that I received my grade and would not have an opportunity to amend it. While I received very clear feedback, I would have appreciated more chances to improve, but this presents the inherent challenge of not receiving as clear feedback from Ted. Also, the sample memo offered seemed to have a couple significant flaws- for example, Adam explained that is was odd the sample memo used numbers. Also, when comparing my section to others, I think they should all take a page out of Adams book and focus more on discussion of general material and less specific readings.",
    "Really good class. easy to follow, clear lectures, good sections",
    "Professor Wittenstein is an amazing lecturer, who really cares about making the course material interesting and engaging for the class. The layout of the course is really great too.",
    "The course is straight-forward and intellectually accessible to students from a variety of backgrounds.",
    "Prof. Wittenstein is a good lecturer and the content was generally interesting and well-organized. Sometimes the lectures got a bit repetitive and reading off the slides, and often the lecture would cover the readings in a way that made the readings unnecessary. Readings were mostly interesting but still very long. Assignment-wise, the workload was not too bad. I strongly disliked section - the TA (Cara) was almost always late, we were always running behind, and it was not engaging or beneficial to my learning.",
    "Would have liked to talk more about current events both in lectures and in sections",
    "I can't think of many weaknesses of this course. Ted and the TAs do a great job at presenting the information and main ideas and facilitating discussion both in class and in section.",
    "The course was great overall, TFs were especially awesome.",
    "Strength: -posting lectures online -TA sessions Weakness: -more connection between reading and lectures (sometimes) -sometimes it was difficult to identify key themes",
    "I believe the course is strong in its ability to assess the entirety of the history of American intelligence, and I think needs no improvementit's a great class!",
    "Strength: Professor Wittenstein. He is a great professor. The strength of the coursework itself were the readings. They were a bit long sometimes, but reading long texts in a short amount of time is a good skill. The two lectures per week were very engaging, and the TFs in the discussions were very top quality. Professor's Wittenstein's knowledge of the topic, his first-hand experience in the field, and his skills as a speaker are the best qualities of this course. Weakness: The discussion sections were sometimes tiring after long class days, not because of the TFs, but because how the discussions were structured. Discussions were more like extended review sessions for the midterm.",
    "I feel like this could be a more engaging course if it were smaller."

    "YES! Prof. Wittenstein is the BEST and very engaged and knowledgeable. He cares about his students and is clearly excited about what he teaches. Fascinating subject also -- very glad I took this course!",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. It was very interesting and not a lot of work,",
    "I recommend this course to anyone who is in touch with reality.",
    "GLBL 392 is a must take course for anyone in the policy world. Whether you are studying domestic political relations or international affairs and foreign policy, basic knowledge of the intelligence community is necessary. Professor Wittenstein's intelligence and legal background provides a very interesting insight into the profession.",
    "Must take.",
    "Highly recommend - very engaging and important information any student should know given today's circumstances.",
    "yes errytime",
    "Yes! Especially if you're interested in the subject. It is not an easy course or gut at all, but it's low work and not very strenuous. You will think about America differently and in general it's a good, focused course on a subject we should all be familiar with.",
    "Definitely!! I really enjoyed the experience. It's a great course and I would recommend it to anyone regardless of major.",
    "Yes! Great class and extremely interesting!",
    "10000%! Professor Wittenstein is so amazing and reads\/comments on all of your assignments. This class is a lecture, but feels so small and comfortable. We always referenced historical things in our lectures, while also discussing current events. I loved this class so much",
    "I would certainly recommend this course. If you have an interest in foriegn policy, intelligence, national security, or defense, this course is excellent.",
    "If you are interested in the CIA, NSA, or FBI, this course if for you.",
    "yes. it is a fun intro course about intelligence in the US",
    "I would recommend this course to any student who is remotely interested in the intelligence community or foreign policy. The material in the course is accessible but still complex enough so as to be intellectually stimulating.",
    "I took this as a credit\/D because it is an interesting subject that I had no prior knowledge of and needed a fifth class. There are a lot of readings that must be looked at in order to contribute in section, and the course itself was very fair, so I probably should have taken it for a grade. The course is very interesting if you're into the subject, and Professor Wittenstein is awesome!! I would definitely recommend.",
    "Yes! Even if you are not interested in foreign affairs, which I am not, it is still a really cool course and you learn valuable and relevant information. It pushes you to analyze past and present national security issues we have all heard of, like 9\/11, in new and interesting ways.",
    "Yes if you are interested in the topic this is a great class!",
    "Yes! Especially if they are either interested in the course material or plan to work in the government in some capacity when they graduate (military, IC, justice dept, state dept or other foreign relations job, public office even, etc)",
    "Absolutely take this class! Professor Wittenstein is a gem and his lectures were always beyond interesting, engaging and valuable. The class is such an interesting way to learn more about American foreign policy and about a branch of the country's government that we don't normally know about due to its clandestine nature. Readings were for the most part very doable and helpful for understanding the material, and the midterm, final paper, and assignment were all manageable as well.",
    "Yes if you like American history, engaging professors, or dream of joining the CIA!",
    "Great class. Pretty easy most of the way.",
    "absolutely, Professor Wittenstein is a great Professor.",
    "The course is a great opportunity for those seeking a career in foreign policy and security.",
    "Yes, I would recommend the course with the right TA. Overall, the class is very interesting and I learned a lot about the intelligence community. There are not too many assignments, and while the readings can be a lot during certain weeks, they are actually pretty enjoyable. Section, on the other hand, needs a lot of work. Our TA, Cara, was disorganized, showed up late most times, talked (more like ranted) for half the section, and kept us late. If you get a good TA, I'd wholeheartedly recommend the course.",
    "Would recommend if you want to learn about a cool topic and don't want to stress too much!",
    "Not really. I felt as though the content I learned was repeated throughout the entire course",
    "As a STEM major, I felt completely comfortable in this class and would recommend it to anyone who any interest in the intelligence community or wants a crash course on recent US foreign policy.",
    "Yea I already have",
    "Yes! Anyone interested in intelligence, American history, or foreign policy ought to take this course.",
    "Yes, absolutely. It is a great way to learn about U.S. foreign policy, and Professor Wittenstein is a skilled lecturer. I would recommend anyone who is even slightly interested in the topic to take this course.",
    "Yes, but only if you're really interested in the subject matter. There's a lot of readings and sometimes the content is really technical.",
    "Yes, this was an excellent course and I would highly recommend it to any student looking to learn more about current affairs, to delve into the workings of the intelligence community, or simply be able to critically analyze and speak eloquently on current events."
