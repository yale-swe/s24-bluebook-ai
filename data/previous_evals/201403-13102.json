   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this class to freshman who want to get started on college-level writing",
    "I would recommend it to another student ONLY if they are interested in the topic. It is an excellent class if the topic sounds appealing.",
    "The class is a perfect introduction for those who truly have an interest in how our food is produced.",
    "The way policy was presented in this class made the writing component frustrating. I do feel that I learned a great deal about the workings and condition of the food system and food policy, but the sources were rather biased. While the bias was acknowledged, it was difficult to write confident papers given the lack of variety of opinions covered in class.",
    "In English 114 24, we discuss food politics and culture in the United States; we look at how the Farm Bill affects health, wealth, political policy, and international relations. I would recommend this course - what an interesting subject!",
    "I would recommend that anyone looking to take an English 114 class seriously consider which topic is right for them. In the beginning of this class, I did not enjoy the reading. I grew to like the topic, but it would have made the class way more enjoyable if the topic was something that I had loved and wanted to write about.",
    "A great writing class that strengthens discussion and critical analysis. Dr. Stuart is a great instructor that engages wih her students. I would recommend this class for anyone looking to improve their critical reading, analysis, and those who want to improve research paper writing.",
    "You'll learn about a lot of topics at a VERY cursory level and never go in depth. Good if you're interested in the politics side of food. Do not take if you're solely interested in nutrition (we never learned anything except \"fat isn't as bad as you think, and sugar is 'worse.'\" We ate a giant apple pie on the last day of the class..."
