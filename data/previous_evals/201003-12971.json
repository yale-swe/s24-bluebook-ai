    "Yes!",
    "Yes I would, it is a helpful language to know, especially given that India is becoming more prevalent in our work life. The instructors understand that it is difficult to learn an entire script and are patient, but it does require perseverance from the student's side.",
    "If you want to learn Hindi or are looking for a relatively easy yet fun way to fulfill a language requirement I would definitely take Hindi. I thought that it would be a pain to go to this class 5 times a week but I loved it. Its a really relaxing learning environment. That being said, if you want to become proficient in Hindi in a really short amount of time, this probably isn't the best way to do it because the class is somewhat unfocused at times.",
    "I would highly recommend Hindi 110 to those wanting to thoroughly learn a language in a \"chill\" environment. I loved the course and believe I learned a lot throughout the semester. Take it!!"
