    "Group work was so important. I learned a lot about how to work well and not well in a group. You need to learn to leverage your group to generate better ideas than any one person could.",
    "It was focused a lot on group work and I learned this was a very important part of the success of a project. I enjoyed working with diverse groups. I struggled during the final project lacking an engineer and only having 3 of us. It's clear how important it is to have diverse members.",
    "Some groups were great. Finding a time to meet with some students was very tough. Better to set up a \"lab time\" in the syllabus so students can block the time from the beginning of the semester.",
    "The workload is too great to do independently, which makes group work necessary. But sometimes the team dynamics impeded projects. Some students obviously pick up on the creative process faster than others, and randomly joining students together makes it difficult to function on the higher level that's necessary."

    "Interesting course.",
    "Be prepared to invest a lot of time toward the end of the semester.",
    "You won't actually learn any green engineering or sustainable design. Very broad overview of LCA, cradle-to-cradle design, but not actually how to implement it. There was a single class about different material types in the second half of the semester, not even taught by the professors and only occurred because the students requested it. Grading of group projects are much more aesthetic rather than functional. Final projects challengers were very weak. Professors give you a hard time for not laughing at their jokes and then get told you're not enthusiastic. When students gave feedback that it was odd that we had to print out assignments in order to hand them in, we were also given a hard time. No individual projects is a missed opportunity for students to take large risks. Wildly inconsistent grading makes it hard to care about any assignment. Working with classmates make or break this class since lectures are pretty worthless, so take it with friends.",
    "Be prepared to dedicate significant time to the course. Make sure you fill out the surveys to get matched with a good partner.",
    "A great course, but way too much workload to take in the second semester of your senior year. Other course loads will suffer."
