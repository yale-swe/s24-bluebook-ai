   "comments": [
    "This course was pretty fantastic. It allowed me to explore new artistic mediums in an experimental way and gave me the space to try my hand at abstract art. I wish there had been more of a balance between critiques and making art during the class (it was weighted too heavily towards critique). I especially loved the field trips to the art museum and graduate art exhibit. If you need this course for your major, take advantage of it, but if you're just interested in taking an art class, I might take one that appeals to your specific interests.",
    "It's a creative process",
    "Visual Thinking is definitely a good introductory course in art if you want to think about form and composition, especially if you don't have prior drawing\/technical training.",
    "Visual Thinking is a prerequisite for the Art Major. It is a studio class that deals with sculpture, video, photography, drawing, collage, and other mediums. Grades are based on critiques, participation, and the art that you produce. Visual thinking is great if you have never taken an art class before as it does not require you to have prior skill or knowledge in art and if you care about learning in the class, you will become a more thoughtful artist.",
    "Take it, if you're an art major, because you have to AND because it's fun. Take it, if you're not an art major, because it's a good intro to, thinking about and making art.",
    "I would recommend the class to someone who is already a decided art major with some experience.",
    "Visual Thinking introduces you to looking at artwork and analyzing the form and composition in work whether it be painting or sculpture or collage. I definitely would recommend this class especially to people who feel they don't know how to analyze artwork.",
    "It is a very useful class for art majors. It might get a bit too abstract if you're not a major. The classes are getting boring sometimes because the in-class assignments are not too specific.",
    "Visual Thinking is a fun, somewhat relaxing (sometimes stressful because assignments can be odd), class that really teaches you the fundamentals of design and how to be creative."
