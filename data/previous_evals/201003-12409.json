    "Yes. Take the course because Portuguese and Brazilian culture is amazing, there is such a rich literary tradition! Also Brazil is rising to become a major player on the world stage.",
    "This is definitely the most disorganized and haphazard course I have ever taken. The course packet is the [very]rough draft of a book, which makes it nearly impossible to use as a reference guide. It is so overloaded with extraneous dialogues that you can't use it for meaningful grammar review, and the class spent most of its time reciting lines from those dialogues. Each subsequent student at the table would monotonously read one line of text (without grasping what the text said) and then the next person would read the next line. We spent more time learning about food, clothes, random songs on YouTube (which no one could understand anyway because we didn't know enough Portuguese), and memorizing lines of poetry than we should have. I needed grammar review and meaningful oral instruction, not videos on extreme sports in Brazil, lessons on how to make bean stews, and rote memorization of poems.In short, the only way I learned basic Level One grammar was by buying a book and using it for review independently. This course's saving grace is that the lectors teaching the course were very friendly and were willing to help when you had questions. The class teaches Brazilian Portuguese, so buyer beware if you're looking to go to Portugal.Your success in this class wholly depends on a.) your innate ability learning a new language, and b.) your willingness to learn the language on your own.",
    "Yes. It is fun.",
    "If you want to take portuguese, take it!",
    "Elementary Portuguese is a very good class. What I really liked about it was that, apart from learning a foreign language, I also got to know a lot of interesting facts about Brazilian culture. Although the class meets every day, the work is never too much. The only drawback of the course was the lack of organization at some points and the slow pace in grammar (although vocabulary goes really fast). Professor Jackson was great!",
    "Professor Jackson is energetic and likes to do fun activities on the internet duing class, such as looking at websites about what we are studying that day and listening to Portuguese poems and songs on youtube. You will get a lot of practice every day and will learn a lot; at the end of the semester I realized I knew a lot more than I thought I did.",
    "yes! such a fun class and beautiful language.",
    "This is a very laid back language class that will be easy if you already speak Spanish (if you don't, good luck, because you don't actually learn the grammar in a super organized way). The only major problem was that Professor Jackson has a really strong gringo accent (he's not a native speaker) so if you're looking to gain oral fluency I might try to get into Marta's class."
