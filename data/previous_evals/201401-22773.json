    "- broad examination of developmental biology, with in-depth analysis of how each sub-field evolved and of the current issues and literature- seminar format with in-depth paper discussions- would recommend to other MCDG first-years",
    "I don't think I would recommend the course unless Steve was the TA again. Honestly, it was kind of a mash-up of random lectures loosely under \"developmental\" biology that were disconnected and, for the most part, not particularly engaging. The lectures were basically a return to undergrad, but with less capable teaching. Clearly, the faculty in charge know their stuff, but (equally clearly) teaching these lectures is not their priority. Further, it seems to me that the paper discussions are where the real learning happens, and where the type of thinking that will make us be good scientists happens.",
    "I would recommend to another student because the material is fundamental to many aspects of biology."

    "I have a greatappreciation for the complexities of developmental processes and how they work together, and I understand the kinds of questions currently being examined in the field and the techniques used to answer them.",
    "It definitely made me not want to study developmental biology, but I think that was mostly because the material isn't my thing. I think it will help me in the future, though, because it showed me what it takes to be a good TA, and showed me how a good paper discussion can be run.",
    "This course presented the foundation work and concepts of development from the perspective of genetics. As an aspiring geneticist studying brain development, the material presented here is crucial background knowledge."
