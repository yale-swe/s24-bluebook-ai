    "I would summarize it as an important reading of Walter Benjamin's most important work, out of which arose many of his other writings. It is a book about contingency and the formation of the modern metropolis, and how this bizarre form came to be. I would hope to convey the importance of the course by showing them how influential the Arcades Project was in Western philosophy.Yes, I would absolutely recommend the course.",
    "I would recommend the course, but probably only if the student already had some affection or affinity for Benjamin. If you don't enjoy his writing (a prospect which I can even really imagine), it's not for you.",
    "I would recommend this class without hesitation."

   "comments": [
    "It contributed greatly because it really framed the processes that were at work in the formation of the modern metropolis. This is essential to my argument in my thesis because I'm trying to show the way that the economy shaped the city to reproduce the conditions for that type of economy. The course examined precisely that.",
    "It was extremely useful for me, largely because of the readings"
