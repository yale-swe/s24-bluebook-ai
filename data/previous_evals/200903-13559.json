    "The financial side of land management is critical, and this course provides a good background on financial analysis. The instructor was often unclear about what assignments were due when, and the lectures wavered from the syllabus somewhat. Still, the instructor was good, and passionate about his subject.The TA, Sarah Lowery, was exceptional. She worked very hard to help us understand the material, and was very clear with expectations.",
    "4. The workload was not really hard conceptually, but it was alot in quantity. Almost too much and it wasn't very well spread out throughout the semester.",
    "A very relevant course with important financial skills needed by every land manager. The examples and case studies was focused mainly on the United States rather than having an international feel. Too much problem set questions for this level of education making the process more mechanical rather than solving real life case studies. There is a lot of topics to be covered in a relatively short time.",
    "(Regarding question 9a) The problem set assignments is the key element in this class. They are very useful but sometimes students have too many assignments in hand and the workload can be overwhelming. A little more organization is needed to ensure a better distribution of the assignments in the semester",
    "The course is an essential for understanding how the forest industry works. It was well taught and through the many out of class assignments, forced me to struggle with the concepts to better understand them."

    "A very practical course with good case studies.",
    "The homework forced me to really apply the concepts we learned. The mini project was also very useful in applying the concepts to a real life situation.",
    "It was a great introduction to the basics of financial analysis. I think it was very simplified compared to what financial analysis would be like at SOM, but for non-SOM students with an interest in using financial tools, it was a great way to start building skills\/knowledge in that area.",
    "All the practice problem sets really helped me learn the material. I could see major progress in my understanding by the end of the semester.",
    "The introduction to key investment appraisal tools like Net Present Value, Internal Rate of Return, etc. which are key in most financial analysis related to the management of natural resources.Another good thing about the course was the opportunity to undertake a mini-project in any area of interest and applying financial analysis tools to provide an evaluation of the situation and to offer recommendations.",
    "-Lloyd presents useful material, with interesting insights as support.-Lloyd's passionate and very knowledgeable about the subject.-The miniproject was the most useful assignment (second was hogwarts)",
    "forestry expertise of the professor",
    "Professor Irland is very responsive and seems to enjoy teaching the course.",
    "I am not a forester, so I learned a lot of new concepts in forestry. The course was a bit biased to plantations. I am now loaded with all the facts regarding establishment and management of plantations to maximize profit. This is cool as plantations can offer sustainable employment.",
    "The Professor is extremely knowledgeable about the subject and he even offered extra sessions of interest to the students. I found those very useful",
    "Lloyd's great attitude and teaching style.",
    "The assignments."

   "question_text": "The things about this course most in need of improvement are:",
   "comments": [
    "The instructor needs to be more clear about when assignments are due, since he wavered from the syllabus.",
    "The class should cover more concepts. I felt very frustrated by the fact that the only theories and concepts we learned were presented in the first third of the course. The rest of the course was application of those concepts, but I felt that we could have covered more material.",
    "Lloyd needs to communicate better with students his expectations, the schedule the class, assignments, etc. I found myself spending half my time on assignments just trying to decipher what he was asking us to do. The work for the class could also be more evenly dispersed rather then coming in spurts with multiple things do at once and then a week or two of nothing due.",
    "I would have liked to see more non-timber land management applications since my interest is not in timber management. I know Lloyd is a timber guy, so perhaps it's an opportunity for some guest speakers?",
    "-a few of the homework assignments should have been cut. We reached a point int he semester where we had too much due on consecutive class periods. This left little time to thoroughly read the assigned material.",
    "may consider moving the pace up a little",
    "The instructor needs to be more organized and prepared before the class.",
    "1) A better assignment distribution2) A better in-class analysis of the assignments. THe assignments by themselves are of great help but i think that more emphasis should be placed on explaining the details of the assignments and their relation to the lectures and their overall importance",
    "There were just too many assignments and they were not spread out well. Sometimes we would go two weeks without an assignment and then we would have one due every class for two weeks.Also, limiting assignments will allow students to spend more time on individual ones and grasp concepts better. Often I was so rushed that I wasn't able to conceptualize the assignment and simply messed around with the equation until i got it right.",
    "Making the lectures relevant. I learned the most from this class while wrestling with the assignments, the lectures were interesting but didn't register as much as the assignments did. The lectures gave context to the numbers used in the assignments but didn't deepen my understanding of the material.",
    "The professor fell behind in the syllabus and I feel like we didn't cover as much ground as we could have. I would have liked more emphasis on topics other than forests."

    "Lloyd was always willing to sit down with us, or answer e-mails, but I think most of the students used the TA, Sarah. She was great and more than willing to hold long office hours to help us figure out the concepts and assignments.",

    "Financial constraints are very important in the overall study of land management, and so this course was very valuable.",
    "This course provided me with some beginnings of finance that I had never learned before. It also was very applicable to forestry, which is my focus.",
    "I think learning how land management decisions are affected by financial considerations is key, so for me it was an essential skill to acquire at FESfor my future career in land management and conservation.",
    "I think the ability to make financial judgements is helpful in any environmental profession. My interest is in land conservation for water quality protection, and I feel comfortable that I now have a basic ability to allocate resources based on financial analysis.",
    "Very well. I had some prior investment appraisal experience and this course has deepened my understanding and scope of applications these powerful tools can be put to.",
    "Fits extremely well. Perhaps Lloyd should consider splitting this into two classes. One for MFs to take their first year, one the next. I think others would agree with this.",
    "As someone trying to specialize in environmental\/resource economics, this course was very useful. I learned and practiced the use of different financial metrics and how to allocate land to the most profitable use(s).",
