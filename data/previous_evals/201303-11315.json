   "comments": [
    "Absolutely take it. The group of students was awesome and diverse, the conversations were lively and actually relevant, and the readings were important and I would have liked to read them at some point in my life anyways (they ranged from Friedan to Gunnar Myrdal to William F. Buckley). Our essays, a political autobiography and a long research paper, were thoroughly explained and I thought taught me a lot about my writing andmy politics. Prof. Gage is just all around awesome, brilliant, patient, and great at leading discussions. Take it take it if you can get in.",
    "The course was excellent--take it, if you can get in. Professor Gage is an absolutely great seminar leader, providing her own insights while also facilitating discussion on the part of the students. While some background in U.S. politics is helpful, the material was easy to read. The workload is heavy--a political autobiography, weekly reading responses until November, and a research paper--but the autobiography is a great excuse for self-examination and creativity, and Prof. Gage gives a ton of guidance on the research paper. The students in the seminar all wanted to be there, so make sure to be prepared for each week's class. Overall, one of the gems of the History Department.",
    "I would definitely recommend it if you enjoy writing a lot.",
    "If you're at all interested in politics, take this. Beverly Gage is well-known in the history department for a very good reason. The readings are fascinating, and be sure to do them, as the rest of your classmates will. The final paper is incredibly intense but is a great learning experience.",
    "Take this class, it is one of the best. Professor Gage is brilliant and engaging, the readings are interesting, and you will just learn a lot. I looked forward to going to this class every week. Don't be fooled by the seeming ease of the political autobiography though, it is a pretty difficult assignment, so start early.",
    "This class is a lot of work but absolutely worth the time. If you love American politics, take this class!",
    "YES. The material is relevant to most everyone, the readings are very interesting, class discussion is always fast-paced, and Professor Gage is an amazing seminar leader. Should avoid if you have absolutely no interest in politics, but everyone else (even those with only a bit of interest) will love this class. It is history heavy, but all feels extremely relevant.",
    "It's a really amazing seminar that changed my view of politics. The reading, Professor Gage, and the discussion is awesome! One of the best classes I've taken at Yale and I highly recommend it. Gabe is also great!",
    "If you're interested in politics, this is a solid class to take. The readings are not only manageable and insightful but also enjoyable. The two main assignments -- a political autobiography and a research paper -- are also quite enjoyable. And Professor Gage is great. Just beware that with this being a course on politics and with this being Yale, the discussions had will inevitably be slanted. Professor Gage makes a sincere effort to present things objectively, but she obviously can't control what students end up saying. Just something to keep in mind.",
    "100% recommended. A must-take seminar if you're at all interested in American history or politics. The assigned readings are really some of the most important and vital writings of the past century.",
    "Absolutely. Just look at the syllabus and talk to Gage and you'll know immediately that the class is amazing.",
    "Most definitely. This is a great course with an amazing professor. I'd even say it was my favorite course in four years at Yale. Emphasis on primary readings makes it easy to do the week-to-week work. The \"political autobiography\" was a ton of fun to write, and Gage walks you through the process of writing the final paper. I picked a topic I was interested in and really enjoyed writing my paper- Gage's draft editing was also really helpful.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to someone who is interested in gaining a better understanding of how American politics has arrived at its current point. However, if you do not think you enjoy discussion about politics, this class is probably not for you.",
    "Yes",
    "Yes I would. Take it if you get in!! It really challenges your previous ideas about liberalism and conservatism. It's also never boring, which I can't say about a lot of seminars"
