   "comments": [
    "I would certainly recommend it, with the caveat that one must enjoy Shakespeare and, at the very least, not dislike opera. The class is great fun and is definitely worth taking if one is remotely interested in either subject.",
    "Good, small class with a relatively reasonable workload. During class, you mostly just discuss stuff the whole time. Would recommend if you're willing to read a lot of Shakespeare and look at it from a musical perspective and think creatively.",
    "Shakespeare and Music is an interdisciplinary, broad-ranging look at some of the uses and adaptations of music in Shakespeare, taught in a small seminar with the very talented and all-around wonderful Professor Malafronte. It really does have something for everyone: our program of study ranged from early modern instruments to Verdi, and by reading period everyone had fallen in love with at least one composer or text. The workload is light, mostly consisting of watching operas and pursuing research or creative projects of personal interest. Take it if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re a musician, Shakespeare fan, or have never read Shakespeare or played an instrument, because this class is glorious.",
    "HUMS 078a is a brilliant course that can inspire you to appreciate Shakespeare and music, independently, and together.I would recommend the class to someone looking for a fun way to read Shakespeare and analyze is work.",
    "We read a Shakespeare play then look at various musical cues in the play itself and how others have taken the plays and set it to music. Are the new settings still Shakespeare? What do you like about it, what don't you like about it? I would highly recommend this class, it is a great seminar to get Freshmen acclimated to life at Yale",
    "A beautiful mix of music, history, and literature.",
    "Shakespeare and Music is a really great freshman seminar to take!! It's not too much work, because most of the work is pretty enjoyable (watching films and operas \/ listening to music). I had no exposure to a lot of the music aspects of the course, but I didn't feel like I was at any disadvantage because of this. There was a good mix of die-hard Shakespearites and accomplished musicians, and then a couple of people like me that were somewhere in between. I would certainly recommend this course, especially because of Professor Malafronte. She's an incredible professor, very approachable and she made every single class worth going to and very fun. Also, the best part of this class was going to New York to see one of the operas (all on Yale's dime as well)! The other best part was the final projects. We were each able to choose a topic that interested us, and do a creative or academic piece on the topic we chose. Some people did compositions, while others explored the different restorations of Shakespeare's texts.",
    "I definitely would recommend this class. If you have any interest in Shakespeare at all, or in music of any kind, you will love it. It will open your eyes up to possibilities that you may have never thought to look for otherwise."
