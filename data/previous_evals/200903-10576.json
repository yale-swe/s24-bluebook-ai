    "Yes, I will recommend SEAS500 to other students, because this course is really useful, and Prof. de la Mora's teaching is really excellent.",
    "It's a class that allows students to sample a variety of topics in maths. Yes, I'd recommend it to another student.",
    "Absolutely not. If you have taken Complex Analysis before, spend your money and time on a good multilinear algebra book. Unfortunately, MATH 505 is not really better, so it is a choice between two evils.I strongly suggest the School of Engineering and Applied Science to reconsider the structure of its mathematical foundation courses. It should be one of their primary tasks to obtain instructors capable and willing to provide incoming graduate students with a sound and solid treatment of fundamental mathematical concepts, as it is expected from a distinguished graduate school and engineering program at a school like Yale.",
    "\"Math for engineers\".I would recommend the course since this course mathematically explains the basic concepts of physics.",
    "I would not recommend this class to anyone. It only presented methods on several unrelated topics in a messy way, but no real understanding of the relevant mathematics. The recipes presented for solving a certain type of problem can be learned when one comes across such a problem, but trying to summarize them without explaining why they work is, in my opinion, useless.",
    "I would first recommend students to not take the class and if required, they should be prepared to refer to external materials regarding the topic in the class. The lectures are not enough to teach the material. Also, the problem sessions with the TA are some of the only ways to determine the answers to the problems of the homework."

   "comments": [
    "This course is really helpful, because my research is mainly based on numerical simulation and mathematical analysis. This course has greatly strengthen my mathematical background.",
    "It definitely provides the mathematical tools needed for my discipline.",
    "I am most certainly ill prepared for further mathematical study, and feel the need to take an \"real\" mathematics course from the Department of Mathematics this upcoming term. In particular, I need a sound understanding of multilinear algebra, and this course failed at providing me with one. Unfortunately, this course has caused me (and, my fellow colleagues in class) much distress and has served little use in our academic careers.",
    "This course did not deepen any knowledge, but provided some superficial fragments of information on a few topics.",
    "At this point, the material presented in the class will have very little influence, if any, on my future research."
