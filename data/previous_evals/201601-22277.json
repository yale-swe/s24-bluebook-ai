    "Stellar Dynamics is a must take for any student in the astronomy department, and should be a required course. Even if you are not interested in dynamics, it has applications to a lot of different parts of astronomy, especially exoplanets and galaxies. The topics covered in this course will be useful for any field of astronomy. You can't take it without understanding that it will be a huge time commitment, which Marla quite clearly conveyed in the first lecture.",
