    "If you take this class, take it seriously. I didn't, and I felt like I got very little out of what was, in fact, a pretty good course. It was at 9am this year--if you can't focus that early, don't take it. You write one ~1000 word prompt every two weeks, with extensive editing from the professor in between, and read excerpts from a course packet. The editing and professor's comments were very thorough and useful, and grades were based on the final draft.",
    "Take this course if you want to write all sorts of French texts and learn a lot about French literature without taking a French literature class. I absolutely loved it. It can be quite challenging at times, as some of the French texts can be hard to understand.",
    "definitely a class to take if you're looking to improve your writing",
    "You do the short readings, come prepared to discuss in class and then write a paper about every two weeks. I would definitely recommend this class to any french major looking to fulfill their requirements and even non majors who just want to practice their writing. This course was intensive on writing, but nothing that Jonathan asked for was unreasonable."
