    "A better understanding of the language, particularly grammar and some more vocabulary to build on my L1 knowledge",
    "This course helped me to develop my Spanish speaking, writing, and reading skills.",
    "I learned a lot of Spanish, and how to communicate complicated ideas with elementary grammar and vocabulary.",
    "I gained a lot speaking wise and learned a lot of grammatical and vocabulary skills",
    "This course helped me build a connection to the Spanish language. I began to understand connections between English and Spanish through this course.",
    "I feel like I built upon my previous Spanish knowledge by learning how to read and discuss Spanish literature, as well as learning the classic vocab and grammar skills. We went through a LOT of grammar, so I am unsure of how solid my grasp on all of it is, but I do think I can use tenses relatively seamlessly in conversation and in writing, which is very much an L2 skill.",
    "I gained a good understanding of the concepts of Spanish needed for basic survival in the Spanish-speaking world, and about its literature and culture.",
    "I advanced my Spanish language skills and learned more about the culture and history of Spanish-speaking countries.",
    "I gained a huge amount of vocabulary across a variety of topics, as well as knowledge of some of the key, everyday tenses and grammatical structures used in Spanish like the imperfect tense and the past participle. I also enjoyed learning in detail about the Galapagos Islands for which I had to do a presentations. A couple of key skills I feel I really developed were my speaking and reading ability, the latter developed through having to read numerous short stories in Spanish."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "It has a good amount of evaluations, though sometimes they feel like a lot.",
    "A huge strength to this course is that it is very engaging. I loved the structure and style of the course and I think it is designed very well to help students develop proficiency in Spanish.",
    "The strengths were the teacher and the activities that we did while the weaknesses were the assessments and the readings.",
    "Strengths: Prof. Alexandrov is FANTASTIC, and the course is well-organized for student learning. Textbook is good and quizzes\/exams are challenging but fair. Weaknesses: Supersite homework never helped me understand concepts much, and I felt like the course wasn't organized well at the end to prepare us for the final -- we were reading literature up until a day or so before the last exam, and we had learned the grammar it covered awhile back.",
    "I think the strengths of this course include the firm structure and regular assignments that facilitated steady learning. I can't identify any aspect I feel the course needs improvement.",
    "I thought a strength of the course was the regular testing. It ensured I continued to work hard throughout the semester and learnt all the content. It also meant there was not a huge spike in work at any point. A key weakness for me was probably the expense of it; the textbook and workbook cost $230 which was more than double any other course I took and the book felt rather dated given the cost. Another strength was the class size; at 12 people I felt like I really got to know my class mates which was wonderful."

   "comments": [
    "Yes. It enhances your knowledge of Spanish quite significantly, even though it is quite challenging to keep up with the worklaod",
    "Yes, absolutely! My overall improvement was beyond my highest expectations, especially considering how little I felt like I knew leaving L1. A very worthwhile course, especially if you're able to take it with Profesora Alexandrov. She's an absolute gemmy day was always made better having been in her class. Undoubtedly, my favorite professor at Yale.",
    "Absolutely, I love the Spanish language and Professor Alexandrov is the best Spanish professor I've ever had.",
    "Yes, this course is useful for people who want to improve their Spanish and bond with other students through small classes.",
    "Yes, it's a good option for the language requirement. L2 is significantly harder than L1 but you learn a lot more\/it's more rewarding. Prof. Alexandrov is truly the best Yale's Spanish department has to offer, and she will make the more tedious parts of the course (and, by design, there are some) as painless as possible. Can't recommend her\/her section enough.",
    "Yes; I feel the course has greatly expanded my Spanish vocabulary and developed my skill in spheres of grammar, speaking, and cultural awareness.",
    "Yes, especially with Professor Alexandrov. I always looked forward to the class and learnt a lot with every lesson, and I am sure everyone else did too. With regular work you will develop your skills from L1 considerably and find yourself, by the end of the semester, really able to have a conversation in another language - albeit a broken one."
