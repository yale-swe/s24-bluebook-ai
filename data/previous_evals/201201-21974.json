    "While English Literature and the French Revolution does have an amazing reading list, this seminar is the kind of class you take because you want to study under a particular professor. If you care about the books on the syllabus, then take the class. If you don't care about the books on the syllabus, still consider taking the class because Professor Bromwich is awesome. He's the best seminar leader that I have had at Yale by far. He gives students ample space to make their own comments, and he always addresses those comments directly and takes them in fascinating directions. I don't think a professor could know his or her material better than Professor Bromwich knows this material. He is a joy to listen to. Writing the final essay was continually frustrating, but all of the frustration surrounding the paper was worth it just to take a class with Professor Bromwich. I never got the sense that he had a particular thesis he was trying to enforce on students. He always made interesting comments, but seminar was a space in which he made comments in order to draw out the most interesting comments that his students could make. My only issue was that Professor Bromwich takes a pretty hands off approach when it comes to offering guidance on essays. I wish he had required students to submit more of their work at regular intervals throughout the semester.",
    "A lot of reading, but very unfocused discussion. Most certainly would not recommend. The professor is clearly brilliant, but seemed unable to communicate his brilliant thoughts about the reading to 85% of the students. The course was also badly disorganized. The syllabus was rarely accurate. We usually didn't know what we were supposed to read until Sunday night two days before a class meeting. Worst of all, the syllabus neglected to mention that there was a final exam on top of a term paper. The final wasn't horrible, but still. The professor only made its existence clear to the class at the end of March.",
    "I liked the class, although I wish discussions had been more lively. The class was unusually quiet, perhaps because it was at 9:00 am. Bromwich is very smart and exacting, and he's good to talk to outside of class, too. I might have liked more discussion of the French Revolution as a unifying thread throughout the class, but the readings, which had seemed disparate, all came together in the end. Bromwich really is very much worth taking a class with.",
    "This is an awesome class, particularly for a pre-1800 requirement. Professor Bromwich is engaging, super smart, and clearly a motivated professor. The readings are very interesting, though the course is definitely based around close readings, and not necessarily an overarching \"thesis.\"",
    "A rigorous, challenging survey of Romantic poetry and its broader political and intellectual implications. The reading is hard but manageable, and class sessions are quiet but smart. The assignments are well-designed."
