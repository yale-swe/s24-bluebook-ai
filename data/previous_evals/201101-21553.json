    "This course is a LOT of work. The problem sets take 8-15+ hours depending on how many impossible questions there are (i.e. most of the questions are rather straightforward albeit a pain to write up, but a few on each assignment will force you to think for hours and possibly get no result), and one is due every week. Definitely made my Thursday nights miserable and stressful. If you dislike proofs and mathematical thinking, you will probably crumble and do poorly no matter how hard you try. Most people in this class are hard-core and so doing very well is even harder. As a person who skipped Math 250, I still did well, but probably only because of my extensive math background from contest training. If you're thinking Econ-Math, you are stuck with this, so as some consolation, Professor Feiszli is nice and actually quite engaging considering it's a math lecture. His tests are fair and although the overall course is a bit disorganized (the classesv2 website is not that well maintained), it's very clear what material you have to study.",
    "Yes, highly recommended!!! Take it and get a sense of the beauty of rigor in mathematics.",
    "You'll drop a pair",
    "This course was very well-taught and interesting, even before taking into consideration that it was a math course. I would recommend it to those with strong quantitative abilities and so long as Feiszli is teaching.",
    "Good class if you want to study analysis",
    "It is a really hard and challenging class. Problem sets take 10-20 hours, but the class is worth it because you develop a greater appreciation of mathematical theory and thinking.",
    "Maybe I'm weird, but I really liked analysis. If you don't know what it is, it's just going back and defining calculus very carefully and rigorously. So in this class you prove things that you've already learned to be true, some of them quite \"obvious\" (like the Intermediate Value Theorem). I think it's really interesting, and I really liked this class. But I suspect for lots of people this class is required. It's not really that bad, it's just many rigorous proofs (that's all the homeworks and the exams are). You'll really know how to do a proof after this class. And if you can, try to take this class with Professor Feiszli. He's one of the best math professors I've had here. He is great at explaining things. I'd say the workload for this class is slightly higher than usual. But I feel that his tests are quite fair.",
    "Math I had taken:math 120math 222math 250math 300 is a great intro to analysis. its not 301, so its not as hard, but you end up in 305 anyways if you continue on. according to Feiszli, who was our professor:\"the difference between this class [300]and 301 is that in 301, Peter Jones tortures you, and in 300, I torture you\"So if you were planning on taking analysis to begin with it really depends on where it fits into your schedule. If you're really really intense take 301. If you're just looking to gain some fulfillment by taking analysis take 300. I definitely enjoyed the class despite the work and would strongly recommend it to anyone remotely interested, especially if Feiszli is teaching",
    "Math 300 takes everything I learned in Calculus that I was happy to blindly accept as true, and makes me prove it all. It is extremely difficult if, like me, proofs do not come easily to you. Problem sets are very time consuming. Only take it if it is required.",
    "I would recommend taking it but only if you have enough time to put a lot of work into it.",
    "A solid class, good professor but the material is kind of boring.",
    "In Math 300, you\u0092ll build calculus from the ground up: You start by carefully defining the real numbers, and you\u0092ll soon end up proving all the major theorems that you learned about in high school calculus. The subject material gets cooler and cooler throughout the semester, but also more and more demanding. Make sure you have a lot of time to put into this class, since the weekly homework can take up to 15 hours---definitely not something to start the night before it\u0092s due. I would recommend this class to anyone who really wants to solidify their proof-writing skills and to get a sense of how delicate and powerful calculus can be.",
    "Analysis has the potential to be a torture chamber; luckily with Feiszli it wasn't. I thought it was significantly easier than Math 250, though at times the course can feel a bit dry. Overall a good course.",
    "This was the class I was most afraid of for my entire Yale career and it ended up being really fun. They call it boot camp, but it can be quite enjoyable.",
    "250 will be a great preparation for this class.",
    "Analysis is incredibly well-taught (with professor Feiszli). The professor is very focused on ensuring that students understand new concepts, and the tests are fair.At the same time, like many math\/QR classes at Yale it\u0092s definitely the type of class that tries to \u0093weed\u0094 students out. Perhaps that\u0092s more of an issue with the department; I\u0092m not sure. Problem sets are incredibly helpful and having two midterms is actually a blessing more than a curse.",
    "It's required for math majors so there's really no need to recommend it if you're a math major. If you have the choice to take it with Feiszli or a different professor, though, I would definitely take it with Feiszli. He's one of the rare professors in the math department who seems like a real human being. He gives great lectures and the homework and tests are tough but reasonable.",
    "Math 300 is one of the better mathematics courses I\u0092ve taken at Yale. Topics in Analysis has the reputation of being a really hard class; however, I\u0092ve found that with practice and thinking critically about the material, the course really isn\u0092t as hard as it\u0092s made out to be. For those of you who don\u0092t know what analysis is, I\u0092ll give a quick explanation. In this class, you will prove the theory behind calculus; by the time this class is over, you will know what convergence, limits, differentiation, integration, and function spaces are much better than your current understanding from taking high school or college calculus. This class certainly forces students to think more critically about what mathematics is, specifically calculus, and teaches students how to write and read rigorous mathematics proofs. Professor Feiszli is really an excellent instructor: he is patient, a good lecturer, and has a good understanding of what parts of the curriculum are likely to be difficult and which parts lessdifficult. Professor Feiszli clearly cares about his students and making sure that they understand the material being taught. Problem sets for this course ranged between 6 and 12 hours and were usually reasonable in terms of difficulty, especially when working with a study group to solve the hardest questions. Examinations for the class were, for the most part, very fair with two slightly easier than expected midterms and a really difficult final examination. I would without reservation recommend this class to any student with a genuine interest in the more theoretical side of mathematics (including those who want to have a more solid understanding of single variable calculus) and to those students for which this course is required for their major. I would recommend that mathematics majors take Math 301a instead as that is likely a better introduction to what one is expected to do in other analysis courses numbered higher than 301. I also think that it is important to note that there is a wide array of mathematics ability and background represented in the students enrolling in the course at the beginning of the semester which can be kind of intimidating for students with a weaker background in theoretical mathematics. I assure you that you shouldn\u0092t be intimidated by this since Professor Feiszli is good at leveling the playing field by giving clear guidance on the more theoretical parts of the course. I am giving this class an overall rating of \u0093very good\u0094; I think it is important to note that this class has the potential to be \u0093excellent\u0094 if some slight modifications are made, but given the high quality Yale should expect out of its courses, this class falls short of the threshold, though I still did learn a lot from this class and have gained a new appreciation for mathematics.",
    "I thought it was a really good class. Professor is really good about explaining things and we really built everything from the ground up. If you're looking for a class thats going to have a lot of repetition in the same types of problems, this is not a good class for you. But, if you're looking for a class that doesn't use many numbers or have a lot of computation and instead does a lot of proofs, it's a good class.",
    "I would definitely recommend the class as well as the instructor. It is an introductory class on analysis but it is challenging and taught at a more advanced level. Assignments take quite a bit of time but are extremely helpful to practice the material. Students should have solid background in calculus. Depending on each student's background the workload could be quite heavy."
