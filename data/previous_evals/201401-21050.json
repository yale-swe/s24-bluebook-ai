    "I would recommend this class it doesn't have too much reading, just lots of TV and movies. More psychology based than I expected, but still good!",
    "This is a great class that combines many disciplines: american studies, film studies, psychology, and even philosophy. The TV shows and movies are very well chosen, and the class builds a very strong foundation for discussing the television shows and movies shown later in the semester. This class is really about trauma, so don't take it unless you are prepared for that. The class was a little big this semester, so it made it a bit hard to have discussions. Overall, this class is interesting and informative.",
    "Yes, I would if you want to learn about trauma theory. The readings are, for the most part, really interesting, as are the movies\/shows we have to watch. My one biggest complaint about the class was that we spent so little time discussing the movies\/shows--sometimes as little as 10 minutes for an entire season. I felt like I wasted so much time (13 hours) watching a season, and then although my viewing of the show would have greatly benefited from class discussion, we never did. I was really disappointed by that.",
    "A cool course. If you're down for some depressing conversations, you get to talk about the nature of trauma and then how it is represented in film and TV. Not too bad of a workload--weekly readings, one midterm paper on trauma and one final 15-20 page paper on a particular American trauma and a movie\/TV show portraying it. Interesting, if sometimes repetitive discussions about trauma itself and then about specific traumas in film, like Vietnam, the Holocaust, 9\/11. Dean Muller is great in class, enthusiastic and super knowledgeable and approachable, but also very strict on deadlines and expectations. It's fun to talk about TV and film in an academic setting!",
    "If you're looking for an interesting, fun fifth class, this is a good seminar. Class discussion is good, and the workload is very manageable. You'll enjoy the class far more if you choose a final paper topic that you can really get excited about researching (final paper is 15-20 pages). You definitely don't have to be an American Studies major to follow along or do well.",
    "It's a great class! It was new this year and needs some work structurally. We barely got to talk about the films\/tv shows each week, but the readings and conceptual topics were really interesting as well. It starts out like a psych course and then evolves into something that straddles anthro, sociology, and media studies. Overall a great idea, though.",
    "Right now, it's more trauma than television or film, especially until the midterm. This disappointed me, but I still recommend this course. Not only will you watch great TV and movies and talk about them in ways you don't often get to at Yale, but you will also learn about the role of media in processing and understanding traumatic events on all scales from the personal to the global. The midterm paper is not as much fun to write as I would have hoped in a class with such a rich and intersectional topic; we were limited to \"defining trauma\" which felt like regurgitation of course readings and maybe should have been more of a reading response-sized assignment. BUT the final paper is great and you have a lot of freedom with your topic. Muller makes herself available to help and is always interested in talking TV with her students. The course as it stands now is a little light on film studies and TV studies components, so if you lack background in those areas, you have some ground to make up when final paper time comes. Take it with a friend or two because viewing is all on your own.",
    "If you're interested in discussing American traumatic events--individual, collective, and cultural--from a psychological and cultural perspective, then this class is very interesting and informative. The workload isn't too heavy and Professor Muller is an engaging and kind instructor who cares about her students. It's also fun to watch T.V. shows and movies for a class. Definitely shop it and if the material interests you, then go for it!"
