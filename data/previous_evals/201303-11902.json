    "DEFINITELY. This class ruled. Very interesting and relevant material that will affect your perspective on health and change the way you participate in media consumption.",
    "Media and Medicine explores the ways the media has shaped our perception of medicine. You'll learn about the influence of advertising, TV, film, celebrities and more on our assumptions about hospitals, researchers and doctors. It will reshape the way you view certain topics. It's really interesting and not a lot of work. Take it if you need a 5th class and are remotely interested in the subject.",
    "Media& Medicine is a very interesting class! I would recommend it to any student, pre-med or not, because it talks about how the media shapes public perception and affects many parts of life. I enjoyed learning in this class.",
    "take this class. it's a great class, but grading is harsh",
    "1) First of all, hold no illusions: Med&Med is a HISTORY class. It's not a marketing class. It's not sociology. It's history.2) Warner is a great history professor. His lectures are interesting (but repeated in his assigned readings). I heartily dislike history but was still able to greatly appreciate Warner's lectures.3) Berland is absolutely awful. Her lectures (which are on the modern aspects of media and medicine) are insubstantial and decidedly dull- an impressive feat when talking about something as interesting as modern marketing, hospital advertising, obesity epidemics, and the like. Whatever you do, don't ask her questions after class- she equivocates, skates around questions, and generally appears uninterested.",
    "Good intro and overview of big health topics and media involvement. The powerpoint slides are not posted.",
    "Yes, especially to anyone interested in medicine.",
    "This class is great if you are interested in media but also if you are interested in medicine. I think that was the clear divide in the class, but I think both sides really enjoyed it. Its not too much work and really entertaining.",
    "I recommend this course because it shows how media has influenced and shaped medicine in recent years -- very interesting.",
    "This class is somewhat boring to attend, but isn't horrible if you take it with a friend. Try to get in a section with a friend too. There is no work in section, but it helps with how much info you have to learn. The midterm was fairly easy if you study for it. The paper isn't too bad because you can pick your topic. The final covers a lot of info but it could be worse. I would recommend this class to any HSHM major.",
    "Sure, it's pretty interesting and not too much work.",
    "Yes, great Hu...",
    "TAKE IT. This class is brilliant. One of those classes that makes you see the world differently. My academic interests have nothing to do with media or medicine, I took it as a fifth class just for fun. The lectures are really interesting and I always walked away feeling like I had learned something new. Professors are articulate, and their use of media in the class keeps things interesting. And the work is pretty easy. There's not really a reason not to take this course.",
    "It's a fairly easy class. Not much reading and easy section.",
    "Take this if you are a science major that needs a humanities credit that isn't very much work. You're not guaranteed an A unless you actually put some effort into the class. Still, its definitely tailored to people that don't care that much about the humanities.Most lectures are somewhat interesting, especially the guest lectures, although there are a few that kind of boring. There is a ton of reading for the class but you don't need to do any of it, except when studying for the midterm and final. Even then, you just need to skim the primary source readings for each lecture so that you can reference them in the answers to your essay questions. If you go to all the lectures, this class will be a minimal amount of work and you will do reasonably well.",
    "A fine class to fulfill distributional requirements.",
    "I would summarize History 147 as a must-take course for anyone interested in the media or in medicine. Media has shaped public perception in a way I could never have imagined. Medicine gives a great example of how this has happened.",
    "If you're interested in how the medical field rose (and subsequently fell) in prestige, how the media can skew public opinion, or our healthcare system's history (from the lens of the media), this is a good class for you. Workload is not tremendous. Manageable as a fifth class.",
    "I would recommend this class if you are interested in medicine in the media, but if not, it is kind of boring",
    "Would only recommend if you're looking for a gut class. The work consists of mandatory section meetings, one midterm, an 8-10 page paper, and a final. This class is probably most valuable for a pre-med student who's looking for an easy SO credit.",
    "The material is very interesting. There are a lot of readings, but I found them to be interesting for the most part.",
    "Super easy but also informative and fun, I'd definitely recommend it if you're interested in the topics.",
    "definitely a must take. super chill and impossible to get a D if you credit\/d. best gut, and also pretty lowkey class. interesting material as well. i actually went to class",
    "Sure! It's a cool class that discusses a lot of ethical issues regarding medicine that one may not normally think about. Very thought provoking",
    "Take this class if you are interested in the material. It is a good amount of work so only if you are interested! Good humanities for premeds!",
    "Course goes from 1880s to present day covering the coevolution of media and medicine. Lots of readings that aren't completely necessary to do - depending on which section you are in. The readings are interesting anyways. I would recommend it.",
    "take it",
    "Great class for a humanities. Should do the reading, even though it is a lot. Lot of studying required for the tests, but the topics were extremely interesting and we got to view some great primary sources. Professors are really into it and know what they are talking about.",
    "I liked this class a lot and would recommend it to other students",
    "Not as much of a gut as people will lead you to believe but the work is very manageable and the reading are not super necessary seeing as they're covered in lecture and section. Midterm, one paper, and a final. Both tests are very general, so if you go to lecture you can do well with out doing much else.",
    "I would highly recommend tis class if you are at all interested in US history, it was very enjoyable and easy to understand and It greatly increased my understanding of US medical history and how the media shaped it.",
    "The lectures are actually interesting and the workload is super manageable, basically section and a paper plus the tests.",
    "A great class for those interested in the intersection of medicine and national media!",
    "AMST 247 is a great class, which explores both the historical and contemporary relationships between media and medicine. There are weekly reading assignments. However, the readings are generally short. There is a midterm, final paper, and final exam. The final paper can be on any topic related to the course. I would definitely recommend the course, especially as a fifth class.",
    "great course that one should take if one is interested in media and how it interacts with medicine",
    "Yess",
    "A course on lots of media and health topics. But you can probably get that from the title.",
    "This is a great course. Not too much work and the readings are quite interesting. The course explores the themes of media and medicine. Only a midterm, final and final paper. Not much work throughout the semester except readings. The lectures are a bit dry sometimes.",
    "Pretty interesting class. Tests are pretty straightforward and the amount of material is not overwhelming.",
    "I would recommend it to anybody.",
    "Ack - I wouldn't take it again. Much much to broad and vague, no lecture outlines -- the class wasjust too unstructured in terms of what it wanted from its students, which led to much confusion and no uniformity in the quality of work submitted. It all basically depended on whether you lucked out on TA assignments.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. It's especially good for people who are interested in medicine as I think ti provides a good perspective that any doctor should have.",
    "The perfect course for people interesting in medicine but not knowledgeable about the scientific aspects of it",
    "Media and Medicine gives a general overview of how various forms of media (such as TV, advertising, newspapers, etc.) have been used in the medical field over the years. You learn about topics such as the role the media has played in the rise and fall of the public's esteem of doctors, in addition to the media's role in disease campaigns and the importance of whistleblowing, celebrity patients, and poster children. It's a good course overall, but sometimes got a bit dull. The workload is light (a midterm, paper, final, readings and section participation).",
    "I would recommend this course. It's as easy as that. You will get as much as you put into it. At the very least, you will learn interesting facts about America's health history.",
    "The material is overall pretty self-explanatory. Though the readings can be interesting and there is a midterm and an end of term paper in addition to a final, overall: gut.",
    "Hist of Science, Hist of Med 202 was a course that discussed the significance of media in the world of medicine and health culture in America. I would definitely recommend this class to another student because the lectures are interesting and there is not too much reading.",
    "Overall, not a very demanding class. An interesting class that is also a good humanities credit.",
    "The class covers interesting topics and is relatively simplistic. I would recommend it to another student because it is not all that time consuming (the readings are definitely not imperative) and the lectures are enjoyable.",
    "This is a great humanities credit if you are more of science\/math kind of person. I personally took the course because I was really interested in the role the media plays in shaping public opinion. We definitely talked a lot about that and it gave me a new perspective on what it means to be a journalist or reporter. I would highly recommend this class to someone who needs a fairly easy Hu credit, or to anyone who is interested in the interaction between media and medicine. The exams are pretty easy (just 3 essays) and even if you don't do all of the readings or go to all the lectures you can do well.",
    "Definitely a great class that presents the information in an easy to follow way. Definitely go to class to be successful. Some of the readings are interesting, but often are just very specific and provide examples of what the professors discuss in lecture. Not too difficult and the information is easy to learn.",
    "I really liked this course. If you like public health, take it.",
    "ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC. Not a difficult course, but very eye opening and thought-provoking. The readings are also really interesting, and doing them helps add to the course.",
    "Very interesting course (plus lots of video clips during lecture) and a pretty light workload.",
    "It's an interesting class, but the reading is sometimes a lot of you want to do it all.",
    "absolutely - the lectures are fascinating, I learned so much about a topic that I didn't realize would have so much substance to it. It's a chill, relaxed class with quite a bit of reading but we didn't have to do any reading responses and it was okay to skim or just do part of the reading. It was overall a fun class. I looked forward to it.",
    "A class to take if your interested in the material or need to fulfill requirements, but if you are not sure if you want to take it then don't. If you are choosing between this and a different class, choose the other class.",
    "I would recommend this course. It's a good survey of medical history as portrayed through the media over the last hundred-plus years. Not much work besides reading (although make sure you know what's up for each week -- some weeks it's virtually no reading and some weeks it's a boatload).",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to anyone who is even remotely interested in the effects of disease\/medicine on society as a whole. The course delves into several very interesting health cases and experiments. That being said, it isn't too much work. You can probably coast by without doing many of the readings because most of the material is covered in lecture. The midterm and final were fair. You don't have to study too much, but keep in mind that you get out what you put in.",
    "Super interesting course- i loved it! not too much work but very interesting especially if you are going into the field of medicine!",
    "Media and Medicine is an interesting topic that I would recommend to students. The class has a lot of readings but if you pay attention in lecture you don't necessarily have to do all of them.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student! Although the lecturers are not very energetic and peppy, they are definitely very passionate about this topic and the themes are very engaging in themselves. Basically, this class was really interesting! It made me realize how important media is, and how it has such a large influence on people. The themes were fun to learn about, and lectures that were filled with old media clips were a blast from the past that sparked an interest in me to actually go watch these old films. It is great at presenting compelling and engaging ideas, although the 2-person alternating lecture format is a bit confusing. We tend to jump around with the years, so it becomes difficult to piece all of the eras together until the end when you make timelines to study for the exam. The slides are also never posted, which is annoying for those who sit in the back (the class is too full) and cannot properly hear or see what is going on during lecture.",
    "Manageable work and also very interesting",
    "This is a solid course and not a bad introduction to the subject of media and pop culture's interaction with medicine. Go to lecture and take notes; it's not a difficult class, but if you don't put in the work, the midterm and final will be impossible. Section can be useful or a waste of time depending on your TA, but that's not course-specific.The professors care about the material and it's evident. Unfortunately, the guest lectures are pretty horrific in most cases (excepting 2, one of which was delivered by a TA).",
    "YES. IT WAS PRETTY REWARDING TO CONSIDER HOW THE MEDIA PLAYS A BIG ROLE IN THE DAYS OF OUR LIVES.",
    "it is an interesting big intro course if you don't know anything about the topic with good ta's. very big lecture though so be prepared. also it is not extremely challenging although there is a lot of reading.",
    "NOT a gut humanities course, especially if you're aiming for an A. The bulk of your grade comes down to the final few weeks of the class (in the form of a paper and the final), so that can be a bit stressful. You are expected to remember the titles of the readings you do so that you can reference them in your essays on the midterm and final, which is a bit ridiculous. Section can be extremely boring. Still, I think I gained a new perspective on media and its interaction with medicine, and overall I learned a lot of interesting information.",
    "It was a fun, large lectured-based class about the history of medicine in America as it related to media. Great for anyone really -- not a lot of work, interesting, and tons of resources at the University to supplement your experience with the course. Take it if the syllabus sounds interesting to you.",
    "This is a really good humanities class particularly if you are interested in this topic or those similar to it. The readings are a little much, but they relate well to lecture so it's very much coherent. Section was really enjoyable and a lot of interesting questions were raised. Would definitely recommend this class.",
    "This class describes how the rise of modern media corresponded with the rise of modern medicine. The workload was light and it was usually interesting. A good 5th class or a class for anyone interested in medicine.",
    "One of my favorite classes at Yale!",
    "Enormous lecture plus weekly section, intuitive and (mostly) engaging material, very little work. There's a huge overlap between reading and lecture. Honestly, you probably don't have to do the reading at all, but it only takes like half an hour so you might as well do it. Always go to lecture because the slides aren't posted and they show film clips and other visual media that might show up on exams. This course is not too demanding; there's an in-class midterm, a 7-page final paper, and a cumulative final exam. Everything is pretty straightforward. Overall, good introduction to the history of the various intersections between public health and media. Nothing special, easy fifth class.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to anyone regardless of their major or interest in medicine. The class covers a wide variety of topics in media and medicine from the late 1800s to today. Lectures and readings were really interesting. Overall the class was very enjoyable.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. It an engaging, relevant class, not a crazy amount of work, both the readings and lectures were fun, and the material was interesting. I am most likely majoring in HSHM, so the class was right up my alley, but I had a lot of friends who took the class with me and really enjoyed it. I also think this class would work as a 5th class, for those of you who want an extra fun class that is not too demanding. Overall, I would say take it!",
    "Media and Medicine should be one of those classes that all pre-meds should take. It really goes into the history of why doctors are seen the way they are, which is really cool because I think it gives you a bit of insight into how patients view doctors and how doctors can influence these views. The course is very straightforward. Mandatory sections, midterm, 6-7 pg paper, and final.",
    "M&M is an interesting, accessible course. The readings are mostly interesting, but also not strictly necessary for understanding of the course material.",
    "It's an interesting class, but it'skind of like English 114 in a way--the essays you have to write are subjective and based on whether or not the reader likes your essay. If you didn't enjoy English 114, I say stay away from this class because it will probably make your life miserable. That being said, the topics we covered in class were interesting.",
    "Media and Medicine is a class about how media depicts medicine. If you've taken an HSHM class before, you likely will already know a lot of the material covered in this class. Take it, not a huge workload- one midterm, a paper and a final",
    "This is a good class with interesting material and not too much work. I recommend it if you would like an interesting course that combines history and medical information.",
    "One of the best lecture classes that I've taken at Yale. Interesting material, great professors, and a fairly low workload (midterm, seven-page paper, and a final exam). Take it!!",
    "Class discussing media in relation to medicine.You'll look at ads for prescriptions in an entirely different way.",
    "This is a relatively laid back class, yet it is an interesting, multifaceted topic. I would highly recommend it if you want a relaxed but cool class to round out your schedule.",
    "Media and Medicine was a great humanities course for people who don't have a lot of experience with humanities courses or students who have any interest in medicine or health care. I thought all of the lectures were really interesting, and most of the readings were too. However, the reading isn't really that \"light\", as the syllabus said. The paper assigment is very broad, so you're essentially able to write about whatever you're interested in.",
    "Great course if you're interested in how the media portrays issues in media and public health. Interesting lectures, and not too much work.",
    "Totally recommend it. Not quite as awesome as it sounds, and the reading load isn't that light, but it was an interesting class with fun and useful information (particularly if you go into medicine).",
    "This class was extremely interesting and informative, especially if you are at all interested in medicine. Lecture is interesting and enjoyable to go to. There is a weekly section, a midterm exam, a paper and a final exam, so overall the workload is manageable.",
    "Great survey of medicine and its relationship with Media in the 20th century",
    "Yes take it!!! You actually learn a lot and please don't take it just as another premed wanting an easy class. Invest time in this and it's so worth it!! Literally one of the best courses at Yale.",
    "This was an interesting class to take. I took it simply because I needed a humanities credit, and I don't regret it. It wasn't too difficult, but was also very interesting. You definitely need to attend all lectures though, because although the slides are posted, most of the informationis not on them.",
    "I would recommend this course as a fifth class.",
    "The class is great. Do the readings and attend lecture and you'll have no problems.",
    "I would recommend this class to people interested in either the media or medicine. It provides a good survey of how medicine has evolved from the late 19th century to the present. It also teaches you how medicine's relationship with the media has been very dynamic over the century.",
    "I'd recommend if you had some interest in media\/medicine and wanted to get an academic overview of some topics to discuss in it. Not much room for in depth work aside from the paper, which may be a turn off to people looking to dig deeper.",
    "I would recommend the course because it is really interesting and a good way to learn a little bit about medicine and the media. I really learned a lot from just listening to lecture.",
    "I would recommend this as a very interesting class.",
    "It was an interesting class and not too hard. It is exactly what the name of the class is.",
    "Media and Medicine in Modern America is a big lecture course; take it if you're especially interested in the syllabus or it will count towards a major. It was moderately good but not amazing. There are better classes and there are worse classes. This one is good enough.",
    "A very interesting course about the relationship between television shows, movies, advertisements, etc, with medicine. I would highly recommend it to any student.",
    "If you take this, go to lectures. The class isn't a lot of work if you pay attention during lectures and grasp the main concepts. Pay attention to the different posters and video clips they show as they will come up again in section and on the exams.",
    "I would recommend this course because the material learned was interesting. There is a final, a midterm, a paper and yo can do the reading if you want. You will need to reference some of them for the midterm and final. Lectures were engaging and contained a lot of information. There were a lot of readings but they were also interesting and supported the lectures well.",
    "It is a class tracing medical history and how the media played a role in that. Very interesting for premed\/ history of medicine students. I loved it! It was pretty easy and enjoyable and not much work. Just a lot of reading but you don't have to do all of it unless you want to- the readings are really interesting and relevant.",
    "HIST 147 is a very easy, matter-of-fact humanities course. There is one midterm, one paper, and one final. Both tests follow the exact same format and if you attend the lectures you can get away without doing any reading. I would definitely take it if you need a humanities class and if you like medicine or media because the material is actually pretty interesting and is also something you can talk about at the dinner table.",
    "It's a good class! Not too much work and the lectures are pretty interesting for the most part -- you get to see lot's of cool movie\/commercial clips and ads throughout history. The lectures and readings (which you definitely don't have to do) are engaging",
    "I would recommend this course if you are a HSHM major, interested in the subject, want an educational fifth class that isn't too taxing, or enjoy the first lecture in shopping period. Both professors are pretty good lecturers, and they bring different perspectives as a historian and as a practicing physician. There is a fair amount of reading with the course and you should do at least some of it, but it's all interesting and not overwhelming. The exams and paper are very reasonable. I felt like I learned a lot about a lesser-thought-of but still highly relevant aspect of American history and culture.",
    "A pretty easy A, but not a total gut. The course content is pretty interesting, but the lectures definitely get repetitive. Your grade is composed of midterm, final, paper, and section participation. The midterm and final are pretty much the same format -- 2-3 essays, some of which are in response to relevant images. The paper topic is very open-ended; you can pretty much write about anything you want. Wanling was a super friendly, approachable TA, so I would recommend her section if you can get it. It is definitely not necessary to do all the course readings -- most are either just reiterations of the lectures or unrelated to the lectures. They're mainly just necessary for the purpose of name dropping authors\/articles in your midterm\/final essays. But overall, I would recommend it. Manageable, but still intellectually stimulating to some degree.",
    "Media and Medicine is a great class that covers many of the large medical events in American history, and analyzes the relationship between the media and the medical field during these events. I would recommend this class to another student because it is very interesting.",
    "I would recommend this course. It provides a really interesting look at the way in which the media affects our lives and ideas about medicine. It could get a little repetitive by the end, but I think it's worth it\u00e2\u0080\u0093 a fascinating and relatively low key course.",
    "yeah take this class if you are at all interesting in media and history of medicine and how they interact with one another",
    "Definitely! A lot of people take it as a GUT, but it's one of those courses from which you get as much as you give.",
    "Take it if you need a pretty easy humanities. The tests are fair, 2 exams and one paper. It's a very interesting class too and applicable to every day life.",
    "Fascinating class, great lecturers overall but section can be a bit boring.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. It gave me a lot of useful insight into an interesting intersection that I hadn't thought about before.",
    "Exactly the title - how media changes medicine and how medicine uses media",
    "Interesting class, not too much work. Take it as a fifth or if you just need a cool lecture that isn't going to take up a lot of time. Do not buy the course packet it's online.",
    "Take it! It's interesting and not too much work. The readings help but I didn't find them necessary. Definitely pay attention in lectures.",
    "Definitely take this class. You will leave knowing so much more than you did before the class. It is also not too much work.",
    "Interesting and informative, definitely recommend. Not too challenging intellectually, but you look at a profession through a fascinating lens (i.e. the media). A good fifth class, too!",
    "I would recommend this course to another student. The organization of the class was not very well done, but I learned a lot from it and it was very interesting.",
    "HSHM 202 is a very interesting class about the way media has influenced medicine and the way that media and medicine have interacted throughout history. I would definitely recommend this class to another student. The material is extremely interesting and relevant to everyone's life (and it is also one of the few classes at Yale about media and advertising). The professors are both fantastic and engaging and the workload is definitely manageable. Lecture is always interesting and some great and really cool guest lecturers come to speak to the class as well. Overall this is a great, very manageable and interesting class and I would recommend it to any student at Yale.",
    "Media and Medicine is a great way to learn about the history of public health in america, as well as understanding our present health situation in a better context. It also is not much work, just a midterm final and final paper. I would recommend it to anyone!",
    "The material was all interesting, both for the components history I didn't know and for moral grey areas that were thought-provoking. Sometimes a little confusing because lecture jumped around a lot chronologically and it could also get repetitive. The readings were interesting for the most part, and the very long history ones usually weren't necessary to read because we would go over them in lecture- it was more important to read the more journalistic\/opinion or archival pieces. Not a particularly difficult class, with only a midterm, final, one paper, and of course attending section, and the professors both seemed like great people. I would definitely recommend taking it!",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student. The workload isn't too heavy, but you are simultaneously able to explore important questions of representation of key issues within the media. I feel like I left the class understanding important issues within medical history, and I also feel like I am more aware of how my perceptions as a consumer of medicine are shaped by the media.",
    "This is a fantastic overview of the interaction of media and medicine throughout American history, starting in the 19th century and extending until the modern day. The readings are pretty fascinating and the lectures are very intriguing. I would recommend it.",
    "Although I only really meant to shop this course, I ended up getting sucked into the superbly interesting topic and took it for my first semester of freshmen year. I loved all the material and found that, for myself (a prospective film major), learning more about the media's influence of medicine is not only informative but also necessary to know. The extent the media changes our perspective on really important topics is stunning - and if you're at all interested in that phenomenon, at least shop the course.",
    "This class is really enlightening in understanding how media and social trends are connected to the medical world. We studied such things as the origin of the medical breakthrough, pharmaceutical advertising, and the portrayal of doctors in the media in TV shows like Dr. Kildare and House. Iwould really recommend this class. The professor are really interested in what they lecture and the topics have connections to the real world.",
    "It was a very interesting class, and not very demanding (there is quite a bit of reading, though).",
    "Very low work load, get a lot out of it",
    "Media& Medicine is a solid course but not an exceptional one. I enjoyed learning about historic public health events, and even \"recent\" events from the 1980s and 90s \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Clinton health reform, lawsuits against tobacco companies \u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00c2\u00a0were fascinating and fresh for me. But the coverage of more \"modern-day\" topics \u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00c2\u00a0social media, food advertising, stigma and obesity \u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00c2\u00a0did not seem to offer much to any student with a decent understanding of current events and issues. The guest lectures in particular, while appreciated, did not offer much substance. This class did team-teaching better than any other team-taught course I've had at Yale, which is a huge plus, but I still think it led to some disconnection and repetition between lectures. Berland and Warner are both interesting, and I enjoyed the balance of having both an MD (Berland) and a historian (Warner) teach the course. Readings were great and well-chosen. The paper was actually fun to write and the exams were very fair (and not difficult). My particular section was pretty boring and wasn't very informative, but section is always a challenge for a history-type class.",
    "Take it as an easy but interesting class",
    "An awful, awful course. Your grade is entirely TA dependent, and the grading itself is extremely nitpicky and subjective. The professors decided that in order to prevent this course from being a gut, which it had a reputation for, they would tell TAs to grade harshly and they would assign tons of dense and\/or uninteresting reading. The lectures with Prof. Berland consist of her not knowing how to use technology and yelling at the tech people to help her and her asking questions but never answering them. Prof. Warner\u00e2\u0080\u0099s lectures are more well-structured but generally are just reiterations of the tons of reading you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re supposed to have done by class, and cover more history than media. Discussion section consists of students trying to be eloquent when really, the course has given them little to work with. Do not take this class.",
    "Take it...it's an enjoyable class",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend. Take this class.",
    "Yes, but be aware that the readings fluctuate between 10 pages to 100 pages per week. It is a course where you can get away with skipping readings, although I think attending lectures is helpful, as there is material in lecture that may turn up on exams.",
    "It's a very good class for premeds and people who are interested in the history of medicine.",
    "I would 100% recommend this class to other students. The subject matter is all relevant to us, especially in this modern age of medicine. The tests and paper are all fair. Definitely worth your while.",
    "This course provides modern and historical perspectives on the relationship between media and the medical establishment. I personally would recommend this course to anyone with an interest in either, although I definitely preferred the lectures on modern topics to the lectures on related historical events. Both professors were interesting and the TAs are great.",
    "Highly recommend it. Really interesting material that touches on trends and events that many of us have seen in our lifetime. Looks at how these occurrences represent underlying societal trends and perspectives. Also examines how media is represented in the media and how that has changed with time. Berland and Warner are fantastic. The workload was very easy and the readings (at least the few that I actually did) were very interesting).",
    "A interesting course that teaches you about a different side of medicine that is really quite interesting. It is not that heavy of a workload and you learn a lot. I did not particularly enjoy this course while in it, but after appreciate it and for this reason recommend it.",
    "Media and Medicine has interesting course material. Take it if you want to learn more about the history of medicine in this country and how the role of the doctor has changed over the years. Section can be a bit more work than you expected, depending on your section leader. Some of the readings are interesting, the longer ones are often quite dense. The professors were not so dynamic. Be prepared to take meticulous notes - they don't post the slides and the slides don't have much anyway. The guest lecturers were quite good for the most part.",
    "Great class overall. If you are interested in the topic, take it. There really isn't anything bad about the class.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to other students - it's also a great way to fulfill the Humanities distribution requirement (without too much work). The class does a really good job of incorporating current events, medical issues, and technology to bring out issues we were never aware of. I also thought the readings, while not as light as suggested in the syllabus, were, on the whole, pretty interesting. If you're interested in the interaction between medicine and the media (in newspaper articles, movies, ads, etc.), then you will enjoy this class for sure. It's a fun one!",
    "This course covers material that comes up in daily conversation and I found it to e quite applicable to life and I highly recommend it.",
    "Media and Medicinewas a course about how the media has affected medicine in America since the origin of the germ theory. It was amazingly interesting and sometimes I found myself saying \"Is it over already?\" at the end of lecture. Definitely take this course if you have time. Especially take it if you are premed as it actually pertains to the line of work you are interested in (unlike chemistry and biology).",
    "A fascinating overview of our media culture as it relates to medicine, and how that's evolved through the ages. It gives a lot of context to things that are happening now, and it's super relevant. I'd recommend it to anyone! Every lecture was a treat.",
    "Very interesting if you like the subject material. Also pretty easy course, especially if you get a TA that's an easy grader. I got one of the hardest ones, so that was annoying because I took this as an easy fifth class. But it's overall interesting and a refreshing break from a lot of Yale's other heavy-duty history credits. Also, very little reading!"
