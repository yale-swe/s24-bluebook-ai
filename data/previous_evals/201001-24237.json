   "comments": [
    "I would reccommend it as a pretty cool class in which you get a lot of leeway to try different things. It's definitely not boring and I'm glad I learned about different tissue engineering systems as I had no experience in this before. But it's frustrating because you spend a lot of time doing a project without too much guidance. It felt like I was just copying different procedures from different paper without much meaning. Not difficult class, just requires a lot of effort.The tests varied in dificulty. Not difficult in comprehension but in just vast scope.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class to anyone who is interested in biology or biomedical engineering.",
    "A laboratory\/lecture course in which you learn the principles of tissue engineering, while at the same time designing and then actually growing a tissue of your own.I would recommend the course to someone who has a real passion for research (even if you dont know yet that you want to do BME), and who is willing to invest quite a bit of time and effort into the course. the thing is, in the end, the reward of this class measures upto or outweighs what you put in.",
    "You learn a lot of interesting information in this class, but the lecture material is very manageable. The tests are not hard as long as you come to class and pay attention. What feels like the bigger portion of this class is the lab component - you work in groups of 3 to grow an engineered tissue (blood vessel, cartilage, or skin). This sounds awesome, but watch out! It will take over your life towards the end of the semester. It's worth it in the end, but be prepared to spend 10 hrs\/week in lab sometimes. The TA's are helpful, but the project is still very independent. It helps if you have previous tissue culture experience.",
    "Only if you're self-motivated.",
    "If this class continues to run as it did this year, only take this class if you are prepared to come into lab every other (or every 2-3) days for at least 1 hour, plus spend countless hours reading unassigned papers for your project, plus reading papers for class materials. Also make sure the TA is Liz Calle, because even though she wasn't the TA this year, she was extremely helpful with the whole process and really made sure we understood the material even though she was technically not supposed to be affiliated with the class at all."
