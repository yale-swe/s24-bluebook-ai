    "This was an excellent course on Organic Chemistry, and I definitely learned a lot. However, do not take it lightly. Organic Chemistry is a monster that will devour you if you don't give it at least 25 minutes a day. I'm very serious - I tried cramming the day before for the first exam (having not learned my lesson from the first semester) and was thoroughly checked and wrecked. My grades fortunately went up from there, but in the end I have to say you should definitely consider your willingness to dedicate yourself to this class. It will not sit well with other demanding activities, especially if you aren't used to it. One last thing. If you don't like studying a lot, don't take this class. And get flash cards. And some tissues. Good luck.",
    "Profesora Sab is wonderful! At first I was intimidated by her because she runs a tight ship, but she is very passionate about teaching and makes class fun. She is very good at teaching Spanish- very clear and has good teaching techniques. I didn't like L1 Spanish, but with her as my prof for L2, I always looked forward to coming to class every day."
