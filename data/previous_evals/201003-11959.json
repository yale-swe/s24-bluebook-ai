    "This is required for BME so you have to take it. Advice? Don't expect to understand what to do from the instructions, look at it as some form of really bad humour. Choose nice and fun lab-mates, you'll be spending long, frustrating hours together.",
    "Yes. Great lab course.",
    "Take it, it's really very interesting and not much work outside of class. It has been the only BME class so far to instill any sense of being an engineer.",
    "Recommend it. Not too hard",
    "I would recommend this course to any student interested in the field of BME. It provides a comprehensive overview of several systems in the field and allows students to learn about the field through application.",
    "Take it if you have to - it'll be fine, just start the write-ups in advance because sometimes they're unclear and it's helpful to email a TA.",
    "If you are a BME student, then you have to take it and it's an ok course. Otherwise there is no reason to take it."
