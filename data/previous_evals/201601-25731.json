    "The class is a good introduction to filmmaking and the process. Sandra is an interesting and engaging professor committed to her students. The class is both a time investment and an emotional investment but I found both to pay off at the end of the semester. I would recommend the class to people interested in film but as the class is an investment, I would encourage people interested to give some thought as to whether they think such an investment will be worth it to them personally.",
    "This class is a self-guided technical class, and an instructor-driven coaching about how to construct a story. You have to be committed to doing the homework because without the technical skills, the meat and potatoes of the class won't help much. It's a balance of abstract, concrete, philosophical and literal - and you've got to be okay with learning the technical part on your own, because it's the only set of skills that can be taught online\/via tutorials. The real value of the class is in the classroom, which serves to balance out the online\/tutorial work."
