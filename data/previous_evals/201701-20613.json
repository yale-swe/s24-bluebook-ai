    "The strengths are that the course is immersive but also fun, and allows rather quick learning of the language. It featured a good balance of German culture and practice speaking spontaneously with grammar lessons. One thing I felt was sometimes a weakness was the online homework. The CONNECT questions were often helpful and were effective in reinforcing the lessons in the book\/from class, but there were also often questions that required listening to a speaker and typing what was said, and these felt like a waste of time because they often included vocabulary that we had not yet learned and the answer was marked wrong unless it was typed exactly as spoken. Similarly, the online forum was a great thing but problems arose due to lack of participation. Finally, I think the class would benefit from more practice speaking and listening to native speakers. Overall though, I highly enjoyed the course and would recommend it to others."
