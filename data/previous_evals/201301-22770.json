    "2 hrs every day with 3-4 hours of hmwk every nightTranslation from Latin to EnglishCovers full framework of Latin gramma and introduces idiom as wellSmall class that relies heavily on participation",
    "Hm. If you can take the normal two-semester sequence, do that. Because this is a LOT of work, and you should be doing a lot on your own. Tim Robinson is the best professor ever and you should take a class with him, so if he's teaching this go for it, but be warned that you better be committed to this class and be prepared to give it all your attention and time. Don't do anything else, just Latin for one semester. You might die if you don't.",
    "More of an experience or lifestyle choice than a class. You spend 2 hours a day with the professor and with your classmates and it becomes part of your life. Embrace that.You'll definitely gain a grasp of Latin and you'll leave having read actual latin verse."
