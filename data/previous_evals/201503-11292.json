    "Professor Malvesti is one of the best professors at Yale University. She is a captivating discussion leader, and the depth of her knowledge in National Security is unparalleled. GLBL 724 focused on a broad range of theories that impact decision making in national security, crisis, and everyday settings. Although much of the material was intuitive, Professor Malvesti found case studies and new angles that made it more nuanced and compelling. The vast majority of what I got out of this class came from her and my fellow classmates. Highly recommend.",
    "Reading-intensive, very thorough course. Come prepared to class. As an undergrad, you get to hear first-hand experience from some very knowledgeable and experienced graduate students",
    "This class will change your perspective when addressing situations of decision making. Expect to work hard and be prepared to participate in discussions.",
    "The class spends the first few lectures looking at the structure of the National Security Council, and how it makes decisions. It then spends the remainder of the course looking at different models of decision making, some logical, some irrational, to analyze how the US government makes choices. The Iranian Hostage crisis is used as a course long case study into decision making.",
    "I would definitely recommend the class. I really enjoyed learning about decision making using the lens of national security from someone who has so much experience!",
    "Of course.",
    "This course is a perfect fit for anyone seeking leadership positions in their career. Unlike a leadership course, this course pushes a person to explore the broader influences to decisions, not just the ego of a single person. This course a unique opportunity to reflect upon the pitfalls of poor decisions making and the pathways towards more clarity.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to another student.",
    "I would say this is a class that you absolutely must take. It doesn't matter if you don't care about national security decision making - this course has a strong national security component obviously, but by and large this is about decision making. So even if you are never going to take a job in the government, you will likely have to make decisions and work with others. This made me re-evaluate my group interactions and was useful for that",
    "Yes I would recommend it if Prof Malvesti is teaching it."

   "comments": [
    "Solid foundation in the process of decision making at the individual, group, and institutional levels. Extensive discussion of the US national security national security decision making apparatus and relevant case studies in the late 20th century. Reading and class discussion about cognitive issues that can plague decision making in various situations. This class was very useful on a personal level and as a framework for understanding government decision making.",
    "Provided phenomenal insight into all aspects and approaches regarding national security decision making",
    "This course inspired me to pursue a career in national security, now having a more comprehensive understanding of the policy making process behind governmental decisions.",
    "I studied political science for 2 years, with a focus on international relations. I then switched to study in decision making. As a result, this course served as the perfect intersection of the two. I loved the combination of looking at national security and decision making.",
    "Absolutely. I have been trying to get a better foundation in government response to security concerns and this class was incredibly helpful!",
    "It honed my understanding of how key national security decisions are made, especially ones under conditions of uncertainty.",
    "This course directly relates to my profession in the US military. It also allowed to explore a specific topic regarding China, which also directly related to my research interests.",
    "This course was particularly useful in its interdisciplinary approach - I had not previously been exposed to cognitive science as applied to political science. It was the first course I've taken that took the decisions themselves and the individuals involved as the units of study, versus state-level actors or systemic factors.",
    "This might have actually shaped my summer interests and research projects. I am very interested in how national security council decision making effects the U.S. strategy.",
    "I learned a lot more about U.S. political thought in terms of making national security decisions. It was interesting from an international student perspective."
