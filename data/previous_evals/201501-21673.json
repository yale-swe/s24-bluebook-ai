   "comments": [
    "Its a great course, but only take it as an elective for you major\/required class. Unless you are actually interested in biomechanics, you probably wouldn't like the material.",
    "This is an excellent course. Professor Humphrey really has you focusing on internalizing the material in a way that is difficult to do in classes where you are overloaded with busy work psets. Would highly recommend, even if you aren't a BME major.",
    "This is a fantastic course! Professor Humphrey is so knowledgeable and truly a leading expert in the field of biomechanics. His passion for it shines through in every lecture, and makes you want to strive to understand the course material. This is a low-stress course with one midterm and relatively simple problem sets. Attending lecture will be key!",
    "Best taught BME class in the department. Professor Humphrey is a great teacher who loves biomechanics. There is very little work for the class. The tests are relatively straightforward, but have high averages so curve might be tough. Would highly recommend even if you are not a BME major.",
    "HIghly recommend if you are a BME \/ MechE and want to know basic of biomachanics. This class is extremely well organized and you will learn things that will last.",
    "Definitely recommend it!!!! Take it if you're a mechE major as an elective, not much work and a good class. Exams are very reasonable as well.",
    "Don't let the concepts sneak up on you. Not a lot of work, but great instructor.",
    "BENG 353 is one of the best BME classes here at Yale, Professor Humphrey will easily be one of the most respected teachers that you have had. He does an incredible job and because he is so good the exams aren't really that hard.",
    "Not too much work and you learn a lot. Psets take less than an hour but the paper may take some time",
    "A general introduction to mechanics. There's a substantial amount of writing for an engineering course, but the research paper was rewarding and gave us a chance to explore a personal interest.",
    "I took BENG 353 as an elective for the mechanical engineering major and would definitely recommend it. If you're a Mech E the concepts are all familiar and Professor Humphreys is really great at presenting these topics in a new way. The psets are short and the exams are straightforward.",
    "very thorough introduction to biomechanics. Great teaching, not too much work",
    "I would recommend this course. Humphrey has a unique teaching style and I learned a lot.",
    "Really manageable class. Fair midterm and final, and you get a great introduction to the topic. At times a bit too theoretical though. Start the paper early.",
    "I would recommend this course for engineers as electives. BMEs have to take it but it's enjoyable!",
    "I really enjoyed this course. It was well-structured, well-ordered, and each unit clearly built upon the previous one. Professor Humphrey was an excellent lecturer, and he made sure to address any confusion on the part of the students. The material was made very clear and easy to understand thanks to his clear, exact style of lecturing. This course really piqued my interest in biomechanics. If you have a decent physics background (Classical Mechanics is good), this course is an excellent introduction to the mechanics of continua. Take it!",
    "This class starts off at a manageable pace but gets fast at the end. Keep going over things so you can make sure you can reproduce proofs and problems, as Prof Humphrey likes asking for proofs on exams.",
    "Great intro class to take even for nonBMEs. After having taken fluids, it was interesting to relearn concepts from a different perspective. The professor accounts for the variety of engineering majors and provides useful applications.",
    "A great class to see the connections between all fields of Engineering. It was a great class for putting things into perspective and learning them at a deeper level. I would recommend the class to anyone who is in engineering or has a strong science background.",
    "This is a great class. It's very heavy into derivations and such, but the professor is amazing and all of the classwork and exams are very fair. There is a 15 page research paper - I heard from a few people that they thought it would be shorter, so it was a shock to them, but I hadn't heard anything else. That is a lot of writing for an engineering course, but it can be about any topic You like which I think was really cool.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student, EVEN if you are not BME\/Mech-E student. The course teaches a set of tools to be used across a wide array of applications, rather than how to solve individual problems. The material is incredibly interesting, and even the more technical of it is taught with an eye to contexts of relevance. The problem sets reinforce a tool set and are very manageable, as are the exams--nothing is meant to trip you up. Professor Humphrey is a great professor--the best I have had across both of my majors (one in the social sciences).",
    "BENG 353 teaches the mathematical concepts behind basic mechanics. A class that is heavily focused on derivations, Professor Humphrey is absolutely awesome in making sure students understand the relevance of his lectures and the step-by-step process of mathematical logic. If you are still lost, the T.A.'s office hours are incredibly useful. I would definitely recommend the class, and remember to speak up during lecture.",
    "If you're a BME major, you have to take it; there were a lot of mechanical engineering majors too. Not as mindblowing for me (probably since the class was so large this year). Strengths: logical and easy-to-follow presentation of the material. Felt I learned a lot about the core aspects of mechanical engineering (balance equations, constitutive relations, the role of experimentation and theory) despite being a biomedical engineer. The \"non-traditional\" assignments -- writing essay responses on the history of specific scientific developments -- are a good idea for any engineering class and offer a way to incorporate writing well about technical topics. Weaknesses: The problem set and test questions are quite basic, which is good and bad. But as a result, the test averages tend to be very high - this raises the question of how much the test is testing a deep understanding vs. memorizing laws and not making careless errors.",
    "As an engineer but not a BME, I came into the class hoping to learn a bit about biology and a bit about what biomedical engineering is. What I got instead was the shoddy application of physics, thermo, and fluids to vaguely biological problems. Not the greatest class in the world, but certainly fine.",
    "This is a truly fantastic class. Professor Humphrey introduces the founding principles of thermomechanics, fluid mechanics and classical mechanics in a way that ties seemingly disparate concepts together with beautiful simplicity. Professor Humphrey is one of the most eloquent, well-organized and kindly professors I have ever had. This class is a must for anyone in science and engineering.",
    "This was an amazing course! Humphrey is a fantastic teacher and really knows how to make the topics interesting and easy to follow. All of the homeworks are well tied into what you're learning, and the workload is very manageable.",
    "Another required course in the slew of classes deemed 'BME.'"
