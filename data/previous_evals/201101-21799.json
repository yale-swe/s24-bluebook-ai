    "Italian 120 completes the survey of basic Italian grammar and is largely supplemented with cultural (literature, cinema, opera) studies. It is challenging but incredibly fair, and the improvement you will notice in your speaking, writing, and understanding of Italian is so rewarding. I would absolutely recommend it.",
    "It's L2 Italian, and if you enjoyed L1, you'll love this class. TAKE IT WITH PROFESSORESSA CARDILLO. She's fantastic.",
    "I would DEFINITELY recommend Italian. The department is awesome, and it is not too challenging.",
    "Yes. Giulia's great.",
    "I would recommend Ital 120 to another student. Italian is a great language to learn. It's not too difficult and it sounds beautiful. Italian culture is intersting. There are also many great Italian films that you watch in this class."
