   "comments": [
    "Anthro 110 is a great class for if you want to know what cultural anthropology is all about. You cover field techniques, as well as some theory and history. For tests it's a lot of memorization though so beware!",
    "Good course--your basic intro to anthropology. Not too hard, pretty interesting, fun assignments that really make you think about Yale.",
    "Yes. I had heard in the past that this class has been less than ideal, and rather boring, but if Harms continues to teach definitely take it. It is a really helpful foundation in anthro that will be really beneficial for looking at issues in any field. Harms really cares about teaching and gives good lectures. It's not mind blowing or anything as it is just intro so you don't get into anything super exciting but it is very very useful.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course! It's seriously a great course for anyone interested in anthropology, history, and\/or sociology. Be warned, however, that there are a decent amount of assignments, but they are all very short and pretty fun.",
    "I strongly recommend this class! The perfect survey introduction to anthropology, with well-chosen readings. When you shop this class, you will probably find Professor Harms a little quirky; that humor is a GOOD thing, that I seek in my professors. His modest charm relays onto his lecture presentation; he tries his best to incorporate fun examples into the course. If you're looking to learn something different, or if you're considering anthropology and want to get a taste before committing to a seminar, take this course!",
    "Yes! Intro to cultural anthropology really gives you a great start in the basics of anthro and introduces interesting perspectives and lenses for analysis.",
    "Loved everything about it. The readings are interesting, nothing too long and the lectures are very fun, stimulating and easy to understand.",
    "Anthro 110 is an exciting intro course that spans verious topics and digs deep into several themes that are relevant in today's society. I would certainly recommend this class to another student!",
    "An introduction to the great thinkers, movements, and techniques of anthropology. This class had a great balance between broad thematic explorations and detailed analysis of specific topics; I feel like I came away with a great understanding of this topic and a new way of looking at the world. Definitely take this class if you are at all interested in social sciences or how people interact!",
    "I thought this was a really well-organized class. I feel like I got a good broad overview of the history, theory, methods, and importance of cultural anthropology. The different types of reading and assignments were interesting and it was great how varied they were. It was in this class that I really decided to be an anthropology major. Professor Harms is very engaging and does a wonderful job of making everything we learn relevant to our lives. My friends who are not anthropology majors also really liked this class. I think it's a great thing to know no matter what your major is.",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend this class to another student. It is a great introduction to not only what socio-cultural anthropologists study, but what they do, as well--the ethnographic project is a great way to get a feel for the research method. Professor Harms is an engaging lecturer, and although the readings take time, it is accessible to anyone interested in learning!",
    "ANTH 110 is a basic overview of cultural anthropology. It is a very good survey and I feel it managed to combine a very broad overview with analysis of particular readings which were pertinent. The readings are VERY MUCH worth doing, and if you don't plan to come to class every day, don't take this course. I really don't regret taking this course.",
    "I would definitely recommend it! Not only if you're interested in anthropology; also good for those who just want to take an interesting class. Great readings, and ideas that apply to every-day life.",
    "This course was a great introduction to sociocultural anthropology. We covered a lot of seminal anthropology texts and concepts, and I now feel well-versed in the discipline. Don't be fooled by the \"introduction\" in the title though, this is a rather work-heavy course. There's a lot of reading with responses due every week, and ethnographic assignments about every two weeks. Some of the books we read were fascinating. If you are interested in anthropology, but don't know a lot about it, this is a great way to start! The ethnographic assignments were really thought-provoking and different thanany other writing assignments I have done for other classes. They also help you to start thinking and writing like an anthropologist. Professor Harms is really nice and fun, but his lectures could sometimes be a little oversimplified. Overall though I really enjoyed the course and would certainly recommend it to anyone interested in sociocultural anthropology.",
    "Yes, definitely recommend.",
    "Introduction to Cultural Anthropology was an enjoyable lecture course. Professor Harms was an engaging lecturer. The class may not be the most academically challenging, but it will challenge the way you look at the world, which is what good classes should do."
