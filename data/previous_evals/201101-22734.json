    "I mean, you have to take it.The pure mathematics one this semester was taught by Professor Kapranov. The topic differs from year to year - this semester each of us had to do one presentation in class. No problem sets\/midterm\/final.",
    "Each student in the class gives a presentation on a topic assigned by the professor. Not too stressful.",
    "this is by far the easiset way to fulfill the senior requirement, and also by far the easist class at yale. no joke",
    "This is sort of a dumb question. You either have to take it or you don't. It was a good experience but that's kind of aside from the point.",
    "Yes, v. light workload, interesting topics.",
    "You have to take it--but take it with Kapranov if you can. He's funny and actually puts some effort into the class, so it's not totally on the students' shoulders to organize the semester. His lectures are interesting and followable, and it helps frame the semester's study in a way that ties everything together and leaves you feeling like you've actually learned something (which you have). So take it with Kapranov and hope the class isn't too small."
