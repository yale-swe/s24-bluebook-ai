    "This class generally involves learning about matrices, vector spaces, transformations, and applying them in various concepts. With Prof. Kfir, we had a much more theoretical perspective, closer to how 225 would be. I felt lectures were dry because we just proved a lot of things without understanding how they tie together, whereas the psets were mostly computation.That being said, this subject is wonderful! I just did the psets without understanding the concepts for most of the year, but I read the Strang book before the final and it was tremendous to see everything come together. I would definitely recommend this class, and especially with this professor, if you take the time to tie the theory and math together.",
    "Don't take it.Here's why:The material is poorly taught. The grading is unreasonably harsh, even for a math class. In our year, half of the class either dropped or withdrew from the class because they were so terrified of getting an F. Our midterm was adjusted so that the median was a C+ , and our final exam was six multiple choice questions, with no partial credit. We knew none of this going into the class, which has made for a very stressful and unpleasant experience.",
    "boring class, don't take if you don't have to",
    "Awful. If Professor Algom-Kfir is teaching, avoid. Take Diff. Eq. instead and wait for someone else to teach the class.",
    "Yael is just not a good teacher, but from what I've heard, most of these teachers are terrible, so maybe it's not her fault. Half of our class dropped it because they were too confused. I went to maybe 8 classes all semester. Just watch the MIT online course with Gilbert Strang. He's interesting and explains the concepts very well. Maybe Yale should just make the course a video seminar.",
    "In Math 222, just as in any other Linear Algebra class that I can imagine, you learn Linear Algebra. This year we didn't discuss much material that would normally be classified as \"applications,\" but at the same time we usually did not do fully rigorous proofs, and such was certainly not expected of the students most of the time. I personally love the Gilbert Strang textbook that we used; most of my progress in the subject came from reading it and doing the homework problems, as has often been the case with me and mathematics. Yael Algom-Kfir is a relatively new teacher, and the class was more theoretical this year than most seemed to have preferred, but I would say we mostly left the class understand the linear algebra that was taught in class. The midterm and other grading seemed to be harder than usual, which may have actually given us a bumping-up curve this semester.If you have to take Linear Algebra, then you have to take it. If future semesters are like this one, be prepared to learn a lot on your own. But that's not a bad thing, is it?",
    "This course is good for people interested in math-related fields that don't want to pursue pure math theory. You will learn the basis for a lot of applications to the sciences and even economics, or in my case, just learn some cool concepts and a totally new branch of math from calculus. Yet you see how many of the algorithms relate to processes in calculus. Overall, this course is fairly solid and theoretically doesn't have an unmanageable workload, but if you take it with Professor Algom-Kfir you will hate it. Without proper instruction and a fundamental understanding of the concepts, it will be very hard to get anything out of this class without working extremely hard on your own to basically teach yourself the material. It is also just very unenjoyable with this Algom-Kfir because she was such a disagreeable teacher and didn't seem to care about teaching the course at all.",
    "It's fine, I guess. I took it as an elective because I wanted to expand upon my math skills, and it did that. It made me view math in a different light, which was kinda cool.",
    "This class, as taught to me, was not an \"applications-based\" class. A lot of class time was spent with proofs or abstract cases, and we didn't lean many practical uses for linear algebra. That being said, the material isn't that difficult (but it depends on the professor...), but neither is it fun.",
    "Don't take this unless you really need it. It used to be an easy class, but with the professor changes, it no longer is.",
    "I thought that the material in Linear Algebra was really interesting and I liked learning it but I did not think that my Professor did a good job teaching it so I probably would not recommend Math 222 to another student.",
    "Linear algebra is very interesting (but sometimes abstract), but you will get a fairly good introduction to this subject through MATH 222. The course paces steadily. The later materials are a bit abstract, but their applications in real-life problems are pretty engaging. Yael is a good professor, but maybe the major problem this semester is that it\u0092s her first time to teach MATH 222 and she often confuses with MATH 225. Sometimes you feel like you are doing more proofs than you should do, and the format and questions of the exams are a bit different from previous years, but hopefully everything should be getting better in the future. Homework problems actually take quite a bit of time and are sometimes tedious, but I guess with linear algebra you do need a decent amount of practices to completely master the materials. Exam questions are not just computations of matrices. A lot of them test on important concepts of linear algebra and are sometimes a bit tricky.",
    "Not unless you have to take it. Especially hard this year.",
    "If you are planning on taking this course, you should take it with a different professor. Yael makes this class way too hard and stressful. I often couldn't follow her lectures, also, because she explained everything in terms of mathematical proofs instead of just giving us intuitions on how things worked. I ended up watching the Gilbert Strang MIT lectures in this course in order to learn most of the material.Also, the problem sets and tests are a bit too hard-- at least 3 of the 10 psets took over 20 hours. Which is a little bit ridiculous for a fairly intro level math course.",
    "This course teaches the basics of linear algebra. I would not recommend this course because the problem sets are quite long, there are few applications, and classes are filled with proofs. Less than half the class actually attended lectures every day, although I would recommend attending them if you take the class.",
    "I usually don't get too mean on evaluations, but this time I can't help myself. I spent 3 months of my life dealing with 20 page psets, a teacher who barely taught and made her office hours as inaccessible as possible (9 am Wednesday Friday), and a midterm that was terribly graded. If you have to take this class, watch the MIT open courses lectures, otherwise you're in trouble.",
    "I do not have an accurate assessment of this class. All of the students I talked to from previous years said that the course was fine, but if Yael is teaching, I would strongly recommend against taking this course.",
    "Excellent course. Well TAed, well taught and generally a very beautiful area of mathematics. TAKE IT!!!",
    "Yale's math department has always disappointed me. This course is no exception. MATH 222 was rather poorly structured. We didn't cover nearly as much material as the professor planned to. We hardly went over Jordan form and were told it was going to be on the final. And if you have to take this class, don't take it with Algom Kfir. First of all, she asked us to tell her if we were dropping the class so that she wouldn't have to grade our exams, while it should have been the other way round: she grades our exams, and then we decide whether to drop the class. She always has other \"commitments\" that prevent her from paying enough attention to us.",
    "Do not take (especially with Professor Kfir).",
    "If you like mathematics and want to learn new linear algebra concepts, I would recommend this course. If you just want to take this class for fun, it is not a good choice.",
    "Math 222 provided an introduction to the concepts of linear algebra, however there was less emphasis on the applications than I anticipated. The class was often unnecessarily stressful and confusing. I would recommend this class if you need linear algebra for future classes\/major, but not necessarily if you just want to take an interesting math class.",
    "Personally, I did not think Math 222 is a good course. There seemed to be very few applications to what we were learning. I would only recommend it if you are forced to decide between it and 225 for your major.",
    "MATH 222 covers linear algebra. The title says \"linear algebra with applications\", but I feel like we didn't cover much applications stuff at all. I'd caution against taking this class with Yael Algom-Kfir. A lot of my friends who took this class with me agreed that she wasn't that helpful as an instructor. The textbook we used was written by an MIT professor, and his linear algebra course is on MIT opencourseware. Read the textbook and watch the lectures online and you'll do fine on this course. Workload was pretty manageable and the material wasn't that difficult (a bit harder than MATH 120, but easier than Differential Eqs).",
    "DO NOT TAKE THIS WITH PROFESSOR KFIR. Seriously. This is not one of those I've-never-taken-a-math-class-before-in-my-life-and-now-I'm-complaining-about-the-workload reviews. No. I'm a science major who's had my fair share of problem sets and abstract thinking, and this class was completely unreasonable. Professor Kfir is unfair, unconcerned and confusing, assigning massive workloads and tests that covered material outside of the homework. We weren't even allowed to ask about homework in the TA problem sessions. This class will take over your life if you want to do well. Don't do it. Just don't. Worst experience of my undergraduate career."
