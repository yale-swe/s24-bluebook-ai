    "Do not take this class unless you are very interested in the subject matter or already have a very strong physics background. I came in having taken AP Physics B and C in high school, but the class material (in lecture) was still very hard for me to follow. The workload was low, but the exams were very difficult and many people dropped the class because of their initial failing test grades. There are also many people who take the class who get almost perfect on exams, but if you're not in that group, it will be more of a struggle. The material is not universally appealing, and the majority of the time I struggled to stay awake. Please think twice about taking the class-- if you do, go to help sessions with TAs to get homework help and study hard for exams.",
    "Professor Heinrich has been doing this for a while, and although he seems very nice, he's not particularly engaging. Conceptually, this course is pretty easy, but there is a good amount of memorization. The problem-sets are simple and can be completed quickly. The exams are poorly written and so can be tedious and difficult. I would not particularly recommend this course.",
    "I would recommend this course to a fellow student! It's an interesting course about the physics behind everyday technologies, and the ideas presented in this course are very cool. The physics was more challenging than I anticipated - students should be prepared to work hard to succeed in this class.",
    "It's a great class to take if you need a Sc credit. You will have to put in some effort but considerably less than what you put in for other classes. Henrich is very approachable outside of class for help and his lectures are pretty engaging- there are lots of cool demos.",
    "If you're looking for a gut science class, this isn't it. If you are looking for an interesting, manageable science class, then you've found it. There is a problem set every week, two midterms, and a final, but no textbook so no reading throughout the semester. Basically, go to lecture and go to the help sessions for the problem set and you should be fine.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to a student who is interested in physics and technology, but has not had much experience in the area.",
    "The Technological World is a wonderful course to understand some of the basic sciences behind the things we encounter everyday. It's exciting to be able to walk away from class and know how an LCD screen works, or a GPS system. However, if math is not your strong suit, you may find this class a bit of a struggle. I am not math-minded, so I sometimes found some of the equations to be a bit difficult. The class is a QR along with a SC, so don't forget that. If you're okay putting in a few extra hours in the library, then definitely take this course. It's the one where after every lecture I would come home and tell my roommate what I learned.",
    "This class is not easy if you don't take it seriously but if you do, there's a lot of support and you can do well. Go to class and go to help sessions.",
    "This course is a disgrace to Yale education and please avoid this course at all cost.",
    "lEngineering and Applied Science 110 was a great class that covered relevant topics in modere technology. The mathematics was challenging but doable, and the exams were all reasonable. I learned a lot.",
    "Definitely. Take it to learn a lot about modern technology and some basic physics as well. It does help if you have a quantitative background though.",
    "No no no. I feel like I didn't learn that much. Henrich gives you sheets every class and lots of information. He gives you tons of information but you have no idea what is important and what isnt. There isn't a text for the class, so you can't read up on it either. You just have to remember what he said in class on every sheet. Not as easy as advertised. Especially if you didn't have a physics background.",
    "If you need a science credit, take this class. It's very interesting and not too difficult.",
    "The material covered is fairly interesting, but the problem sets and exams are rather difficult. There are easier classes you can take for a Sc credit but this might be the most rewarding.",
    "This class was really interesting and a fun QR. Be prepared to work hard on the problem sets. They take a long time, and are really only doable if you have a group of friends to work with. The first few weeks are the hardest-- if youget through them you will be fine! It is really math\/physics based though so be prepared to work!",
    "Terrible never take it.",
    "This is not a gut, but it's a very fun way to get a science credit.",
    "This was one of the most unique and interesting courses I have taken at Yale. It's really cool to learn how a computer, digital camera, LED light, CD player et cetera all work, as it's something we tend not to think about even though these devices are central in our lives.If you have a basic background in physics this course will be a piece of cake. You'll still have to go to lecture though because even though the concepts are familiar, the applications you have to understand are situationally specific.If you don't have a physics background this course is still very doable and worthwhile, but will definitely require a greater time investment.",
    "The Tech World is basically the class for the website\/books How Stuff Works. Its really interesting and very manageable for non STEM majors, especially if you have physics\/ engineering friends willing to help you on psets. Its really important to go to class and take notes, but if you do that and hand in your psets on time, its fine. The psets don't take too long and theres only one a week so the work load isn't bad. On the midterm and final you get two two-sided pages of notes, which makes it a lot less stressful too.",
    "Take it if you're mildly interested in how gadgets work and took high school physics.",
    "Yes absolutely. It is a great class for anyone who has ever been curious about how the technology in the world around them works. It will challenge you to actually apply the physics that you are learning and see how the concepts make sense practically.A really fun and interesting course.Highly recommend.",
    "1) Psets every week2) 3 tests - all are hard3) learn about many technological devices, such as GPS, TVs, 3D movies, LEDs, solar cells, etc. Really, really amazing stuff. I'm glad I took the class so I could learn about the technology.",
    "The class is basically a \"how stuff works\" class. You literally learn the physics behind tons of things we use every day, which is really fascinating. I would recommend this class as an intriguing science credit, but it is definitely NOT a gut.",
    "It was a wonderful class, not too difficult, but very interesting. I would recommend this to another student."
