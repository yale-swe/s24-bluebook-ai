    "Navy 311 was a basic overview of naval engineering material. If you're not a member of NROTC, it is largely not useful. Do not take if an engineering student. The course is not designed to be upper level. Interesting class overall though. You do not receive credit for it.",
    "Great class for my purposes, but I would only recommend if you are in ROTC. It's meant for students like me who have never really studied engineering."
