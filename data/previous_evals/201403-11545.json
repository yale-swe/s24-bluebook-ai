Also, presentations on the reading were often lackluster. Many people are not good at speaking in front of others and often presentations were hard to follow. Generally, readings were not clarified in section. I would prefer not having a discussion section and instead having an extra assignment somewhere in the semester that is meant to synthesize the reading."
