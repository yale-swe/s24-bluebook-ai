    "Strong course, wish that there was a clearer idea of the objectives for each project going in, although I understand that a lot of this changes on the ground based on the information collected.",
    "Interesting course material and projects; While the op-ed assignment was fun to do, it fell at a pretty inconvenient time with respect to the timing of the projects. Had it been earlier, I would have been able to spend more time on it.",
    "Requires a lot of time and commitment to the project, but the end product is definitely worth it. The lack of structure might scare you at first, but utilize teamwork to work things through and establish goals to reach.",
    "This course is great for getting hands-on experience in advocacy and policy. Very rigorous projects that push you to do important, impactful work you didn't think you could do.",
    "Has the feel of going full-speed, juggling three different balls at the same time. So a fun class, but occasionally terrifying. The class does have premium on teamwork and functioning as a responsive and available human being."

    "Instructor: Alice M Miller \u00a0one of the best professors I've had here at Yale.",
    "Instructor: Alice M Miller \u00a0A wonderful supervising professor, we would not have been able to push through with the project with such depth and understanding without her guidance!",
    "Instructor: Alice M Miller \u00a0Ali is very supportive and brings great energy to the class and team projects. She is an abstract-thinker, but her thinking always provides sharp, critical analysis to the work at hand.",
    "Instructor: Alice M Miller \u00a0First(well, technically second but far more convincing) and only person I know whose ever convinced me a meta-analysis of language and syntax actually has practical effects on health justice advocacy. Also a wealth of practical experience tied to more analytical\/big-picture thinking.",
    "Instructor: Amy Nicole Kapczynski \u00a0Thoughtful and critical - a little intimidating to speak to at first, but truly a caring person once you get to know her.",
    "Instructor: Amy Nicole Kapczynski \u00a0Amy is very practical and logical, and always makes sure the project is grounded in reality. She is also accessible and makes herself available to support the project whenever needed.",
    "Instructor: Amy Nicole Kapczynski \u00a0Has accomplished the interesting balancing act of being both an interesting academic in terms of ideas and rigorous in terms of practical application. An eye-opener in terms of being able to nail down the present core of a policy and still being able to look ahead to advancing the rest of the agenda\/other policies. There's often a lot of moving parts in any given policy area that cuts across a lot of domains(legal, economics, politics, etc), it's interesting meeting someone who has a good grasp of the details of the domains AND can convey those intersections to a more lay audience.",
    "Instructor: Gregg Steven Gonsalves \u00a0Thoughtful, caring, engaged. Would always send us emails with breaking information on any of the three projects.",
    "Instructor: Gregg Steven Gonsalves \u00a0Gregg is very goal-oriented and kept the team on task to work towards the end product. Gregg is also analytical and had a lot of great insights for the project, especially during the writing phase.",
    "Instructor: Gregg Steven Gonsalves \u00a0Friendly and responsive. The enthusiasm about the work is also very different from a lecture or even seminar based class. The extensive experience with advocacy both internationally and domestically is a big plus."

   "comments": [
    "An amazing way to begin practicing intersectional public health and law work in the context of a practicum with institutional support from faculty.",
    "It definitely requires your undivided devotion and good time management skills. Of you don't, you'll feel it during the numerous supervised and unsupervised meetings, because your lack of work will show, in comparison to the awesome people you'll be put to work with. However, it's not all doom and gloom. There has never been a class where I've learned such interdisciplinary skills and had been so impassioned and motivated by the subject matter at hand. You also get to learn from really qualified and extraordinary professors!",
    "Very time-consuming course. Do not take if you have other major time commitments. You will learn a lot about advocacy, but you should be sure to put in the work for it.",
    "Take it if you're looking for a hands-on practical legal\/public health policy course with a lot of supervision interaction and teamwork. The workload is intense, but very rewarding. Not necessarily a theory intensive class."
