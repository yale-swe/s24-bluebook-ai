    "A great class, but SO MUCH work. You'll have weekly animation assignments, several 30-second assignments, and then spend the last half of the semester working on a longer project. This class is really what you make of it: if you put the time and effort in, you'll walk away with some incredible pieces. Don't let the work scare you off! Just be aware that it's there. Also Johannes is a wonderful professor!",
    "Don't expect to learn.",
    "If you like drawing, storytelling, film, computers - or anything else - TAKE IT!",
    "Principles of Animation provides a great foundation and introduction to animation, but it by no means will make you an expert in the field. It provides a really good foundation and history to the early conceptions of animations as well as establishing the main principles for the art. It also has a good introduction to a set of programs that can be helpful in producing animations but will require a lot more time than the semester to master and be an expert in."
