    "very little work.",
    "great course, really gets you thinking about how to make new products. the only issue is that the book is terrible. It is unorganized, the index has no page numbers, there are typos all over the place. then you buy the course packet, and it is the book again, but then some more added on, pages are printed multiple times, the page numbers just stop after about 300, it is incredibly frustrating to figure what the heck is going on in the book.DONT BOTHER BUYING THE BOOK.",
    "Absolutely take this course. It is really cool and you get to learn about small businesses and the creativity process. It is unique and there is no other course like this. Take it for sure.",
    "I would recommend this.",
    "That was a fascinating chance to take a class where the aim is designing a physical product. Each week you learn about a different aspect of product development and in just a short 10 weeks, you will have created a tangible product prototype which you will present in detail at the end.HIGLY RECOMMENDED!",
    "Best classs everrrrr. Very little work week to week but very interesting. You can hold off doing the final presentation until relatively close to the date, but if you slowly work on it throughout the semester it will be the lightest workload you've had at Yale overall. Nice break from the other classes you take. No Doubt, take it.",
    "Yes. This is a great course. Not very challenging, but definitely worth taking if you can get in.Creativity and New Product Design is a fun course. It's like no other course offered to undergrads at Yale.It is well-orgainized and follows Professor Bolanos' process for creating and developing a new product. I particularity enjoyed the team-oriented aspect of the class as well as the process of creating my own product.Professor Bolanos is great. He is clearly an expert in the field of creating and developing new products. His lectures, his book and the accompanying course packet guide students throughout the process of developing a new product.Downsides: the lectures can be a bit boring and some of the material is a bit outdated.However, the class is overall a great course and one you're guaranteed to do well in.",
    "Pretty relaxed, fun class where you essentially learn the process of designing a new product, marketing it and getting financing. Don't expect to get too much out of it unless you put something into it, but it's pretty easy and really enjoyable.",
    "Creativity and New Product Development is a great course for anyone who has ever wanted to invent something. The course is spent designing a new product, doing everything from coming up with a concept, surveying other students, building a prototype, and pitching your final product to investors. It's a great course, not too hard, and a lot of fun.",
    "Definitely take this class. I learned a lot about a different subject that is not touched on in any other class at yale.",
    "TAKE IT-- one of the few practical classes at Yale- really easy, very little work, and occasionally you get really interesting speaker"
