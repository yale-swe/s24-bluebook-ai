    "Not sure how helpful this is going to be because this class will no longer exist next year, but I would recommend taking a stats\/probability as well as a linear algebra course before this one to familiarize yourself with the subject material. If you've never coded before, there might be a steep learning curve but MATLAB is pretty easy to pick up.",
    "I was frightened coming into this course by previous evaluations I had read, but I really did not find this course as terrifying as its made out to be. Its an overview of Matlab, statistics, a lot of curve fitting, and biological applications. I thought it was a cool course that will hopefully be useful to me in the future. If anything I thought it tried to cover almost too much material and did not go in depth enough on any one thing. The problem sets are reasonable and Carson encourages collaboration. Carson himself is a cool guy and a fairly engaging lecturer on what can sometimes be dullish material. I don't know if this course would be super useful to other engineering majors, but I would definitely recommend it to other straight biology majors who might not be getting a lot of exposure to computation and data analysis.",
    "I would recommend it, although BME majors should try to take higher level math and cs courses after.",
    "Do it because you have to, but you'll learn some fun stuff along the way!",
    "Hard, expect to spend a lot of time working on the problem sets. The contents of the exams are largely focused on the lectures and not on what you do on the problem sets.",
    "Very difficult course that requires a great deal of work. Would not reccomend to anyone who is not required to take it",
    "A required class. I mean I think I learned a lot but it was also awful in terms of course load. There was a final pset due on the last day of reading week and that totally messed up my studying schedule and made everything awful",
    "It's an introduction to matlab in the context of biological applications.",
    "Take it if you need to. If not, just don't, it's not worth the struggle. This class is very difficult."
