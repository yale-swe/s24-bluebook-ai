   "comments": [
    "Highly recommended if you're interested in learning the basic of music theory and literacy. If you have no musical experience you might struggle and have to put in more time practicing, but if you keep at it you will find it very rewarding.",
    "Some of the homework can be tedious, but it's a good introduction to music theory.",
    "Its a great course that teaches you a skill that you can take with you for the rest of you life, and that is how to listen to and play music.",
    "Busy, tedious, do not recommend.",
    "A LOT OF WORK for a low level music class. This is not the spring equivalent of \"clap for credit.\" Take it if you know nothing about music and want tto learn, but be prepared to spend a lot of time understanding, or you will quickly fall behind and not know what to do. I kind of knew how to read music, so the first few weeks were easy, but then had to spend a lot of time to keep up.",
    "Definitely take this class if you're at all interested in understanding music in a more formal way. Even if you've played an instrument or sung all your life, this is a great comprehensive review of music theory if you're not familiar with that kind of thing. If you've never had any exposure to theory, music notation, etc., it might be pretty time-consuming at first. Some people in my class were spending 3-4 hours on each homework assignment (assigned every lecture). With that said, it's well-worth your time if you want to become a better musician. Shop multiple sections and see which one fits you best because each instructor has a different style."
