    "WAYYYY too much work. Also probably the best-taught language here, and all of the sensei are fun and endearing. But still, don't take it unless you want to be an East Asian studies major or you have absolutely no problem with doing two hours of Japanese homework a night.",
    "Strongly recommend! All the instructors are so nice and willing to help you improve Japanese speaking, writing and listening skill. Since the course meets everyday, I have so much fun every morning and start the rest of the day in a good mood.",
    "A fantastic class with an appropriate fous on spoken Japanese. The teachers are all enthusiastic, helpful, and above all adorable. The class is a good bit of work, but what you put in you definitely get out. Met some great students in the class, and by the end of first semester a group dynamic ha definitely formed. Got me excited about language in a way I'd never been before.",
    "Japanese 110 is an intensive course that teaches you the basis of Japanese. Though it is a lot of work, it is essential to push yourself when first learning Japanese, as it is an extremely difficult language. Overall, it is a good class. Though difficult, it is doable.",
    "Yes, I would recommend!",
    "Summary: best L1 class ever! Take it.An outstanding L1 language class, taught by great professors. The structure is that you learn the grammar and vocabulary at home, and then come to class to practice speaking and using the grammar and vocab. The class is extremely interactive, and the use of classroom visual aids is unparalleled.I would definitely recommend this to any student interested in a language. The class also builds a very tight-knit community as well thanks to the rotating sections, an optional trip, and brunch\/lunch in Commons after."
