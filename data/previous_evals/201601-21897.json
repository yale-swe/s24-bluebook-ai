    "This class is a highly grammatical approach to language, like other ancient language classes. I would recommend this if you like grammar and are able to put in the time for the homework.",
    "It is not a lot of work at times, but can be stressful and time consuming when an assignment is due. Overall ok, harder than the previous course.",
    "I would recommend this class because it is unusual, yet interesting. It is rare for people to say they can read Hieroglyphics, and this class offers insight into the culture, as well, beyond the grammar of the lessons, thanks to Professor Geisen.",
    "I would definitely recommend Egyp 120! You get to read the tale of the shipwrecked sailor, so by the end you will have completely translated a true piece of ancient Egyptian literature, which not too many people can say they've done!"
