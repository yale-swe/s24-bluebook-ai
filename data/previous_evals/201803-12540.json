   "comments": [
    "strengths: engaging discussion; good readings. Others: I feel sometimes prof. Erikson comes in with a very strong and specific interpretation of the text, which can be a good thing, but it also forms pressure on the students' part to agree with that specific interpretation. For students who don't agree, it might go into a lengthy debate that is not necessarily constructive use of everyone else's time. I like how prof. Erikson challenges students' comments, but it might also be good to give some positive feedback on the students' opinions first and then go into rebuttal. Or it is easy to come across as disappointment with students. A separate point is that some students in the class, from my personal knowledge, have not done the readings dutifully and carefully. And these students, in particular, have a tendency to speak more to hide the fact of their inadequate preparation. So they would make non-substantial comments that are not specific or concrete but express their \"general feeling\" or normative judgment, but their comments or debates are not in fact meaningful and take away the time that students who have carefully done the reading would use, to make actually constructive comments. I hope if the instructor can detect this pattern, then there could be better judgment of what comment is actually useful and what is not, thus more interference. Not every opinion is equally valuable. Sometimes I feel the classroom time is not spent in a valuable way because of those comments, but I don't know what to do.",
    "The readings were great. The professor had a very impressive knowledge of each thinker and could provide insight that seemed really valuable. On occasion, it felt like the class was perhaps on a different page than the professor, so at times it seemed like more scaffolding could have been done to get the class on pace. That said, I think it's important that the class be held to a high standard of reading and comprehension.",
    "The only weakness was that sometimes it felt like a bit of a whirlwind tour of various thinkers. One could spend a lifetime studying Hegel, for example, so doing him in 30 minutes felt slightly perverse...but this is probably an unavoidable problem in a course like this, and I don't think it would be helpful to sacrifice breadth for depth.",
    "As for the strength, I think it is the broad range of topics that will be covered in this course. It is not limited to the \"big three,\" namely Weber, Marx and Durkheim; we have also read materials from DuBois and so on. As for weaknesses, I think sometimes the discussion is not so concentrated on fundamental issues in sociology. But it is not a big deal; at least I can learn from others."
