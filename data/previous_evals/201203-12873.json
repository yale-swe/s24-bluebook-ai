    "course material is interesting, but expect to do a lot of learning on your own.",
    "Honestly, this is a class you only take if you're pre-med. It's really hard and while it's nice to get an understanding of the base of how things work in biology, it's a lot of unnecessary material that is unnecessarily difficult to understand. It definitely could have been a lot worse though in terms of how much work there could have been...",
    "If you are interested in organic chemistry at all or need to fulfill pre-med requirements, this class is great. It is geared towards pre-med students and if you take it while taking a bio course the overlap is so cool. This was a great course and though I was not previously thinking about taking a higher level organic chemistry course, now I am definitely considering it.",
    "I don't know if I would have taken it had it not been required, but I have enjoyed the experience even though it is definitely a difficult class. Not so much class work, but a lot of work on your own to study\/learn the mechanisms. Also, don't be fooled by open-note exams. They are more difficult that you anticipate them to be.",
    "I think this class is pretty cool. You probably have to do, but you should anyways even if you don't have to. It is cool to apply what you know about Orgo to biology.",
    "Solid course. In-class exams are much harder than take-homes for obvious reasons, but you learn a lot in the course and start to think in an \"organic chemistry\" way. Super interesting material with numerous biological applications. Halfway through the course, I honestly thought this could be a biochemistry course. Take it with Prof. Phillips!",
    "You will probably take this since you have to. It is pretty difficult, but all tests are either take home or open note.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course because it brings together very interesting concepts and is a nice challenge.",
    "def take it with phillips if you can. otherwise, stay away.",
    "CHEM 230 is a great introductory course for learning the organic chemistry of biological pathways, as the name suggests. Although I liked organic chem going into it, Professor Phillips really made me love the class. He emphasizes the \"why\" of reactions rather than the \"how,\" which makes the material a lot more interesting. He also relates almost everything back to biology and modern drug applications for diseases, which is great if you are pre-med. Three exams, one in-class and 2 take-home, and you can drop one. The problem sets are not difficult. Overall, not a lot of work and a wonderful learning experience. I would say that if anything could be improved, it might help if the lectures were organized a bit more efficiently so we could follow the trajectory of the material a bit better.",
    "Take this class! I love orgo to begin with, but this class was wonderful. You get to learn the organic chemistry behind glycolysis and the citric acid cycle, which was really interesting. Prof. Phillips is awesome.",
    "Yes. but only if Phillips is teaching it. Otherwise, good luck.",
    "I definitely would recommend this course. Professor Phillips is excellent and laid back, and you'll learn loads about real-life chemistry.",
    "Good course - Professor Phillips is a great professor, who emphasizes understanding rather than memorization. I highly recommend taking organic chem with him.",
    "Please take this Orgo II class. It's the best\/easiest way to fulfill your orgo requirement!!",
    "I'm sure if you are looking at this course, you are probably frustrated with organic chemistry for two reasons: 1)You have to study this annoying subject to fulfill requirements for something vaguely related and 2) Orgo 1 was so bad that you are still traumatized. Fortunately, this orgo course was the easiest science course I've taken at Yale. The problem sets only take an hour at max, and there are only 5 of them during the semester. The exams are mostly take-home, and he has no problem with the average on them being 90%. He is also rumored to curve the class to an A-...talk about grade inflation. So kick back, relax, and enjoy Orgo 2, but do try to go to class (it helps for the take-home exams). Good luck!",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student if they enjoy chemistry and problem solving.",
    "I definitely recommend the class. If you are interested in the bridge of chemistry and biology this is a good and fascinating class. In my opinion, this class is easier than orgo 1 (though if you had Ellman than maybe the same amount of difficulty). Tests are all open note and open internet, and you have two take home midterms that I think can definitely be done well given that you put enough time and thought into it.",
    "Chem 230 was a pretty chill class overall. The P Sets were very short, the in-class tests were open book \/ note \/ computer, and the other tests were take-home. You focus on the chemistry of the carbonyl group and learn a ton about how it functions in nature. Professor Phillips is the most chill \/ realistic professor ever, and he makes the atmosphere a very friendly one. Take it with Phillips!",
    "CHEM 230 is the second half of organic chemistry. Instead of rote memorization like the first half, though, CHEM 230 is a lot about critical thinking. There's not a lot of work compared to the first half, but the material is also more challenging in my opinion. I would recommend it though, because it can be really fun if you understand what's going on.",
    "This course started out being one of the most frustrating courses I've taken at Yale. Professor Phillips was certainly trying to teach us as much as possible, but I think a major issue was that he wasn't there that often. He was always on a business trip somewhere, making it difficult to ask any questions about the material or the p-sets. Another problem was that his notes or at least what he wrote on the board seemed very disjointed and unorganized. Going back through my notes was a bit difficult since nothing seemed to have rhyme or reason to it (I took the CHEM 220 with Ellman, and his notes were always very linear, very organized and understandable). Although the first midterm and the final were all open notes, open book, and open laptop, the fact that our class as a whole did so poorly on the first midterm should have been a clue that something was wrong. And it seemed that it did work, because after about the second midterm, Professor Phillips seemed to take things more slowly and try to work with us on a more conceptual level. That was appreciated and I think the class did improve from there. If you can pick your TA and it's the same three teaching (they work in Prof. Phillips' lab), try and get Candace. She's so helpful, although a bit of a tough grader. Ben is pretty useless and gets much of his information wrong. This also seemed to be a class where we were promised many things but ultimately did not get anything. We were promised keys to the midterms we took: we received absolutely none. We were promised 10 p-sets throughout the semester and the option to drop 5. The prof. was scrambling to give us 6 (uploaded them Tuesday night and due that Friday, a problem when the class is MWF), so we could drop at least one. Overall, this was frustrating but if you're pre-med you're going to take it and to be honest, you can get through it if you just accept this will be a frustrating experience.",
    "Not bad, especially with Andy Phillips. The in class tests are HARD, but the take homes can salvage your grade.",
    "I didn't enjoy this class very much. I thought the structure of the class w\/ take home\/open note tests was really not cool, and I felt like I wasn't learning much throughout the process. It's a lot of biochem and not a lot learning fundamental orgo reactions. I didn't like that. I found orgo 1 to be better.",
    "I expect to do worse in orgo 2 than I did in orgo 1, even though every exam was open. The material is in some ways more interesting because it's more biology-oriented. Phillips is a funny and good person and great scientist, but he is a relatively disorganized lecturer compared to Ellman. His philosophy is great: it's not about what you can memorize, it's actually about what you learn and how you apply what you learn, which is why all exams are open notebook. He's busy and famous-ish, which means he's not great about replying to emails, posting answer keys on classesv2, having secure office hours, etc. He cares about his students in a kind, fatherly way.",
    "Go ahead and take this class. It won't kill you. The first midterm really hard, but things get better from there.",
    "Professor Phillips does a great job! It's a very conceptual course, but you will learn it well.",
    "Definitely recommend it. Professor Phillips is a great and dynamic lecturer, you learn a whole lot in a semester, and you are tested on concepts\/understanding rather that silly memorization. Providing you don't leave any one thing for a single night (test, homework, studying), the class should work itself out.",
    "It is an extremely interesting class. It has a substantial amount of work, but it is enjoyable. You lean new information everyday. You don't just learn about mechanisms, you learn about why these mechanisms happen. It is definitely a good class to take",
    "Chem 230 is a great class. There's not that much material, though the topics can be a bit disjointed at times. Prof. Phillips presents the material in a clear way and the book is very useful in supplementing the lectures. All tests are either open note or take-home, so it's very helpful to compile a comprehensive summary sheet. Key to doing well in the class (apart from understanding the material) is to be as organized as possible and know where to find your answers. The answer to any question can found directly from your notes, handouts, or the text.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. The problems sets were enjoyable, the tests were not too stressful (take home\/open book), and I learned a lot.",
    "Yes, highly recommended. It was a lot of fun to look at Organic chemistry in the scope of biological systems and the chemistry of life. And professor Philips was a great person to teach it.",
    "I thought this was a good class, but I'm not sure if I would recommend it to other students unless they have to take it. I thought the material was really interesting, but since all the midterms and final were open book\/note\/computer, I felt like I learned mostly how to look things up in Google than the actual material. I don't think this is a tortuous class at all, and I'm sure that if you take it you'll be fine, but I wouldn't recommend it for a \"fun\" class for someone.",
    "Overall, I would recommend this class. As long as one stays on top of the material, the class is manageable.",
    "Lots of work but very interesting",
    "yes, definitely less stressful. tests are open book, which may or may not be a good thing. i don't think you always leave class with a deep understanding of the material or mechanism, but it's a pretty enjoyable class.",
    "You probably have to take this class, but 230 with Phillips is not too bad. Although I had Ellman last semester so everything was very very structured, it's easy to get lost during lecture and have no idea what will be on exams. Phillips curves the class very well however, which is nice. There's one in-class open book test, two take home exams, and an open-book final. Nearly everyone does bad on the first test, so work really hard on the take homes and you'll do fine. Phillip's philosophy on studying is interesting and should be the way most classes should be structured, it's about consolidating big ideas rather than getting lost in memorizing (as was done in 220). Don't fall behind and learn glycolysis the day before the final, and you'll do fine.",
    "If you are looking to take this class, you probably are doing so because you have to take it anyway (i.e. premed reqs etc). That said, Orgo II is significantly more challenging than Orgo I. I would recommend taking the Orgo series out of sequence (Orgo I in the spring, Orgo II in the fall), as you have smaller classes and better professors. The class has a hefty workload, three midterms (two of which are take-home), 5 problem sets and a final. All the tests are open book, open internet, open notes, which is both a blessing and a curse. Overall, a good course, rewarding if you work hard and keep up with the material, miserable if you don't.",
    "It's much more fun than orgo 1. honestly. it really is. i don't know if i can call it objectively fun, but that's mostly because the kind of people who tend to take orgo are horrible, angry, pre-med underclassmen with no souls, who are basically succubi. and incubi. andy phillips is spectacular, the material is SPECTACULAR, but oh man, those pre-meds. hate em all.",
    "This class is a lot better than the first semester organic chemistry course if you like enzymes. It focuses more on the reactions that occur in the biological pathway than reactions that happen in lab. It is a good course in general.",
    "Chemistry 230 is very different from Chemistry 220 in that there is less of a focus on memorizing material and more of a focus on identifying key structures and figuring out how to use chemical properties to develop viable mechanisms. In essence, a higher degree of critical and analytical thinking is involved. If a student is to do well in this class, then attendance is mandatory; only by attending each lecture can a student acquire all of the material necessary to prepare for exams and develop a good understanding and appreciation for these concepts.I would certainly recommend Chem 230 to another student. The course can be challenging at times, but I believe that students will find it to be worth the investment of time and effort, especially when they find how much their abilities to think critically have grown.",
    "I recommend this course, particularly BEFORE Biochemistry. You will learn about some of the same pathways (ie glycolysis, citric acid cycle), but it is SO much easier to remember because you know the mechanism behind the pathway. In this class there is very little memorization and a huge emphasis on the reasons that certain mechanisms occur. Some people complained the class was too slow...definitely don't expect to take this to cram a huge amount of information into your head. Likely you will already know a good portion of the material. But I found it refreshing to get to actually learn something, instead of just memorizing information for exams that I forget soon afterward. Also, the workload is basically nothing.",
    "This class is different from other science classes and takes time to get used to. There is one in class midterm, two take home midterms, and 1 final. There is an emphasis on understanding the material instead of simply memorizing, so all exams are open book. Professor Phillips is a good teacher. Sometimes he goes through concepts too fast but he is great at explaining things.",
    "Chemistry 230 is exactlywhat the name suggests: a course about the relationship between organic chemistry and biology. I feel like it's less difficult and more interesting than all of the memorization we had to do for our first semester of organic chemistry, and with Professor Phillips all of our exams were open-book, open-notes, open-laptop, etc. (even the final), but with the kind of material we were learning, the tests were still difficult unless you really knew the material from class well. Long story short -- it's a difficult class, but it's super interesting, and if you were having second thoughts about premed thanks to first semester orgo you'll probably be re-inspired in this class.",
    "Guys, this is actually a great class. You come out having learned a lot about organic chemistry. Phillips teaches the class in a way that makes you appreciate the material. The first test did not go well, but we had a retake. The next two exams were take homes and had a pretty high class average. The homework assignments are fair and really make you think, and it's fun to work on them in groups. The final is truly comprehensive and tests your conceptual understanding of the material. It's not too much work day to day, and you will definitely come out having learned something you didn't know walking in.",
    "The course is pretty disorganized - I often didn't know what knowledge I was supposed to leave a lecture with. But in the end, I did learn a fair amount and am glad prof. Phillips was my teacher.",
    "Definitely take this class! Much better than orgo I, and prof. Phillips is the best!",
    "It is not like orgo 1. Open book exams and take homes make this course a little different from what you might be used to.",
    "I would recommend this class if you are Pre-Med, Chemistry major, MCDB major (this class can count as an elective), and\/or MB&B major. It is a great way to look at the organic chemistry used in common biological pathways. There is a lot of overlap with biochemistry. One of the better classes in the pre-med track.",
    "I definitely recommend this course as long as Prof. Phillips teaches it. He keeps the material fun and relevant and his emphasis on understanding rather than rote memorization made this course really helpful for future courses like biochemistry.",
    "I highly, highly recommend this class. Pre-meds in their beginning years are so used to having to memorize mechanisms and details that they often lose the forest for the trees. This class is very rare in that it forces you to see the big picture. If you are one of the 99% of aformentioned pre-meds, it will be frustrating, but all the more reason to take it with Philips!"
