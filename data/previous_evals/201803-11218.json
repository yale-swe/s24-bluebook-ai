   "comments": [
    "This course provided me with a massive base of knowledge of literary criticism. Every single class was packed with both incredible readings, and even better discussion with the rest of my classmates. I really appreciated the structure of the course pairing a piece of literature with a piece of theory every week. That structure allowed me to read the fiction and understand it for myself, read the theory, and then read the fiction again with the theory in mind. This class really allowed me to start asking questions of my own discipline and how I think about the theoretical nature of architecture.",
    "An understanding, and some more questions, about the ways in which theory is reading and approaching literature. Reading in those materials made me introspect and think about the ways in which in my work I approach literary texts with theory, and I learned - I hope - how to read with greater sensitivity, how to write about theoretical questions - in which I am mostly interested - while not subordinating a text to them, but letting the text actually interact and interfere with the theoretical discussion in fruitful ways. In other words, it was an intense reflection about one of the biggest challenges of our work and I feel it helped me develop my own thoughts about it and to search for my way to face it (and also to pay heed and evaluate other theoretical attempts with regard to their work with texts).",
    "The course focused on theoretic texts derived from different kinds of readings of literary texts. Besides tracing the particularities of each of the theories and their connection to the specific literary text, the course addressed in a more broader sense the question of the role of theory and the different praxises of reading we can pursue in our own research.",
    "Thought deeply about reading as a theoretical practice, and how it is related to other theoretical questions of identity, difference, and literature."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The structure of the course was the best strength. The pairing of a piece of fiction with a piece of theory really allowed me to engage with the course and understand both readings better.",
    "As said, the topic was relevant and enabled a combination of learning and reading closely the materials given - major works in literary theory that were mostly new to me - together with the useful possibility of reflection and thinking about how to do this sort of reading by myself. The group of students was great - everyone was involved in the conversation and there was positive tension in class. The professor is wonderful. A point for improvement - I think if the reading was a bit shorter in some of the weeks, that would have enabled more devoted reading.",
    "The selection of the texts was interesting and the fact the amount of reading was not too high enabled a more focused preparation and an intense discussion of the texts in class, which often involved close reading of specific parts. The opening remarks of the professor who tied each session to the previous ones helped a lot to establish the wider connection of the course and to launch the discussion."

    "I very much would recommend this course to any student looking to gain a strong base of knowledge about literature and theory.",
    "Definitely. The course was really great, interesting and thought-provoking, and the subject was from the essence of what we do when writing about literature. The discussions were deep and lively, the texts were important and interesting and the professor is great."
