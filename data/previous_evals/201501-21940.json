   "comments": [
    "Yes, it is a lot of reading, and if you don't like Jane Austen, then you shouldn't take this class. Even if you haven't read anything besides Pride and Prejudice, like myself, this is a great class. The workload isn't too awful, and the reading is enjoyable. You read about a volume every class meeting, which isn't too bad on Mondays but is a pain on Wednesdays.",
    "I would recommend the class to another student who is interested in Jane Austen or the writing of the time period. Having only two papers was nice. Lots of reading, but lots of fun.",
    "I would recommend this to anyone interested in reading all of Austen, but I would warn against taking this with a heavy course load or any other English class as the work load is a lot.",
    "ENGL 010 is an in-depth analysis of Jane Austen's work, including he lesser known juvenile works and unfinished novels. I would very much recommend it if you are interested in Jane Austen -- it was the first class I ever knew I wanted to take at Yale and I do not regret it at all. The reading can be a bit heavy between Monday and Wednesday as we read a volume for each class usually, but with appropriate planning it is manageable. Professor Markovits makes every class interesting and despite the fact that it is an hour and 15 minute long class, she makes sure the conversation never dies down with prompts to help us see the next level.",
    "Good class if you think you'll like Jane Austen. Not so good probably if you don't.",
    "I would definitely recommend it to students who are committed to doing a lot of reading, and eager to get a rich introduction to Austen's work.",
    "Jane Austen is an interesting English freshman seminar. It is very focused, so make sure you like reading Jane Austen, but if you do, it's a great class.",
    "Engl 010 is a look at all of the work written by Jane Austen. I would recommend this class to anyone who enjoys the Austen novels because Professor Markovits does such a great job of teaching them. However,If you haven't read any Austen before I would definitely read a little before taking the class to make sure her style of writing appeals to you because it can definitely get tiresome after reading six novels.",
    "A wonderful intro to Austen. Even for the most die-hard of Austen fans, this class will push you to reconsider the motivations that inspired the famous authoress and her continued impact on culture today. The course incorporates everything from her novels, letters, and juvenilia to critical essays analyzing her works and even a few hilarious Austen spin-offs. Class discussions are intriguing, assignments thought-provoking and not too demanding, and the professor fantastic.",
    "I would recommend the Jane Austen freshman seminar to all die-hard Austen fans, but also those who wish to explore Austen's texts for the first time. You will be able to keep up and succeed in this class regardless of your previous exposure to Austen. The seminar was thought-provoking, challenging (but manageable) and engaging all at once. A great way to improve your writing skills (although there are only 2 major papers) through analyzing incredible novels."
