   "comments": [
    "Nope. Too much work. Do not do it to yourself. You will regret it or else do the work as fast as possible and not end up learning anything. Either way, use your language credit on another department or sadly you will eventually regret your choice.",
    "I would definitely recommend it. The class really improved my French grammar, reading, comprehension, and especially speaking skills! It was a very enjoyable class that I always looked forward to.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student wishing to gain greater knowledge of how to convey more complex ideas in French. The course allows for thorough review of more complex ideas and structures so students can not only learn of them, but learn how to use them.",
    "Take if you like French!",
    "I would definitely recommend!!",
    "Challenging but good French course. Pretty steady, nightly workload. Should know basic grammar structures and rules well before taking this, because they're not really reviewed at all and grammar moves quite quickly. In addition to language, Prof Bedoui also covers a fair amount of French history, culture, literature, and philosophy, which added tremendously to the courses. Prof Bedoui is incredibly helpful and supportive, if you have any difficulties, I strongly recommend meeting with her outside of class.",
    "The small class size is definitely a plus as I really got to improve my oral skills which were subpar compared to my written skills. There were some people who were stronger in writing while others were stronger in speaking, so I didn't ever feel too behind. It's a great class, and not too much work as long as you keep up!"
