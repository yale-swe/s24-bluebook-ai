    "I would recommend this class to another student. You get to learn cool basic concepts about film and it will really change the way you go to the movies! If you're down to watch three hours of film every Tuesday this could be the class for you.",
    "Do not take Film 150 unless you really like film. It is simply not as good a class as it should have been. Professor MacKay is enthusiastic, but his lectures are too incoherent to learn much. The readings for the class are terrible. The textbook is overly simplistic while the additional assigned critical readings are generally too esoteric. The one redeeming feature of the class is the weekly screening component often in 35mm (although a few of the choices are questionable.",
    "This is a fun course with a pretty light workload. You get to watch movies and think about how these films came into being and what they are trying to say. If you have any interest in movies or in the world around you, I would recommend taking this class.",
    "Yes, I would recommend FILM 150 to another student; overall it was a great intro course. In terms of the course's strengths: good survey of a number of different films, film techniques, and film history. I also very much enjoyed the readings on film theory and liked how accessible everything was for non-film buffs\/majors. Professor MacKay is a very engaging lecturer with a dynamic lecturing style. I enjoyed attending lecture and listening to the film introductions prior to each screening. In terms of the course's weaknesses: as much as I liked watching so many different films I also felt like some of the screenings were a little too long (sometimes we watched two, 1.5 hour+ films which cumulatively was quite a lot). So just be warned, FILM 150 is definitely a time commitment but well worth it for those remotely interested in film",
    "Eh...I wasn't the biggest fan of this class. Maybe I'm not cultured enough or something, but I didn't like how many silent\/black and white\/experimental\/non-narrative films there were. I also didn't think I ever really learned anything in lecture. Professor MacKay is a pretty engaging lecturer, but every class he seemed to be making an argument about the things we were learning that week rather than teaching the basics. (Had to read about basics from the textbook.) So my notes are pretty everywhere. There was one day for documentary that he put up actual points on the board to discuss types of documentaries, and that was the only time I remember thinking, \"I absolutely need to write this down.\" That said, I did see some good films and ended up feeling happy about the final.",
    "If you care about the arts, take this course. It's a wonderful survey of the field of film studies, dealing with the abstract ideas of film theory in a way that is easy to understand. It's wonderful.",
    "Not as interesting of a class as it should be",
    "I would never recommend it, especially if the student enjoyed film. It ruined film for me.",
    "A bit academic, but it forces you to watch important films in film history. you also get a basic sense of cinematography\/production etc.",
    "YES! TAKE THIS CLASS! YOU WILL NEVER WATCH MOVIES THE SAME WAY AGAIN! (Do not take this class if you don't want to show up to screening though. The films are generally beautiful, but don't expect to be watching contemporary Hollywood cinema). The final is extraordinarily fair and the two essays can be written about virtually any topic so long as it relates to the screened films.",
    "Yep, i would definately recommend if you have any interest in film. Even if you might not be entertained by all the screenings, (and some were downright painful, i.e. Killer of Sheep), you could almost always reflect on each screening, and find them full of interesting ideas to think about.",
    "A pretty relaxed introduction to looking at film in a more critical, analytic way to better understand how the director wanted the film to be received. I would recommend this course to another student who is inclined to analyze the arts in historical, social, and cultural lenses. It was an interesting course that I think those who enjoy film would greatly benefit from.",
    "This course is somewhat time-consuming but ultimately worth it. It totally changed the way I watch movies, and considering I'll probably be watching movies for the rest of my life, it certainly was worth spending 3 months learning about. Watching films can be time-consuming, especially because they generally aren't the most engaging movies: the weekly time commitment is a 3 hr screening, two 50-minute lectures, and a 50 minute section (5.5 hrs total). But beyond that, you just have to do a couple readings a week and then write 3 papers (which are quite open ended and not at all unpleasant to write). Overall, I'd certainly recommend this to anyone looking for a good Writing credit, or who just want to be able to go to the movies with a keener eye.",
    "I definitely recommend FILM 150--first and foremost, because it's a prerequisite for any other film course you might want to take, but also because it's so much fun. The screenings are a blast and I, for one, really enjoyed the film theory stuff--that might not be everyone's cup of tea. It is a lot of theory, though, so buyer be warned.",
    "Intro to Film is a great course, but it takes up a lot of time. You will have not only lecture and section, but also screenings every Tuesday night. They will often be three hours, maybe longer. You will have textbook readings as well as articles\/papers by people in the film community. You will have to post responses to these readings in ClassesV2 every week. There is both a final paper and a final exam. There is one writing assignment and one essay within the semester as well. While the first half of the course will teach you about the different elements that must be considered in the film, the second half is often just Professor MacKay asking and answering his own questions about film and film theory. But at the same time you'll learn a lot about how to really look at a film, and get to watch lots of old films and some new-ish ones. So it really depends on what you're willing to do.",
    "It's really great. Take it if you're interested even a little bit in film. If anything, you'll be more cultured. The instructors are super, and the class is fun and low key. Would recommend.",
    "Fun class even though there's too much avant garde stuff. Take it anyway because it's great.",
    "Good intro class. Not too much work and the essays are fun to write. Definitely helps in understanding movies better",
    "You get to watch some great films and some not so great films. The essays actually weren't too bad and the material is not too hard.",
    "Take the class! It's a great way to understand film better, and the course is definitely accessible to everyone and anyone. It has been one of my favorite classes at Yale-- professor MacKay was fantastic and the TF's are great and very helpful.",
    "This is a great class without a ton of work, great for anyone interested in learning more about film or film theory. Definitely recommended.",
    "This is not a class about making film. It's a class about watching film and learning about the history of film. I would recommend it to a fellow student as long as they enjoy analyzing film. If they are more interested in actually creating film then watching it, I would not recommend it.",
    "FILM 150 with Professor MacKay is essential to any student who is interested in becoming more film literate. This class will help you gain understanding and appreciation of films beyond just their plot, and will certainly help you appreciate avant-garde films. Professor MacKay teaches with passion and clarity and knows how to instill that same passion in his students. I can't recommend this class enough.",
    "Take this class if you're willing to put in the time. The workload is certainly doable, but definitely consider time commitment (the two hours that the syllabus states as the time allotted for screenings proved to be an underestimate on a weekly basis).",
    "Film 150 is a comprehensive introduction to film studies, with a focus on analysis and close viewing. Weekly screenings reinforce concepts discussed in lecture. I would absolutely recommend this class to anyone with any level of interest in film.",
    "If you want to actually learn how to do film analysis take a more refined class. MacKay will teach you how to love film, but won't teach you enough about its mechanics.",
    "I would say FILM 150 01 is a WR class that surveys film class, film theory, and a bit of film production in a chronological order from beginning to present. I would recommend it to another student because it is an interesting class that teaches a lot. It helped me develop my understanding and thought process to accommodate a medium that greatly impacts how modern society perceives the world and itself."
