   "comments": [
    "Learn about writing different genres of nonfiction. I would recommend it if the student is interested in the subject or needs a writing credit.",
    "The plethora of positive responses to this class does not lie: English 120 is English teaching at its best. Gone are the days of random markings of \"awk\" on your drafts and grades that seem to be pulled out of a hat. The class is less concerned with things as subjective as style (although the class readings give you plenty to try out!) and instead focuses on information management - intermediate elements of a good story and a well-crafted essay like focus and conflict. Professor Graham is a master of constructive criticism and unique perspectives that can cut right through writer's block. Just make sure that if you're not entirely comfortable with writing and want to get something out of it that you schedule the rest of your courses expecting to be doing a lot of work. As a math\/science person, I had severe reservations about any sort of English class, and in the beginning I was spending tons of time to produce satisfactory work, but it always felt worth it, which is the best you could ask for in a class. And it definitely gets easier later on. Highly recommended for a meaningful writing credit.",
    "This class was a great survey of various styles of nonfiction writing. I learned a lot about how to improve my own writing, as well as how to be a better reader of others' writing, and would highly recommend taking this class. It was a great, broad writing credit, and would serve someone in any discipline well.",
    "Every student should take this course. Essential.",
    "You write 6 personal essays on a variety of topics. Challenging to write so much about yourself, but also very eye-opening.",
    "Definitely take it - especially if you are scared of\/don't enjoy writing",
    "Overall, this course wasn't as overwhelmingly helpful to your writing as everyone might (I'm sure I don't share your exact experience) rabidly encourage you to believe. It does help though, obviously, being a Yale class taught by assuredly competent instructors who want to improve your writing. But if you've never thought, alas, my writing could definitely transform with some specific, analytical techniques I have never intuited or honed into being with repetition, then maybe this class will \"only\" serve as the extremely enjoyable (this is not a lie) light-but-not-trivial fifth\/sixth class, as opposed to the devastatingly enlightening writing overhaul no one should be expecting.",
    "Better than English 114, but still a pretty big time commitment. Glad I took the class but be prepared to work.",
    "Everyone should take this class, especially with professor Graham. It is a fun class that everybody seems to enjoy. You learn a lot. Professor Graham is amazing. This class is probably one of the best at Yale,."
