    "As someone who had no economics background before coming into this class, a lot! About different kinds of markets, basic supply and demand, externalities, efficiency vs. equity, etc. Although it was an intro class and probably much simplified, it feels nice afterwards knowing at least some of the basic concepts and terms behind microeconomics.",
    "I learned intro microeconomics and lots of supply and demand.",
    "I learned useful skills pertaining to Microeconomics.",

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I think the course was very well taught with all of the opportunities to learn through the book and section and lecture. I wish that it wasn't necessary to attend class through the catalytics. I think having all of the resources on Canvas really helped too. I do wish there were more opportunities to meet with my TA and peer tutors.",
    "The strength of this course is the amount of resources available. Weaknesses are that if you are not interested in the subject and do not make an active effort to keep up, you can easily fall behind.",
    "I think this course teaches a lot of good fundamental ideas important for every student to understand.",
    "The course was well structured and the order of the topics made sense. The lectures were engaging, particularly the student participation through Learning Catalytics. The problem sets were generally set at a good level and they were helpful to understanding the content, as were the sections.",
    "Get rid of in-class participation. It's hindering to students.",
    "There aren't too many assignments or deadlines, which can make it easy for students to fall behind on learning the content.",
    "I thought that the lectures were very easy to understand and that the problem sets were do-able but the test questions were on things we had never seen before and tested on material that we had never really been presented. They asked us to apply things that we learned to an extent that intro students really don't understand. The means of both tests were around 50-60% and I really don't think that is necessary to assess if students have a grasp on the material. I really enjoyed learning the material in class, but it was hard enough to turn me off from taking further econ classes.",
    "Though the logistics of such a large course are bound to be difficult, ECON 115 does not work as a class the way it is currently set up. For example, this is the type of class that should be a 50 minute lecture as opposed to a 75-minute lecture, even if it would mean having to add a third class meeting per week. Of every student I have talked to who has took ECON 115, none of them have been able to follow the lecture the full way through, because it is jam-packed with material. Learning Catalytics was a great choice for this course. There needs to be *far* more student participation in lecture through technology, more working through of problems rather than discussing them in the abstract.",
    "Please grade the Problem Sets better. It is ridiculous how simply messing up an intercept on a graph automatically drops your grade 20%",
    "Some strengths include Professor Udry, and the teaching fellows, but I think one way that the class was weak was in the lack of guidance for the actual exam. The midterms and exams were all extremely challenging and sometimes, I felt as if many of the questions had not been taught well enough in section.",
    "Strengths: This course was taught by a passionate lecturer. Sections were on topic and helpful. There was a lot of support. Weaknesses: Oftentimes the test material was completely new to me.",
    "Lecture did a good job of re-emphasizing important points and reviewing confusing material, though it was occasionally dry and repetitive. I liked that the inadequacies of the economic models were acknowledged.",
    "Hope there are more review sessions before the final exam.",
    "The lecture was always very informative and thorough. However, I felt that more time was devoted to things that were more or less intuitive and less time to the proofs and theories tested in the exams. The feedback for problem sets was incredibly frustrating because there would be one mark next to a question but 20 percentage points or more would be deducted.",
    "I thought the course was well taught and I really appreciated the fact that Udry put lecture notes up after every class.",
    "Lectures move too fast and are too conceptual. I think this class would be best taught in sections ( I know it's offered as one but the curves are supposed to be harder). I learned most in the once per week sections with Eoin.",
    "My TA was amazing, so section helped me so much. I know this was not the case for everyone, though, so perhaps making sure all of the TAs are engaging and understandable.",
    "I don't think lecture is a great way to learn the course if you are truly interested in economics. There's low student engagement, although the professor is clearly talented as both a lecturer and the course isn't that boring. The material could be made more compelling (in the way it's presented) and the grading scheme for homework could be made more clear. There seems to be a fixation on neoliberal economics. Typical, I suppose, of university economics departments, but it would be nice if heterodox economics were even mentioned or alluded.",
    "Ta's cover stuff from the previous week, not the same week.",
    "This is one of the best run courses I have ever taken. There is almost nothing I would change about it. The lectures are very informative and easy to follow. The pacing is just right. However, I think the homework problems should be graded on a scale larger than 5 points, even if they are still worth the same percentage of the total grade for the course. Small mistakes cost far too large a percentage of points on individual homework assignments, and a scale that goes up to 100, for example, would allow for more nuanced scoring.",
    "Problem sets were graded unfairly -- too much work for too little payoff. Learning catalytics was definitely a strength. Fun to do, interesting to see results, reason to show up to lecture every day.",
    "The lectures drag on and are not particularly engaging. There could be more review sessions by the TA's - and the TA's should actually speak english. Eoin was excellent.",
    "Strengths: Professor Udry is a very cool lecturer and explains things well. Some very good, dedicated TAs, such as the head TA Eoin. Weaknesses: TA quality differed a lot. The connection between problem sets and what we learn in lecture is often tenuous, or information in the problem sets will be learned in the lecture following the due date of the problem set.",
    "This course is great. I think one thing that could be improved would be to have more practice problems with the material we are going over.",
    "Great textbook, lectures and teaching staff. The slides can be dry at times, so more examples and a few fewer graphs would be appreciated.",
    "This course's lectures are extremely dry, and the content feels so inaccessible and simplified that we are not learning about anything real. It could be improved if actual calculus concepts were used to teach students, rather than oversimplified assumptions about linearity.",
    "Truly an unhelpful series of lectures that were repetitve, difficult to follow, and had were unhelpful in learning how to do econ problems.",
    "Econ is kind of dry but Udry and Mcguirk care a lot and were great!",
    "The lecture was sometimes too long and the material covered would get glossed over.",
    "Strength: good lectures, real-world connections, helpful TA explanations Weaknesses: none to speak of for an introductory course",
    "Strengths: textbook is helpful, some TF's are knowledgeable and engaging, slides posted online, homework and tests returned in a timely manner. Weaknesses: lectures were not particularly engaging, major variation between TF's in terms of quality, topics often presented in an overly confusing way. It could be improved by standardizing the quality of section, having more engaging lectures, and more specific materials to prepare for the final.",
    "A strength of this course is definitely Professor Udry. He is super funny and engaging and puts things in a very digestible way. He gives good study tips and I always found myself coming to lecture cuz they were so helpful",
    "This was a good course, but sometimes I wish that lectures lined up with p-sets more in terms of content and focus.",
    "Prof. Udry is an engaging and knowledgeable lecturer, and the course is designed so that students come away with a good foundation for other economics courses. The course covers a lot of content in-depth, so sometimes it would be hard to keep up during lecture. In addition, it's taught without calculus, so some parts were confusing and involved some memorization.",
    "This class could be improved if the lectures were louder and you could hear them from farther back in the room. This was a decent overview of microeconomics but not super engaging because of the lack of applications of the concepts and the surface-level understanding of concepts we were taught. Also, if more problems were actually done in class we would have a better understanding of problems for the psets and exams.",
    "Lectures had nothing to do with Psets\/exams.",
    "This course moves very quickly, and it is hard to keep up if you do not have an economics or STEM background.",
    "Awesome Professor and TFs. Slides were helpful, homeworks fair, section being relevant to homework was great, having past materials online super useful.",
    "I believe that the course could be taught at a slower pace and that practice with problems should be incorporated into the actual lectures more.",
    "Weaknesses: very hard",
    "For the most part, the lecture + section format worked really well. The lectures were very clear, and section helped consolidate and solidify what we had learned in class. Occasionally lecture would move a little too quickly over complicated concepts, and section didn't really fill in the gaps (section tended to focus on simpler stuff instead of more complicated ideas, which is great for building a foundation but at the same time the complex stuff is what we needed more review of). That didn't happen very much though (mostly with marginal social benefit stuff), and for the most part the rest of the class was as understandable and engaging as you can reasonably expect an intro econ class to be.",
    "I do not like the setup of the tests, where they rely on a curve. If half of the class is getting around 50% of the material correct, there is either a problem with how the class is taught or a problem with the tests themselves. Furthermore, tests and P-sets gave NO FEEDBACK WHATSOEVER beyond a marking denoting what responses were incorrect, and even that was difficult to discern at times. Correct responses are posted online, but poor markings leave many errors ambiguous. Asking my TA did not prove to help clear much up either.",
    "This was an excellent class. It was very accessible and felt quite personal for a lecture. The learning catalytics implementation helped to increase engagement during class time. Section helped to reinforce these skills in a more personal environment. I can't think of any obvious ways to improve this class.",
    "I found that the section I was assigned to was less than helpful, although I continued to attend throughout the semester. My TF almost never worked through difficult problems during section and did not leave time for questions, making it an unproductive usage of time for me. I also often had a difficult time following the powerpoint slides during lecture when the professor would flip back and forth between different visuals (i.e. graphs) very quickly without pausing to let the class absorb the significance of each line and intersection.",
    "Lectures are too long and a bit dry and so most of my learning of the material occurred while studying for the test",
    "Very well structured course! The TA's are very helpful and Prof. Udry is extremely knowledgable about his subject!",
    "This class should be taught in a classroom setting not lecture. The material covered in each class is quite a bit and would be easier to absorb if done in a more intimate setting where people felt they could ask more questions during the presentations. Second of all, the tests were written too long. Most students told me they never finished the midterms or final exams because they didn't have enough time. This is a big problem. Although Econ may be intuitive to people already familiar with JT, it is not I tuitive to most and requires time to think through each problem. The subject matter of the course was very interesting and applicable.",
    "It could be improved by taking away learning catalytics.",
    "Udry is an amazing lecturer and the class is interesting but the tests and psets are hard and I found the math applications difficult",
    "I would've liked more engagement with the optional research papers associated with each topic, perhaps more mention of it in class, as I think was originally intended. I think it would've been interesting and rewarding to see at least how the fundamentals we were learning could be expanded into those kinds of research. I also would've liked perhaps an optional calculus supplement to some of the textbook readings, for people who have the background. Otherwise, I thought the course was a good introduction to microeconomics well-paced and not too difficult or too easy.",
    "Lectures were good so that the material wasn't too challenging, so were p sets. Sometimes hard to understand how they were grading p sets but if you looked online it was more clear.",
    "I thought that sections were incredibly helpful. The only weakness was that because it was such a big class it had to move somewhat slowly and lectures were huge. It would have benefited from being somewhat smaller.",
    "The strength of this course was the amount of resources provided for us. We had access to past tests, p-sets, and multiple TA's with office hours nearly every day of the week. The weakness of this course were the lectures as the slides would often be repetitive. Also, it was just difficult to get engaged with such abstract material.",
    "Big lecture is easy to skip, but Udry is pretty engaging. He also checks for participation with Learning Catalytics",
    "Better and more engaging lectures",
    "N\/A",
    "The course covered interesting material at a good pace. I think if lectures encorporated more lively, interactive moments (more than just asking the students questions or polling the students), like the ones in the game theory lecture, it would be more engaging.",
    "Srrength: great TAs and cool examples Weaknesses: too big, too slide-based",
    "The weakness lies mainly in lecture, as it wasn't engaging. Problem sets are also far harder than the should be.",
    "Sometimes the lectures were a bit hard to follow. Sometimes we would spend a really long time proving a specific idea or doing a problem, but I would be totally lost because it wasn't prefaced with enough information. Or, we would learn certain ideas or skills in lecture, and they wouldn't correspond to the problem sets for the week, which was frustrating. To improve, I would suggest making sure that the topics presented in lecture correlated exactly to the topics on the problem sets, the midterms, and final. I spent time studying topics that I felt were important in lecture, but didn't show up on the final, and vice versa. I would also suggest that during lecture, it would be great to establish a topic through words before moving onto graphs or numerical representations.",
    "The powerpoint slides are really badly designed-- unclear, etc. I found my section much more helpful than lecture (I had Eoin-- he was AMAZING) because the explanations were much clearer and visually-oriented.",
    "The material covered in this course is helpful and important but I would have liked to see more direct student engagement. Using Learning Catalytics during lecture was helpful - it kept everyone engaged and focused. I also thought the lectures were most effective when they used a lot of real-life examples to illustrate concepts.",
    "I think the course was outstanding!! Some of the problem sets, however, were a little ahead of the material covered in class. In other words, our progress in class lagged behind the problem set questions just a little bit.",
    "The course is great and the Professor is exceptional, but can be ruined if you get a bad TF.",
    "This course is easy to become disengaged in because of the size of the lecture course, but there is a lot of material. Understanding and success in the class does require time and effort.",
    "Lecture was very dry. A large part of the problem was the fact that it was hard to hear professor Udry. Also the slides were super difficult to review - a lot of times variables would be introduced without them being defined or talked about first eg. E(U(x)) - expected utility of x - or the cap and trade slides were never really explained in class or in the slides. I found I had to supplement a lot of the material with instructional YouTube videos. Lastly I found it was relatively onerous to contact the TAs. Rponse time wasn't great but when I reached them they were very helpful. Also the canvas files stopped being updated for me after Class_20 was uploaded. That was pretty frustrating. Udry is a very caring and helpful professor. He always was available to patiently explain materials after class to me.",
    "the lecture was extremely boring and very difficult to follow",
    "It's pretty easy to follow and covers everything I really wanted to know about econ.",
    "Weaknesses: the study material from previous exams hardly helped on the actual exams. Also I felt as though the TA session was not very useful.",
    "Lots of resources and lots of people to study with.",
    "Strengths: The problem sets help you learn the material, and the TA's are pretty available to help you with the problem sets. I liked Professor Udry's stories about Ghana. They added personality to the course. Weaknesses: What is taught in lecture varies drastically from what you are expected to know when solving the PSet problems. It might help to do a few example problems during lecture. It was often difficult to try to apply the lecture to the PSets. The majority of people do so badly on some of the midterms that they are drastically curved. Maybe, instead of having the huge curve, the tests should be a little bit more geared towards what we have learned. Then people will do better on the exams.",
    "The lecturer was great at explaining each subject to the class. Learning catalytics was a good way to keep the class engaged and helped reinforce learning material.",
    "Good overall, but would be better if more practical examples were given. Seemed very theoretical.",
    "This course was very interesting, but it was a large time commitment. I spent a lot of time outside of lecture trying to insure the material had solidified by attending both section and extra tutoring sessions. However, this course was worth the time commitment as it was incredibly useful material."

    "If you're interested in business, take this.",
    "I would because it is a comprehensive course based in both the social sciences and mathematics, which exercises multiple parts of the brain.",
    "I would recommend this to a student because I really enjoyed the course material but suggest that they credit\/D it for the sake of their GPA.",
    "In its current format, no. The content is not too difficult and the curve is generous, but it was a chore to go to this lecture and try to be engaged. It has nothing to do with Professor Udry's style of lecturing, just the length. Being told about math for 75 minutes without really being asked to follow along or do a practice problem is just not a good time.",
    "Yes! It was a great class. Had no experience with ECON before, came out learning a lot, Was a very intuitive and relatively easy class if you are even moderately engaged",
    "If they are interested in economics, yes, but if not, I would not recommend this course. Not a good use of your time unless you absolutely need it.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student, but only in the spring. I have heard that the fall semester is pretty competitive, so if you are not pursuing econ, or just trying to get a social science credit that you can use in real life, (my case), take this course in the spring with other people in the same boat. Not an incredible amount of work, but studying for the tests can be time consuming.",
    "I would recommend this to anyone who is interested in economics or who wants to take a QR credit that isn't too difficult.",
    "good learning experience!",
    "No, I would recommend that a student take the seminar version of introductory microeconomics if possible. Learning a nuanced subject in a lecture setting can be challenging if not enough time is devoted to mastering the material outside of class.",
    "If you are interested in a course that is not too much work and teaches you the basics of microeconomics I recommend this course. It really doesn't require much time outside of class and the lectures are engaging.",
    "I find the subject matter of this class very interesting, but the class itself was not the most interesting. Would definitely recommend if you are at all interested in economics, because it gives you a basic understanding of the field (at least micro) and could help you decide if you have a potential future in it.",
    "This is a fine course. You likely don't have much in the way of options, as it is a prereq for a number of social sciences. Take it either as lecture or seminar, but I think seminar is generally better for learning.",
    "Yep",
    "Yes.",
    "Sure. Econ is cool. Have to do it for the major (although if you can place out with AP scores, I don't see why you wouldn't).",
    "No - don't take it unless it is a prerequisite for your major.",
    "Would recommend to most students, as economics is a different mode of thinking that can change your everyday life if you want it too. It's not exceptionally hard, either.",
    "Totally! This class teaches you knowledge that pretty much every competent member of our society should have a basic understanding of.",
    "Take the course. The curve is generous and the material is relevant. A must take for all majors.",
    "Take it if you have to take a QR, but you will hate every minute. Lectures are three hours of boring a week, p sets are 2 hours of terror -- why should you have to go to an extra hour of section to actually learn things in this class?",
    "Yes. I took it just to see what the hype with Econ at Yale was about. I hadn't never taken Econ before in my life. It's basically just logical things theorized or written down into concepts. Now I'm considering adding it to my major.",
    "Maybe if you want to learn the basis of economic thinking. it's not the most fun course but it's a solid QR credit that will introduce you into new kinds of htinking",
    "This course should be required for people interested in the social sciences. Other than that, skip it.",
    "If you want to understand the basics of economics, or are thinking about majoring in the field, take this course.",
    "I would recommend this course to a student looking to fulfill a QR credit and look to fulfill an econ credit for their major. It is not a particularly difficult class, but at times, it can be hard to engage and TF's can be difficult to understand.",
    "Yes, I feel like intro micro is a class that all Yale students graduate having taken and I really loved taking it with Professor Udry. I definitely learned a lot.",
    "Yes, I'd recommend this course - it's challenging if you haven't taken economics before, but it's a good class.",
    "This course is required for other econ courses, so it's probably a good idea to take it if you anticipate taking other econ courses in the future. The workload and the difficulty is manageable, although if the Psets and midterms are hard, it's really important to get help from peer tutors and TFs. Overall, I'd recommend it for social science majors who need a QR.",
    "I took this class because I wanted to explore the subject of economics, which I had never taken in high school. Take it if you very purposefully want to learn if you like economics\/get an introduction. However, don't take it just for a QR or SO requirement -- it is not a well-taught class, and not very easy either.",
    "No, I would not recommend this course. It was highly unorganized, and the professor and TA's have very little involvement with the students. Unless you are STEM, this class will be fairly challenging.",
    "Definitely not. The course was nonsensical. It tried to cover so much that I understood a single topic fully throughout the semester.",
    "To learn the fundamentals of economics, it is necessary.",
    "Yes, especially with Udry if you can. Useful stuff to know to engage, even surface level, with econ arguments so important in our world today.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this class because while it was challenging, it was not unreasonably demanding. It also covers the basics of economics pretty well.",
    "No don't do it",
    "Yes; if you're looking to fulfill a QR or econ requirement it is definitely not as painful as you would think. A lot of the concepts are actually pretty interesting, and Udry kept class pretty engaging and understandable (also his shirts were a highlight of every lecture). Overall it's not going to be the best class you've taken at Yale, but definitely not the worst.",
    "Only if you need it for your major or field of study.",
    "I would recommend it as a way to learn economics for context and for interest.",
    "Yes, I think everyone should take an introduction to economics at some point, if only to learn fundamental skills about how the world works.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student, because even though I disliked the organization of the course overall, I feel that the information presented is an essential part of an informed understanding of the modern world. I also feel that the amount of information and the course's level of difficulty was appropriate for an introductory level course. In addition, there are many resources available to students outside of lecture and section if they chose to pursue them.",
    "Yes -- valuable information!",
    "Definitely! This is a must-take course for anyone at Yale! :)",
    "yes the professor is great but be prepared to study a lot on your own in order to do okay on the exams.",
    "I would recommend this course to any Yale student who either has some interest in economics or is just trying to find their passion.",
    "Yes because it's a valuable course with a great Rachel, but they should go in knowing it will be difficult",
    "Yes, I'd recommend this course. For someone who might not have an interest in economics, the material may seem a bit dry at times, but it definitely seems like useful background to have for anyone interested in public policy of any kind. The workload is reasonable, 1 problem set a week, 2 midterms, and a final, and there are a lot of practice problems and additional resources provided to help you out!",
    "Interesting class, Urdy was a great professor, the TA is important",
    "Yes, definitely. Chris is a fantastic professor and a good guy. I really enjoyed taking his class.",
    "I would not recommend this course to someone who feels like they need to take economics because of other students or other external influences. If they do, it will probably be a very boring class. I would recommend it to those who have had some experience in economics and are eager to learn more.",
    "Take it if you want to be financially literate and understand the world economy better. It really does help, and it's not a bad class. Udry does a great job.",
    "Yes",
    "Yes, because I believe basic knowledge of microeconomics is very important.",
    "A necessary intro econ course",
    "I only would if they were actually interested in economics. Otherwise, it's not the greatest idea.",
    "I would not recommend this course to another student who, like me, had no knowledge of economics before the course. It seemed like many of the topics learned were too difficult for someone who hadn't take economics before to be able to catch up with another student who had.",
    "This course material is incredibly easy-- just terribly taught; however, the material is actually really important for a basic understanding of economics. My TF saved me by explaining things in a way that was incredibly easy-to-understand; my advice is to find a great TF, ignore the textbook, and GO TO THE TUTORING SESSIONS.",
    "Yes. It's a great way to be introduced to economics.",
    "I would recommend this course to someone interested in economics, specifically if they were interested in advanced study in economics. I do think it's important for students to have some experience with and understanding of economics. However, it's not the most engaging course for someone who's not originally interested in the subject matter.",
    "YES!! FANTASTIC COURSE!!",
    "I would recommend it on the basis that it is a necessary stepping stone for any kind of foray into economics and also provides a basic understanding that can bolster ones engagement in a number of other classes on development and global affairs.",
    "I would recommend this course to students who are genuinely interested in economics, and do not just feel the need to take the course. While helpful, this class is not fundamental to a well-rounded education.",
    "Yes! Cool concepts that definitely added to the way I think. Very happy I took it. A lot of materials are supplied to help you succeed.",
    "no",
    "Yes, if you're interested in econ or want a painless way to satisfy your sc requirement.",
    "Yes-good things to know.",
    "As someone who came in wary of econ, I don't regret taking this class. I gained a surface level understanding of how consumers and firms make choices, and the math wasn't hard it felt like fun little puzzles. I wish that I'd gone to office hours more often, though I did fine on the p-sets and felt like I mostly understood the material but felt fairly unprepared for the final.",
    "After finishing this course, I feel like a have a solid foundation in microeconomics.",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone who might be interested in the economy. This is a very basic course with not much work, and if you show up to lecture and pay attention, you will easily be able to do well on the assignments.",
    "If you need to take it, it's not bad. If you take it just because, it's not fun at all-- hard to care about it if it's not required.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. I think that even students who are not particularly interested in economics should take this class."
