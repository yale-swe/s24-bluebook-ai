    "\"Unless you have to for your major (which is what most of the class was there for) I wouldn't recommend this class.\"",
    "Interesting survey of earth processes, but very difficult in terms of workload",
    "I would definitely recommend EVST 201 to another student regardless of your science or math background. You will learn practical climate change knowledge and better be able to understand the world's atmospheres, oceans and environment around you.",
    "EVST 201 is an overview of the atmosphere, the ocean and environmental change, as the title suggests! I would recommend the class to any students wishing to better understand weather phenomena and the world around us that we so often take for granted.",
    "Take it ONLY and ONLY IF you need to - aka environmental studies majors or energy studies students. You will hate it, I promise you.",
    "I would recommend this class to any student but especially to someone in the EVST or G&G majors. I think it provides the basic scientific background that every EVST major and G&G major should know, and I also think it provides a lot of interesting and practical information on various earth systems (eg the atmosphere, the ocean, climactic systems) that are interesting and useful for all students. The only downside of this course is the required lab, which adds no educational value to the course. The course does have 3 midterms, but they aren't too difficult. Also a relatively easy QR or Sc credit.",
    "A great and relevant class. Even though it was at 9:25 three times a week, and even though I had no prior interest in the physical science of atmospheres or oceans, I never fell asleep in this class. Professor Smith delivers clear lectures through which his enthusiasm and expertise shines. He is approachable and caring. He includes information in his lectures about the current issues of climate change, and this class taught me information that I found relevant to my life in the world today. 8 weekly problem sets, 3 midterms, and a low coursework lab can be challenging, but enhances and reinforces understanding of the material.",
    "Take this class and learn about the systems controlling our planet. It is a really comprehensive class in which you learn a lot and become more climate literate. It is not an easy science credit, so don't take it for the credit, take it for your major or your own interest!",
    "This was a great class. The workload was really manageable, PSets every 1-2 weeks, and the material really interesting. Whether or not it's for your major this is a class that everyone should take just so you have a better understanding of the planet, environment, and climate. Having a basic background in chem and physics is helpful but not necessary. Definitely recommend!",
    "Yes, its not a hard class. You use simple concepts from high school chemistry and physics to learn things about how the Earth governs our weather.",
    "My prep for this course was AP Chem five years ago, and no other QR or hard SC at Yale. I survived this class, but it was pretty painful. The psets are challenging, the tests even more so, and the lab period is a time suck. I did learn some cool stuff and get 1.5 credits out of it, but it was a struggle. Studying with classmates and meeting with the professor (who's occasionally helpful) was important, as were the online lectures and old tests posted on Yale Open Courses. If you need it, take it and good luck. If not, I wish I'd done something different.",
    "I would recommend this course to someone with an interest, or at least a curiosity, in atmospheric science. However, it is a survey course that does not use calculus, so it may feel as if the syllabus only skims the surface of some topics; such is the nature of the course. The tests are relatively fair; the problem sets are the only source of practice for quantitative questions, so at times I felt like I was making learning mistakes typically made in practice problems on tests, but not because the material was foreign. The required lab may at times seem like a hassle, but if run well, it complements the course well.",
    "This is a solid class and definitely worth taking. It's not hard but there are a lot of things you'll have to know by the end. Take the tests seriously because you won't have much time to finish them. This is a good science class even if you are not an EVST major. The lab doesn't feel super useful but is also not a huge time commitment and is very little work.",
    "I would take this course if you are required to or if you want to learn the basics of weather and climate.",
    "Decent course, QR heavy at the beginning tho so beware. Gives you a could foundation for the science and quantitative side of environmental studies.",
    "A necessary evil for EVST majors. Pros: -Interesting material on how climate systems operate -Engaging professor who thoroughly explains each equation and why it matters -Light workload (one pset a week, sometimes every other week, and three exams plus a final exam) Cons: -Lack of feedback\/aid if you're struggling with the material -Exams will suck. You will never have enough time to finish every problem thoroughly and you will be disappointed. -Lecture will feel overwhelming if you don't completely understand the first three weeks of material Overall, great course material, but not taught in a way that ensures retention or comprehension. Save your notebook for later when you need to recall how a cloud forms or why El Ninos occur",
    "Class about all the stuff in the environment that gets talked about in daily life that you were too afraid to ask about",
    "This class is great for anyone who will work tangentially with Earth science in any type of policy writing or non-profit. It is well organized and very interesting. There are a lot of problem sets which can be tedious, but very rewarding. The exams are quantitative, but you only have to remember which formulas go to which problems. Then just plug and chug like a real scientist!",
    "If you are even remotely interested in environmental systems and how the weather channel knows what it's talking about and, seriously, why the f is the sky blue, anyways?--take this course. It's really informative and applicable to daily life, and pretty straightforward, if you don't mind a steady workload.",
    "I would recommend the class if you're interested in what it covers but otherwise no, and definitely not if you're just looking for an Sc and Qr that doesn't go too deep into hard math or science.",
    "Take it if you have to or want grounding (LOL) in atmospheric science.",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone who is interested in learning about how earth systems interact. The information is presented in a way that is easy to understand, and the class is generally engaging.",
    "Ron Smith is an excellent teacher.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student so long as they are interested in atmospheric and oceanic sciences. This class does a fantastic job of explaining how the atmosphere and the ocean work. The lectures are all interesting and engaging and I would find myself outside of class trying to explain current weather patterns. The workload is very manageable and, for the most part, the tests are manageable. That said, the tests expect you to really understand the material and be able to explain it quickly and effectively. Professor Smith does a great job of encouraging students to participate and trying to get to know students outside of class if you decide to meet with him. Overall, this was a great class.",
    "It's harder than you think! But not as difficult as many other science courses. The material can also be really cool. The class tends to ignore anything that is not precisely scientific, so don't expect this class to be extremely liberal or focused on the problems of climate change. Climate change takes up about two classes and that's it.",
    "I would recommend this class and definitely recommend watching the Open Course of this class because the professor goes over some pretty dense material pretty fast!",
    "This class was a lot of fun, and though it covers a lot of topics, it goes in-depth enough in each to keep someone with prior knowledge in one of the subjects interested. The tests are partly conceptual and partly quantitative; the quantitative sections definitely give some students trouble, but if you're reasonably good at problem-solving or have some background in math or physics you'll find it easy. I would definitely recommend this class",
    "G&G 140 is a fascinating class and Professor Smith is a great lecturer. Prepare to be challenged, though. It's helpful to have some physics and chemistry going into it - I found it more quantitative than I had expected. I learned a lot, and would recommend it.",
    "This is a decent environmental science class, though it's taught as if it hasn't changed much since the 90s. Don't take it unless its required for EVST or geology, but don't dread the class either! Problem sets are reasonable, and tests are tricky but graded on a curve. You come out with a cool understanding of clouds, storms, rivers, etc, and it is helpful for future environmental studies or politics classes.",
    "Hard. Lots of work. Go to every class. But interesting stuff to learn!",
    "If you want to have a more holistic and descriptive understanding for the natural world around you, EVST 201 offers just that for you."
