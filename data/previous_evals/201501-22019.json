   "comments": [
    "ENGL 218 is a look at all the quirky, crazy, and revolutionary texts that sold off the shelves in the 17th century. It traced patterns through these works and purposefully left Milton out for breaking these patterns. It examined texts that were defining in English literature, even if they're not the most widely read - Pilgrim's Progress, Oroonoko, etc. It provided really cool insight on the crazy world of Restoration England.",
    "Professor Rogers always opened each session with an insightful framing of the course material, which helped to guide subsequent discussion and provided valuable historical and critical context for framing each of the works in consideration. I would definitely recommend this course to English majors and non-English majors alike! (Also, definitely take Rogers's Milton lecture - it's a fabulous course in its own right, and is an invaluable foundation for the 218 curriculum.)",
    "This has been my favorite pre-1800 course in the English major, which I wasnt at all expecting. Professor Rogers is just so much fun. He has a great sense of humor and it's hard not to share his excitement about the readings, which are diverse, strange, obscure and surprisingly accessible. Workload is v manageable. Size of the class is just right. Recommended for a jr. seminar.",
    "A class with a pretty amazing reading list, and a very enthusiastic knowledgeable professor. Take it if you love delving into old poetry, prose, and plays and discussing things down to the level of the word.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS. IT IS FUN. YOU LEARN COOL THINGS. YOU TALK ABOUT LOTS OF FUN STUFF. YOU READ *WOMEN* AUTHORS. YOU READ SCIENCE FICTION. YOU READ PLAYS. YOU READ POLITICAL TREATISES. The scope is just limited to the 17th century England. BUT THIS CLASS IS SO FUN. IT IS SO FUN. AND YOU CAN MAKE IT FUN. ROGERS IS THE BEST.",
    "One of the best classes I've taken at Yale! Rogers is a wonderful section leader: funny, engaging, brilliant and wonderful at leading discussion. I originally shopped this class because of him but ended up loving the bizarre and hilarious material we read! A must take."
