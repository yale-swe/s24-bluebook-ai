    "TAKE IT!",
    "Take it if you're familiar with reading and writing Hindi. Might be tough if you aren't very fluent though.",
    "This course is absolutely fantastic! Professor Khurana is a gem - kind, accommodating, and passionate about her subject - the ideal instructor. The strength of the class, apart from the fabulous Seema Ji, is the curriculum: we read an exhaustive range of literature and watched films that truly summed up pre and post independence India. The best part was the oral partition narrative - an excellent initiative of Seema Ji that reveals the truths of the partition in an unabashed manner, unlike stories in films and books. We were encouraged to engage with each other, and have (and defend) our own opinions.",
    "Definitely recommended, especially if you like discussing recent Indian history or need a language credit",
    "Don't even think about it, just take it!",
    "Great course. Great professor. Had a lot of fun taking this class, and learned a lot.",
    "Definitely a relatively easy class for any native speaker, good way to get the language requirement out of the way. Low workload and class discussions need no preparation."
