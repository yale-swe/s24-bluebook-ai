    "AMST 422 01 is a GREAT class. I loved all of the readings assigned by Professor Blackhawk, and the structure of the class is very relaxed. It is taught in the NACC, so you always have access to coffee and snacks for the 9:25am time slot. Professor Blackhawk is a brilliant man--he will make you think deeply, explore historical texts in a way you've never considered, and expose you to topics you are likely not familiar with. Absolutely recommend this class.",
    "Take it, but only if you know what you want to get out of the class beforehand. There is no real structure in class. We spend the first half of class reading a haphazard list of seemingly unrelated books on Native Americans. Then, the last half of the class is an independent research project. This is by far the coolest part of the class--and if you want to dedicate serious time to investigating a topic in Native American History, then this is the definitely class to do that. Blackhawk is quite knowledgeable and ever-ready to help students in their academic pursuits. But if the research project does not interest you, don't bother taking the class. The reading list is a waste of time and class discussions are uninspiring. Only the end-of-semester essay is worth doing.",
    "I would not recommend this course to another student. It clearly represented an ER&M course and not the history class I was expecting. overall the quality was mediocre and I did not feel I learned as much as I did in other history classes.",
    "I would definitely recommend History 151J because you will learn so much about not only your project but your classmates as well. It is a great opportunity to learn about Indigenous people and the subject of history more broadly.",
    "I would strongly recommend HIST 151J, Writing Tribal Histories to another student. Professor Ned Blackhawk is an extremely knowledgeable and engaging instructor. He goes to great lengths to make the class unique,interesting and informative.",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone who wants to delve deep into a particular topic relating to Native American peoples or culture. This is not a course for learning facts and dates and historical events, but rather, one for exploring personal curiosities through research and writing.",
    "Seminar once a week in which students engage in discussion led by Professor Blackhawk. These discussions are about that week's assigned reading, usually a book about an event, institution, etc. central to or illustrative of broad themes in recent American Indian history. I would recommend this class to students interested in Native history and issues and also to students who want to learn more about the Native experience. Although it is not a broad overview of American Indian History and perhaps tougher than the intro class that Professor Blackhawk teaches, it is still reasonable for someone without that knowledge to participate\/engage so long as that person puts the work in."
