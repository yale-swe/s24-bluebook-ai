   "comments": [
    "This course was in my experience great at almost every level. I left it with a stronger grasp of the poets we covered, the period in which the wrote, the history of their reception, their significance to the history of literary criticism, and the philosophical stakes of their writing. All of this was enabled both by the instructor's capacious erudition and by patient close readings of particular poems, which generally provided us with excellent examples of how to read poetry at different levels: stylistic, historical, philosophical, etc.",
    "This course helped me to further think about, and complicate, the term \"romanticism,\" especially in terms of how thinkers were responding to each other and to their time. Even though the course had three separate poets -- Bryon, Shelley, and Keats -- our discussions helped us to see them as constructing and responding to the spirit of their time, and to see their poems in a big-picture framework.",
    "I knew very little about the English Romantic poets coming into this course, and I feel that I have a solid grasp on Byron, Shelley, and Keats now. I feel that I have a good understanding of their intellectual concerns and stylistic signatures, and find myself motivated to go back and read the earlier Romantics."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "No complaints here, except that perhaps I would have liked to have read some secondary literature alongside the poetry.",
    "We might had benefited from a list of suggested critical texts about the authors we studied, or from a list of important works by antecedent or adjacent writers -- and not only poets.",
    "The strength was that there was a focus in each discussion -- Professor Fry was very good about directing our attention to specific concepts and ideas for each week. I also felt that the assigned readings for each week made sense, and although the pace was a little fast, we covered a great deal that was interesting and relevant. It could have been improved if we had more specific secondary sources. I also appreciated Professor Fry's detailed feedback on the written assignments.",
    "On the one hand, I would have appreciated critical readings incorporated into the syllabus (aside from those we consulted for individual presentations\/papers). But on the other hand, I felt that the reading load was intensive some weeks already, and that Professor Fry gave useful summaries of the critical discourse on relevant topics each week. So honestly I'm not sure if the lack of required secondary sources was a detriment or not."

   "comments": [
    "Yes!",
    "I would recommend it strongly, only with the caveat that it sometimes felt more like a lecture course than a discussion-based seminar. This is not a complaint, since I generally felt like the instructors lectures helped elaborate ideas that we wouldn't otherwise have reached in the context of an open discussion.",
    "This course is both good in introducing romanticism as well as getting very much in-depth about specific ideas and concepts for each poet.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course, particularly to someone who already has some knowledge of Wordsworth\/Coleridge\/Blake -- much of what this course engages with seems to respond to these earlier authors, particularly Wordsworth, so it would have been helpful for me to have had more background knowledge on them.",
    "Yes."
