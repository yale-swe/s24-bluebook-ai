   "comments": [
    "Take it if Justin Fox is teaching it.",
    "It's a great political game theory class that helps teach you to think critically and analytically about complex papers and game theoretical models.",
    "this class is really fun. there are 8 two-page reading responses due during the semester and a final five-page paper. the workload is evenly spread throughout the semester, so the class entails very little stress. the readings are interesting and the discussions keep you thinking about the material after class. the game theory is very conceptual - definitely not quantitative. using simple game theory devices the class tackles current institutional problems in a way that most students have never been exposed to before. just a really great class.",
    "This class is really interesting and Prof. Fox is incredibly supportive. This is a must take for any EPE major!",
    "A good class to train you to critically approach academic texts, though I learned less about game theory\/modeling than I expected",
    "I definitely recommend this course.",
    "Professor Fox's teaching style allows students to freely make their points in class, so everyone has a chance to expose their own views. However, it often allows for off-topic discussions, with students expressing their political views and bias. The course quickly lost its game-theoretical approach and became extremely \"political.\" If you want to show off your (often mistaken) knowledge of Democrats and Republicans, you should take this course.",
    "This course is great! Professor Fox is a lot of fun and gives a good number of readings. Discussions can vary but weekly reading responses make sure students do read. The course is not too difficult and Professor Fox grades very fairly.",
    "The way I described this class to people is read (or don\u0092t) a few semi-interesting papers and then sit around and criticize them for two and a half hours. Topics include somewhat interesting things such as: would it be a good idea to elect members of the executive branch separately, what incentives drive political parties to engage in obstructionism and, of course, patriot dollars. The assignments are exceedingly straight-forward. Write eight two-page response papers (they do not actually need to engage with the readings, usually I would pick up on some problem that the reading outlined and think of some policy that would mitigate it) of which you are almost guaranteed to get 4\/4. To the best of my knowledge no one in the class the entire semester ever got anything other than a 4 on any of their papers. Oh boy! The final paper is a, wait for it, six-page \"research paper\"--pretty stress free.The only caveat I would add about this class is that you experience may vary significantly depending on who takes it with you. Much of the discussion is student led so if the people in your class don\u0092t seem particularly bright get ready for a world of hurt, because Justin Fox will never ever ever disagreewith people or tell them that he think that they\u0092re wrong. The worst sort of class though would probably be one that isn\u0092t very talkative because Fox lets students run the discussions. If no one in your section is willing to speak things will get awkward very quickly.Finally, even if you don't take this course you really should get to know Professor Fox sometime during your time at Yale if you're interested in models of political systems or game theory in general. While this course wasn't particularly intense or mathy, Fox is very very very smart and also happens to be an incredibly nice human being. Highly recommended.",
    "If you're interested in game theory, political institutions, behavioral economics, or simply how people respond to incentives in politics, this is an interesting and engaging course. Not surprisingly, this course on institutional design and incentive structures has very well designed incentive structures. 3\/5 of your grade consists of 8 comment papers (2 pages double-spaced; you can write on any of the 13 weeks), on which it is very easy to well provided you simply do the reading. This means that on any given day almost every student is able to talk confidently about at least one reading. This makes discussions significantly more productive and more interesting. Professor Fox does a nice job giving a crash course in game theory at the beginning of the semester (though it helps to have encountered it before). After that, seminars are mostly student discussion. These discussions are typically quite fun and engaging (thanks, again, primarily to the comment papers). The class overall is not too much work, and the workload is steady rather than concentrated in crazy weeks (since so much of it is comment papers). The only other assignment is a short final paper (4-6 pages, 1\/5 of the grade) that develops a critique of an idea in more depth. Participation (1\/5) is the last part of the grade, which also helps ensure good discussions.",
    "An excellent class that will teach you about the pros and cons of all aspects of institutional design (executive hierarchies, voting systems, etc.), as well as how to evaluate them oneself. Prof. Fox is very knowledgable and quite accomplished in the field, and he brings to class not only his expertise but also boundless energy for topics that a lesser teaching would make boring. Our class had a great time and I highly recommend this course. Note: though it includes some aspects of game theory, this is NOT a game theory class; many people have been confused by this.",
    "This course focuses on social choice theory topics in modern American politics. I was expecting more analysis of game theoretic models during class discussions, which often focused less on the model itself and more on its political implications. I do not have a solid background in contemporary policy and knowledge of the Washington day-to-day, so I learned from classmates in seminar, but often felt like I had less to contribute.Professor Fox was good at fostering a relaxed classroom environment in which everyone was encouraged to participate."
