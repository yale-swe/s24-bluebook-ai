    "This class was just wonderful!! If you liked 185, you'll really love this so much more. Fewer people, more attention, more focus -- a really fantastic learning experience! It's just a fabulous class!",
    "Intermediate Translation is the best class I have taken at Yale, and I am so glad it came in my last semester here. It all comes down to Prof. Waters' energy and passion for translation, which are both infectious. I also loved working on one piece for the whole semester and collaborating with the other students in the seminar, so that we got to know our works and those of others really well. I am very proud of the work we did in this class, and can't think of a way to improve it.",
    "LOVED IT. An absolute gem. If you like Intro Translation, you'll love this one because you have complete control over what you translate and you can really get involved in just one book, which you translate over the course of the semester. Professor Waters is awesome, and the debates over translation are fascinating.",
    "Best class ever. Take it. See both French and English in a new light.",
    "I would totally recommend this course to another student who is creative, has a love of language, and is very self-motivated. Because there are not a lot of weekly assignments, it is crucial to keep up with your work so you can have a project you're proud of to turn in at the end of the semester."
