   "comments": [
    "This course was very demanding (two essays, one major final, a weekly reading response, and a lot of readings). The material is very interesting, but if a student is looking for a course that will be less demanding in terms of work, I would suggest taking a different course.",
    "I took this because I needed a list A that fit with my schedule. Workload was easy, but unless you really love this material, I wouldn't recommend the course.",
    "Yale doesn't have a lot of courses for interested prospective law students, but if you happen to be a psychology major, then you should take this class. It is very interesting, and assessments are fairly spread out. There were weekly reading responses, two papers, and a final. The hardest part is the final, which covers a lot of material, but if you keep up with the reading throughout the semester and take adequate notes in class, you should be fine. The TFs (Nick and Andrea) were also willing to help and explain their grading too. Overall, very interesting and enjoyable! Also shows how messed up the criminal justice system can be, especially in regards to how blacks are treated.",
    "I would recommend this course to other students. I am a psych major who has a huge amount of interest in the law so I enjoyed it immensely. I also feel that this subject matter is extremely relevant and students can see how research is being applied in a way that effects their daily life which makes it worthwhile.",
    "Take the class if you get in! The material is awesome and Professor Lockhart is an engaging lecturer. The thought questions are not ideal in their current format but the workload of the class is worth it if you're interested in the material.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS!! If you are interested in law, then this is a must-take. Even if you are not, the class is relevant to all of us, as we read about trials and police encounters every day and may one day be selected for jury duty! A lot of what you learn is intuitive, but you also learn a lot about the criminal justice system that you probably never knew. It really opened my eyes to the issues with our criminal justice system, and reaffirmed my desire to become a lawyer.",
    "Great class to know about 1) how the legal system works, 2) how psychosocial biases influence outcomes, 3) important legal cases and how they changed the law. Great course!!",
    "This class is amazing. I've never learned anything like it at Yale and I bet there is no class with similar content. Lectures are fun, assignments aren't busy work. Take if you have the chance.",
    "It's a wonderful and enjoyable class that really gets you thinking about this justice system and your own morals. Take it!",
    "Really interesting material + moderate workload. Definitely take it!",
    "Psychology and the law was an extremely interesting class! Professor Lockhart is really engaging and I would recommend her PSYC330 class. The class involved topics such as shooting bias, not guilty by reason of insanity, felony murder law, and many others.",
    "Crash course in how psychological bias systematically plays into legal cases, and many times not to the benefit of those who are innocent but are unable to defend themselves against a barrage of courtroom bias.",
    "A unique psychology class that covers material untouched by other classes in the department. Very interesting and applicable to everyday life. TAKE!!",
    "I would not recommend this course to another student unless you find this material really exciting and are incredibly patient.",
    "Do not be fooled by the appeal of the class name. This class was poorly structured. Pr. Lockhart's lecturing style is speed reading through a ton of slides for the entire duration of class time. Honestly, it's so uncomfortable, that I found it hard to breathe some times. The amount of reading required for the reading responses is a bit heavy. The reading responses are graded out of 15 points. The grading from the TAs is so inconsistent. The class also requires two short papers throughout the semester. They are both 5-6 pages, with such an annoying format: relate how X (given scenario) relates to class concepts. It is very hard to narrow the scope of the paper, especially when the grading reflects that the TAs essentially expect you to cover everything in the class. Honestly if you do the reading form the textbook and the supplemental articles assigned for the reading responses, you do not need to go to class. The final, which is the heaviest weighted form of evaluation is intense. It covers all content from the course. The test booklet is like a short book. It is an EXTENSIVE evaluation.",
    "A good comprehensive review of the relationship between psychology and the law. A lot of focus on racially-influenced biases, but I suppose this is realistic to our world today. Overall very good class. The grading could have been a little bit more fair and evenly distributed. I would definitely recommend.",
    "Definitely would recommend, it's a great class. Professor Lockhart is known for making class really fun but I think people don't recognize that she also really knows the material and will get pretty deep into the details of studies and cases. It's also nice to see an area of psych where studies have big, clear effects that are super relevant in the real world, as that isn't the impression you always get of psych from other classes. The only problem with this class is that the grading is super arbitrary. I think Professor Lockhart is starting to realize that she needs to do a better job communicating with TFs, she wants to make grading easy but the TFs graded harshly a lot of the time.",
    "I highly recommend PSYC 330! It is fun, interesting, you learn a ton about the law and our criminal justice system, and Professor Lockhart is great. The work load is pretty reasonable, but grading can be arbitrarily harsh.",
    "I would recommend this class to another student--it's interesting!",
    "TAKE IT! Kristi is so much fun and so excited about the subject. She does a lot of hands-on exercises in class. I thought grading was a little harsh but not ridiculously so.",
    "I generally enjoyed this class. Professor Lockhart is great and the material was engaging, interesting, and at times depressing. A little more preparation for the final would have been helpful because we had a lot of information to review that we had never really had to recall all at once before. However, I would still reccommend this class.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to a student who is interested in psychology\/cognitive science, and in the legal system. Great professor, not too much work, really interesting readings, and engaging lectures.",
    "Usually cover topics over a 2 day span or so and weekly reading respoonses, which is a single spaced 1 page response to a topic we talked about in class basically. She generally gives you a couple things to read, but they're doable by just skimming 1 of them usually. Some of them are much better reads than others and can be pretty interesting.",
    "Yes, I would recommend the class. Even if you're not completely interested in the psychological aspect of things, this course offers a good overview of the criminal justice system, as well as its flaws.",
    "I really enjoyed this class and the combination of psych and practical application. Lockhart was interesting and engaging. Weekly thought questions require some effort (3 hours), BUT the final was HARD!!",
    "Definitely take this class if you can. One of the best at Yale. Extremely useful and thought-provoking. The readings are fascinating, and you definitely get more out of the class if you do them, but it is possible to do well in the class and still learn a lot just from the lectures."
