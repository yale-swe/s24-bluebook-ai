    "I have learned to be more mindful and have actual discussions in a discussion section. I learned to be more critical of myself and what my practices implicitly say.",
    "This class was interesting but in terms of hard skills learned the value in productive debate with those that dont share the same opinion as you. Of course the studying of traditions was interesting as well.",
    "I learned a lot about other traditions and feel very inspired in developing my own vision.",
    "This course pushes you to asks and attempt to answer lifes biggest questions. Definitely made me think more deeply, and I think will affect how I approach life forever. Also teaches you to listen and engage with your peers.",
    "How to examine and interrogate my life and lead a life that is consistent with what is right.",
    "You will leave this class with such an amazing outlook on life that it will change your life forever. You will deconstruct so much of the things you and other value, an incredibly valuable insight to gain this early on in life.",
    "This class provided me with an expanded view of different traditions' views on the life worth living.",
    "Learnt to structurally think about what traditions and faiths provide to the question of what is a life worth living. Was enabled to reflect on my own personal life and question the assumptions I may have implicitly held."

   "comments": [
    "Great course overall! I loved both the seminars and the lectures. If anything, I would want the seminars to be less structured, lets just have a conversation for an hour! The lectures were awesome and I loved being able to ask practitioners questions.",
    "Strengths - great readings, cool guest speakers Weaknesses - perhaps too much discussion about the texts and less about how they directly apply to our lives",
    "Strengths are the openness of the professors and the digestible yet insightful readings. Weaknesses are the structure of a tradition a week doesnt seem substantial enough.",
    "The strength is that it covers very interesting material in a personal way--by engaging students in the class who might be practicing a certain tradition. A way it could be improved is by scheduling the lecture in between the seminars because a lot of time the interesting materials in the lectures are not discussed",
    "I love the seminar-lecture structure. I found that time extremely valuable. I really enjoyed the readings as well. I really did NOT like writing the papers. It didnt make sense to me to try to develop a coherent thesis statement and answer these huge questions in three really short papers. I felt the format totally contradicted the deep inquiry\/reflection we developed and practiced throughout the semester.",
    "Strength: Definitely the community. The course does a great job at cultivating a tight-knit community within which you are comfortable to share your views.",
    "I felt as though Drew talked too much during our section even though he stated he did not want to take control of our discussion.",
    "Discussions were always lively and instructors made conscientious effort to make sure that everyone in class was comfortable sharing. One thing that could be improved would perhaps be the ability to spend more time on each tradition because some times it felt like there were a lot of readings and they were rather dense, but we were not properly able to explore it."

   "comments": [
    "Yes! Every student should take this course before they graduate. However you get out what you put in. If you don't think about the course questions outside of class you won't gain anything.",
    "Yes! It asks you hard questions that you can otherwise ignore in the Yale bubble.",
    "This class was tricky. I went in with really high expectations that were not met. That being said I still learned a ton and would recommend this class as a credit d to a junior or senior.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class to a student who is interested in exploring other traditions and let them inform his\/her own vision of life.",
    "Definitely! My most meaningful academic experience to date.",
    "This was the most important and influential class that I took at Yale. It will stick with me much longer than any other. If possible, I think it should become a mandatory class for all Yale students in order to graduate",
    "Absolutely! This is a Yale class you must take before graduation.",
    "If you get into Drew's section, stop whatever you are doing and rejoice! He is a total rockstar, and an absolute gift to Yale College. He is an amazing person to get to know, and he cares so much about his students.",
    "Yes!",
    "Yes, would definitely recommend. It's a class that's definitely not fluff and it provides you with fodder to think and to question. I personally think it's ok if you disagree with the readings or discussions or the direction which you might think the class would go. Ultimately, everything in this class provides you with a perspective and something to think about in your own life."
