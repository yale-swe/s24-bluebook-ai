   "comments": [
    "Yes, the class moves at a fast pace and most of your classmates have taken 3 years of Spanish, but its manageable. Sebastian specifically is the best professor to have for Spanish 1. He brings energy to the class and is very forgiving.",
    "Good class for introduction to Spanish. If you have no background in Spanish expect to have to work very hard to keep up. Homework load is not bad at all and the tests and quizzes are fair if you do your studying.",
    "If you get the right teacher it is a great class and you become close with you spanish partners in class.",
    "Lots of work, very difficult for those who have never taken spanish in high school. I would only recommend to those with background.",
    "definitely take it if you have interest in spanish! not too much work, you learn a lot and it's a chill and fun class",
    "Yes, I would recommend Spanish L1.",
    "Definitely take it with Sebastian! He's such a good teacher, and it's actually kind of fun. It's consistently 20 minutes of homework every night, but I'd say it's kind of hard to fail the class if you do all the work. The beginning is difficult\/stressful for people who have no experience, but it gets better as it goes on. Good thing about Spanish, after a semester, you can kind of understand\/make yourself understood in Spanish.",
    "A Great way to start learning Spanish. I would recommend it because it was a fun class and a cool way to learn a new language.",
    "Lots of work, but Prof. Diaz is a great guy.",
    "I would definitely recommend it. You will still remember the Spanish learned in this class after college. Not quite sure if this holds for other languages such as Chinese per se.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this to another student. This class was interesting and I became so much better in the Spanish langauge as well as becoming more culturally aware of what goes on in Spanish speaking countries."
