   "comments": [
    "Synthesizing literary material and philosophical concepts from a historical perspective",
    "In this course, I came to better understand the modernist and post-modernist strands of philosophical thought, in addition to the effects of this thought on the literature of the relevant periods.",
    "I improved at comprehending difficult texts. I think also in reflecting on a text and its connections to previous ones we have read, in writing the reading responses.",
    "Exposure to texts that YOU WILL NOT BE EXPOSED TO OTHERWISE. Period. A convincing reason to take the course in and of itself. Plus, learned so much about analytical thinking about individual texts in historical contexts, and, for me, was my first exposure to philosophy in any formal setting, which I enjoyed tremendously.",
    "My grasp of modernity, postmodernity, and a host of other intellectual movements became much more solidified. This course is about helping you to get inside the heads of the people whose writings came to define certain time periods in intellectual history. I am yet to take another course that does this so effectively. It truly is not just a history course, but an intellectual history course.",
    "The ability to synthesize across philosophical disciplines that affected the history of Eastern Europe.",
    "I have learned quite a bit about modernism and postmodernism, esp. in Eastern Europe and esp. in Russia, though mainly in terms of literary production; not so much in terms of historical events, except inasmuch as the writing of a book is a historical event."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Syllabus felt a bit too eclectic and it was difficult to sustain the connections from week to week in more than a superficial way.",
    "A strength of this course was that the readings really connected to each other. It was fun to read philosophy for a few weeks, and then be able to see the application of those ideas in the form of the novels we were assigned. A key thing to note about this course was that we didn't really get into the Eastern European history behind the philosophical and literary text we were analyzing in class. As such, the class was much less history-oriented than I had expected. This could have easily been deduced by reviewing the readings on the syllabus, but it was certainly a pleasant surprise for me that the seminar discussions were oriented this way (toward the literary and philosophical as opposed to the historical) as well.",
    "The strengths are in its syllabus. The mixture of literature and philosophy is really interesting. Weaknesses -- the world fellow really derailed the discussions, often. I think it's great to have interesting people from across the world around classrooms, but her long stories and side conversations with the professor were annoying, and not usually particularly interesting. I think this class was great, but that it would benefit from efforts to keep the discussion on track.",
    "Course is great as it is. I don't think a format change in work\/reading schedule would add anything. Maybe a little more feedback other than the two rounds of graded journals would have ben helpful.",
    "The strengths of this course lie in Professor Shore striking just the right balance between letting student discuss the texts together while also occasionally jumping in to make sure the most important questions are not being overlooked. This course does not really have any weaknesses that I can comment on. Perhaps having one smaller paper to work on in the middle of the semester would then make the final paper feel less daunting, but that might really be it. It fees like you get more than your money's worth with this class. It is a history course sure, but you also walk away feeling like you completed a seminar in continental philosophy as well.",
    "Strengths: Comprehensive reading list, great structure, comfortable environment Weaknesses: difficult subject, didn't translate too well to seminar discussions at times",
    "This is a necessary course, and we need more like it. There are very few courses at Yale that engage explicitly with the question of postmodernity: what it is, what it means, where it leaves us, how we got there. We have this for Eastern Europe, but we need more: for the U.S. (in which one might read David Foster Wallace's \"Infinite Jest!\") for Latin America, etc. Perhaps a global course. We need them in History Departments and in Literature and Anthropology Departments. This course was a helpful survey of some of the literature coming out of Eastern Europe that deals with questions of modernism, modernity, postmodernity, postmodernism. The reading list was intensely heterogeneous. This could have worked out alright except that the Professor (whose favorite works these obviously were) failed to provided a good grounding framework for how to fit in all these wildly different works. I was left sort of floating between one and another and failing to put any class together with the next. First of all, not everyone who enters the course has any background at all in Eastern European history. Sometimes not even the basics. (I had much less than I should have). This needs remedied, if not outside of the course then inside of it. The student presentations are decidedly unhelpful to this task. What I am saying is that as a history course there needs to be an emphasis on history here. What is going on in the world at the time our authors are writing? We talk so much about modernism and postmodernism but we never talked about the concrete world that this philosophy comes out of: what is modernity and postmodernity -- what machines are being invented? When does the internet become widespread in Russia? We didn't even touch on the historical event that was the Berlin Wall coming down and what that might have possibly just maybe meant for our writers. Everything felt disembodied, disconnected, coming out of nowhere, and completely ahistorical. I got no sense of continuum from this course. No sense that there was any stake at all to any of the questions we were asking. No sense of the real world behind what we were talking about.",
    "This course demands a good amount of reading--at one point there was a 3 week stretch where the reading assignment was a different novel every week. Overall, however, the reading is engaging and rewarding and Marci is exceptionally engaging in class discussion."

   "comments": [
    "Don't take if you're looking for a rigorous, analytical course. Do take if you're looking for a historically informed way to explore ideas you've already studied in more formal settings. If you treat this class as a way to synthesize work you do in other contexts, you'll probably enjoy it. I felt lukewarm about this course in the end, but appreciated having it as a more low-key counterpart to my other academic work.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. The readings were fun (ranging from philosophy to literature), Professor Shore was engaging, and the seminar format was conducive to understanding the nuances of the text. If you enjoyed DS, you will love this course.",
    "Yes -- it's obviously a kind of niche interest, but I think if the course description sounds appealing to you, you'll find it exciting. Some of thinkers we read are really memorable :)",
    "This class is sick. You will be exposed to texts you will not be exposed to otherwise. Read VOROSHILOVGRAD by Serhiy Zhadan and NOTHING IS TRUE AND EVERYTHING IS POSSIBLE by Peter Pomerantsev. I loved loved loved the syllabus, and that's a reason to take by itself. Prof. Shore is a pleasure to learn from. Her erudition is plain, but she is also so respectful and open to her students' thoughts and comment. I'll repeat that she is so knowledgable about the material. I gave a presentation on Vaclav Havel, and as I was researching, I came across his Wikipedia page. Prof. Shore is cited at length on it. I gave a presentation to my professor on someone whose Wikipedia page cites my professor. That's Yale for you, but more so Prof. Shore. The workload isn't light; you read either a bunch of philosophy or a novel a week, so be prepared. Other than that, the only work was a weekly philosophical journal which I really enjoyed writing, as it helped synthesize what you had just read (which is often complex, and always thought-provoking), a presentation on one of the readings, and a 12-15 page paper on whatever you'd like that draws from the syllabus. Though the seminar is two hours, it's never slow. If you're at all interested, go for it.",
    "Any class with Marci Shore is great.",
    "If you don't like getting what I would call \"possessed\" by ideas for unspecified amounts of time, do not take this course. However, if you are a student who has been waiting his\/her whole time at Yale for a professor to open you up to ideas that you perhaps had never encountered before, ideas that are going to make you think and think hard, then this is for you.",
    "Yeah! great class, prof shore is really cool",
    "I would recommend this course to someone who already has a strong background in Eastern European or Russian history of the past 100 years , as well as a background in some philosophy. This is not because you will do poorly in the course, but because if you have that background you will get a lot more out of the class than I did. For your own sake, put this class off until you have something intelligent to say about the topic.",
    "One of my favorite classes so far. A great introduction into the realms of modern and postmodern thought throughout history. Marci is incredibly knowledgeable about mid 20th century intellectual history and its relevance to the present has never been more evident. Would highly recommend to anyone interested in intellectual history, philosophy, and cutural thought."
