   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this to another student. The beginning of the term helped me think through arguments a lot more than the first term did, because we had to struggle through the material without help from the lecture. I think the standards for writing also were higher than the first term. The last part-- the moral philosophy portion-- was very interesting and crucial to peoples' understanding of the roles and aims of human life. It helped inform my worldview.",
    "Yes, would absolutely recommend. The ideas contained in this class will leave their mark on you forever. Should not go through life without at least once dipping into modern Western philosophy.",
    "I would definitely recommend DS - a sampling of western philosophy that develops and builds of the most fundamental philosophical texts.",
    "I would definitely recommend. I loved this class.",
    "I highly recommend Philosophy. It is the place for the critical, engaged mental effort that DS purports to create.",
    "I would definitely recommend it, especially with Prof. Garsten."
