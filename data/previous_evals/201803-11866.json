   "comments": [
    "Evren guides the course on a remarkably in-depth inquiry into three major branches of critical thought: neoliberalism, modernity's production of subjects, and sexuality. Not only did I gain the ability to deeply understand neoliberalism as a moral regime and the subsequent subject's it produces (AND how these subjects warp the field of power that comes to define our sexualities), these highly theoretical (and vitally important) concepts were grounded in case studies sprinkled throughout the semester that made the ideas remarkably tangible. This course helped develop my ability to deeply question the world around me in a way that few at Yale allow. I will definitely be using the theories I learned here to analyze other courses I take!",
    "Great class on how to rethink institutions and structures of power in the world around us",
    "This course taught me critical thinking skills and helped me to understand the relevance of history to the future.",
    "I learned about the implications of neoliberalism for various social and economic groups, as well as discussing potential solutions for these issues.",
    "I gained incredible perspective on our society today, and learned to think critically about the existing power structures and dynamics.",
    "This class is essential for any prospective critical race, gender, queer, or political theorist. It's almost impossible to articulate how much Neoliberalism and Sexuality taught me. In short, students learned to analyze and critically think about the relationship neoliberalism, the most up-to-date form of hegemonic capitalism, shares with constructions of gender and queer identity. However, I truly feel like I have taken much more from this class. I am much more conscious about the way capitalism works and how it affects poor communities of color and the articulation of sexuality and gender. Beside it opening my eyes up further to social justice and political philosophy, the class also helped me become a better seminar-styled learner.",
    "I learned how to look at the world critically and to judge the systems in place to create inequality while thinking of new solutions for a better future.",
    "I learned so much about the way society has come to operate under neoliberalism and the depths it explores. We took a lot of time exploring exactly what neoliberalism is and the distinct attributes that allow it to change the way social groups are perceived. While we didn't really focus on the history of neoliberalism, we did spend a lot of time exploring the different aspects of society that is heavily influenced by sexuality and thus affected by neoliberalism.",
    "I learned so much about Neoliberalism, which I previously knew nothing about. Since the class was discussion based, I also imporved my speaking skills a lot. I loved being in small class with other first years. This class gave me words I needed to argue for what I believe in.",
    "I learned what neoliberalism is and how it's integrated into almost every aspect of our society. I also understood sexuality as a field of power and how neoliberalism affects it.",
    "In this class, I learned to complete leave behind any preconceptions I had about the subject matter and think about the world in a totally new way.",
    "So many! The course provided me with detailed knowledge of what neoliberalism is and how it intersects with sexuality in (often nefarious) ways. It also taught me to rethink the way that I view most aspects of our society (eg. what kind of activism can actually incite change, my conception of sexuality, to be critical institutions which I formerly didn't pay much mind to)."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The strengths of this course were too numerous to count. The structure of Evren's guided seminars, the selection of readings, and the use of papers and blog posts to synthesize material were all wonderful. The course is also strong simply in the way it requires you to think. Lots of the assumptions of our current social regime are stripped a way and you're forced to question some of the most fundamental assumptions we make and why we make them. Also, the wide range of power structures analyzed (neoliberalism, the carceral state, heteronormativity, heteropatriarchy, marriage, settler colonialism, white supremacy, and capitalism, to name a few) provided a very rich analysis of how our dominant social order operates. The only weakness I can think of is the relative late scheduling of the first paper (we didn't have much of an idea where our relative grade would be until after the credit\/d\/fail deadline) but thats a very minor critique to an absolutely fantastic course that you absolutely should take!",
    "Professor is great:very knowledgeable and understanding.",
    "One of the core components of this course is that it is a seminar, which allows students to exchange ideas and also learn together. The course could further be improved with more use of the blog posts. The blogs were an excellent way for students to bring in other interesting ideas to the course, particularly from people who are not as active in class discussion. I think more of an engagement with the blog posts would be nice, such as requiring people to respond. I also liked the short papers (two of them), because they cause you to reflect on what you have learned and how your thinking has changed throughout the course. The final paper, which is essentially a creative writing assignment, is also a space for you to explore what the world could be based on what you have learned throughout the semester, and I feel as though it is a worthwhile introspective activity. A great community forms out of this course, and while the reading load is quite heavy, for most people the material is probably new and fascinating. For an introductory, course, I believe it is also an amazing job at showing what the WGSS department is like.",
    "The biggest strength of this course is the small size, which allowed us to easily share ideas and discuss with everyone engaged.",
    "The course was simply amazing. The level of discourse was incredibly high, the readings were compelling but manageable, and the mixture of blog posts and papers was optimal. If I had to change anything, I would have assigned more blog posts, as they were very helpful in digesting the readings.",
    "Professor Evren Savci is the absolute best instructor ever - she is phenomenal. Savci did her best make the seminar an open conversation, which she succeeded in. Although, the transparency of the class is also thanks to the students themselves. In office hours and in class, Savci diligently and clearly answered questions students may have had. She was very kind and dedicated to student learning.",
    "This course was overall the most fantastic I've taken this semester. I have no recommendations for weaknesses except that I wish we had more time together! I loved the material, teaching method, and professor.",
    "So many strengths, I don't even know where to begin. For one, Evren is an incredible professor, and the combination of discussions, videos, and her \"lecture-style\" explanations made it easy to walk out of the room feeling enlightened and questioning apart of society you never thought to question before. The class featured interesting readings too, especially during the intimate institutions unit - which was definitely my favorite. The course could be improved by spending a little bit more time on Foucault and the relationship he establishes towards sexuality in the beginning as his readings were the most difficult to understand without a lot of background context, and are central to many of the discussions we ended up having.",
    "The strengths are Professor Savci and the other students, but the whole curriculum is honeslty a strength. The readings were extremely interesting. When they were confusing, I could always count on the discussions in class that week to help my understand them. I think it would be interesting to tie this class into current events even further. We did this a bit, but I found that some of my favorite classes were ones where we examined current events.",
    "The discussions in class are very fun and enlightening.",
    "Strengths: The content of the course was super interesting. We wrote a variety of essay lengths\/ types (i.e. did blog posts on the readings and discussed in class). Prof. Savci gave us clear, honest feedback on our writing. EVERYONE (literally) was super engaged in the class and I think did almost all of the readings (which I have heard is not true in many other seminars) - this was thanks to a combination of the atmosphere Prof. Savci created among the kids in the class and the fascinating subject matter. The aforementioned atmosphere\/ sense of community in the class made the seminar style much more effective because we were more comfortable participating in the discussions. Weaknesses: I truly cannot think of any."

   "comments": [
    "Absolutely. If you have any interest in queer politics, anti-capitalist thought, social justice, community organizing, political philosophy, critical feminism, or simply politics, this course will introduce you to perspectives that you won't be able to get elsewhere. The course will give you a deep academic analysis of how to truly subvert oppressive power structures that is very transferable to how we organize as students in the current moment. Understanding neoliberalism is vitally important to understanding modern social movements, and Evren really hammers home how these topics influence the world around us. The readings are going to be pretty dense, but do not fear! Evren is more than willing to break down ideas in course so everyone can engage in discussion. And plus, being able to understand someone as dense as Foucault is so satisfying; it's worth the effort!",
    "For sure! Everyone should take this.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course! I learned a lot through the readings, even about topics\/subjects that I knew particularly well, because this course teaches you to think differently, not just providing you with knowledge about a certain subject (which it also does). If you are at all interested in WGSS, this introductory course might also help you determine if it's right for you.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student because it is an amazing learning experience, even if you know little to nothing about neoliberalism beforehand.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to others. It really opens your eyes, and makes you excited to take an active part in shaping our world.",
    "I have already told many friends about how great this course was. I would definitely recommend it to more people.",
    "Yes! This course was absolutely fantastic and taught me more about the world and thinking critically than any other course I've ever taken",
    "I love this course so much and would definitely recommend it to another student. It was a great freshman seminar and really allowed you to explore your own understanding of sexuality and its meaning in society while also challenging our current social climate. Evren is an incredibly brilliant professor and you will not regret having the opportunity to learn from her.",
    "I would strongly recommend this class to others, if only because of Professor Savci. She was one of best professors Ive ever had. Besides Professor Savci, I believe neoliberalism is an important subject and an analysis of it through the lens of sexuality was incredibly interesting. This class was very informative and challenging enough to keep me on my toes, but not hard enough to the point where I felt as if I was drowning.",
    "Yes, because you will end up learning more than you thought about neoliberalism and sexuality",
    "Absolutely recommend! Evren is such a wonderful, kind, fair, passionate, and interesting professor whom the entire class fell in love with immediately! This course completely opened my eyes to aspects of our world that we take for granted and showed me how the world could be different. Incredibly illuminating, enlightening, life-changing course with a simply outstanding professor!",
    "YES!! This class literally changed my life. Prof. Savci was incredibly helpful and nurturing to us, which made my transition into academic life at Yale so much smoother than I think it would otherwise have been. She helped the class become very close friends, so speaking in class was never intimidating. The class made me think so much more critically of the world in a way that improved me, morally, as a person and was super intellectually stimulating. I feel much more equipped to vote\/ participate in activism\/ interact in a healthier way with a diversity of people because of it."
