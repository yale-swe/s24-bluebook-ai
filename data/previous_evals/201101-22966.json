    "What a class this is. So many great things to say. Woodruff is a powerful force - his criticism is harsh, and incisive, but never unkind. He always appreciates the work we put into this class. Bring a notebook; write down what he says, because he moves fast and doesn't repeat himself often. Your classmates are great resources - build off each other's pieces, use their ideas. I had so many wonderful moments watching, live, moving theater, so much more fresh and alive than things I've seen on stage.Producing a performance piece every week is HARD. I constantly felt like I was bringing shit to the classroom week after week, but because I had to bring in something, I created nonetheless, and I learned from it. Try not to worry about what others will say or think, and just create pieces thatyou like. You'll also feel like you're bullshitting a lot in this class, so just remember that it's all about the moments, and also that nothing has to mean anything.Our class had a panlist that was extremely useful in coordinating pieces, timing, and finding props. I would recommend something similar.TAKE THIS CLASS. Don't wait until next year. Take it now. You won't regret it.",
    "Yes! Take this class if you know what you're getting into and want to be challenged to create.",
    "As much as you will want to drop out after week 4, stick it out. It will teach you about directing, composition, time, and aesthetics in a way no other class at Yale will. You create something every week and will find yourself creating some very bad and some very good work. Regardless, worth your time and energy.",
    "Take it if you're up for a challenge.",
    "I LOVED this class. I explodes your imagination, and illuminates sonmuch about theater, directing, and art in general. Literally life changing. Take this class. Just do it. It's actually not as much work as it seems.",
    "TAKE. IT. (cr\/d\/f)"
