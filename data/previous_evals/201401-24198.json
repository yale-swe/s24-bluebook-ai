    "Excellent class if you're interested in the material. Even if you're not initially, Prof Spatz makes the information really interesting and accessible. Do be prepared for a seminar that's not the liveliest, however, though this was likely more attributable to the people in ours than anything else.",
    "Huge potential, lackluster follow-though. That's all I've got. Incidentally, this was offered at 9:25 a.m. when I took it. It was not worth that. Had it been later in the day, I think we would all have agreed that it was legitimate, but take it as you will that an early hour is enough to lose this class my recommendation. You only get so many chances to take a history seminar at Yale, after all.",
    "Absolutely would recommend this to anyone with any interest in American history. There's nothing more American than the car so this should be at the top of your list.",
    "The course was a solid introduction to the subject, but lacked a real coherence. The discussion was very stagnant, and the seminar became like a lecture at times. That said, Professor Spatz provided a good deal of guidance and insight, and the topic gets not a lot of attention from outside this course. A great focus on visual resources and cultural history.",
    "I highly recommend it for people with any interest in American history or cultural history in general.",
    "It was very enjoyable to learn about a topic not commonly studied at Yale. I learned a lot and enjoyed the professor and class discussions. I took it to get a writing credit, but it ended up being my favorite class this semester."
