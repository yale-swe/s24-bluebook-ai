   "comments": [
    "I would cautiously recommend it - I went in having a vague knowledge of James and really struggled with some of the material and have come out, sadly, not his biggest fan. But it was a very challenging and interesting way to come to such a conclusion!",
    "I would definitely recommend this class, whether you are interested in James or in the novel in general. Be prepared to read copious novels.",
    "Yes, I would recommend the course to another student. Of course, single author topics require a unique commitment from the student. I have not taken many single author courses before so I found it to be very useful to be able to witness the development of an author over time. However, there is a risk that the student loses steam, so I would recommend the person to have a significant interest in the topic.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to anyone interested in Henry James.",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend the course to students interested in theory of the novel and the fiction of Henry James. Working with a scholar such as Dr. Yeazell is such a privilege and delight."

   "comments": [
    "It was for me a fantastic introduction to James's work. And I feel now much more knowledgeable about literary theory",
    "I have not chosen a dissertation topic, so it is difficult to assess its relevance in this regard. However, the class definitely broadened my knowledge of Henry James, as well as some of the major issues in realism and modernism.",
    "The run-through of James and novel criticism was very useful.",
    "As a graduate student interested in fiction and the novel, I learned a great deal in this course. Again, Dr. Yeazell is an excellent guide, and she chose intriguing criticism to accompany the primary texts. Thought difficult at times, the reading immensely benefitted my interest in novel theory."
