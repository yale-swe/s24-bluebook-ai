    "I learned how to comprehensively review the literature in a novel field of science and critically analyze the key developments in that field.",

    "Critical literature review on topic of your choice.",
    "Learned how to write a nice report and make a presentation.",
    "Critical review of scientific literature. Composing a cogent scientific review and scientific presentation.",
    "I got to explore the literature on a topic of interest in greater depth, and gained experience writing about existing scientific literature.",
    "I think I improved my research and scientific writing skills, and I significantly improved my confidence about being able to write a scientific paper!",
    "I didn't develop any new skills. However, I was able to practice my presentation skills; this is something that is so, so important, yet I have never had the chance to do in any of my MB&B classes. I also enjoyed summarizing and synthesizing large amounts of scientific literature.",
    "I learned a lot about the topic that I chose, and also learned a lot about how to structure a good literature review and how to present a new topic to a group of people who weren't very familiar with the subject area."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "This course could be improved by incorporating more opportunities for peer review and group discussions.",
    "Strengths were the structure and the frequency of meetings. It could be improved by having an additional meeting in between the draft and the final paper, I think, to go over questions.",
    "Light workload, nice capstone to the MB&B major. Could be improved if it mandated more of a focus on molecular mechanisms (many people seem to have summarized histories of a field).",
    "Its great.",
    "Strengths: my mentor was good at keeping us updated about due dates and expectations as well as providing feedback.",
    "This senior project was not very time- or effort-intensive, but I thought that was also a weakness because I didn't feel like it was really a project to culminate my four years as an MB&B major. It would have been nice if there was at least an option to do something related to your own research (which could still involve connecting it to existing literature). The advisors are helpful when needed, but it would have been nice to have more continuity throughout the semester, both in terms of interactions with advisors and speaking with other MB&B seniors to learn about their projects.",
    "- Professor Solomon is excellent - I think I actually would go to a weekly or every-two-weeks meeting of students to check in and write together. Especially if there was food! - I hadn't expected to like this class, but I did!",
    "Strengths - enormous flexibility to choose a research topic that fascinates me (and that isn't being studied by a Yale MB&B lab), meeting one-on-one with my thesis adviser, practicing my reading\/writing\/presentation skills, clear step-by-step timeline for the project (which saved me from procrastinating until the last minute!), dividing the MB&B class into four groups (felt more \"personal\" and made presentations less tedious) Weaknesses - The course felt anonymous. I only met with my adviser 3 times in the semester, and saw my other group members once. I would have liked monthly \"check-ins\" that included my adviser and group members.",
    "Strengths: the fact that you can choose to write essentially on anything made the project a lot of fun. The class was also well organized in terms of letting us know when we should turn in certain things, or be done with a certain portion of our project. Weakness: Feedback. I got minimal feedback on my paper, and although my advisor said it was because my paper was really good already, I really thought that there could've been improvements. Feedback on our presentations as well as the final version of our paper would also have been nice."

    "It is required for any MB&B major.",
    "MB&B 490 is fairly chill. The structure is laid out to you at the beginning- make sure you read through all the details so you aren't surprised later on about what needs to get done. Otherwise just follow the deadlines and choose a topic that interests you, and you're good to go.",
    "Capstone to the MB&B major. Fairly light workload, can be a nice opportunity to write a lit review on a topic of your choice.",
    "You probably have to take this for MB&B. Its great! Not too bad and you learn a lot",
    "You're required to take this, but it is a good end to your MB&B career!",
    "Since this course is mandatory for all MB&B majors, there isn't much choice. However, my advice for people in the course would be to pick a topic that's actually of interest to you, and actually try to talk to your advisor and draw from their expertise as well.",
    "I enjoyed this class much more than I expected to! There's a structured set of deadlines that helps you not write the whole paper at the end of the semester, I had excellent feedback from my advisor, and the other people in my cohort hard really interesting presentations at the end of the semester.",
    "A class with very light workload, compared to other senior projects for other majors. The requirements include a 3,000-4,000 word review of a recent discovery (of your choice) and a 15 minute presentations. We were split into four mentor groups (around 10 students per faculty mentor). Over the course of the semester we had deadlines for choosing a topic, writing an outline, writing a draft, and submitting the final paper. After each time point we were required to meet with our mentor for feedback. From talking to my MB&B classmates I had the impression that this is a very straightforward class (everyone does well if they put in a genuine effort). The low-stress and a ton of fun! My adviser even baked cookies. Definitely left me with an excellent final impression of the MB&B department.",
    "This is the most fun MBB class I've ever taken. It's low stress, allows you to pick an area that you find interesting and explore it deeply. I learned so much from just reading on something I found interesting and reading to learn and to be able to write\/present knowledgeably on a subject matter, and still retain a lot more from my studies on my project than a lot of my studies for actual MBB classes. I've heard the experience in this class varies by advisor, but my advisor (Dr. Garen) was pretty chill. You have to take it anyways, just know that it's fun."
