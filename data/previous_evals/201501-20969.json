    "Math math math. I would recommend it for students in chemical or mechanical engineering as a mandatory course. Any chemical\/mechanical worth their salt should know some of this.",
    "This course was not easy but was definitely worthwhile in understanding the various transport phenomena. The course covered various operating regimes and approximations. The mathematical side of the course was very helpful from perturbation analysis, FFT, to vector and tensor identities.",
    "it's a rigorous, challenging course - but the things you learn about the world around you are really fascinating and if you work hard it can be a tremendously rewarding course."

   "comments": [
    "Learned a lot about transport processes and the many ways to solve problems. Opened my eyes to the fact that even the most simple processes could be extremely difficult to model. Based on my current research interests, I don't think I'll be using much of the material though.",
    "This course taught me the relationships of various transport regimes along with easier mathematical approximations. This course is very applicable to any transport problem, from fluid flows to heat flows and mass conservation. The first order approximations for my transport problems in research all are based from this single class. The instructor was a terrific teacher!"
