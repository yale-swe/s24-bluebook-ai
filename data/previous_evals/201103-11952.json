   "comments": [
    "Good class. Must take.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class, especially to political science majors. It applies theory to current events and is really important to understanding politics abroad.",
    "Overall, international democratization is an excellent overview of the various issues. The fact that there is a midterm and a final makes reading a must, but the reading is never so much that it cannot reasonably be handled. Professor Marinov is a good lecturer, if a bit disorganized with the course schedule. It would probably be a more exciting course as a seminar, but the small-lecture format was good for a basic introduction. Overall, I would recommend it. You'll get out of it what you want to.",
    "I'd recommend the class with a couple caveats. I don't think it was a particularly rigorous IR class or anything like that (it's questionable whether such a class exists), but the material was interesting, the readings were accessible (though you don't really need to do them, Marinov summarizes everything in class). The exams were kind of weirdly structured though, with ID questions that were kind of unclear.",
    "What you see in shopping period is what you get. Interesting material from a man who knows it inside-out.",
    "An overview of how and why countries democratize and what influences this process. I thought it was interesting but not overly engaging.",
    "Yes, but only if you're interested in the topic.",
    "I thought it was a great class. The 9am time is a little hard to make, but its a manageable poli sci class on an important topic. I walked out feeling like I've learned some important concepts that help inform my understanding of current events. This is not a \"current events\" class, but you learn a lot of interesting theory on democracy that Prof Marinov ties nicely to real life revolutions. From what I understand you need to talk in class somewhat to get a good grade-- and that's not hard because Prof Marinov does a good job of asking questions and its easy to contribute to discussion.",
    "Int'l Democratization is a great course for the information that is made available to the students. Our homework generally consisted of four readings per week (two per class) and two 2-page written assignments for the semester. If you want to enjoy this class I strongly suggest doing the readings and reading them thoroughly. They can be long but they are super interesting and thought-provoking. Lectures tend to be an overview of the readings, with some extra information. Professor Marinov is clearly passionate about the subject matter, and it really comes through in his lectures. Exams (a mid-term and final) are pretty straight-forward. I would recommend this class if you're looking for a super interesting poly sci course with a light workload.",
    "Good course on the process of democratization, with a balance of theory and case studies. Prof Marinov is a good and clear lecturer, though the course is slightly disorganized as of now. He assigns 1-2 academic papers for reading per class, but many of them we simply go through again in class over the main points."
