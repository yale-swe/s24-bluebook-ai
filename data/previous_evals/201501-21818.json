    "It's probably been said somewhere on this site before, but it's true: the Chinese language program at Yale is an incredibly well-oiled machine. Students should \"know what they're getting into,\" true, but they can also expect a clear sense of organization and consistent, fair grading. Professors Wang and Chan are both incredible - brilliant and energetic. I was grateful to be learning from them every time I walked into class."
