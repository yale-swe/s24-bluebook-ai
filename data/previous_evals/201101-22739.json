   "comments": [
    "You should take it!",
    "I would totally recommend this, because the course material is super interesting and also Professor Williams is outstanding.",
    "an eye-opening experience that goes beyond the reach of a class",
    "I would recommend this course. It is a small seminar, and you get to know your professor and classmates very well. There is a mid-term paper, a large annotated bibliography, and a final paper. There are periodic quizzes to make sure you at least skimmed the readings.It's a great class with a very casual atmosphere. That being said, there is a wide range of material we covered, and I learned quite a bit about early 20th century East Asia.",
    "I really liked this class. I'm really interested in Asian American Studies, so I've studied Asian American history in the past. This class gave me a new perspective, though, because although it incorporated history, that wasn't it's focus. Instead it had more of a scholarly and academic feel -- we studied a lot about the ideas of past scholars who were interested in East Asia. Professor Williams is great -- really competent in the field but also really chill and fun. If you're interested in film, East Asian Studies, or Asian American Studies, you'll definitely enjoy this class. Take it!",
    "Manageable work load with a great professor. I recommend it.",
    "English 299 is a great seminar style course to take. Long discussions, but not too focused or too broad. The course presents a variety of learning material- films, books, and the I-Ching, which saved my life.",
    "I'd definitely recommend taking this class if it's with Professor Williams! He's down-to-earth and very flexible and funny. The reading is usually pretty interesting, too.",
    "A really fantastic, unique course - perhaps the most interesting and diverse collection of works I've ever encountered that are all grouped together under one topic. The reading and films are definitely manageable (and often interesting) and Professor Williams is always very friendly, knowledgeable, and fun. He really cares about the subject matter and the students and makes an effort to present the material in a way that is understandable and accessible to the class as possible. The writing assignments are also structured in a way in that they build onto the previous one very nicely, making the final writing assignment less intimidating.",
    "This class looks at a few different ways in which America interpreted China and Japan on multiple levels (artistic, political, cultural, etc.) in light of its historical problems. The readings are all short and really interesting, the professor is one of the most chill guys I've ever met, and the workload is very manageable. I'm not an English, Film Studies, or American Studies major, but I still would wholeheartedly recommend this course to anyone interested in cultural history. Even if you're not really into it, you could probably still learn a ton."
