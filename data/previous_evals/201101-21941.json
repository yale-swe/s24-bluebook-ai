   "comments": [
    "This class is a lot of reading of the Odyssey. You prepare a passage every day, usually an important scene split up over a week, that ranges from 15 to 35 lines, and then workwith translating the passage in class. You also learn a lot about dialect, scansion, and other elements. I skipped L2 and L3 so my grammar was a little weak, but I still found it a great class in terms of learning how to read more quickly and effectively, especially since no one had done Homeric before and we were all on the same page with the Homeric grammar, which led to the review of a lot of constructions. The Odyssey is fantastic in Greek, so if you have enough background take this! It'll help you become better at Greek and still be relatively interesting along the way.",
    "Compared with past editions of this class, we seem to have covered less text (average of 25 lines per night), but that was more a function of the variety of skill levels in the class, as we had several students who were jumping up from L1. Focusing on the Odyssey, we coupled translation with readings in translation and discussions of grammar and dialect, and covered most of the best-known episodes from the text (Circe, the bow contest, Scylla and Charbydis, e.g.). Overall, a good course.",
    "I would recommend it. I would say it's the first, laborious step towards appreciating Homer.",
    "Ancient Greek 141 is an introduction to Homer through the Odyssey. It covers small sections of the epic, which were largely of the classes' choosing. We also went over Homeric forms and the history of the dialect.I would absolutely recommend Greek 141 to any student. It was easier, much easier, than 131. Homer is really awesome, especially when you can read it in its (semi-)native form. You learn the hexameter, where it all came from, and the whole shebang. TAKE IT.",
    "At least as taught this year, the course didn't demand very much of the student. One could get by easily without really absorbing new vocab or recalling much grammar. As a result, I don't think our Greek skills improved as much as they otherwise could have. I'd like to see the course have more stringent requirements in the future.",
    "I would recommend this course to any Greek student or aspiring Classics major. I enjoyed it very much--not too much work, good discussions, and good instructors. A great \"warm-up\" for L5."
