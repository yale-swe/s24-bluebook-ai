    "If you have any interest in the environment, climate change, or air quality you should take this class. You will learn a lot of the science behind recent environmental policies. It is taught more like a graduate school class but the work is manageable if you ask for help. The lectures are at times a bit dry though and will probably go over you head.",
    "Great class to understand how pollutants and natural emissions can effect ozone, health, and crops."
