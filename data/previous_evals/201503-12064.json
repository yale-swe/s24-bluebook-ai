    "Take it! Classical french tragedy might seem like a scary topic but it'll be a great choice for you, I swear.",
    "Absolutely take this! Great reading, informative discussion.",
    "A classical tragedy every week with a straightforward midterm and three papers.",
    "FREN 265 01 is a very interesting class. The workload isn't a lot, but it is still challenging and the vast majority is spent discussing what you've read outside of class. The plays are usually very interesting and easy enough to read, so they shouldn't be a problem. If you like to participate actively in literary discussions, especially those of plays, then this class is for you. I would recommend this class to a fellow student.",
    "I recommend this class to someone who feels very at ease with the french language. I don't think this class is suitable for just any L5 french student because of the density of the texts and the rhythm at which you are expected to read and understand plays.",
    "I would most definitely recommended FREN 265 to any student with an advanced level of French. Professor Semk is awesome, incredibly knowledgable about the subject he teaches, and genuinely cares about his students. The course itself can seem a little intense on the readings (a play per week), but this comes out to only about 100 pages a week. You also learn so much about ancient myths (the origins of the tragedies studied), 17th century France, and how the two can relate."
