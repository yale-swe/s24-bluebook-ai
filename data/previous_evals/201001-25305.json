    "Teresa is a great professor because she is extremely knowledgeable, helpful, and always there for her students. Very intelligent and dedicated, and good approach to the course overall. However the class was EXTREMELY biased and she failed to provide well-rounded readings that gave all sides of our political debates. It was very difficult to have opinions about the subject matter that were different from hers. Classes got tedious. But all being said, I did learn a lot and it idd get interesting. You just have to be very conscious and open-minded politically going into the course.",
    "As one of the very few classes on Latin American politics I recommend this class to anyone looking to improve their Spanish and even those who are already fluent and are interested in the content.",
    "Take this class! Great way to improve your spanish and learn about latin american politics and history.",
    "Yes.",
    "This class gives a nice overview of some of the major issues confronting Latin America. Sometimes I wish that more focus was placed on each country, but all in all, this course was incredibly stimulating and was a wonderful opportunity to use one's Spanish and learn about international affairs in Latin America at the same time!",
    "This is a great class to take if you're looking to keep up with your Spanish and get a primer on Latin American politics. Take it if you're an advanced Spanish speaker.",
    "It's alright. You'll learn a decent amount about some countries in Latin America. You'll have to go through several weeks about bigger concepts (globalization, the media, democracy, populism, partisanship) that are silly because the class isn't prepared to address them.The readings are pretty good, and extremely short. The class discussion is usually pretty dumb, but she breaks it up into group work a lot, so you don't have to put up with that much of it.There are about 5 short writing assignments (i.e. a few paragraphs), 2 short papers (5-7 pages), and preparation for two in-class simulations, which sounds like it amounts to a lot more than it actually was. Ultimately a pretty low-work class. Do the readings, though.A decent intro to Latin American politics, especially at a low Spanish level, or if you have no exposure to the subject before. If you're good at Spanish and have a decent amount of knowledge in Latin America\/poli-sci, look elsewhere.",
    "This is a challenging poly sci class in Spanish"
