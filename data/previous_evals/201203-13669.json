He clearly prioritized student understanding of the material, and was more than willing to help you understand whatever it was that was confusing.",

    "Field trips with practical work would be great!",
    "It may have been helpful if the professor went back over test questions that students seemed to really struggle with.",
    "This course was great, but it could be improved upon by including a little more hands-on training. We had one class where we stepped outside to use some sampling tools. This was wonderful, and answered many questions quickly and effectively. I think there are other opportunities for brief interludes that could help reinforce material. For example, we had a couple readings and a fair amount of discussion on the mirage method of correcting for edge effect when plot sampling. The readings and discussion were useful, but highly conceptual. I think it could have been useful to step outside and see this method in action.",
    "Some real-world case studies can be introduced.",
    "Class meeting time should be reschedule to mornings.",
    "I strongly feel that the ability to present the course in a manner that strongly lets the students appreciate the value of the subject matter was not achieved. The nuances and the uniqueness of the sampling methods would have been further discussed through the use of examples that would have been relevant and how each of the methods varied from each other. Unfortunately this was not done."

While the return of the assignments to the students was acceptable, it could've been improved. I am not sure how other students took advantage of what the TA offered as consultation hours, however, I feel that there wasn't a lot of venue to clarify the course with the TA."

That said, it provided a set of skills that no other course at FES offers, and so is essential for any research scientist hoping to gather and manipulate data in the future.(2) The professor is very willing to answer questions, but he will keep going unless students stop him. Don't be afraid to say that you don't understand - chances are most of the students in the class will be in the same boat. When stopped, the professor was always willing to spend as long as it took to make sure people grasped the confusing material.",
