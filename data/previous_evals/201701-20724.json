   "comments": [
    "I learned a lot about a subject on which I knew almost nothing before this course: Iran and Central Asia in the modern era.",
    "An interesting insight into the period and region of Iran, Afghanistan and Central Asia.",
    "This class was an overview of Iranian political history vis a vis other, generally Western states. It was comprehensive, and Professor Amanat is both accessible, knowledgeable, and kind. The material and readings were interesting.",
    "The class was a thorough look at the history of the great game onwards. You will learn how to independently write papers and research",
    "I learned the content of the material, of course. In addition to that I learned how to read sources more critically and how to use different types of sources to get fuller understanding of history.",
    "The most productive part of my semester was writing the research paper. Professor Amanat provided very helpful guidance throughout the process (you just need to ask for help, attend office hours, etc.) I was disappointed by the lack of discussion throughout the year, because the group of students was very dynamic and interesting and the content important. However, given that student presentations took up a lot of the time I felt like I got less out of the class and was not able to as fully engage in the material.",
    "Understanding of the region's modern history. With regard to sources: how to use British Foreign Office documents for better insights into colonial-era politics and Great Game governance. Also, some focus on close textual analysis of 20th century Shi'ite political Islam writings."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Professor Amanat is an incredible professor and a very kind person. However, this course was unfortunately quite disappointing; it was poorly structured, we had trouble keeping up with the assignments and there was very little time for discussions of the material covered. The few discussions that we did have were amazing.",
    "The material covered is interesting and well diversified: it draws upon historical, cultural and political aspects of Iran and Central Asia's relationship to the West. I admit I found the second part of the course, where we focused on more recent (20th century) developments more engaging, but that's simply a matter of personal taste. Professor Amanat is a great scholar and led the seminar very well! On the down side, I really wish we had gotten more feedback on our written work during the semester.",
    "Strengths include the potential interest value of the course material, and prof. Amanat's kind nature. Besides this however, the course was largely a mess. The syllabus and assignments seemed to change weekly, readings were moved with little effective explanation. The quality of material assigned was also far beyond the plausible, and classes suffered desperately from a total lack of engagement in the readings and discussion, as well as incredibly bulky class presentations that always ran far too long--because the readings that needed to be covered in the review presentation assignment was always incredibly complex, far too much so to be summarized effectively!",
    "The class was well-organized thematically and in terms of time period. The readings were interesting and well-curated. The course spent more time on pre-20th century Iran than I would have liked. I would have preferred more weeks devoted to after the Constitutional Revolution, but this is just a matter of taste. The professor was very open to students' ideas, even when they differed from his own.",
    "The content was very interesting",
    "I really enjoyed how we had to present every week. I think we learned a lot from that. A shortcoming of this course was that weekly student presentations and frequent guest presentation left little or no time for discussion.",
    "Strengths: Professor Amanat is incredibly knowledgeable. He is the expert on many of the topics studied. Weaknesses: lack of class discussion",
    "Great class and great professor. Professor Amanat is extremely knowledgeable about the said region and events, and sets the seminar readings to get a very strong understanding of the modern history and narrative of the region. It could be improved by trying to ensure more cohesion of Central Asia (which still seems as situated on the periphery in this class) into the syllabus and devoting at least one seminar towards the middle of the semester to focus on closing up the Great Game narrative."

   "comments": [
    "Yes, I definitely would recommend it! The subject is very interesting and relevant for understanding the region nowadays, and even if you're more into European or American History (or into subjects other than History in general), there is a lot to learn in this class. The readings were all very interesting and engaging, and the discussions in class were a great opportunity for debating the issues pertaining to each week's class. The workload is definitely manageable for a seminar.",
    "I would ONLY recommend this course to students with extensive and established research interest in the histories of Iran\/Afghanistan\/Central Asia; however, this course is by no means an appropriate introduction to anyone else; and even then, for any student, the poor organization and unwieldy workload consistently made this class far more chore than enjoyable challenge.",
    "I would recommend this course. This class was an overview of Iranian political history vis a vis other, generally Western states. It was comprehensive, and Professor Amanat is both accessible, knowledgeable, and kind. The material and readings were interesting. The class was well-organized thematically and in terms of time period. The readings were interesting and well-curated.",
    "Definitely. You'll learn about a history you've probably never learned about before",
    "Yes, I would recommend it for its content. I think it could have been better organized to facilitate discussion, but this is an easy fix.",
    "Take this course if you are very interested in 19th century history of British and Russian influence in the Greater Persianate world -- Iran, Afghanistan, Central Asia. But it often felt like there was not enough background to really understand. The course requires a big research paper but besides that just has small assignments; a book report, evaluating a press article, and a presentation to the class.",
    "Absolutely recommend. Professor Amanat is great to talk to and knows the material inside out - making it an absolute pleasure to take this seminar with him."
