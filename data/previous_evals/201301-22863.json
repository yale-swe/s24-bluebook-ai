    "It is a excellent survey course of western Canonical Literature beginning with Petrarch and going to the 20th century. I would absolutely recommend it.",
    "Second semester lit is rough. The texts get way longer and you don't get anymore time to read them. On the bright side, they're all really good too! Definitely take advantage of breaks if you can, and also be willing to accept that you probably won't be able to read it all. If you've made it through first semester of DS you should have a pretty good idea of what second semester should be like. H&P and Philosophy stay pretty similar, but Lit close to doubles in workload.",
    "A continuation of the journey from first semester DS Lit, the second semester begins with Petrarch and ends in the 20th century. It was a fine survey of the works (naturally not allowing for an in-depth treatment of most, but nonetheless offering tantalizing tastes for further exploration), with lectures by leading professors (for instance, the editor of perhaps one of the best-regarded modern editions of Paradise Lost - David Kastan - delivered a Paradise Lost lecture). If you've enjoyed the first semester and were able to keep up with all the work, then certainly continue. However, if you felt that the reading was overwhelming in the time allotted (or are not a very fast reader), and are interested in really getting to know these works, I would recommend trying to explore these texts on your own and through other courses. While it is true that without DS it would be difficult and unlikely to cover all of the works, I believe at least some of the joy from literature comes from the discovery in a first reading of a text, with the slow absorption of material, and subsequent sudden connections. To complete the reading in DS, you are forced to rip through an entire work (often skimming), and in the high-octane environment fostered by the program, the experience is changed. While one can certainly revisit some of the works in later course work and on one's own, that initial wonder from a more relaxed first reading cannot be restored. This did not seem to bother some, but it did others (including me). So, having come halfway, seriously think on your first semester experience before committing.",
    "Challenging, Expansive, Rewarding. The most reading I've done for a class in my entire life, and the most fun I've had in class discussing the texts. My writing improved so much over the course of the semester, and that's a testament to DS as a curriculum and the faculty that enable it to be such an incredible academic experience.",
    "Yes. It is a pleasure. Does no feel like \"work\"",
    "A good review of the important works of literature of the western tradition."
