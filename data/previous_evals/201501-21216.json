    "Same response as question #2.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to another student. I would summarize it as a critical look at the fugue as a rhetorical\/ oratory musical form with a focus on the fugues of JS Bach.",
    "I would definitely recommend the course for the professor is very helpful, passionate and motivating. The comments he offered were always very insightful and stimulating. I have gained an in-depth knowledge about the subject.",
    "I would highly recommend this class to another student. I would summarize it as \"a class where you learn to take apart fugues into little bitty pieces, and then put them back together again - sometimes in a different configuration!\"",
    "You will learn many things about many different kinds of fugues, as you'd hope. The semester falls into two rather separate parts, the first part of which features readings to discuss in class and some counterpoint exercises, while the second is almost entirely analyses and presentations thereof. (The first part is shorter too, I believe.) There is no final paper, but rather just a presentation and a fugue of your own to write on a given subject, and so especially if you agree with me that more composition is a good thing to have in music theory classes, I highly recommend the course. More generally, I recommend it to anyone with an interest in fugue or it intricate noty procedures. Students who are more into history or interdisciplinarity or musica speculativa may be a bit disappointed, though it might still offer them a good dose of balance, perhaps."

   "comments": [
    "This course worked in tandem with my organ improvisation course, also dealing with fugues, to better understand a fugue's form\/structure. In addition, I gained knowledge on fugues from different eras---not just 18th century.",
    "I have acquired many tools to analyze fugues from various perspectives but ultimately this knowledge and form of analysis is applicable to many other forms, this class has helped me to improve my analytical skills for other classes as well.",
    "Understanding the structure of a piece is essential to performing it, and this class teaches you how to understand WHY something is important.",
    "The course directly engaged with some of the music that is most central to my area of interest, so it was certainly very relevant to my own work. I gained many perspectives on how fugal music of various styles can be analyzed and discussed, and many of them are techniques that can be applied to other types of music as well (even though some, like the continuity graph, are particularly well-suited to the fugue)."
