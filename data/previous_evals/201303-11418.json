    "All econ students need to write a senior essay, not only because it's a chance to delve into a topic you truly want to explore, but also because it will be a first-hand exposure to real data analysis. In class, the data you're given is quite clean, and you're explicitly asked to look for specific relationships, so it becomes remembering what commands do what in STATA. In real research, data sucks. It may be hidden on some obscure impossible-to-automate website where you have to click a thousand buttons to retrieve 20 observations, or it costs a year of tuition for the full set, which you don't have. Half of the required fields will be mysteriously blank, and inconsistencies are absolutely everywhere. Like the stock that jumps from $100 to $20 on a perfectly normal day, even though the data says split-adjusted. Once you have picked at the data enough to make sense of it, you'll have to decide which ones of the dozens of variables you want to control for. So begins the quest of obsessing over that unobservable term and maximizing adjusted R-squared's and t-stats. And when you've found a regression that does just that, your advisor points out that high autocorrelation in a time series means you have to difference adjacent time periods, sending your t-stat into the insignificance inferno. But after a few months of wrestling with this, you'll finally have a robust model that you can write intelligently about. Despite all these struggles, you'll understand your topic like never before because you've looked at concrete data, read a handful of scholarly articles, and thought about all the possible nuances en route to making your regression unbiased. Find a good advisor who will offer help with the obstacles and an exciting question that you enjoy thinking about - you definitely don't want to fight through the jungle of econometric techniques with no help while hating your journey. But if you choose carefully, it is easily the most rewarding project you'll work on at Yale, and probably the most useful credit for your future career.",
    "Yes, I've been learning a lot.",
    "yes if you want to do independent research",
    "Yes. Anyone who wants to write an essay.",
    "Definitely do it.",
    "Yes",
    "Overall, if you have a doable and exciting topic this is an awesome choice for senior year. Definitely puts the concepts you've learned in previous courses in an applicable setting! Plus it's really fun to work with a professor on a project as well.",
    "This is a senior essay - think about your topic in advance",
    "Students take turns giving lectures about the topic of the year. It's pretty laid back, definitely a good experience for Econ+Math majors.",
    "I used it as an opportunity to explore a question I was genuinely interested in and it is a great alternative to a senior seminar for those last few credits",
    "great idea if you have a topic in mind!",
    "A senior essay is a wonderful opportunity to combine a personal passion and all of the economics you have learned. It leaves a lot of room for creativity.",
    "I would definitely recommend doing a senior essay. It was a great experience. Got to work on a topic that I was really passionate about. Also liked the independence that comes with this type of class.",
    "Econ 491 is a great if you are interested in writing a thesis. You need to be a self motivated person or have an advisor that will assign deliverables or it can be tempting to not get much done during the first semester. I would recommend the class though because I really enjoy writing about a topic that I find interesting and I think it's a great culminating experience for the econ major.",
    "Do it if you know what you want to do and that the data are readily accessible. Do not do it if you only want distinction in the major. No one outside of Yale knows what that is anyway, as one professor put it to me.",
    "The first semester of the thesis requires testing around the data and honing in on a particular research question, with biweekly\/weekly meetings with a mentor.",
    "It's the two term senior essay, and I would definitely recommend doing a senior essay if you're an econ major. why not?",
    "Required for year-long essay.",
    "I think it's probably better to write a two term essay than a one term essay, so this is helpful for that.",
    "Yes",
    "First semester of senior econ essay. It could go very differently for each person, but mine was spent talking to different econ professors on what I wanted to do, getting data, and doing literature review.",
    "The first semester of Econ 491 is relatively relaxed. Different students approach it in different ways, and the approach is dependent on the topic and your adviser. Most students treat the first semester as an opportunity for literature review, data gathering, and preliminary analysis."
