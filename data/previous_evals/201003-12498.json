    "Your mathematical cajones will descend after this course.",
    "math 250 is a great class for people who are doing the 120-222\/225-250 track. i personally was average at 120 and 222, but found 250 to be great because feiszli teaches well, and its a very hard class but very doable if you put in the time and effort. in the end, i did not take the class because i wanted a good grade but i took the class because i was genuinely interested in the material, so the sheer amounts of time spent on the pset weren't as big a drag for me as theyw ere for other poeple. its very intimidating at first for people who haven't done proofs, but over time it definitely gets easier, and at the end everything concludes and wraps up very nicely with stoke's theorem. take it!",
    "Imagine proof-based math 120 with linear algebra in n dimensions. Psets: 8-12 hours a week. I found working with a group very useful and enjoyable.I would highly recommend it, especially if Prof. Feiszli is teaching it.",
    "There's a lot of work, but the homework can be pretty interesting, leaving you with a \"huh, I never really thought about that, but cool!\" feeling each week. Great professor for an iffy subject matter. Definitely recommend.",
    "Great class. Very challenging material and problem sets but if you find a good group of people to work on them with you'll be fine. Very rewarding. I really felt like I improved my math skills in this class.",
    "Math 250 is a good successor math class for students who have taken both multivariable calculus and linear algebra and want a good solid foundation in being able to understand why the material taught in Math 120 was correct, mathematically sound, and justified. It is a good, generally well taught course by a professor who cares about his students. The material is mostly interesting (with a few notable exceptions in the middle of the semester) and is a good course to take before enrolling in other more advanced math courses because it starts to emphasize the more theoretical side of mathematics. That being said, homework assignments varied greatly in length and difficulty; some took 15-20 hours to complete, a few under 7 hours, and most from 10-15 hours. Keep in mind, most problem sets had no more than 8-10 questions, however, they contained one or two questions that kept you up for numerous hours on a Thursday night before the problem set was due. It is extremely helpful for one's own sanity to find a study group of other students one is comfortable working with: a group in which everyone shares ideas and approaches to solving problems and without people who just copy answers. I would recommend Math 250 to the following cross section of students: (1) mathematics majors who don\u0092t want to take Math 230 and\/or didn't take Math 230, (2) economics and mathematics majors who quasi-need this class in order to take Math 300, and (3) freshmen and other students who have the math background to take a challenging, more theoretical mathematics course. Overall, the course is necessary to take if you want to understand the theory behind multivariable calculus or are simply interested in taking more advanced math. Although the course was well taught and catered to people of all math levels, it is very frustrating when there are some individuals in class who clearly have taken more advanced, more theoretical math, and are taking this as an easy class, when most of the students are first being exposed to this higher level of thinking and are truly struggling. It is extremely unfair to the other students in the class (and to oneself) if one has taken a much greater quantity of math courses in analysis and geometry than the other students in the class. Finally, the final examination was quite unfair. The final tested material which was not emphasized in the course and that the professor found uninteresting, yet the most important ideas from the course were noticeably absent from the exam. Also, there was one question on the final worth over 8% of a student's final exam grade that was utterly unfair to ask and place on a final, cumulative examination. Ultimately, this class could be an excellent class if it had more reasonable homework assignments, an equitably prepared group of students, and fairer examinations; however, based on the manner in which this course was conducted this semester, I am loath to even give this course a \u0093very good\u0094 overall assessment.",
    "Good teacher, fair tests. Take this class if you want a math credit and you're interested in learning the theory behind multivariable calculus.",
    "If you're willing to put in the work and you enjoy the material, then by all means take it.",
    "I didn't really understand what this course was before I took it (it's required for my major). But it's basically math 120, with a little more rigor. You do much of the same thing, differentiation and integration on R^n, and Stokes' theorem, but also you learn about manifolds. If you thought math 120 was interesting, then this will be interesting to you as well. But if you must take this class for your major, take it with Matt Feiszli. He's a really good teacher, and he's very helpful when you go to him. I certainly had to work very hard in this class, but I didn't really think it was that hard to do well. The problem sets take quite a long time, so get started early. The exams are fair if you study.",
    "This class is hard, but if you like math you'll probably like it. It goes over the major concepts from multi, but it uses linear algebra to talk about functions in n dimensions. The final version of stokes theorem is really cool (although it's hard getting there). If you are a first semester freshman, I highly suggest starting off credit-D-fail.",
    "This is a good class for math and science majors.",
    "This course is a diamond in the rough that is the Math Department. Prof Feiszli is absolutely wonderful. His lectures and in particular his lecture notes were clear and concise, and very helpful when doing homework and studying for tests. That said, problem sets were extremely challenging. Like, 8-10 hours challenging. But they'll be worth it in the end. The last math course I took before this one was Math 120, and this course was a good first introduction to proof.",
    "You have to be good at math, but if you are, this is an excellent math course.",
    "Great course. Feiszli is a wonderful instructor. A great course to choose if you're interested in mathematics but wary of the 230 track.",
    "Professor Feiszli is really great and the textbook is pretty good, though getting another book from the library as a less terse reference book would probably be a worthwhile investment. Make sure to have a good study group of about 4 people and this course should be a rewarding and actually enjoyable experience. Do be prepared for some late Thursday nights with your study group though.",
    "250 was a fine course. You probably aren't taking it as a course for fun and I am unaware of another course that covers similar material so it doesn't really matter if another student recommends it.",
    "The subjects studied in 250 are important to many higher level mathematical fields, and as such I think it is a great class to take if you want to prepare yourself for them (and if you already have a background in proofs and linear algebra). However, unless you feel you have an intrinsic ability to understand mathematical concepts, be prepared for a challenge if you take this class.",
    "Definitely!",
    "This class is challenging. Problem sets are time-consuming and difficult. However, once you get through it, it's the most fulfilling thing you'll ever do. Feiszli is a phenomenal professor, and I've heard the grading is fair."
