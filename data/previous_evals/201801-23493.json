    "I learned A LOT about the history of medicine. The class did a good job going from ancient times to modern times, but it was obviously almost too much to pack in. Although I was often confused to the point where studying was difficult, I think I learned more than I ever thought. I learned how to take effective notes, and I appreciate the varied lecture style.",
    "This was my first HSHM class at Yale and it gave me a good overview and insight into the background of modern medicine and how it has changed how time and developed into what it is today.",
    "I learned a broad history of medicine starting from Hippocrates to current day.",
    "I learned a lot about the different knowledge and attitudes people inside and outside of medicine had throughout history.",
    "This course gave a brief overview of the history of public health and its interactions with society.",
    "A great foundation for the history of medicine",
    "This was a great survey course that covered the history of medicine from Hippocrates all the way to the modern day. A major emphasis was placed on contextualizing medicine, and understanding how to use historical perspectives to evaluate the different transformations which took place throughout time.",
    "I have an understanding of medicine throughout the world.",
    "I learned an overarching sweep of the History of Science & Medicine; from Galon to AIDs Activism.",
    "I learned a lot about the evolution of medicine and trends in how certain groups have been excluded from both being treated and being allowed to practice medicine. I learned a lot of really interesting fun facts that were pretty surprising about what people used to believe about health.",
    "A critical perspective on the evolution of medical knowledge throughout Western history.",
    "I gained a great deal with regard to overall history of health.",
    "Looking how to view medicine and medical practices and beliefs from a historical view"

   "comments": [
    "The class felt a little disorganized at times. The beginning was also extremely slow. I felt very confused by the Hippocrates\/Galen\/early stuff. I will concede that I'm not super interested in things pre 1800, but it was challenging to stay engaged. However, I felt the grade breakdown of the class was acceptable, and I think Dr. Elder and Barbara are both wonderful people. On the exams, I HATED the timelines, so please do not use those again!! Also, please allow a little more choice with the IDs-- most classes usually allow you do choose a ratio of about 2\/3, not just all but 1.",
    "Strengths: The readings are really engaging and insightful, and I enjoyed the topic of materials presented. Overall I don't feel like there was a period of time or topic we didn't cover at least broadly. Weaknesses: The organization of the course was poor. The biggest weakness was Dr. Elder's lecture style, as she read off of a script and it was hard to follow her at times, and she did not put slides online for us to review later. That made it very challenging to feel like I walked away from lectures understanding fully what we discussed. At times I felt some information was neglected or glazed over, and I think I would have benefitted from slowing down. As we continued towards present day on the timeline, material was less in depth. I feel as though I know more from the first half of the class than the latter half.",
    "This course was very interesting, but there were a few topics I would've wanted rearranged to make more sense regarding when we learn about them. The various assignments were helpful in maintaining engagement.",
    "I really liked the reading selections. They were all important, and not too lengthy. Never felt like I was reading something useless.",
    "It is very comprehensive - weaknesses would include that subject material is covered too fast and not given enough time to fully break it down",
    "Strengths: clear focus and themes, readings and primary content correspond well to lectures Weaknesses: this class covers so much history, and as a result, moves rather quickly. I would prefer to focus on fewer topics and move slower",
    "Prof Elder is really nice but (I mean this in the most constructive way) it would be much more engaging if she didnt just read from her notes! Its hard to stay as attentive when someone is just reading.",
    "The professor reads from a sheet of paper everyday making the class seem ill prepared for, she doesn't ask for much participation and it makes the class dull. The guest professor was much more dynamic.",
    "Strengths: -it was incredibly informative of the history Weakness: -there wasn't enough time to go into specific detail about anyone period of time",
    "The lectures were pretty dull but the material was interesting. If you could get yourself to pay attention in class, it was pretty interesting, but this was difficult to do because Prof Elder just read off a piece of paper rather than actually presenting the material. Also, it would be great if she released the slides since it was hard to get everything down that was on the board and that she was saying at the same time. I think this class could be improved a lot if the professor presented directly from the slides instead of her own notes and had a more conversational tone. The class was very small so it easily could have been way more interactive than it was.",
    "Strong survey course, but the lectures are not delivered in a very engaging way.",
    "The Professor and the Ta (Barbara Pohl) are the strengths",
    "wish it was more engaging and not slide by slide and monotone"

    "I would recommend this class with pause. The grading is very fair and the workload is manageable-- 3 short reading responses, 1 10 page paper, 1 midterm, and 1 final-- but the material is very dense, complicated, and hard to follow. As someone who is not particularly interested in medicine and doesn't take many HSHM classes, the material was very overwhelming. The course also assumed a great deal of background knowledge. The professor was nice and did her best, though. The TF was the saving grace! If you're looking for a good credit\/D or just want to take a decent 10:30, this is for you. BUT if you're truly looking for a class that changes your life and speaks to your passions as a \"must take Yale class\", I would look elsewhere.",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend this class. I truly enjoyed this class and the material and found it very interesting.",
    "I would, because I think Dr. Elder will probably be able to lecture better next time because this was her first time with a larger lecture (as she said). I thought the material was interesting and I enjoyed the topics, it was just a challenge at times to fully have a grasp on what was going on.",
    "Yes, especially if you tend to struggle to fulfill the Humanities requirement. I've taken two HSHM courses to fulfill this requirement, and while this one definitely overlapped with the first one I took, this one was much easier to follow and understand.",
    "Yes! Its quite interesting and the readings are fine.",
    "Yes. A good introductory HSHM class",
    "Definitely take this course if you're interested in HSHM! It overlaps with a lot of the other HSHM content, but gives a broader overview that can be helpful for contextualizing more specific topics that are covered in more advanced courses or seminars.",
    "Yes if you want something that is low in work but not if you want something that fulfills you academically.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to another student! Medicine and Health in society was a great class. The material is so interesting and the lectures are really engaging. The class is also well-structured and well-taught. Overall, this course was a positive experience and I really enjoyed taking it!",
    "I would recommend this course to other students; it's the reason I've decided to major in HSHM.",
    "Yes, I loved the material and it was pretty easy.",
    "Yes. This course is a strong and broad survey course of the history of medicine, and is a good foundational course before either continuing with HSHM or a future career in medicine. I took it as a senior about to start medical school who will not be taking any more HSHM, and I thought the material we covered was so important to learn because it offers really critical historical perspectives to the discipline I'm about to enter. Professor Elder exclusively reads her lecture notes, unfortunately, which makes the course feel somewhat stilted and makes it difficult to feel fully engaged with her. However, her lectures are incredibly well organized and manage to convey a ton of information into clear and easy to follow lectures.",
    "if you are interested in medicine or the way things were back then and how we have gotten to where we are in medical market place, yes"
