    "This course was a lot of fun. I'm often disappointed with YSPH classes for not engaging in critical thinking about the social factors affecting health, and this course gave me a little outlet for it. The workload was manageable but I felt challenged and definitely learned new things.",
    "I really liked it - it was super small, so when no one would contribute to the discussion it could get awkward! We discussed some really great topics, and I definitely learned things I did not know before",
    "Strengths: small class size, great contentMay be improved by more interactive activities from week to week",
    "This seminar-style course was a fantastic introduction into health disparities with an emphasis on race and socioeconomic status. The assigned readings were seminal texts in the field combined with the most current literature on these topics. I appreciated the small group discussions, as well as the methodological approaches that Dr. Jones emphasized to many of the important disparities' questions."

It focuses on the epidemiology of measuring health disparities which was a new lens for me and I really enjoyed it. Dr. Jones is fun to work with and very caring about her students. Overall, I would recommend it.",
