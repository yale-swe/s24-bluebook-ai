    "This was a fabulous course. I would highly recommend it to Ethnicity, Race and Migration majors in Yale College, in particular. I was really interested in the interaction between race and law, so this course was fascinating. While the course name AFAM 829 might make a student think that the course focused solely on African American legal history, in reality, the course touched on a much broader body of literature, which included the cases involving Native Americans, the Japanese and the Chinese. Definitely take it if you're considering it!"
