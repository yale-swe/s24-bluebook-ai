    "Modern Hebrew 140 is great course to transition a student learning hebrew from basic grammatical study to an actual engagement in ways in which they might use the language.",
    "Fourth level of Hebrew. Focus on grammer but you get to read some literature and watch Israeli movies.",
    "If you need a foreign language credit and want to have fun, take it. Even if you have already fulfilled requirements, you should take this class.",
    "A great continuation of Hebrew 130. If you want to learn more grammar and at the same time read some fun short stories and poems in Hebrew, this is a great class for you.",
    "Ayala is great.",
    "140 continues developing the first three semesters' material. You finish the active binyanim and learn nifal, a passive binyan. Ayala uses many readings and poems, which keeps the class interesting. Vocab development is still somewhat limited in the course, but you really go deep into the grammar of the 4 active binyanim. Ayala is very friendly and tailors the readings to suit the students, though she can sometimes be heavy on the homework."
