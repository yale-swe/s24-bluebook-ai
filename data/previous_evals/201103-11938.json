   "comments": [
    "TAKE THIS CLASS! There is so much more to it than funny movies. This class is an exploration of a few comedic geniuses minds and of your own.",
    "If you plan on being an informed American citizen, you must take it to understand more about America's cultural makeup\/identity\/history.",
    "Good class, gave a varied introduction of comedy in America. The class never felt long, since it was organized around the screening. Spend an hour talking about the film, then watch the film and discuss afterward. The reading was a little daunting, but you learn how to work with it. The essays themselves are pretty reasonable.If you can get it, take it.",
    "Yeah, sweet fifth class.",
    "It is an interesting class. You talk about what makes the movie you watched in the class before funny and then you watch another movie. Although it is a long class, it is really nice to watch the movie in class rather than having a screening. Roemer is very insightful about what makes something funny and the class discussions were good.",
    "This is an interesting course in which you'll watch a bunch of really, really great movies. If that sounds good to you, you should take it. Be warned, though, that the readings are dense, and the classes are pretty unstructured (Roemer will talk for a while about the movies, then you'll watch them; you won't have much work week-to-week except for the 3 times papers are due).",
    "Superb. Roemer's style is such that the class is 1\/3 film comedy education, 1\/3 fascinating anecdotes, and 1\/3 philosophical musings. Don't miss it.",
    "Absolutely take this if you get in! You watch one-three comedies each class. What is there not to like?",
    "Do NOT be fooled by the title of the course! I took American Film Comedy expecting it to be easy and a lot of fun. I was very wrong. For one thing, there was very little class discussion - Michael Roemer is very long-winded and talks at length about the dark (boring) history of the comedians whose movies you watch. Class does not prepare you for the papers. Roemer shuts down everyone's ideas. There is no reading schedule or discussion of the readings, but they're required for the papers, so you better make sure you understand them. The class is long (three hours). Roemer does not have email or office hours, making him almost impossible difficult to reach.One of the most boring and frustrating classes I've taken at Yale, by far!!!",
    "AMST 225 is a great course! The work load is light, class is entertaining, and Professor Roemer always has something enlightening to say. The once-a-week three hour class is a little much, but you'll spend a least half the time watching movies and film clips, so it's not as bad as it sounds. If you can get in, take this class! It's not essential, but it's fun and doesn't require a lot of work.",
    "This is probably unlike any class you have ever taken, as it is more a meditation on the human experience and the psychology of humor and the comic than it is about the cultural history of comedy. Take this class if you want to be taught by one of the wisest people you will ever meet and write papers trying to figure out why scenes make you laugh (informed by late 19th\/early 20th century philosophers).The film selection is eclectic, and you may be disappointed if you expect specific films. The first half of the course is Charlie Chaplin.Ultimately the value in the course is getting the perspective of a man that has lived a long and full life and made some incredible films himself. His insights onto humanity are the crux of the course, and you will watch some terrific movies. Make the effort to talk to him after class and seek him out\u0097like many professors he is wonderful to talk to once you have the right questions.If you don\u0092t take the course, watch City Lights and Singing in the Rain on your own.Also, American Documentary Film with Professor Roemer is just as amazing as this course!"
