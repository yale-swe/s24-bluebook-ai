   "comments": [
    "It will make you realize simply the more things change the more they stay the same. There's always a to fit your personal story into the narrative of the class, even if you aren't necessarily of the African diaspora (in the technical sense).",
    "Hist 394J is a pretty good class. I already had a vested interest in the subject, but even if you don't, you will learn so much. I would definitely recommend this class.",
    "Yes! This course is eye-opening. The material is interesting and the workload very reasonable. The syllabus has great variety, from history to journalism to biography, and class is always dynamic. The final project, a short (8-10 page) paper with annotated bibliography, is incredibly doable -- the trade-off is that you have weekly reading responses, but they are helpful and keep you on track. Prof. Magaziner is great -- he's engaging, friendly, helpful, and a wonderful seminar leader.",
    "One of the better seminars I've taken. Professor Magaziner is great and the material is very interesting. The discussions were lively as well.",
    "A great class! I would definitely recommend this class to another student. Professor Magaziner is extremely intelligent and a great person overall. The readings were really thought-provoking and I enjoyed them all, as well as doing the weekly reading responses. There is not much work, just the responses and then the final paper (~10 pages with annotated bib). Just come ready to seminar each week ready to participate in discussion. If you do not feel comfortable in discussion, Professor Magaziner also looks for your other strengths. I definitely appreciated this, but I also grew stronger in discussion in the class. This was my first history seminar, and I really enjoyed the topic and feel like I learned so much and also came up with many more questions, which I think shows the value and impact of the course.",
    "Awesome course! Makes you think about race in society in so many interesting ways and the professor is great! Be ready to put in the work though, it's a lot of reading and it can be really intimidating if you don't do it all (or at least most of it). Definitely make sure this class is one of your top priorities (I didn't and it made the course much more stressful than it needed to be). Overall I would definitely recommend it, though it also probably depends on the group of people who take it with you because the discussions were very student driven."
