   "comments": [
    "A little harder than L1 and L2, but enjoyable.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this class to another student. The language instruction was terrific and Russian is a great language to know for students planning to go into any field.",
    "This class is a manageable, but also challenging continuation of Russian language. Be ready for the class to be conducted almost entirely in Russian.",
    "Yes! I would recommend this class for anyone wishing to become conversational in Russian or challenge themselves with a very systematic language.",
    "I would definitely recommend as a continuation of L1 and L2.",
    "Definitely recommend! You'll become so much better at conversing and more fluent in verbs of motion by the end of this semester. It's really great to see how you can hold an intermediate-level conversation by the end of the semester, because that wasn't something I felt at all comfortable doing after the end of L2. You basically just become so much more confident in your speaking abilities and comfort answering and asking spontaneous questions.",
    "After taking two semesters of Russian I felt like I knew the basis of the language but was not comfortable with it yet. This semester helped cement the language in my head and now I can readily pull it out. Irina was a wonderful professor who cares about helping you. The workload is about the same as the first two semesters.",
    "Level 3 was a great way to solidify a lot of the topics that seem really confusing and vague at the end of level 2. It was definitely worth taking the next level, which improved everything but I think especially my speaking abilities. They recognize that it's a difficult language to learn and are very understanding, but still hold you to high standards. Level 3 gave me the confidence boost I needed, to believe that I can learn Russian."
