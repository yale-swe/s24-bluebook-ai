   "comments": [
    "Don't take this class, especially if you're at all politically minded. The professor is very set in her ways and opinions about things and looks at things academically. Maybe it was just me and my classmates, but a lot of us did not like that because we were actually invested in the political side of things. The professor also rarely, if ever, said that a student's opinion on the topic was valid beyond a \"maybe\" or a \"really?\". My least favorite class at Yale so far. I would have dropped it if it weren't for the other freshmen taking it.",
    "Talk about some great books! Lots and lots of reading with two large writing assignments. Discussions are bound to be interesting and varied with your peers and it's a great opportunity to take a small class at Yale.",
    "Great course with a fantastic reading list. The class itself was small and perhaps could have benefitted from a greater diversity of viewpoints, particularly since later on it became apparent that fewer people bothered to do the readings -- but there's really no reason not to read the books, which are wonderfully selected and assigned in significant but manageable chunks if you plan your time well. Professor Dimock was knowledgeable and always more than willing to offer constructive feedback.",
    "Do not take this class.",
    "If you like reading, this class is fine. It carves out time for you to read pretty good books. If you care about class discussion then maybe this isn't for you. Maybe it was my class, but this semester was horribly painful. The hour and fifteen minutes felt like four hours some days because of the dryness of the course. Professor Dimock would try and push the discussion in one direction as the rest of the class desperately tried to push it somewhere else. At times I felt like repeatedly banging by head on the table.",
    "This class will be filled with American studies\/English majors who will be looking to get out on top while advancing their own agendas. While I enjoyed the readings, one novel every week gets brutal and difficult to keep up. Only take if required for you or you enjoy the readings\/have time. Do not take otherwise."
