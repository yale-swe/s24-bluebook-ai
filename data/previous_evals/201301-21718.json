    "If you're looking at this review, you probably have to take this class. It's not at all bad with DeMille - he's a nice professor and he explains things clearly.The weekly problem sets have very messy algebra, and especially once you get to perturbation theory, can be conceptually confusing. Most of the problems are taken from the book, which means that most people check the solutions in the book (or check them with people who checked them in the book).The midterm was a take home to be done over 3 hours during the two week spring break. The average was a 70, which DeMille told us would correspond to a low A- probably. About 25% of the midterm was incredibly easy, whereas the rest of it required some thinking.I'm writing this before taking the final, which I'm very worried about... but hopefully it'll be ok!Also, 440 is very different to 410. Some people I know who were average in 410 are doing brilliantly in 440, others who were average are doing below average in 440... so things change a lot. Don't base your success in 440 on your grade in 410.",
    "A great class, although it is a lot of work. Prof. DeMille is really great at explaining complicated topics and very accessible if you have questions. He also had a good intuition about whether the class understood a topic and could move on or needed more explanation. Homework sets are very long but always helpful to understanding the material, and exams are hard but fair (and open-note\/open-book, which is great).",
    "It was a really good introduction to quantum mechanics. The psets took a ton of time (he had us write how long they took and he tried to write them to take 15 hours), but I learned a ton. DeMille's a pretty good lecturer and I learned a lot from the class.",
    "This class is not for the faint of heart. You will work hard, and you will struggle with what is often very tough material to understand. That said, this class is a mutual struggle, and there is a real sense of accomplishment in understanding what is going on. You'll spend between 10 and 20 hours a week working on problem sets, depending on the topic, and you WILL have times where you question why you ever decided to take this class. However, professor DeMille is as good as it gets when it comes to teaching a class like this. He is very organized and easy to follow, and he is also great at answering questions in ways that make sense to his students, and is both approachable and interesting to talk to outside of class. Overall, if you want to work really hard to understand some really interesting material (or you need to take it for your major), I would recommend this class. If you don't, Also, this class uses a lot of pretty heavy math to guide you by the nose, which may sound daunting, but is actually a blessing because your head would probably explode trying to understand this stuff without some hard evidence behind it.",
    "This class is SO MUCH WORK. The problem sets routinely took 15-20 hours. That said, the class was great and Professor DeMille is fantastic. I found it helpful to read Griffiths a lot, since he explains the material very well.",
    "If you're interested in the actual mechanics of quantum mechanics (as in, how the mathematics of it works out), then take this class. Professor DeMille was incredibly nice and was an interesting, thorough, and engaging lecturer, and was always there for help if you needed it. I'm not sure many people \"consider\" taking this course, but if you are unsure about it, I definitely recommend shopping and seeing what it's all about. Don't be alarmed if you dive right into the Schr\u00c3\u00b6dinger equation on the first day!",
    "Physics 440 is the best physics class I have taken at Yale and I highly recommend it to physics majors and those with enough background in math from other departments. Not as intense as I had feared and I'm very glad I took it instead of 439. The material is interesting and it makes everything you've done in math and physics up to now feel worthwhile. DeMille is a great professor so take it with him if possible. He's a very good lecturer and his tests are fair and well written.",
    "I would recommend this class only for Physics majors in that it is a lot of work. The material is interesting but not a lot of chapters are covered; rather it is a really rigorous introduction to quantum mechanics that cuts no corners. The homework is really long and tedious \u00e2\u0080\u0093 13 problem sets that are aimed to take around 15 hours or more a week, so one should know the workload that he or she is getting into. DeMille is great though \u00e2\u0080\u0093 very clear and helpful, one ofthe best physics instructors in the department.",
    "A course thats good for physics majors, no complaints there. He targets the psets to take 15 hours, which is usually pretty accurate and pretty reasonable I thought. There were a surprising number of nonphysics majors in the class this year, and most of them seemed to enjoy it. If you're thinking of doing that, know that this is a very mathematical approach to quantum mechanics, and if you're looking for discussion about what quantum mechanics means or how it can be applied there isn't much of that here.",
    "This was a tough, but rewarding class. The lectures were fantastic - informative, clear, well-paced and very conceptuallyinteresting and DeMille is the absolutely best physics teacher I've had, in three years of the major. The psets are very fair (he expects ~12 hours per week), but the exams are much harder. He gave an exam over spring break, which at first might sound nice, but actually disadvantages students that have plans filling the break.Overall, this was a solid class and would recommend taking it over 439.",
    "The class was well-taught, although moved pretty quickly at the end and the final was very difficult. The problem sets are time-consuming but you get a lot out of doing them.",
    "If you are an intensive physics major, you have to take this. Professor DeMille is an immensely caring, intelligent, and approachable teacher. He has inspired me to look further into quantum mechanics as a potential area of physics specialisation. The lectures were extremely lucid and clear, and DeMille was clearly well prepared for them. My only complaint involves the exams. I know absolutely outstanding physics students who achieved poor marks on the midterm because of the omission of something which was only mentioned briefly in class, and never again mentioned. The final was extremely hard, involved an integral which we had never had to solve for before with the specific limits, and which were not on the formula sheet. The whole of a question rested on getting this. It seemed like one could have studied and understood everything we learned, and still done very poorly on the final. I consider myself a strong physics student, who cares deeply about the subject, and there were questions I could not answer. At the end of the day, this course fostered a real love for quantum mechanics, but I felt the exams were unfair. Professor DeMille is a very caring Professor, so I am sure he will address this in the future.",
    "Quantum mechanics is actually a very interesting class if you stay with it everyday and spend of a lot of time understanding the topics. With that said, it is extremely time consuming, so if you have to take it, make sure you choose your other classes around it.",
    "A really hard class. And it turns out that I really don't like quantum either (though I expected to like it a lot). This class convinced me NOT to be an intensive physics major. This class was a bit harder than 410, but generally a lot less enjoyable. His goal is that you spend 15hrs a week on p-sets, and he gives more psets than there are weeks in the semester.",
    "The lectures and homework are not bad. I enjoy DeMille's highly structured and straightforward lecture style. The homework assignments are long (DeMille expects us to spend 12 hours on them every week) and sometimes involve very ugly algebra. But those are still very doable compared to the exams, which contained unexpected questions and covered concepts that we barely glossed over in class. No matter how well you understand the stuff in the homework, when you see the exam questions, your most likely reaction will still be \"WTF?\"",
    "Ehhh. I hated quantum mechanics.",
    "Yes, as long as you're ready to put in the work. DeMille asks for 15 hours a week on problem sets, which is honestly not the most realistic demand, but you may get close to that on a few. If you made it through 410, you can surely make it through this.",
    "Phys 440 is a rigorous introduction to quantum mechanics. It is quite difficult, so only take it if you want tricky problem sets and very hard exams. I definitely learned a ton, though.",
    "Demille was an excellent professor- he should be nominated for a teaching prize. He always gave helpful answers and was there for students for extra assistance. He really made quantum applicable to the lab and current uses of the sometimes tedious derivations. His teaching made the subject understandable. Excellent course.",
    "Quantum is hard...",
    "Great class! But definitely go to class!",
    "This class was quite a challenge. It starts out easy but quickly becomes very in-depth. If you want to learn quantum, take it with DeMille, and don't fall behind",
    "It's a very enjoyable class if you're interested in physics, but be prepared to spend 10-20 hours a week on psets (and be advised that the rare 20 hour psets can come at inconvenient times). The exams are designed to be a majority (~80%) \"easy\" points and a minority (~20%) \"hard\" points, which I think was a nice idea. DeMille's a good lecturer and a nice guy to talk to.",
    "This class is super hard and are not natural concepts to understand. You need if for the physics major though, and DeMille is great, so stick it out.",
    "This is what every Yale course should strive to be like- rigorous and demanding but with more than enough resources for you to succeed. Professor DeMille was an excellent professor- incredibly dedicated and well-prepared for every single lecture. Take this class with him if at all possible.The problem sets were time-consuming (~12 hours per week) and could be frustrating if you tried to do them alone. However, Prof DeMille was always happy to talk after class or at his office hours (or even schedule additional office hours) to walk you through trick concepts and the TAs were excellent. Make sure to take advantage of these excellent resources!This course does have extra work at unusual times (a problem set over Spring Break, a take-home midterm over Spring Break and a problem set assigned the last week of class). Make sure you are aware of this and plan for it so you don't get swamped.Overall, an outstanding class.",
    "This was one of my most enjoyable physics classes so far because it taught me something completely new. It was especially gratifying at the end of the class when I realized that I knew how to speak a new language (that of quantum mechanics). I would definitely recommend this class, whether you need it for the major, or you just want to learn about a very mathematical and self-consistent way of looking at the world."
