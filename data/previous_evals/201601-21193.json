    "Very good class. Material- Basic introduction to test\/model potentials of 1D quantum with generalization to 3D with a discussion of orbital\/spin angular momentum. I think we could have covered a little bit more, but Skiba likes to be thorough and I know I truly understand everything we did cover. Almost exactly covered Chapters 1-4 of Griffiths. Grades- P Set grading was fine. Much lower work load than PHYS 410 if you have taken it. Straightforward problems. Skiba always manages to make tests somewhat difficult, but I think they were always what I expected. Professor- Professor Skiba is a must take. If you ever see his name on a class take it. Amazing at answering questions, hilarious lecturer, and extremely talented in his organization of lectures.",
    "Skiba is a pretty good teacher, but I kind of liked this class less than classical mechanics last semester. I think we should spend more time appreciating the significance of the mathematical structures used, and sometimes I felt like we were just raping math. That being said, Skiba is still a pretty teacher (and probably one of the most enjoyable at Yale), and his jokes are amazing.",
    "This is a tough class but Professor Skiba is great! I would definitely recommend taking 440 with him--he goes out of his way to help you understand the material.",
    "I jumped straight from PHYS 200 and did fine, and I would recommend quantum with Skiba for anyone looking for a science credit or a fun course. Skiba is terrific and this is a very social class; take it with friends if possible. Its more about calculating physical phenomena than understanding them (the intuition questions on the exams were *tough*), and some of the calculations are extremely lengthy algebra simplifications, but its fun to learn how particles work.",
    "Quantum mechanics is awesome, which is a strength. Griffith's is a really great textbook, and Skiba is a brilliant lecturer and chooses and writes thought-provoking and interesting problems for each problem set and exam. These are all strengths. Caveat: I skipped approximately 25-30 lectures this semester (but only because Griffith's is super thorough and Skiba followed the material very, very closely). Additional note: I'm not really sure which TF graded my psets, but I'd just like to say that I had a really great back-and-forth with my grader where I'd draw a doodle after any especially difficult problems and the grader would add something to it. My personal favorite instance of this was, after confirming the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle for the Gaussian Wave Packet, when I drew a whale with a hat, on which the TA drew balloons and wrote \"Hooray!\" This was great for morale.",
    "This is it. Quantum mechanics. What you find out is that all the magic of quantum stems from a lot of tedious math. If you can take this course with Skiba he is legitimately the best.",
    "If Skiba is teaching PHYS 440 then definitely take it. We covered very interesting materials in class, up to spin\/Stern-Gerlach experiment\/addition of angular momenta. It was a lot and you need to be constantly thinking about the concepts to actually understand them, but totally mind-blowing. Professor Skiba's lectures were very clear and he derived almost everything by hand without referring to the notes. A rigorous and fun intro QM course for physics majors.",
    "This is a great, challenging class. Definitely take it with someone you know, as you'll need to be able to discuss the topics while doing the PSETS. In general the the problem sets are quite fair, but if you also get the Gaussian Wave Packet problem for PSET 4, don't be fooled that it's just 1 problem, start it as soon as possible; the algebra is absurd for that problem.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to another student, but only if they were a physics major.",
    "Physics 440 is a nice class for people who are interested in learning Quantum Mechanics. This class gives you a much richer background and introduction that Physics 260 did, but still as is the nature of Quantum you are likely to find the subject a bit confusing throughout the course, because of our strongly ingrained classical intuitions. Skiba is great teacher, who is always there to encourage you to ask questions. The weekly problem-sets are not too difficult (a lot easier than in Skibas 410 class), however I found both the midterm and final difficult, especially the non=computational conceptual questions.",
    "Great class, you learn a lot but its fascinating material so you don't even realize how much you've gone through!",
    "If you're a physics major, you have to take it, so go ahead! With Skiba if you can. It's amazing stuff. Take Linear Algebra first though. It'll make the class more doable and more rewarding. The stronger your math background, the better it will be for you in this course. Not to say that it isn't doable without linear algebra - a friend of mine did that and she was fine. Technically everything you need is taught within the course, but it'll just be harder to keep up if you haven't seen the stuff before. If you're not a physics major, and you have a strong background in math (especially linear algebra), and you're interested, then go for it! Quantum is so cool!",
    "11 Not a major but interested in Quantum? I would NOT recommend this - it is great, don't get me wrong, but the math is too heavy for a beginner. You will be better off taking the survey courses on Quantum - I heard they are great too. Have the necessary math background (some integrals, multivar, and an introduction to probability)? Take it! It's wonderful. HOMEWORK Weekly, very manageable psets. EXAMS Challenging midterm and final, but very fair grading. LECTURES This is a negative side - lectures were straight outta Griffiths. Reading the book gives the same results.",
    "Good course that followed Griffith's QM textbook fairly closely, making it easy to catch up on missed classes. Prof. Skiba is a very clear and competent lecturer as always, with on-board calculus skills that I can only aspire to. Perhaps would have been better to meet only twice a week with longer lesson times, since some derivations take pretty long anyway, rather than having to trudge up Science Hill on a Friday. Problem sets are very reasonable in difficulty (though you should expect a good amount of calculus including integration by parts, as well as linear algebra). Prof. Skiba's midterms and finals tend to be slightly more challenging, but in a good way.",
    "Phys 440 is a solid class. I personally did not find it particularly inspiring until the end of the semester, since you spend most of the class studying abstract math that really only coalesces into physical significance at the end of the class. That said, I dont really think that there is another way to go about learning theoretical quantum since it is such a weird topic, and the textbook and progression of topics were great. If you can take it with Skiba, do so! He is amazing. He explains things well, is extremely generous with his time, always willing to meet, enthusiastic, funny, passionate, and inspiring.",
    "A fine introduction to quantum mechanics. Unlike 410, the lectures aren't that interesting, unfortunately, but Prof. Skiba is helpful, funny, and a great professor. Psets are short and exams manageable.",
    "Would recommend for everyone, regardless of major. Since it starts from ground zero, I think anyone could follow it (especially since the textbook is fantastic)",
    "An effective intro quantum class. Skiba did a great job teaching it, and really fostered a classroom where students asked questions about the weird concepts that we were learning (Ive never been in a physics class where students were so vocal!). Because the class ran somewhat slowly, there wasnt too much to digest as far as material each week. And the textbook is great, so if you miss information in class youre still okay. The problem sets could be annoying due to unnecessary amounts of algebra\/calculus, but were still not as bad as 430\/420. But the exams were fair. Altogether, I was happy with it and know it was a huge improvement from how the class was previously taught with McKinsey!"
