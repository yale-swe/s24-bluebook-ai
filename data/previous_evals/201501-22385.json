   "comments": [
    "Yes take it! The middle ages were crazy and I learned a ton. Discussion depends on who else is in your class but Prof Purdy Moudarres is always lovely and brilliant.",
    "This class is fascinating and often eye-opening--as always, there was more going on intellectually in the Middle Ages than people think, and it is interesting to examine both how much of that there is focusing on women and what role women had to play in it. Based on that, and an amazing professor, I would recommend this class to anyone.",
    "I definitely recommend this class!",
    "A fascinating topic and much broader than it might seem - we read everything from the Bible to the Inferno. Christiana creates a wonderful environment to explore the subject - she is warm, accessible, kind, and intellectually rigorous, while allowing for tangents based on the class's interests.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS. It is actually brilliant. The best I've taken in four semesters at Yale. It's the totally idealized class I envisioned myself taking when I got into Yale. I'm being fully honest when I say that I ALWAYS looked forward to doing the readings and to going to class. I'd always wanted to read Ovid, Virgil, Augustine, the Bible, Petrarch, Dante, etc-but instead of sitting in a classical literature or DS class I got to read them and then talk about women and history and sex and religion-it was just great.",
    "I would definitely recommend Women in the Middle Ages to a fellow student. It is very very interesting and I looked forwards to it every Tuesday and Thursday. The material is very interesting and very relevant, and there was not one time when I was bored in class. The workload is great as it is a few readings every week and a reading response as well as a couple of papers throughout the semester. I could not recommend a more interesting and well organized class. Take women in the middle ages and learn all about the great women that are our legacy!!!!",
    "I would definitely recommend HUMS 210 to another student. I would say that t deals with lots of questions surrounding women's roles from Antiquity to the middle ages, and that we read interesting texts which answer those questions.",
    "If you want a broader history of women's issues\/want to read about cool female saints and study the masters of Italian lit, take this class!",
    "Such a good class! Will change the way you think about the Middle Ages and provides a really interesting perspective on feminism. The readings aren't too long and the discussions are good, definitely take it!"
