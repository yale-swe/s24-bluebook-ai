    "Recommended to whoever wants to be more mindful about nature.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. Discussions are relaxed and interesting, and the class itself is often a nice break from the rest of your schedule. The writing assignments are fun and the readings are mostly excellent.",
    "Take Nature Writing with Dean Loge! He is a professor that understands that his students are human Yale students, and that they have other classes that might get in the way of his class at times. He is flexible and understanding. The work load is very do-able.",
    "This class was wonderful for anyone who really wants to learn more about the style of nature writing, and about how to evoke nature in their own writing. It was fun, interesting, the readings were interesting, and you could put as much effort in that you wanted to. It ends up being such a small seminar, you end up getting close with the students and professor, and therefore do the work in order to be a part of the class. Fun field trips! Only take if you are really interested in nature, otherwise it will be repetitive and a bore.",
    "Absolutely! This was one of the best courses I've taken at Yale. It was fairly relaxed during class - discussions were very open and you learn more from that than an intensive seminar, I think. Dean Loge is an incredible teacher and takes you on a number of nature walks as a class later in the semester. Best English class I could have taken (and great if you are looking to fulfill a Writing credit!).",
    "It's a good class. The readings are very interesting and fun (when you do them). The writing assignments really give you a good opportunity to develop not only your writing skills but your creativity. The interplay of reading and writing in this class was good for \"letting us enter the genre.\"I didn't particularly enjoy the discussions so much actually. But the reading assignments, the peer-reviewing, and the writing assignments were excellent.",
    "This class was awesome. Dean Loge is a great teacher and very enthusiastic about nature writing. The readings were all fun to read, especially Annie Dillard. There are only four essays, and they aren't that bad to write. The prompts are really broad (literally just write about nature). We also went on nature hikes on the weekends! Overall, a great class.",
    "Nature Writing with Dean Loge is a great course for people who would like to learn how to write a personal essay. A personal essay is not an academic essay; rather, it is an essay in which one writes his or herself into the essay. A personal essay has a unique voice, style, and purpose, all of which the author determines. Nature Writing with Dean Loge examines selected works from a variety of nature writers, such as Gilbert White, E.B. White, Henry David Thoreau. The readings are fascinating and thought-provoking, but one soon learns that there is more to the readings than their beautiful descriptions of landscapes and animals. More importantly, each essay has a public point\u0096\u0096that is, a purpose\u0096\u0096and a unique writing style that one can learn and take from in one's personal journey to find one's own public points and how one wants to present their ideas. This course is one of Yale's finest creative writing courses, taught by one of Yale's finest professors. Take this course if you would like to improve your personal writing skills - not if you want to learn how to write literary critiques!",
    "A great writing class. You will learn to express yourself through the medium of nature, and read a lot about places very different, but sometimes very close, to New Haven.",
    "I would recommend it if you are really excited about nature writing as a genre, and about learning to write within a genre. It's a different experience -- a great experience, but you have to definitely be committed to writing and reading about nature for a whole semester. If you are, then DO IT. This class really fundamentally changed TE way I think about place, community, the world around me, people around me.... It's really really fantastic",
    "Naturally, you are going to think this class is for the particularly liberal elements of Yale, but underneath that assumption you'll find a well taught course that will improve your writing abilities. The class format is typical writing seminar, with discussions, writers workshops, and two draft submissions per assignment. Professor Loge is a good professor, and a true expert in the field. You'll find adapting to the genre challenging at first, but once you do you'll start learning skills that can be applicable to other genres, both creative and non-fiction. I'd recommend taking the course, particularly if you want to hone your craft with adjectives or have a special interest in nature."
