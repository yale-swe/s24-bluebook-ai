    "If you have to. It does help with the class a little bit. It's really easy during the semester, but memorizing all the fish at the end is a pain, but the TAs are absolutely committed to helping you do well so it's doable.",
    "If you take the class TAKE THE LAB.Its really fun! You get to take advantage of the Peabody resources, examine lots of crazy fish (like hammerheads), go on awesome awesome field trips, see a coelacanth (who is a god), dissect ratfishes(!) and learn how to identify TONS of fish.Not gonna lie, memorizing rando latin names is a pain. But its worth it, especially if you go to aquariums or Scuba dive.Alex and Andy are so awesome...extremely knowledgable and helpful. Alex made cookies for and played SCUBA diving footage during the final exam.Make flashcards weeks before the final exam!!!!!And take it. It'll make you smile :)",
    "An awesome lab\u00e2\u0080\u0094 if you are taking the course, you should DEFINITELY take the lab. You come in each week and get to look at a bunch of samples from the Peabody. Alex and Andy are really chill, but also know a crazy amount about fish, and they get you excited to learn about the new species. Sometimes it can get tough (minnows...) but it's one of the best labs I've ever taken. Highly recommended.",
    "If you take the class, take the lab, its a really chill and fun lab, TA's are there to help you, not grade you (harshly). Class is also way easier with the lab",
    "Relatively easy lab. It was fine for me as a non-science major, Just revise fish species every fortnight or so so the final exam doesn't get too gruelling."
