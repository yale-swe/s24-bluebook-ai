    "Making Urban Policy is a good class, especially if you are interested in going into a policy field (urban or otherwise) and want to: 1) be exposed to arguments critical of historically typical policymaking processes, 2) learn about a wide range of cases that should inform your understanding of specific facets of policymaking, and 3) learn a lot about a specific policy of your own choosing. Professor Horan is absolutely excellent. If you're considering this class, then you really should try to take a class with her during your time at Yale. Expect honest feedback and plenty of work, but a real improvement in your analytical and writing abilities.",
    "I'd recommend Making Urban Policy. The workload is significant (as in any class with Professor Horan, there are weekly reading responses) but (also as in any class with Professor Horan) you'll learn a lot. If you're interested in public policy, and particularly learning some theory about it, this is the course for you. I also firmly believe that Professor Horan is one of if not THE best professors in the Political Science department, so it's worth it just for that!",
    "If you want to go into making policy, then yes. If you don\u00b4t then, not really. Professor Horan is amazing, really supportive, makes you think, actually reads your weekly reading responses, and will help you with anything you need. ... but if you're not into the very specific details of urban policy then the readings will be pretty boring, and the discussion will be focused on these readings... However, for someone interested in going into policy and policy making this course is a must. It gives you a deep look at the kind of questions you need to be asking, pragmatic or otherwise, to make policy work..."
