    "I came into this course with a very limited foundation in calculus. In high school, I was taught to memorize certain facts but wAsnt given the reasoning behind them. After taking this course, I have a better understanding of the concepts of calculus.",
    "I definitely more comfortable in how I approach math problems in a logical manner. I no longer just give up the second I look at it. This class has taught me to break problems down and look at the pieces before the whole.",
    "I feel like my this class provided me with a comprehensive review of pre-calculus, but also with a solid and strong background in derivatives.",
    "Calculus and algebraic skills",
    "learnt about general calculus and theory of functions",
    "Feel like I learned how to think more critically and look at a problem from multiple angles"

   "comments": [
    "My strengths occurred after the first midterm. The beginning of the semester was awful. I feel that the transition into this lecture was very rough.",
    "Shajdv",
    "The homework seemed impossible to do unless you went to office hours. The worksheets in class were far too easy when compared to the homework. We should have been challenged in class more so we werent completely lost during homework.",
    "Had to get a tutor to pass.",
    "Strengths: a good introduction to basic Calculus and a great refresher of Algebra. The weekly workshops and daily office hours were definitely the best part of this entire course. Since class-time was so short and there were only a certain amount of topics the professor can go over in one lecture, the workshops and office hours definitely helped to ensure that I grasp on to what was taught in lecture. Weaknesses: the homework did not reflect what was taught in class. Sometimes the TAs were not able to figure out some of the homework problems either. I think more class time should be spent teaching instead of doing problems that professors never have time to go over anyways. As a result, we never know if we are on the right track",
    "Teach more of the stuff on the homeworks and tests",
    "Class sessions can be more focused. More in class examples of work presented on worksheets.",
    "I think that it was taught in a way that I understood pretty well, but might not work best for other people. I prefer to have things thoroughly explained to me rather than to be handed a formula. Sometimes, I felt that lecturing took on a big part of the class time, however. There also wasn't much students engagement in the class.",
    "Strengths: In my opinion, professor Gabriel Bergeron-Legros always clearly taught us the new material. Also, I really liked the printed notes as they allowed me to focus more on him rather than taking the notes. Weakness: I wish there was more of a \"class interaction,\" or more practice problems to help us understand the new material.",
    "The course goes over all topics at a similar speed, which was occasionally too fast and required a lot of consolidation",
    "Time was split well between quiz, lecture and applied work.",
    "weakness depth of topics and time spent covering each topic varied",
    "Weakness: Lectures felt very boring at times. Strength: teacher was more than willing to explain a concept multiple ways until a student understood"

    "Yes. It is a great course to start developing your knowledge for Math.",

    "If you have to take it, then yes. If youre not looking to major in STEM, econ, etc., then dont",
    "Would not recommend unless you need this as a requirement.",
    "Yes, pretty good intro to calc class",
    "Yes. The the overall learning experience was excellent.",
    "I think this is a good course if you did not have adequate precalculus background. My high school did not teach me in the most efficient way, so .I understand a lot more after this class. I think going over the foundations of calculus is important to do before jumping in. I recommend the idea of this class, but I am not so sure about the execution.",
    "I probably would. As mentioned before, I feel like the class is pretty well structured and provides insights into pre-calc and calculus for students who did not take calculus in their high school.",
    "Yes, although it may seem at times either tedious or overly challenging",
    "Not unless they need to do math for their major.",
    "Yes for those learning basic calculus",
    "Yes"
