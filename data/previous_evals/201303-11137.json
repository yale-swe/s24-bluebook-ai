    "I took it Cr\/D, so really didn't put that much effort into it as I should've, as the topic material actually really interests me a lot. That being sad, it's taught very well by an excellent and engaging lecturer, who uses no visual aids of any sort because he's the boss and that's all people will need. Midterm, paper, final, very standard. Gem to take Cr\/D because the exams require minimum work to pass.",
    "Definitely recommend this course. Professor Latham is awesome, the workload is manageable, and every lecture is really fun and interesting. Even if you are not interested in bioethics, this class will be useful to you and you will become interested in it.",
    "It's a pretty straightforward class. Go to lecture. Hear great, interesting things. Go to section. Talk more about great, interesting things. I really enjoyed this class. That said, for whatever reason, I'm having trouble figuring out what I'm doing wrong when it comes to writing midterms and papers for this class, so I probably should've taken it Cr\/D and saved myself the struggle. Still, it's definitely worth taking.",
    "I would recommend the class to anyone interested in law or medicine, but really if anyone is interested in bioethics it's a must-take.",
    "It's a good course, though a little disappointing if you have a high interest in biology or medical science. Usually it's just about the application of general moral principles to scenarios with a medical or biological flavor which is interesting, but sometimes feels a little shallow. Good ethics course though.",
    "Interesting topic and intersection of ethics and medicine. I would recommend it. Not too hard of a class if you understand the hypothetical situations, positions and objections.",
    "Very interesting course. Professor Latham is a beast and just talks for almost an hour straight twice a week without notes of any kind about bioethics. Can be kind of depressing since it's hard to find any right answers about a lot of the material we cover. Definitely go to lecture and you'll be fine.",
    "I would definitely recommend the class. Make sure you go to lecture! Professor Latham is fantastic.",
    "1 midterm, final, 1 essay. Really interesting course, manageable work load, fun topics, and Latham is really great!",
    "Definitely recommend this class. Latham is a great lecturer and the class material makes you think and applies to everyone.",
    "Yes definitely take this course if you are at all interested in the many pertinent bioethical issues we face today. Although be careful on the paper as it seemed that the TAs graded quite harshly on them.",
    "Definitely take it!! and have Shawn as a TA",
    "A good, easy lecture course, material is interesting but not particularly fair in its scope. Latham is an engaging lecturer but the course may not be the most comfortable place for religious students.",
    "This is a good 5th class. It's like Bioethics and Law with philosophy instead, which was more interesting. The midterm was too much like a test of how fast you could write (3 essay questions in 50 minutes), but hopefully this will change in the future.",
    "Great course! Fascinating material, interesting (but not a lot of) readings, straightforward exams, fairly light workload. I found myself talking about the issues brought up in class with a lot of my friends outside of the class just because they're so interesting to think about. And Latham is a wonderful lecturer! My one complaint would be that the course moves pretty slowly, but if you're looking for a low-stress course, this ends up being a fairly good thing because there's not as much material to have to keep straight.",
    "Great lecture but don't slack off.",
    "Interesting and not much work.",
    "Take this for an easy A. It is one of the easiest courses at Yale and it is extremely little stress or work.",
    "YES! It's not difficult at all (the material isn't hard and it's super well taught). And you'll just learn how to think philosophically and counter and develop arguments. And the material is super engaging and interesting. It's a great class. DEFINITELY take it!",
    "Yes, it was interesting and not a lot of work.",
    "I would definitely recommend it. I also took Latham's ethics and law class. The topics covered are similar but you approach them in totally different ways.",
    "Very interesting, relatively easy class. Professor Latham is one of the best lecturers I've had at Yale--he's very easy to listen to and engaging, though he can be a bit scattered at times. Short paper, midterm, and final. No curveballs. Readings are not crucial to doing well...",
    "Amazing class! Professor Latham is great--his style is engaging and very natural. We spent enough time on each topic to really discuss the intricacies and still managed to cover a lot of ground. I took it because I was interested in the bioethical issues I'd heard about in the news, but this class covers so much more, including topics I hadn't ever considered before. Take it if you're willing to question your instinctual ethical beliefs--you'll learn that nothing is as clear-cut as you thought it was.",
    "I would recommend it to anyone.",
    "Issues in Bioethics takes a philosophical approach to examining issues such as organ donation, end of life care, and human and animal subjects research. The topics are interesting, but the class gets quite repetitive throughout the semester. The workload is light though (5-7 page paper, midterm, final; section is mandatory but not factored into your grade), and you do learn a lot if you've never taken a course like this before. However, if you've taken Professor Latham's spring course called \"Bioethics and Law,\" I would NOT recommend that you take this \"Issues in Bioethics\" course because then it gets way too repetitive (although he claims that there is not much overlap between the 2 courses). And if you're deciding between those two courses, I would recommend Bioethics and Law.",
    "Yes, if you want a more 'sciency' humanities this is an excellent choice.",
    "This class will force you to define your own opinions on bioethical issues. Professor Latham is a wonderful speaker, and there isn't much work aside from the paper. A great experience!",
    "I am a MCDB premed, and I can say that all premeds should take this class. One day you will be faced with some of these issues and while there may not be a right answer, you'll have more skills and tools once the day comes if you take this class.",
    "A great intro to the field of bioethics. Prof. Latham is a great lecturer and the topics are very thought-provoking. Was very interesting to learn about what the current debates in bioethics are.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class, especially for pre-med students. The content covered in this course is very relevant for any medical professional and also very interesting for those who are not. Latham is a great lecturer and the content is very intriguing and easily understood. The course load is very light. However, section was not always very helpful.",
    "Great class; yes",
    "Good class, I recommend taking it. Either do the readings or go to class, there is a lot of overlap. Grading isn't too bad.",
    "good class. work isnt too hard. very interesting lectures. take it",
    "This was a very interesting class which gave a framework to think about many different bioethics issues. The readings generally cover exactly what was said in lecture, adding a few more viewpoints. The tests are easy if you come to class, pay attention and study a little bit. The tests were graded differently from TA to TA which was frustrating but that's just the way things seem to go. Overall, an interesting class.",
    "If you are looking for a really easy gut class, go ahead and take this. If you are expecting to learn anything at all from a class, don't take this class. Everything is basically common sense and if you have any sort of critical thinking skills you will be fine.",
    "Strength is that the material is extremely relevant to everyone alive today. As a functioning individual in today's society it is important to understand all the bioethical issues we might be confronted with at some point in our life. Weakness is the \"casualness\" of the lectures. No powerpoints. No lecturenotes, just the professor up there professin' knowledge. Your grade is pretty much predetermined based on your ability to construct and argue an issue. Not any opportunity to grow academically, but the class will force you to form opinions on issues that are certainly relevant to our lives.",
    "Class on bioethics. Interesting subject content that you could debate about for days. Good thing, in real life, we actually do.",
    "Yes if you are interested in biomedical issues! If not, then there's no point. It's also not that much work.",
    "Take this class, it is awesome. I loved it. It is a very good introduction to the philosophical issues regarding bioethics, and really make you think about the difficulties in health care and medical issues. However, don't expect an easy class. Definitely go to all the lectures or you will miss out on something important.",
    "Issues in Bioethics is one of the best courses at Yale. If you have the slightest interest at all in philosophy of any kind, you should absolutely consider taking this course. Professor Latham is one of the best professors at Yale. He has a unique lecture style, not using any notes or PowerPoints, instead talking through ideas in a way that makes the large lecture feel like a small seminar. Professor Latham is fantastic, and Yale is lucky to have him as a professor.",
    "Yes.",
    "It's not a difficult class.",
    "If you need a social science, don't mind barely paying attention in class, and want a low workload course, then I would take this class. Don't expect to leave feeling intellectually stimulated, but it painlessly fulfills a requirement.",
    "Interesting class. I enjoyed it.",
    "Really great course. Engaging on several levels -- a neat blend of practical, real-live issues and a philosophical investigation of the attitudes we take towards them. Definitely take it.",
    "Fantastic class. Incredibly interesting. Prof. Latham is clearly very knowledgeable, yet his humility and ability to clearly articulate the concepts make this class very enjoyable and fulfilling. Very manageable workload (midterm, paper, final). Definitely take this class.",
    "Definitely take this course if you want to be a doctor or a scientist or you are interested in applied ethics. The issues in this course will make your blood boil and your brain buzz, and you will love it.",
    "Good class that brings up interesting topics. Not a difficult class at all. Good 5th class or Credit D",
    "No--unless you're premed, kind of a pointless class.",
    "Bioethics was a easy class and very enjoyable. Not too much work, pretty easy. Can't complain, I liked lecture and section a lot.",
    "Take this class! The material is super interesting and Professor Latham is a fantastic lecturer! I enjoyed each and every class, and am definitely going to take another one of his class in the future! The readings are all really interesting. There is very minimal work load. This is a great 5th class, or just a super interesting class. A must take class!",
    "Good class if you're interested in bioethics - interesting philosophical arguments for major bioethical questions. Not a whole lot of work, but the material presented in class and section is structured well enough that the class is VERY manageable (not a lot of work). Not that easy to get an A though so if that's what you consider a gut it' not one, although an B+ or A- is probably very manageable.",
    "Bioethics was a fairly interesting class that wasn't too difficult. Workwise, it's not bad at all - midterm, final, and a short (5-7 page) paper. I don't think readings are essential since we cover basically the same information in lecture. Professor Latham is an amazing lecturer, really engaging and knowledgeable! However, I was a little underwhelmed by the class - it was more straightforward than I expected. It was definitely interesting, but nothing earth-shattering so I didn't feel like I gained a ton from the class. Take it if you want a relatively easy, but interesting class, but not if you expect this to be one of your favorite classes at Yale.",
    "Lecture basically talks about the articles and authors that you are supposed to have read. When it gets into a series of hypothetical \"what-if\" questions then things get a bit tedious. Section was a lot of this. Not a lot of work at all.",
    "Yes. Being able to converse about these issues is valuable for life. Latham is a great lecturer... Very knowledgable and engaging",
    "Issues in Bioethics is an amazing class. Professor Latham is a talented lecture who can keep a student\u00e2\u0080\u0099s attention without using powerpoints. The course deals with controversial topics such as abortion, end of life care, and organ donation. His unbiased teaching style allows students to develop their own opinions on the issues, and the class is a great way to learn about current and relevant issues in medicine. I would highly recommend this class for anyone who is interested in learning about all topics in medicine and want to hear arguments for and against each issue. This class would be especially good for pre-med students who want to learn about practicing medicine and the critical physician patient relationship.",
    "It was a great overview of the field of bioethics, and Prof. Latham is a very engaging lecturer. Excellent lecturer. The quality and grading does vary between TAs, though, so be careful about that.",
    "I would recommend this class.",
    "If you're interested in discussing these topics, then sure take it. But it's nothing you can't learn from reading articles and forming your own opinions on them, since that's all the course really is.",
    "Phil 334 took a glance at major issues in bioethics, focusing on philosophical arguments for the issues themselves. While touching on some interesting issues, there was little philosophical grounding for the topics we discussed, although this might not be too unexpected, since most of bioethics operates by considering mid-level principles. The result is that it's difficult tosustain arguments, as different people can argue from competing premises. Moreover, while some particular legal cases are mentioned, they are not the focus, so this course will not provide a legally\/technically complete understanding of the issues. Nonetheless, there's a minimal workload (as long as you attend lecture, the readings are hardly necessary, though they are often interesting), and Prof. Latham is an engaging lecturer so if you're looking for a light fifth class that will occasionally inspire you, this would be a good choice.",
    "Overall, this is a very light work type of class. Interesting topics about ethical issues relating to medicine.",
    "Great class. Got a lot of information out of it, and it was easy. You don't really have to do the readings, if at all, to get a lot out of lecture. The readings help with section though. Latham is amazing and brilliant. Easy class, big payoff. Take it!!!",
    "I would recommend it. It is very interesting, has a normal workload, and you will walk away feeling that you have explored many major issues that come up in the news, conversations, and everyday life regularly.",
    "Awesome class. Really interesting, great professor, and the workload is very reasonable. It was one of those classes that was fun to go to and was not a pain to study for. Highly recommend."
