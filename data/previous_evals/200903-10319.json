    "I would recommend it if you have a lot of time, and you're actually going to commit to getting the projects started early. You learn a ton, and the more you put into it, the more you get out. You learn how to do actual science!",
    "Very time consuming but relevant and rewarding. Get ready for countless hours on the electronics experiment. If something isn't working, don't waste two hours trying to fix it, GET HELP FROM TA.",
    "Allot of hands-on experience, very time consuming but worthwhile.",
    "I would summarize this class as the \"real world\" application of the principles learned in the class, as well as the information needed for everyday physical chemistry lab time that would not necessarily be taught in a class. I would highly recommend this class to another student."

    "I'm an undergrad, but it was still incredibly helpful. It teaches you how to be independently motivated in undertaking a project. It teaches valuable research tools (computer programming, electronics, vacuum systems) and makes you do an actual Resonance Raman experiment, a very valuable type of optical spectroscopy to understand.",
    "Prepares me very well for future research work.",
    "I can't believe how much I learned.",
    "This class is very helpful in that the modules covered stuff that are essential aspects to most physical chemistry labs."
