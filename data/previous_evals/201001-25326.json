    "The course material is very interesting and useful if you are into math\/stat\/econ\/bio. A lot about this course (including workload and lectures) depends on who is teaching it that year, so make sure you get a good professor who knows what he\/she is doing. I felt like I learned a lot from this class that I could easily apply to other things.",
    "I would recommend stochastic processes.",
    "It's pretty much exactly what you'd expect. Take it if you're interested in the subject.",
    "yes, if you are interested in the topic.",
    "It's a course that you could probably learn by yourself if you wanted to know stochastic. In fact, what you'll be doing in the class is just reading the textbook and doing problems. You don't have to go to class.",
    "I would recommend this class to any one who wants to take a math class with finance applications. This is one of the few math classes, that are not completely about theoretical stuffs.",
    "Good class, a good introduction to Stochastic Processes with some interesting applications."
