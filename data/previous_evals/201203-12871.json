    "CHEM222L is way better than many other lab classes at Yale, which I had taken before. Professor DiMeglio is AMAZING. That being said, I and everyone else I knew taking this class was doing so ONLY as a pre-req. Like many others enrolled in this class, I have zero interest in synthetic organic chemistry. This class did not correlate well with my organic chemistry lecture class, and I don't really think I learned anything from it that was at all useful or interesting. Honestly, organic chemistry lab techniques have nothing to do with what I want to study or do in life, I honestly think it was a WASTE OF MY TIME. If you do take it, though, take it with Angela - she's awesome.",
    "Yes I would recommend it. Much better than any other lab I've taken",
    "Great course! Really well structured. The early technique labs allow you to easily perform the later synthesis labs. The course packet is extremely clear and provides all the necessary background information that can't be found in the textbook. DiMeglio is such a great professor! She was very helpful and easily accessible.",
    "The labs in this course aren't always the most interesting, but Professor DiMeglio made the course as enjoyable as possible. It's a basic intro lab. Take this class with her, she's great!",
    "Take if you have to, otherwise it's not that exciting.",
    "Chem 222L is an excellent basic organic chemistry lab. You learn about the essential techniques used in organic synthesis and analysis of compounds. The lab itself is pretty chill and if you don't slack off you will be usually done in 3 hours (as compared to the poor people in Gen Chem Labs who sit there for 4 hours or more). As a plus, you get to listen to the radio every lab, so there's also music on the background to accompany your chemical endeavors. The workload is fine; as long as you take good lab notes and read the course packet you should be fine when you're challenged with writing post-lab assignments. Although you will have to prepare a simple experimental plan every week, post-labs aren't that regular, and when you have long ones you'll also have plenty of time to work on them (at least 2 weeks). Absolutely take this class if you plan to major in Chemistry. You might also enjoy it as non-STEM major.",
    "WAY BETTER THAN GEN CHEM LAB! DiMeglio is very nice and tries to learn many of the students names. Try to get Tyler for a TA. He is super nice and understanding and definitely one of the best TA's for Orgo Lab I.",
    "Take it if you need to but it's not a bad experience.",
    "This is fun class in which you learn a lot of techniques that will be useful in later labs. The environment is relaxed, there's music playing, you're almost never in a rush, and the TAs are generally awesome. Though it is listed as a four hour class, itis actually only 3.5 hours long, and there are many days that you can get out by 4. In terms of workload, you write an Experimental Plan each week, which takes about an hour, and about half the time post-lab assignment, which generally takes 1-1.5 hours. There is one lab report, you have two weeks to do it, and one of them is Thanksgiving break! Overall, this is a low-stress, lots-of-learning class. If you're thinking about it, you probably have to take it - sign up, and don't worry about it.",
    "I would recommend this lab for students interested in Organic Chemistry who enjoy doing practical chemistry. But be prepared for a big time commitment.",
    "Good lab to go with CHEM 124.",
    "Much better than general chemistry labs. Less work, and the techniques you learn aren't boring or unhelpful. It is about 0.5 credit worth of work, and the grading is harsh, but you will learn a lot.",
    "Chem 222 lab was an excellent and interesting lab-- the best I've taken at Yale. It is very well run and the material nicely complements and solidifies the material learned in Orgo I lecture, so I would definitely recommend this lab to anyone in Orgo I lecture. Additionally, the workload was reasonable and each lab was educational in teaching or solidifying lab techniques.",
    "A great Lab if you get a good TA. But good anyway. Super useful",
    "You have to take it",
    "I really enjoyed this class, and the labs were usually pretty easy. During the semester, there was only one time that it took me the whole lab period, but most times I was out by 4 PM.",
    "Orgo Lab. A great reinforcement and addition to Chem 220.",
    "Chem 222L was way better than intro chem lab.",
    "It was an excellent introductory chemistry lab class.Yes because it would really teach you a lot of useful techniques in organic labs.",
    "I don't know who would take the class outside of a requirement, but take solace in knowing that it is completely bearable.",
    "Make sure your EPs and Lab Reports follow the strict guidelines in the lab manual.",
    "I would recommend this lab - it was pretty fun, especially after familiarizing yourself with the way ep and postlab assignments are written up.",
    "Orgo lab is a class you take because you need it. That being said, it is the best run lab out of the four I've now taken here at Yale.",
    "Highly recommend. my favorite lab here.",
    "Was fun but takes up a lot of your day. Worth taking if you are taking the lecture.",
    "Although some say that orgo lab is a laid-back and low-stress experience, for me it was quite a challenge. There's certainly a learning curve to this class. You can spend hours on your first pre-lab experimental procedure and end up losing big points on small formatting errors or pedantic requirements. If you're a freshman and this is your first lab course, you'll probably be stumbling into this blindly and need a couple weeks to figure out how to take good notes and make sure your EPs include every silly little detail. However, your experience will also heavily depend on your TA. The grading rubric for lab reports is pretty tough and some of the harsher graders will deduct horrendous amounts of points from your reports, while all your friends in other sections are receiving nice high grades. In the end, it's all about playing the game and being ridiculously meticulous on your reports and EPs.",
    "This lab was a great introduction to the techniques used in organic chemistry labs. The amount of work required to prepare for each lab was very reasonable, and not every lab had a post lab assignment, which was great. Dr Dimeglio was really helpful and approachable and made the lab enjoyable. This lab is definitely a lot better than gen chem lab and it felt like a lot less work, but I feel like I learned more.",
    "Yes, if you have to take it of course! But it is still a fun class to take anyways.",
    "Difficult - but then again, labs always are.",
    "Good course that teaches you well. Yes take it.",
    "Its a lot of work for only half a credit but I took it because it was required. The experiments are very long and time consuming but they are interesting.",
    "I would certainly recommend CHEM 222L alongside first semester orgo, if students are looking to fulfill lab requirements for pre-med. I enjoyed it more than I enjoyed orgo. That being said, it is a significant amount of work with EPs and lab reports\/post-labs due generally on a weekly basis, so use discretion when deciding if you have time to take it.",
    "Chem 222L is actually an enjoyable lab class. Labs aren't stressful the way they can be in gen chem lab and the work load is very reasonable& offers lots of practice without too many really long assignments. The material only includes the simplest orgo concepts, so it isn't very difficult.",
    "Yes. Take it if you need to. Lab is not fun, but Orgo lab is very tolerable.",
    "Picture Chem 116 and 117L. Shudder appropriately. Now fix all of the annoying problems with those classes. You have created Chem 222L.",
    "A great introduction to organic lab concepts. Fun, low-stress. Would definitely recommend it.",
    "Yes, very good considering it is organic chemistry lab",
    "If you are taking CHEM 124, take this lab! It's fun, informative, and a good way to get used to being in lab environments.",
    "Chem 222L is definitely worth taking if you need it\/are going into chemistry. From what I've heard, it's one of the better lab courses.",
    "If you have to take lab, you should take lab. Just be warned: it's difficult if you have no previous lab experience.",
    "Take the class if you need it for a requirement or are particularly interested in organic chemistry. It's much more laid-back than the gen chem labs from what I've heard, and the workload is manageable. Dr. DiMeglio is great and the TAs are generally helpful. I liked the class and learned a lot without it being overly stressful.",
    "Chemistry 222L was a great class. The labs were fun-at the beginning you just do techniques, but as you progress labs become more complex and you get to apply what you learned before. Also, Dr. Dimeglio is excellent-she is approachable and very helpful during lab, and clearly communicates her expectations for assignments. Finally, the workload is pretty manageable-there are small experimental plans due every week, and only post lab assignments for a few labs. Overall, I would definitely recommend this course.",
    "CHEM222L is a great intro orgo lab. However, it helps to have prior lab experience. There are some assumptions about the students preparation for the lab and his\/her knowledge of lab practices (safety-wise and technique-wise). I would recommend this course to a student taking CHEM124 or who has taken CHEM124L. All of the assignments are mostly do-able with knowledge from CHEM124 although sometimes there isn't a perfect overlap in material and lab concepts.",
    "Take it only if this is what you love or the reason for taking it is to be able to do something you love one day.",
    "Standard lab course. You'll probably enjoy it a lot more than gen chem, and near the end some of the labs are pretty cool.",
    "This lab is great. The labs are actually really interesting to do and once you get the hang of things, it's really fun to get to do them. The lab reports and post lab assignments are not bad at all and the work isn't too tough.",
    "Lab is not a heavy workload, but don't make the mistake of thinking you can get away with not preparing. It's a pretty fun class if you know what you're doing. It is not that time consuming but can be an annoying block in your schedule.",
    "I would definitely recommend this lab to another student. As far as lab courses go, this is a pretty good one, and the work load isn't too heavy. We only had one full lab report to turn in. All the other post-labs were pretty short and, as long as you were paying attention to the pre-lab lecture, pretty easy. The atmosphere is pretty chill, too. Music is usually playing, and no one's fighting over chemicals or anything like that. If you're taking organic chemistry, take the lab. It's not too difficult, even if you don't have much previous lab experience.",
    "For a lab, it wasn't bad.",
    "If you are taking Orgo, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll probably have to take this lab. The TA is very important in making the lab enjoyable or not. Fortunately, I had a great TA and therefore the labs were not too bad. Try not to take Friday labs though because they really do suck! Having to spend four hours of a Friday afternoon in lab is not fun. From what I have heard, Orgo lab is not as bad as General Chem labs, so just take it if you have to.",
    "Take it if you have too. Much better than genchem lab.",
    "I think this is a really good lab course, especially compared to gen chem lab. The work is very doable. The experiments are interesting and straightforward. Do the work and be prepared, and you'll do great.",
    "Orgo lab is great!! It's so much fun! The labs themselves are fun and rarely take a long time (especially if you come prepared\/20 minutes early). The lab reports aren't long or difficult either, and you only have to write two full lab reports at the very end. Overall I learned a lot and really enjoyed it.",
    "Orgo lab is the best! Although grading might seem to be a bit nitpicky sometimes, never fear, as the class is curved slightly and the labs can actually be pretty enjoyable.",
    "dont take it",
    "Easy lab that doesn't take that much time, but it doesn't help you very much with the orgo lecture. I would definitely recommend, and you can definitely take this lab in addition to another one in one semester!",
    "It's a tedious introductory chemistry lab for any premed, chem major, engineering major, etc. There's definitely a lot more work than the 0.5 credits presupposes. The experiments aren't that interesting, yet you do learn a lot of basic skills needed to do manage different tools and utensils in lab.Be prepared to do a lot of reading, typing, and A LOT of proofreading to make sure everylittle detail is correct about your experimental plans and post-labs, lest' several points be deducted from your work.I would recommend the course only for those interested in premed, chem major, MB&B, MCDB, BME, or CHEM-E.",
    "Yeah, take it. It helps with the course material, believe me.",
    "Yes. It really isn't much work and it is actually kind of fun.",
    "I definitely prefer this class to the Chem 116,117 lab. Its a more relaxed environment and they play music during the lab! It makes the lab, which people are probably taking because they have to, more enjoyable.",
    "Dr. DiMeglio is great! She's friendly and helpful, and legitimately cares about your understanding of chemistry. The lab is relaxed and covers less material than lecture, but I still learned a lot. Overall, really good.",
    "Orgo lab is a good lab class - much better than Gen chem. No weekly quizzes, and lab reports are not due every week. The final is an in-class test, all multiple choice questions. Also Dr. DiMeglio is a great professor, she is very helpful and approachable.",
    "Definitely a class worth taking, especially if you are lucky enough to have a good TA. I was initially worried about my first lab course in college, but CHEM 222L was a positive and rewarding experience overall. As long as you're taking the organic chemistry course at the same time, this course is fun and relatively easy to do well in.",
    "Not as much work as gen chem lab, and you don't have to write reports every week. Experiments are interesting, if a bit repetitive. You learn a bunch of new techniques and the semester is essentially devoted to building expertise in them by doing different sorts of experiments. Nice accompaniment to the lecture course, and it doesn't weigh you down with a bunch of work. I know most people hate doing this, but I recommend taking it on Friday. It's nice to have the weekend to work on the post-labs and EPs, since it's very easy to get caught up doing other things during the week.",
    "CHEM 222L is very organized and teaches you the basics of organic chemistry laboratory techniques and concepts. Dr. DiMeglio was very enthusiastic and caring. She was always smiling and made lab a nice experience. You have to do weekly EPs, and every so often you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have a post lab assignment. There is one full on lab report that you have to do and a multiple choice final. When taking the course, make sure you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re very specific and have everything down because points are taken off fairly freely for missing concepts, missing data, incorrect formatting, etcetera.",
    "I wouldn't suggest taking this lab for fun, but if you have to take it, you should know that it's more fun and so much less stressful than the general chemistry lab. In CHEM 222L there'd be a radio playing Top 40's, you could walk around and chat with friends a bit, 4hrs was usually more than enough time to complete the experiment (not as stressful as gen. chem!), and you felt like you were actually learning something.",
    "If you are taking orgo you probably are taking the lab. take it at the same time. If you are taking orgo you probably do not have much of a choice. However, it is still a good course and supplements orgo well. I would recommend this class.",
    "Chem 222L is a hard class. It requires alot of work and should be taken seriously, even though it is 0.5 credits.",
    "Easy lab. Be careful from day 1 with the little things in your lab notes and lab reports - that's where all the points are lost.",
    "This is such an amazing lab, and such a great change from Gen Chem Lab. It's so laid back and enjoyable.",
    "As with any other lab, take it only if you have to. If you have to, it's not that bad.",
    "I recommend this course if you're interested in chemistry. Otherwise, it might be that worthwhile.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to another student as a good grounding in basic organic chemistry laboratory techniques. Dr. DiMeglio is very kind, helpful, and accommodating, and the labs are generally quite fun.",
    "This lab nicely reinforced the concepts taught in orgo lecture. The labs and lab assignments were MUCH more relevant, concise, and useful than those assigned in gen chem.",
    "You basically learn a bunch of lab techniques for synthesis and product analysis and write lab reports. Not too much work, but certain TAs can make it stressful. Just do your thing--you'll learn a lot regardless of who your TA is.",
    "It's a pretty normal lab course, mostly consisting of lab reports. Almost all students who take it are taking it with orgo out of necessity, but if someone was taking orgo for the sake of it, they should consider thelab class as well.",
    "Yes! Only one full lab report and you actually learn a lot of useful things. Doctor DiMeglio is an angel and will help if you have any questions!",
    "Orgo lab 1 is a great introduction to an organic chemistry laboratory. You learn techniques like extraction, filatrion, distillation, thin layer chromatography, and infrared analysis. Prior to each lab, you prepare an experimental plan, which details the procedure of the lab and helps you to have a better understanding of what will be performed during the lab. I would definitely recommend it to gain lab experience in a controlled environment.",
    "Good course, fun and relaxed overall.",
    "Orgo lab is one of the best structured labs at Yale. Expectations are clear and grading is straight forward. Experimental Plans (EP) are busy work, but they are a much better way of ensuring you are familiar with the lab before class than quizzes. If you're taking it you have to take it, and it is designed to be as painless as possible.",
    "This is a great lab course; it is very fulfilling and relatively painless when comparing it to other labs.",
    "Great course that complements Freshman Organic Chemistry very well. Lots of work, but definitely fulfilling. I would definitely recommend to any student taking Orgo.",
    "This lab really is quite enjoyable and teaches useful techniques for organic chemistry labs that you can apply in later experiments.",
    "Clearly you are taking this course for some requirement. That said, it's a good course, loads better than gen chem lab, and much more interesting. Dr. DiMeglio is super nice and the TAs are chill.",
    "Obviously you're taking it for a reason. It's much better than GenChem lab.",
    "After gen chem lab, orgo lab is a breath of fresh air. It is an interesting and effective overview of basic chemistry lab concepts. Sometimes it is tedious, but you know exactly what is expected of you. I would say take it if you're at all interested - I definitely enjoyed it. Another benefit is that it's exactly half a credit's worth of work.",
    "RECOMMEND, very few lab reports with simple labs that are easy to comprehend.",
    "A good supplement to the Organic Chemistry lecture but one should only take this is they plan to use the class for their major.",
    "Chem 222L was a great course. You get to do labs that line up well with your coursework, and help with understanding. The writing portion of the lab builds upon itself very well, so that writing up reports or post-lab assignments never feels overwhelming and doesn't take too much time. The labs themselves had a good pace and didn't feel like busywork, and often finished before the full 4 hours passed, which made them less tiring than other labs I've taken. Overall, I thought it was a good amount of work and a helpful addition to chem 220.",
    "Yes!!",
    "Sure, take it if you need it. It's dry if you don't need to take it, but don't dread it or anything if you have to take it.",
    "not too much work...interesting class to take as a survey course",
    "Chem222L is an enjoyable hands-on experience that provides a welcome break from the textbook reading of a standard orgo class, as well as context for the concepts learned in lecture, although the grading can vary and the lab reports, while few, are a fair bit of work.",
    "I would recommend this class. It was a good lab foundation and you get comfortable in a lab setting throughout the year.",
    "This is one of the most fun labs I have taken so far. The experiments performed relate well to class and are pretty fun to do. The time commitment is a lot, even for a lab course, but is very much worth it.",
    "Dr DiMeglio has a really great course. Labs are relaxed, with music playing in the background, and you'll be out well before 5 (usually around 3 or 3:30!). No pre-lab quiz, instead you prepare a pre-lab protocol that you follow rather than the manual. Post-lab assignments are not too taxing (much less stressful than 119L) and you only write one full lab report. Final is a multiple choice quiz, no curve balls. There's no choice about orgo labs, but luckily for you this is a good one!",
    "I would recommend this course to the person that needs to take it because I can't imagine someone taking this lab course unless it was necessary for their major (or if they were pre-med).",
    "Take it if you like orgo or are premed. It's bearable but never fun.",
    "Overall a decent lab course.",
    "Yes!",
    "Orgo Lab 1 isn't a very work-intense course. Just remember to double check for including all the chemicals in your materials sections of your EPs and just go through to make sure you're following what the course packet wants for the post-labs. The packet is really clear!",
    "Yeah, you probably have to take it if you're reading this.",
    "For pre-meds this has been the best lab I've taken so far! The workload is low compared to biology and gen. chem lab, and Dr.DiMeglio is awesome!",
    "I would only recommend Chem 222 if the student has to do it as a requirement or if he\/she is very interested in chemistry.",
    "Take this lab. You will anyway because you have to. But it's nothing like Gen. Chem. It's so chill, there's so much less work. There's no practical exam to freak you out. It's what a lab course should be.",
    "This lab will teach you many of the most important techniques you'll use in laboratory science, and I feel like it was a good foundational lab to have as a freshman. But be prepared to learn fast; you're expected to follow along, and if you have no previous lab experience things will get off to a quick start. No worries, though-- if you put in the time on your pre-lab work, you'll do fine.",
    "The best science lab that I have ever taken. As long as you come prepared to lab and do the EPs and PLs, it is relatively unstressful and actually rather enjoyable.",
    "Overall, I would only recommend this lab if needed for premed.",
    "Chemistry 222L is a great first-semester lab course in organic chemistry that focuses on separatory and analytical techniques used in the organic chemistry lab and explores their applications and their relation to chemical theory.I would highly recommend this lab class to anyone enrolled in either Chemistry 124 or Chemistry 220. Although the first several experiments do not relate to the lecture course as well as the later experiments, this course helps reinforce the concepts introduced in lecture by forcing students to use their understanding of organic chemistry to explain and analyze experimental data. Despite the fact that, like other lab courses, the workload is a bit heavy for only 0.5 credits, it is definitely manageable and entails about 10 to 25 pages of weekly reading, an experimental procedure for each experiment, a few post-lab assignments, one full lab report, and a final exam. From what I have heard from friends in general chemistry courses, the labs assigned in this class are much easier and more interesting than those in the general chemistry lab classes.",
    "Have fun getting a good TA.",
    "I recommend it. It's a good lab and you get a solid grip of fundamentals.",
    "Yes, take this class. It's not very hard, and it is actually quite interesting. I enjoyed this lab more than any other I've taken so far.",
    "IDK lab really isn't as bad as people say. Heck, I'd even say that I had FUN in lab. I mean really you just play with chemicals and chat with the people around you, with your TA even. I would say though that picking the right day to have lab is important for you. I actually chose Friday because nothing else worked for me but it turned out that I really liked having it as my last class of the week - just a nice way to wind everything down. I also had about 2 hours for lunch before lab which also gave me enough time to finish up assignments or at least print them out before going up science hill.",
    "I would recommend this course. It's not a very difficult class but the work does take up a large chunk of time.",
    "I would recommend it if you are taking orgo (which i don't recommend unless you need it)",
    "Not nearly as bad as it could have been.",
    "I would definitely recommend it, but beware that it requires much more work than the average 0.5 credit class.",
    "It is a lab course that introduces you to key procedures used in organic chemistry. I recommend this course to another student, because it's very helpful in allowing you to perform independent experiments and is really fun.",
    "The class is good overall. One thing to keep in mind is thatthe TAs all grade differently, and the scores are normalized at the end, so one shouldn't worry too much. The labs occasionally ran over, but we finished early most times.",
    "This lab kind of makes up for the terrible experience that is organic chemistry lecture. Most of the experiments are straightforward, enjoyable, and don't take the full 4 hours. Professor DiMeglio is great and the TAs are for the most part good.You have to do an experimental plan for every lab, as well as a post-lab assignment. Most of the post-labs were quick, with only one full lab report that you get a lot of preparation for. You're not graded on accuracy, which makes it much more relaxed. The final is worth 40% of your grade, so study hard for that.",
    "I would recommend the class if the student is taking or has taken organic chemistry. Otherwise, the labs will not make much sense.",
    "Interesting and exciting!",
    "Most likely you have to take the course else I wouldn't recommend it",
    "Chem 222L is much more interesting than the general chemistry labs. The in-class work used a variety of techniques and covered a variety of reactions, so it rarely felt repetitive. The post-lab assignments and reports were manageable, and the TA's were great at giving help both in and out of class. It definitely wasn't a hugely helpful supplement to organic chemistry lecture, but it was nice to see certain concepts hands on and never felt like a huge waste of time (as general chem lab often did)!",
    "Standard orgo lab course, light on the workload compared to PChem lab but still sufficient work to keep you busy. Take it if you need to; you won't really gain anything unless you're taking it as a prereq for a major or for being premed.",
    "I really enjoyed this lab! It was much more lax than GenChem Lab but I felt like I got even more out of it!",
    "Lab that applies first semester orgo",
    "Yes, I would recommend it!",
    "Definitely take",
    "This is a very rigorous course-- you will learn the techniques of experimental chemistry well, and well worth taking as an introduction to the world of synthetic chemistry, if you can brave four hours of noxious fumes that leave you with a headache afterwards.",
    "The good news: you aren't graded on your product's purity or percent yield. The bad news: you work independently, so expect to be in lab consistently for close to the full four hours. The TAs and lab staff are all helpful and understanding, so don't be afraid to take this course.",
    "I would recommend organic chemistry lab because it is one of the funnest laboratory classes I have taken.",
    "This is a really great class. It is a fair amount of work, but you really learn a lot. It is a pretty relaxed environment and Professor DiMeglio is awesome--ask her for help if you are confused or something has gone wrong or if you just need help understanding something.",
    "Somewhat laid back chemistry lab. Environment is great because of music playing in background. Labs build up on the previous labs. Highly Recommended.",
    "This lab is not as bad as the others. I actually enjoyed it, and DiMeglio is great."
