   "comments": [
    "I would recommend Pol Sci 113 as an intro class. I found all the reading really interesting. It was really great when the readings related to something really historical or something currently happening.It definitely gets better as the class goes on.",
    "Pretty simplistic intro poly sci class. Can be a bit of a gut. I'd definitely recommend it, since the subject matter is interesting but not difficult.",
    "Only if you really haven't studied American government before and don't know how the institutions work, otherwise it is a very boring class. As an international student it gave me a decent background in American politics, but everything I learned came from the textbook so the class itself was superfluous.",
    "Yes, if you want to be a Political Science major. It provides a fairly comprehensive overview of American Politics. That said, it was probably more interesting than it would normally be given that this semester encompassed a presidential election. I would not recommend this course to a non-Political science major; there are many more interesting social science courses at a school like Yale, even if you are interested in American Politics.",
    "3 short tests. No problem sets. Just have to attend section. Take if you want a fairly easy credit or are interested in the subject.",
    "If you're interested in the American political system, take it!Three straight-forward non-cumulative tests, no papers, very manageable workload, interesting readings.",
    "If you're at all interested in politics, definitely. First, you would learn the basic mechanics of the government, which is somewhat of a prerequisite for a deeper understanding of politics. But furthermore, it will open up a whole new way of reading a newspaper or watching the news.",
    "More than just a civics class, Intro to American Politics helps you see the reasoning and logic behind American political institutions, behavior, and history. Definitely take it if you want to know if you're interested in politics as an academic discipline. Be ready to write a lot for the tests, though; writing three short answers and one essay in 50 minutes is no easy feat.",
    "The lectures are big where notes are often taken on a laptop. Professor Rader is very informative in lecture, often times mostly summing up the readings in Logic. I didn't find the other textbooks all that helpful. The class isn't a lot of work if you enjoy reading, but for someone like me who has an extremely slow reading speed and low comprehension rate, the class had a painstakingly time consuming workload.",
    "TAKE IT !!!! Even if you're not a poli-sci major you should take it. We deal with collective action problems everyday and this class makes you think about getting big things done despite varying opinions on how to get things done. Basically, you can apply a good chunk to everyday interactions.",
    "Yes absolutely it is a good base to political science",
    "I would not recommend this course to anyone, although I've heard it was much better in previous years. There are much better Intro Poly Sci courses at Yale- this one is not rewarding, won't teach you anything you don't already know, and will annoy you all semester. The workload is extremely light, but unless you feel confident that you can do very well on three 50 minute exams (which are all about writing fast, not actually understanding the material), the grading will be rough.",
    "This is a very basic class. Not too much work. Take it but don't expect to learn a ton of new information.",
    "Don't take this class if Professor Rader is teaching again. You can learn all the material by reading the textbook yourself. As an international student, you should be aware that most of your classmates are American students and thus have a much better foundation than you.",
    "I really enjoyed this course and I would recommend it. It is very interesting and is about information that people should know about our country's political system.",
    "It's kind of boring but there isn't a ton of work, no papers, and only 3 tests.",
    "I would recommend Intro to American Politics because it is a good foundation if you want to study something else in that area.",
    "Although this may have been a gut in the past, you've got one coming to you if sign up thinking it is now. Endless textbook readings and raw score tests make this course far from a cake walk. The tests themselves, however, are fairly formulaic - simple three short answer, one essay format. As long as you hit the key terms and answer the question it's not difficult to get full marks.The main thing to look out for are the lectures: 50 minutes of high speed summary, with important points rattled off at mach speed. Rader has a tendency to lecture at the walls for minutes at a time too, which can make things interesting.",
    "The course goes over the formation of the Union, the political theory of the various branches of government, as well as in media etc.",
    "Good introduction to American History and politics. For a course centered on American politics and history, I would not recommend it. However, it was a decent intro to the political science department.",
    "Provides a very thorough introduction to the Politics of the American Government. I would recommend the course because it is interesting for those who want a basic but still thorough introduction to the American Political System.",
    "This class gives a very thorough foundation in American politics, covering political foundations, political institutions, and government interaction with outside groups and the public. This is a very easy class as well, and this means that a lot of people in the class don't take it very seriously. I did though, and Ifound it to be a valuable class. The lecture itself is not particularly important to the class, but the readings and the lecture are good. I definitely find myself evaluating political thought and political decisions than I did before, more as a logical thinker and less as a partisan.",
    "I would recommend taking the class because you would learn a lot. However, I think a few small adjustments could make the class dynamite. I would suggest a different professor and more information on modern day issues and some more basic information rather than strictly logic.",
    "Everything you need to know about this course is found in the syllabus. It's a very straightforward class. I didn't really enjoy lecture too much simply because it was right after lunch time and I was basically too tired to pay attention. Rader is very clear in her lectures, but sometimes they can get boring. I would always start taking notes like crazy, but by the end of the class I'd given up and just decided to read the book to fill in the gaps in my notes, but I think that worked out pretty well.",
    "I would recommend this class to people who are not familiar with U.S. politics but would discourage people who are familiar with U.S. politics from taking this class.",
    "The course is mainly based off of readings in the textbook, so it can be a bit slow. I would only recommend this course if one has an interest in learning about the basics of the American political system.",
    "In PLSC 13 you learn about american politics, both the history and the present structure and it is a good class if you want to get away with doing very little work, but I definitely would not recommend it because it was not engaging.",
    "This course is a good course if you want to know the basics of the different branches of the US government, but I found it really boring. Professor Rader doesn't usually use any powerpoints and she talks pretty fast so lecture can be hard to follow and pretty boring, but it is not a hard course and if you do the reading you will probably do fine. If you have already taken a course in high school about the American government this class is a waste of time. Also, Professor Rader seems pretty jaded about American politics which can be a little annoying."
