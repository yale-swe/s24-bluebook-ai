    "DO NOT TAKE THIS COURSE unless you absolutely have to for the language requirement. If you are beginning a language, begin with something other than Spanish, at least until fundamental changes are made to the spanish curriculum at Yale.",

    "I only took the course because I had to, and I would not recommend it to anyone else unless they have to.",
    "This is a great class for maintaining your Spanish skills and expanding on material from L1 and L2. You will be more conversant afterwards. You will also get some exposure to Spanish culture."
