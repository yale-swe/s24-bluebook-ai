    "Strengths: 1. Well organized lectures 2. Well organized course website 3. Interesting and useful topics",
    "He provided us a lot of business insights, but the class was disorganized and unsystematic.",
    "I think the course could improve tremendously if it were split into two distinct sections: Accounting then Finance. I feel introducing a midterm test to evaluate accounting, and focusing the final exam largely on finance would make the content more manageable and allow the students to learn more about each topic.",
    "It was very stressful having an exam that was 70% of our grade.",
    "very good, related to real world,",
    "very nice job",
    "I learned a lot throughout this course, but I thought that the homework grades should not be on correctness but on effort. I spent countless hours on the homework problems and only received 2\/2.5 sometimes.",
    "good",
    "The class got more interesting in the second half, mostly because everyone got over the bottleneck of the accounting part. When evaluation is added, accounting makes much more sense. I understand the necessity to follow the lecture sequence, and Stanley did excellent job combining those two (excellent!) Perhaps a more balanced workload in accordance with the lecture topic would make this class more interesting."
