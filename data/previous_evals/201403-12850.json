    "This is a great course to solidify your french grammar.",
    "French 150 is a good course to solidify your knowledge of French in general, to learn how to analyze text and film in French, and to learn to write a French paper. It's also a great way to become more comfortable speaking. It is a lot of work, but definitely manageable, and I would recommend it.",
    "FREN 150 is an excellent course, though the workload is a bit daunting - essay word count requirements get progressively larger as the semester goes on. You'll need to look ahead to keep up with your work, especially if you're balancing other work-intensive classes. You will learn a lot, though, because the works that you will study invite critical thinking and creative ways to say things in French.",
    "Very good course for after AP French. Reviews both grammar and writing, etc. Highly enjoyable.",
    "This class is a lot of work. There are five or six 3-4 page papers and smaller homework assignments every day. Despite the large amount of work though, the class is great and very rewarding if you have any interest in improving your speaker or writing in French. Madam Schneider is great! She is enthusiastic and very understanding.",
    "More analysis of texts and films than previous French courses. I was rather apathetic this semester but French was still rather enjoyable; Madame Schneider is always helpful and she knows French. If you're already comfortable with grammar and stuff then this isn't too much work, and the readings\/films are pretty fun.",
    "A lot of reading and watching films and speaking. I would recommend because it was interesting and fun and definitely helped my French substantially.",
    "French 150 is a valuable course to perfect your grammar before taking more advanced courses in the French department. I would highly recommend it, since most of the grammar work is done on your own so that you can discuss reading and films during class. It is a great deal of work though, so make sure you can keep up with it!"
