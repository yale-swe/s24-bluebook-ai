    "Linguistics majors, you have no choice. Muahahaha.",
    "Your experience with this course will greatly depend on your classmates and the professor that teaches it. The course helps you stay on track by requiring you to give three presentations on your senior essay. Everyone is very supportive and gives you positive feedback throughout the process.",
    "The linguistics senior essay is difficult, because it requires you to do rigorous original research pretty much on your own. Unlike science research, it requires an extensive writeup, while unlike humanities research, it requires a scientific style of analysis. It requires a lot of background reading, because most likely the classes you take prior to writing your senior essay will not cover all of the necessary theory. However, the advising is top notch. Since it is a small major, professors are extremely dedicated to the students they advise, and their help makes a huge difference. The process can be a frustrating one. Being uncertain all the time is pretty much what research is. In the end, though, it's an incredibly rewarding experience.As for the class itself, the format and formality of the class depends on who is teaching it. It is really great to get to see how your classmates are coming along and to pick their brains for ideas for your own essay. While you are all writing very different essays, it makes the process less lonely. In our class, we gave two 'progress report' presentations to the class before spring break, and then after spring break we gave a final, more polished presentation to the class and members of the department.Lastly, when it comes to getting your senior essay bound, Docuprint on Whitney is often cheaper and quicker than Tyco."
