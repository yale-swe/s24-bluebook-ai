    "This class is quite interesting, especially if you have interest in the medical sciences. Some lecturers are better than others, and your preference will likely depend on what your note-taking style is. Having a good TA seems to be very important for this class, but from what I could see, all the TAs seemed quite strong and good for the class. A load of information is covered and I think this class is the biggest challenge I've taken at Yale so far (moreso than orgo), but with intensive studying and working stuff out, I think doing alright in the class is possible. There are weekly quizzes which you can get full credit for if you go to the weekly sections (you should go to the sections anyway because they help A LOT), 2 midterms, and a final. This is a class that has caused a lot of anguish but I planned for this when I took it, so I advise other pre-meds to do the same - don't underestimate the amount of material you need to become proficient with to do well in this class. The actual workload in required assignments is not big at all, but a lot of studying needs to go into this class to do well.",
    "If you're taking this, it's probably required, but fret not! It's amazing. Tons of information for a 14 week period, but it's broken down into pretty manageable chunks. It's a great, great time.",
    "Have you ever wondered how your body works? This class answers that question.",
    "I would recommend this course, though if you're taking it it's probably because you have to so this doesn't really even matter.",
    "I wish I liked this course better than I did. Nevertheless, it is worth your time if you have the time.",
    "Survey course of all major human physiological systems. It's no surprise that this class covers a lot of material, and that it will take a lot of time to be able to get the most out of it and do really well in the class; that said, I so enjoyed a class that integrated human biology so well, and that brought in professors from all over Yale, including the medical school, to teach what they specialize in. Overall, I highly recommend the class to any student who is ready to make that time commitment.",
    "Take this class. It was described to me as one that will help you figure out whether youre more interested in science research or in medicine, and its true. The lecturers on the whole were all fantastic. I especially loved the renal system (Prof Aronson) and the endocrine system (Prof Holt). It is a decent amount of reading, but its all pretty interesting once you focus on what youre reading, and it goes along very well with the lectures. I used both the textbook and Constanzo. There are weekly quizzes but you get 100 on them if you attend section .",
    "A great course - if you are willing to put in the time. There is a constant barrage of information you have to digest quickly to keep up with the pace of the course, but it's well worth it in the end if you are thinking about BME grad school or med school later on. Dont overload though on other courses if you plan on taking this one!",
    "Physio is great! It's a bit like cell bio or biochem in that a lot of material comes at you at once but if you keep cool, study the slides, and listen in lecture it actually goes very easily. It's also very interesting and we cover a lot of topics. Medical or engineering applications are usually woven in. Exams are MC, T\/F, and SA but almost always easier than expected if you stick to reviewing slides\/lecture notes. Weekly quizzes are automatically made 100% if you go to section and are good practice for the SA so don't sweat them.",
    "I enjoyed this class. You learn a lot over the course of a semester, which is overwhelming at times, but ultimately rewarding. The weekly quizzes, which are annoying at times are quite helpful when studying for exams. They help to iron out concepts that may have seemed opaque in lecture. Additionally, I appreciated that you would receive full credit for the quizzes by simply going to section (and getting at least a 10\/20). The material though dense is useful and presented in a format that is both interesting and comprehendible.",
    "Physiological systems is an excellent overview of the nervous, cardiovascular, respiratory, skeletal, gastrointestinal, urinary, and endocrine systems! This course will teach you the mechanisms behind these systems and is a great way to enhance your understanding of the human body. I highly highly recommend this course - I feel that this may be the most well-taught course in the biology department. Professor Campbell is entertaining and enthusiastic and he followed by some incredible lecturers that are experts in their field at the medical school. If you are pre-med or think you might be pre-med take this class! Beware that you will have to review the material outside of lecture to make sure that you understand and are remembering important concepts. I think that you could easily spend 3-5 hours per week just reviewing material and completing the reading and the weekly pass\/fail quizzes. While the textbook pretty closely follows the lectures, it deviates and can get unnecessarily detailed at times. Definitely consider getting the Constanzo Physiology book that covers key concepts and important details. It is a very helpful supplement when trying to solidify class concepts in your mind.",
    "BME major here. If you're like me (or MCDB\/premed\/whatever) you're going to have to take this course. If not, this would probably be a rather enjoyable Credit\/D option provided that you put in the work and don't fail, obviously. That said here's some advice: 1) The textbook (Medical Physiology by Emile Boulpaep) is terrible and actually enormous. You will literally be shocked by its size (1300+ pages). Although I stupidly didn't do this, I highly recommend getting a shorter book of your choosing to provide a big picture view of the material as Boulpaep is simply too detailed. Also, the \"assigned\" readings are unnecessary. 2) Take good notes in lecture. Like I mean don't slack off and browse Facebook or imgur or whatever you use to kill time. This will save you a lot of trouble in the long run when you're studying. 3) Unless you have a crazy good memory, and I by crazy good I mean you can remember the third word of the hundredth page of your eighth grade history textbook, start studying for midterms a good week before. There is an incredible amount of information to synthesize and memorize, and I guarantee you that you will not be able to sufficiently remember everything in two days. You'll learn a great deal in this course and you'll get as much as you put in. Good luck!",
    "Phyiology is a fascinating course and, in my opinion, an important one to take if you're pre-med. At the end of the semester, you've learned an incredible amount of information and have gained a profound appreciation for the intricate balance of processes that allows us to live and interact with the world. It's definitely a challenging course, but that's what makes it rewarding!",
    "This class is great for premed students, however it is difficult...extremely difficult. The amount of material presented in this class is honestly ridiculous and in my opinion should be illegal however, the tornado like pace of he class gives a complete (if not a little patchy) understanding of how the different systems of the human body function. When i first enrolled in this class, i was advised to do all of the reading, or at least that it was important to do so. I have no idea if other students were able to do all of the reading, but I know for me it was physically impossible, there were just too many pages. I think you can still gain a pretty solid understanding of the material by using the book as a reference for material asked about on the weekly quizzes and going over the specific pages or chapters mentioned during lecture.",
    "BENG 350 is a lot of work, but is a lot of fun if you are interested in physiology. I learned a lot, and enjoyed the learning. It's just really cool to know how intricate your own body is. Take it, but expect a lot of work and studying for the exams.",
    "I would recommend this class. There is a ton of information to learn, but it is very interesting and presented in an organized manner. If you like physiology then go ahead and take the class.",
    "If you like bio, then I would recommend it. You definitely learn a lot, but it is also a ton of work, and you can definitely work your butt off and still not do well.",
    "Lecturers were hot and cold. As a result, some systems were well taught while others required outside reading to really understand. The readings are very thorough but SUPER long and tedious. If you actually do them all from the assigned textbook (rather than a review book like BRS), you'll do very well in this class. Otherwise, the curve is quite tough.",
    "A HUGE amount of information. I have never taken a class that made me feel more overwhelmed. But I learned SO much about the human body and all the organ systems. Most of the professors present jumbled and unclear slides with ridiculous amounts of information. Holt was the best professor and presented info very clearly, although her lectures, like all the others, were jam-packed with info.",
    "Physio is a great overview of many major body systems. It is fascinating material and I would definitely recommend if you have time to devote in your schedule.",
    "Be prepared to work and take this class Credit D. There is so much material that by the end of it all, it's really overwhelming. That said, this class is super rewarding, and the lecturers are outstanding.",
    "This is a great class to take, the topic material is interesting and it is well taught across the board by all of its instructors. Furthermore the TAs will help make this class even more clear and overall I had an enjoyable time. Be warned that this class does take a lot of time and I was studying upwards of 30 hours for each midterm. Other than that quizzes are fine given that full credit is given with section attendance.",
    "Physiology was the most challenging but also most rewarding class I've taken here at Yale. So much material is covered, but I feel like so much of it is new and fascinating. Stuart Campbell is great at organizing the course, and it's really interesting how it's a rotation of professors teaching the different topics - each professor has his\/her own strengths and weaknesses, but it's always refreshing to see a new face and hear a new voice giving a lecture. Out of all the classes I've taken at Yale, this class used section the most usefully - I always felt so much more positive about the course coming out of section each week due to the material we'd go over. I've really liked this class and I would recommend it to every biology major and pre-med, but I would hesitate to recommend it beyond this category of people, simply because it is a very difficult course that you will have to work hard in.",
    "Physio is a lot of work. Like a lot. Not in actual assignments that you have to turn in, but there is so much material to learn that you have to spend a lot of time studying it. That said, it is really an amazing class if you have the time and energy to devote to it. I would definitely recommend it if you're interested in the material and are willing to work really hard. You really end up learning so much!",
    "This class was excellent. It was one of the most interesting courses I've taken so far at Yale, and all of the professors were engaging and obviously experts in their respective fields. The class was definitely challenging and the density of material was a bit overwhelming at times. Some lecturers were better than others, but overall there was nothing to complain about. The amount of time spent on each respective system was a bit disproportionate, but by the end you do get a great sense of the human body overall. Tests were definitely very difficult, even though half of the tests were multiple choice and true\/false. Going to section was so helpful and one of the things I looked forward to the most in the week.",
    "Too much information.",
    "Good class. Tons of work. if you want to do well you have to either find a way to keep up with the readings (aka don't do any work for other classes) or find a way to get the material without having to do the full readings (aka take really good notes or ask your TA for really good notes).",
    "A well-taught class that gives you a taste of biology beyond AP biology, as such as in medical school. I would recommend it to another student, and would also tell him\/her to come prepared to invest a lot of time into going over lectures and understanding concepts covered only once in class. The class can be stressful because of the enormous material we are responsible for, but learning how to manage workload is an experience that is good for anyone. Reading the textbook is not necessary really, expect to understand the gist of diagrams\/images in lecture slides.",
    "BENG 350 is a lot of fun and a lot of information! You probably won't need the textbook except to answer some quiz questions, because it contains much more information than you need to know. The grading policy for quizzes (which are basically just weekly five-question homework assignments) is very lenient (full points if you attend section). I would recommend this class to anyone who likes biology, with the exception of people with poor memory, because a lot of memorization goes into taking the tests.",
    "Take the course. It is challenging and dense, but so so so interesting and rewarding.",
    "DEFINITELY TAKE THIS CLASS. REALLY. Especially if you're premed because it's SO relevant to being a doctor. You study from a medical school text book and learn from all these different amazing professors. Overall, this class has genuinely been one of my favorite classes at Yale, if not my most favorite. The material, although often complicated and a lot to handle, is very interesting and I would not change anything. Despite complaints that I've heard about Boron as the main textbook for the class being way too dense, I feel that it is okay because I tend to skip the extra detail and really focus on only the important key points. When there's something I don't understand, I find the diagram in the book and read up on it. I also think the quizzes are great. They really do help you to keep up with the material. I also found the case studies in the discussion sessions very interesting. Overall - it's a AWESOME class! It's been such a privilege to attend lectures given by extraordinary professors. In terms of improvement, I think this course could still do a lot better in terms of linking the different organ systems together and how they interact with one another. For example, I would have loved to know more about how the heart and kidney function together. Furthermore, this class seems to expect a lot of \"learning on your own\" type of studying because there's simply not enough time during the lectures to thoroughly go through important concepts that are difficult to grasp. Towards the end of the lectures when concepts get more complicated, there's also a tendency to rush because time is running out which does not help. So I feel timing is also something that could be improved on - really designating more time on the more challenging slides. Last thing I want to say is I feel that because this class demands so much time and effort, and that everybody in the class is so smart, more people should get A's :) This class is known for being difficult to achieve an A.",
    "Really interesting class. A ton of material but if you study hard you will be good. TAs and Profs are really helpful as well.",
    "hard class",
    "A ton of information but also very interesting. I would only take it if you are really interested in physiology, studying for the MCAT or it is necessary for the major.",
    "I highly recommend this course to pre-meds and anyone who is interested in learning about the human body. I don't think I have ever learned so much information in one semester, but they were all very interesting. However, to do well in the class, it is necessary to keep up with the lecture material. It can be a very time consuming class, depending on the amount of reading and studying you do. The questions on the exams were fair. If you study well for the exams, you can do well in the class.",
    "If you really want to learn about physiology this is a fantastic class for you to take. As a junior, I can say that Its definitely one of the best taught science courses here at Yale. The only thing that I would be wary about is that this class is a lot of work. It's a small introduction to needed to learn large volumes of information and integrating that knowledge to solve medical questions. If you put in the time, work, and effort you will do great! Don't be too scared by the textbook, it's big but it should be used as a reference for concept clarification and supplementary information. If you are not a premed or a science major, this class probably isn't for you.",
    "I think that this class is a great course. You will have to memorize a lot of information, but if you find it interesting it would not be a problem.",
    "This was a good class but some professors weren't that great. Overall, I liked it.",
    "This class covers very interesting topics, but can get confusing at times because of all the guest lecturers. It can be hard getting used to all the different teaching styles.",
    "If you are interested in medicine, biology, or want to know why the study of biology requires physics and chemistry take this class. It is challenging but fair, offers a lot of interesting material, and compiles it in a way that I honestly feel I will retain well beyond college.",
    "It's a lot of work but I recommend it.",
    "Absolutely take this class! It's been described as med school lite and if that interests you, then you'll find physiological systems to be one of your favorite classes this semester. The TAs are great (get Max or Amanda if you can) and prepare to do some serious studying before the midterms and final.",
    "Physiological systems was the best pre-med course I have ever taken at Yale, hands-down. It is also the most \"pre-med\" class I have ever taken and should be taken by every pre-medical student at Yale. It covers ever aspect of the human body, in depth, from the cell to the whole body levels. I came out of this class learning more about the human body than I thought I would ever know and the professors to the class are phenomenal. You will be learning from some of the best physiologists - both doctors and researchers - that Yale has to offer. Prof. Campbell is an outstanding professor who did an awesome job his first year. Beware though that there is a large amount of material that is required for you to learn to do well in this course, so do not take it if you plan on putting off the work.",
    "Physiological systems is a great course where you learn about how the body works. The amount of actual workload is pretty average as it involves a 5 questions homework assignment quiz every week. However, the amount of material that is covered during the semester is incredible. It helps if you can find some classmates to review class material directly after class or something, because you go through a lot. Section was interesting because the TA's went through medical case studies that incorporated information we learned in class rather than simply regurgitating what we discussed in lecture. There is a different professor for every organ system we cover and you will enjoy some more than others. I personally thought that the kidney and adrenal gland lectures were the clearest for me. Also, really important, I would not recommend getting the textbook for this class. I did all the reading assignments at the beginning of the semester and I feel that they hurt me on the first midterm because there is so much information on them that it is very easy to confuse different topics. The textbook is so dense that it has its on event horizon (bum dum tsk-nerdy joke). Be sure to enjoy the material and not stress out too much about grades if you are taking the class!",
    "Great class if you want to learn a lot about the human body and are willing to put the time into it.",
    "Physio is a great advanced bio course where you study the physiological systems. The professors are great, and and you come out of the class with a good foundation for understanding physiology and anatomy in general. The course includes quite a bit of reading, but it does help with understanding the material. Make sure you stay on top of it! Overall, this has been one of my favorite bio electives, and I highly recommend the course to all interested.",
    "Yes, take it. You learn SO MUCH.",
    "Physio is one of the best bio classes at Yale. The material is always interesting and engaging because nearly every process you study has direct clinical applicationsand once you know the fundamentals of each organ system, explaining different bodily functions and responses becomes a fun logic exercise. Make no mistake, the material is pretty toughthe textbook is literally the biggest book you will ever buy, and it's the same one that Yale medical students use for first-year anatomy\/physiology. But the grading and expectations are actually very fair in this class. You take an online quiz at home once a week, and as long as you score above 50% and go to section, you get full credit. Other than that, there are just the exams, which are all pretty hard, but they're a mix of multiple choice, true-false, and free response, and for the most part they are very straightforward logic and big-picture questions. In any case, they do not expect you to learn (or read) the whole textbook. I suggest you buy Constanzo's Physiology book, which is MUCH shorter and simpler and hits all the points you need. You can keep the real textbook on hand for when you need to look up complicated figures and things.",
    "BENG 350 is a comprehensive course in physiology that is interesting, challenging, and overall amazing. The semester is split up into modules that focus on different body systems. Each system is taught by a different professor. This year, all of the professors (except one who taught respiration) were PHENOMENAL. They were so knowledgeable, so eloquent, and so approachable. Coming to class at 9AM becomes harder as the semester wears on but trust me, going to class, reading the material and studying for midterms really does pay off. You learn so much about the human body and when pieces of the puzzle from various other classes start to fit together (i.e. concepts from physics, biology, orgo, etc.), it really is an unparalleled feeling of awesomeness. Some tips: Never. stop. reading. The reading assignments may seem daunting and though that may be a sign to start reading easier texts (i.e. you'll probably hear about a review book people use instead of the huge B&B textbook), at least try to read the chapter titles and headings for each chapters before\/after class. Those really help solidify understanding of the material and after all, those large concepts are what are ultimately tested on the exams. If you want to do well in the course, it would behoove you to read, read, and read some more. Use B&B for figures!",
    "Literally no idea why people say this is a good class. It probably has to do with the fact that they spend hours and hours of their lives being miserable over it so that the only way they can justify it was to say that they enjoyed it.",
    "BENG350 is a really tough class - probably the hardest I've taken at Yale. There is a TON of content and if you don't stay on top of the reading it will come back to get you. That being said I learned a lot in this class and it was especially helpful to take right before the MCAT. I would recommend you take it, but don't expect to get an A.",
    "Huge amount of work. But a proportional amount of learning.",
    "Great class. It's a ton of work, though the reading isn't necessary, except for the reproductive biology section.",
    "It is very difficult to keep everything in order! Come prepared to learn a lot, forget all of it, and then cram for the final.",
    "There is an incredible amount of information, but the class is essentially just two midterms and a final because the weekly quizzes are bumped to full credit if you go to section. Therefore, you have to study a ton for those individual tests, but little else.",
    "Fascinating, especially if you're going into medicine. Work hard.",
    "Difficult class-you need to devote a lot of time.",
    "This course is a really cool look at systems in the body. Even if it isn't required for you, it's worth a look at. I had to take it, but it is easily one of my favorite courses that I have taken at Yale.",
    "I don't know if physio was the hardest class I've ever taken at Yale, but it was probably the one that I got the lowest grade in. You will learn a lot in lectures and from readings (and yes, you need to read), but for the tests you will need to know a huge amount of information. They tell you the tests are not based on rote memorization, which is true, but the test questions expect you to know the facts cold and often will try to trip you up. That being said, everything taught in the class was really cool, and I feel like I could've done better had I applied myself more. Take this class if you love organ systems, want to learn a LOT, and don't really care about your grade. (unfortunately if you're looking at this class you are probably a premed, in which case, tough.)",
    "I would recommend 350 to any student who is interested in a deeper inside look at what's happening in the body. Don't expect an easy time though. There is a LOT of information but if you focus on what's in the lectures that's the most important. You will need a lot of time to even digest that though. DO NOT GET BEHIND.",
    "If you have had no prior exposure to physiology it moves really quickly. To be honest, I wouldn't even bother reading B&B. Turn to it only if you want to clarify things that were on the slides. Exams consist of mostly slide information so study those well.",
    "Yes, I would. It is a great pre-med class.",
    "It is a great biology class that if you want to learn about biology in a new way based on mathematical and physical concepts that are applied at a small then large level you should take it.",
    "I would. Great course taught by great teachers. Difficult but understandable so. Worth the struggle",
    "All pre-meds should take this course because I think it's good to be exposed to physiological systems before medical school courses. I didn't think the course was very well taught because there was simply too much information for a semester and for 50-minute lectures three times a week. Some systems were better taught (renal, endocrine) than others (respiratory). In order to get the most out of the class, it's imperative to read the textbook, which is very well-written but also very dense, so reading it is time consuming. Also, it seemed as though the midterms and final often drew material more from the reading than lecture, which was annoying because there's already an abundant source of lecture material that can be tested.",
    "Physio is an amazing class that is a must-take class at Yale!! Honestly, you will walk away from the class with so much more knowledge about the human body and physiological systems. You will also just be amazed at how intricate the body is. If you are pre-med, this is the class that you should take if you want a head start on medical school. Although this is a great class, it is not an easy one. You really need to put in the hard work to do well in this class. You dont necessarily need to read all of the assigned pages in the very dense book (unless you really love reading that material), but you do need to read up on pages associated with figures included in the power points. I would recommend this class to anyone interested in the human body and willing to put in work for this class! THIS IS NOT A GUT CLASS. But really, take this as a real class, you wont regret it!",
    "Yes definitely take this course, especially if you need a 350+ course for the MCDB major. The class is definitely very challenging and takes up a lot of your time. However, the amount of material you learn in a semester is pretty amazing. I now know so much more than I had ever thought I could learn about the human body and there is a lot of clinical applications also for the premeds.",
    "This was an interesting course for me as a student pursuing medicine. I learned a fairly large amount about the functioning characteristics of many of the body's systems and what happens to the body when some aspects fail. It was a good preview to the material in different fields of medicine. This class provides a good foundation in physiology which will be beneficial to any student interested, and particularly useful for those pursuing medicine. I would recommend it.",
    "If you're going into any field which involves the human body, take this course. It's really well put together, a lot of volume but all stuff you should know. Go to section, use the giant monster book as a reference as much as you need to.",
    "Do it. I'm a bio major and have taken a lot of bio classes but this one is by far my favorite. Don't let the book intimidate you. As long as you pay close attention in lecture and take the quizzes seriously, you'll be fine. Don't let the size of B&B book scare you. Find a pdf.",
    "A really interesting class if you plan to do something Bio-related. I switched majors half-way through the semester, and dropped the class. I really found the exams very difficult. Although I put in hours upon hours in preparation, I came away from the exams feeling as if I had to guess on a lot of the questions. I think this is just a result of physiology being such an immense topic."
