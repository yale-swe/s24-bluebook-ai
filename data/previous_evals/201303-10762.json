    "If you're looking for an \"easy language credit\" this might not be the class for you. I wrote more in this class than I did for my English writing class. However, if you're looking to improving your reading\/writing skills before going abroad or taking a 300-level course here, you definitely should. I enjoyed it, and it's super helpful to take before tackling the Spanish major full-force.",
    "Absolutely recommended!! Prof. Byrne is absolutely phenomenal and really wants the students to learn. Ours was a small class, about 10 people, so we all really bonded with one another and with her. The reading is really engaging and it's awesome to feel yourself improve exponentially with your skills. Good class to take if you're coming into L5 classes for the first time and aren't very comfortable with your skills, it's not an unreasonable workload and the professor really helps you learn. It's intense spanish lit, be ready for that, but it's well worth the effort when it's all done because you really do improve.",
    "This is a great class. Take it if you can!Taking SPAN 250 is a great way to really hone your writing skills in Spanish and to develop analytical skills applicable for both English and Spanish literature. Professor Byrne is a really supportive professor who is always accessible by e-mail and provides valuable suggestions\/edits both during the writing process and afterwards (you submit a first draft and then a revised draft for each assignment, except for the final paper). She's also friendly and approachable, which was great considering the amount of freshmen who take this course.Class is mostly discussion of the texts and the general messages\/theme of the texts, though sometimes we focus on grammar and writing strategies at the beginning of class before delving into the text.The only weakness of this class is that I didn't work on my speaking skills as I had in previous L5 Spanish classes. However, I felt like I definitely improved on my writing and reading skills. In terms of which order to go in, I would recommend taking Advanced Conversation Spanish or another L5 class that stresses speaking before taking this one.",
    "I took Span 250 just because I wanted to keep up with my Spanish--didn't need the credit or anything--and I'm glad I did. The class really improved my ability to write in Spanish, and although the increasing lengths of the papers proved difficult, I feel pretty empowered to write more in Spanish after getting through them. Professor Byrne is WONDERFUL. She is so warm and understanding. Class is very organized and you always know what's expected of you. Workload isn't bad: a few papers over the course of the semester, and then weekly readings that get longer\/more complex as you go but are also usually good, and the occasional grammar and comprehension quiz. Discussion was really relaxed, and Prof. Byrne led it very enthusiastically, which was great. The last story we read, by Cervantes, was tough after reading pretty much only post-1900 works all semester, but if it stays on the syllabus you'll survive. I definitely recommend this class, que viva Soan 250!!!",
    "Yes, great class! Borges is so interesting!",
    "Totally. Very low stress, great writing practice, and minus the pressure of constant quizzes and the burden of focused grammar exercises. The stories are funky and unusual. However, some choices seemed odd, and perhaps weren't so successful. Extremely tiny workload; the short stories are super breezy. The monografias were a new experience for me, and by the end of the semester, I wrote over 12 pages in Spanish - which I honestly never thought achievable! CAVEAT: in-class analysis was never very deep, and we didn't learn about Latin American\/Spanish literary history at all, which is unfortunate. I wish the stories were sequenced more logically (either chronologically or thematically)."
