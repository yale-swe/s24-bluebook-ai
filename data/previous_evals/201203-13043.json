   "comments": [
    "I'd summarize the class by saying it's poorly taught, has dry material, and is one that you will come out of not having learned much, use one of your credits for another class, this is a huge waste of your time and energy. Mountains of reading coupled with boring lectures that are mandatory to attend will make you wish you never took this class",
    "I would recommend it if you want to learn about India and especially about a developing and non-western country's economy. Gives a great perspective on India-the good and the bad. A mid-term paper and a take-home final so it's light on the workload. A bit boring though but I'd still recommend it.",
    "No",
    "I would summarize econ 211 as a solid option for global affairs\/econ students. Not very difficult, and not very interesting.",
    "A solid introduction to India's economic system and history. Highly recommend.",
    "You probably can't, anyway, but here are my emotions:I don't have very fond feelings towards the course. Sadly, the class has so much more potential than was exercised.1. Great, impressive professor - Prof Mohan's accomplishments should make half of Yale want to take this course.2. Good TAs - I don't know about Divya, but Ashutosh was really helpful and brilliant at connecting the dots.3. Topic - probably the most interesting of our century regardless of what field you want to get into.4. 0 work. Yes, you could do all the readings, but then you would just read 4 different economists' interpretations (funnily enough, all the same) of the effect of interest rate deregulation. You could also do none of the readings and still get an A-. Probably even an A if you spend more than 2 hours on your midterm and final. We talked a lot about efficiency but the syllabus of the class was potentially the least efficient way to impart information to someone that I've ever encountered outside of communicating solely with emoticons.probably any good will I have towards this course derives entirely from 2 and 3. While Professor Mohan was very nice and accommodating, I thought that the lectures were entirely too oversimplified and repetitive. It felt like taking an Intro Macro class that was formulated as a case study of India. Although this class likely won't be taught again as Professor Mohan is leaving for the IMF, I think that he would do well to make it MORE not less rigorous. I think everyone would be fine with some boring moments if they felt that they were getting immense amounts of knowledge from it; however, it felt like the same procedure with each section - talk about pre1991 stagnation, post1991 reforms (which were all liberalization), where india can be in 2030, and how much corruption sucks. Given that there is no dearth of conversations to be had on India, I think the syllabus should be totally revamped.Grading was fine for the midterm, but absolutely no feedback was given, so that could be changed in the future. Also unclear how section participation will be graded as at no point did Ashutosh take attendance after the first section.",
    "The class provides a great overview on the economic performance and challenges of India. It helps to have a background on the economic history of the country although this is not necessary. It was frustrating however, that the structure of the class was very loose in that a lot of issues were covered over and over again as part of different topics. Rakesh Mohan provides an insider's perspective on the issues covered, although this view was at times sugar-glazed. I would recommend this course if you have a very strong interest in the Indian subcontinent.",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone looking for a reading\/writing-based rather than problem-set based econ class, or anyone who wants to look in depth at a case study rather than learning more theory. Professor Mohan was not the most dynamic lecturer ever, but as a former (and now resumed) technocrat, he provided an invaluable inside perspective on everything we learned about. At times, lectures seemed a little repetitive, but overall I feel I learned a lot about India's economy and about the challenges of newly industrialized economies in general. The workload was also extremely manageable - weekly readings (often redundant with lecture), a midterm essay, and a final.",
    "This is an important class that hopefully will still get taught once Prof. Mohan leaves.",
    "Yes I would if you are interesting in India; having some prior knowledge about India would help you appreciate the course better though.",
    "It's probably not worth taking this course unless they restructure it significantly. The topic of the course is an interesting and professor Mohan (not sure if he'll be teaching it again) was very kind and he's a big deal as an individual. However the course was kind of disorganized and very very repetitive and lectures were often long and boring. Although the workload is not big, the assignments themselves were annoying; a 15 paper in the middle of the semester and a one-day take home 6-essay 'final assignment'. Sometimes rather than looking at India specifically this course just discussed general macro concepts in vague and uninteresting ways. Shop it for a few classes and decide if you want to take it or not.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to every student",
    "I would recommend it if you are really interested about India. There is a lot of reading to do compared to other classes, so I guess that only people who are really interested in India would find it worth keeping up with the reading. Although it is an economics class it doesn't have a lot to do with numbers or calculations."
