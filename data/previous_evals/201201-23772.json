   "comments": [
    "TAKE IT! It was amazing and it will give you a unique insight on so many new areas of the world, and the professor is awesome. Also, if you only do it for one class in all of your four years, go to his office hours!",
    "I would recommend this course to another student.",
    "Yes absolutely.",
    "Absolutely, if you're interested in policy and the area.",
    "Absolutely take this course- Graham is great.",
    "U.S., Russia, and Eurasia Security is a great class for people who both want to gain skills in assessing world issues from multiple countries' perspectives or who have prior interest in any of the countries (especially Russia and Central Asia countries) discussed in the class. Since the class incorporates so many topics, whether it be China's economic growth, Iran and North Korea's nuclear programs, or Central Asia's pipelines, each week's readings are very distinct and leave you with a foundation for understanding the key global issues.",
    "I would say the course is probably the best policy course at all, even if you are not interested in Russia, because he manages to get you to think well beyond the prism of US mindset.",
    "Yes! A great way to study US-Russian politics, looking at a lot of areas you don't typically study in that context.",
    "Yes.",
    "A survey of regional security issues along Russia's periphery, as seen from both Russian and American perspectives. In two words: great class.",
    "US, Russia and Eurasian Security looks at US policy towards Russia vis-a-vis all the regions which border it. It's an incredibly fun class if you like debating foreign policy and examining different American strategies for the 21st Century. Professor Graham is great to work with. The course certainly changed my views on Russia."
