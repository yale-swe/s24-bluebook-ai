    "we haven't gone on any field trips yet, so I could not comment on that",
    "I thought the majority of the best content was rushed into the first half of the semester (pre-midterm) and could have been spaced better. the second half felt repetetive, and i wished that we could have gone into more depth on some of the topics covered quickly during the first half (fire effects, etc)",
    "The first half of the course was excellent. Full of very relevant information. It seemed to sort of taper off after the midterm. Though both the TA and the professor were responsive to student interest.",
    "I couldn't go to the prescribed fire due to a scheduling conflict.I think the readings should be better integrated into the classes. The discussion sections were held twice a semester and that was the main way the readings were integrated into the class. That's not enough from my experience.I think the Science part of the class is much stronger than the Policy part of the class. Ann is a scientist and her strength is on the science side. Strengthening the policy part of the class would include giving students better analytical tools for assessing policy and policy making. There's not enough rigor in the presentation of the history, nor conceptual richness in discussing how policy is made.",
    "The readings were often not posted until the night before class or even the day of. This made it very difficult to plan ahead and get the reading completed.",
    "#9: I think there ought to be field trips for this class and some kind of lab in which we can engage in the incident command system process.",
    "This is a key class - fire is an enormously important component of forest management. The instructor was very much willing to incorporate student interests into the curriculum, which was appreciated. The prescribed burn was hugely important for a learning experience and it would have been great to have another field trip - to the CT DEP fire fighting division, or other active operation, or to see a site burned at varying times over the years."

   "comments": [
    "the open structure. the fire topics really lend themselves to discussion, so student discussion is important",
    "This is the only class where MFs can get any real exposure to USFS Forest policy in this country. I am glad I took it as a result of this exposure but that seems odd to have to take a fire class to gain that.",
    "Ann's experience in the Forest Service and work around fire in the interior West are the strengths of the class.",
    "- Brings out the significance of technical scientific knowledge about fire.- Great real-life examples- Interactive discussions",
    "I enjoyed the presentations from FES students that had experience in fire (Cam Moore, Jason Lawhon, Charlie Mumford). They knew a lot about the subject and really added to the class.",
    "The western focus.",
    "A lot of the direction of the course was left in the hands of the student. There is no over-arching answers to questions of fire policy. A basic understanding of fire science was covered in the first half of the course, and then the second half of course allowed students to explore, discuss and engage in policy topics and questions. The professor provided guidance and experience, but the students were encouraged to explore and make the learning our own. Very effective.",
    "The special guests and hearing their personal insight.",
    "The instructor's flexibility, passion and knowledge about the subject. Good readings and involvement of students in the class."

   "comments": [
    "the syllabus and course plan could be clear. similarly, the exam itself could have been clearer.",
    "Pace of the semester and covering material",
    "Better structure and building of the material presented.",
    "See above (policy).",
    "More examples from the tropics",
    "Structure. The first half was well structured, but after that it sort of went by the wayside.",
    "Timely posting of readings, slightly more structure.",
    "The student discussions were fruitful. Continued efforts to encourage these and facilitate such exchanges would be highly valuable. The guest lectures were wonderful, and I understand scheduling is also problematic, but the course would benefit from grouping these immediately following the fire science\/behavior lectures so that the last several weeks of the course could be all student discussions regarding all we have been exposed to.",
    "The class should involve some written assignments beyond the final paper - a short evaluation of a wildfire, or prescribed burn composed from literature, problem sets involving scenarios, ICS and fuel calculations, or a computer model that helped understand the dynamics of wind and fire behavior."

I didn't expect to learn so much from their insight. I also enjoyed finding out how our school's history ties in with the history of the Forest Service.",
