    "I would strongly recommend this course to other students. I am so happy that Yale teaches the philosophical foundations of law to its law school students. The class was filled with international students, which I loved. I feel like I gained so much from their perspectives. But, I was a little disappointed that there were not more JD students in the class. I think they would gain so much from the course."
