We did a lot of context based vocabulary learning and grammar, and read interesting texts, including important works by Kafka and Drrenmatt. The topics that we discussed in the class were very engaging, and applicable to the real world (refugee crisis in Germany, German expressionism and Bauhaus, politics etc.)."
