   "comments": [
    "Modern Indian History is a really interesting class, and I'd definitely recommend it. Dr. Desai was a great teacher and very approachable. I only wish that the course covered more of the postcolonial period.",
    "For a ROW credit, it's not too painful, especially credit\/D - Marathon take home midterm and 15 page final paper.",
    "Good class covering lots of Indian history--great, enthusiastic teacher--only drawback is that it can often get very lofty and away from actual events to discussions about how we can know and understand things at all, which for me took away from the naturally interesting subject matter",
    "Great class. India is a lens onto so much: democracy, empire, religion and politics, history and historiography, nationalism, violence, gender, etc etc etcIt was somewhere between a lecture and a seminar for us-- which might be different if more people took it in the future. But Prof. Desai expected everyone to come to class prepared and participate. So its not the kind of lecture you can goof off in too much",
    "A very ethereal course in history. Great for cultural history enthusiasts, not great for \"great men\" history enthusiasts.",
    "If you think learning about important people, places, dates, and other facts is an annoying distraction from a pure and abstract study of gender constructs or \"imperial forms of knowledge,\" then you will love this class. If, on the other hand, you want to gain a practicable understanding of today's India - its geography, culture, languages, religion, politics, great figures, military power, or any other non-post-modern facet of historical description - you'll probably do better by reading the Wikipedia article. Prof. Desai is energetic, charismatic, accessible, and downright fun. However, he comes to lecture with virtually no lesson plan, provides very little structure to the course, and essentially runs the class like a freshman year midnight bull session. The highlight was playing cricket on old campus.",
    "Superb intro to the dos equis of countries. 400 year timeline and a prof who gets that history is a whole lot more than dates means your hitting the most relevant themes. Dr desai, who is super young, energetic, and approachable, makes sure to keep showing how British colonialism is relevant to India and Pakistan today. Small class means that it feels like you get 45 min of lecture and then a solid seminar discussion.",
    "You need to take this course if you are interested in History at all. Or a course by Prof Desai in general. The man can make things relevant that dont seem so. Though sometimes he had no lesson plan for the day and the discussion went around in circles, he was able to finally give a coherent argument for the day. He is very open to talking, and welcomes students to his office hours. Overall, just a boss - you will like this guy. It was tough to stay motivated to do the readings for the course itself, and most of them I didn't do. However, the primary source stuff and the Other Side of Silence book were all gems - he really dug up some fantastic material. I wish I did more of the reading - that's my advice to anyone who takes this course.",
    "Yes, take it if you are interested in a survey of South Asian History, and want to explore the subject from different points of view. The reading can get heavy, but the professor is understanding. The Mid Term worth 30% was short answers, but involved a decent amount of reading and his grading was a bit strict. The final paper comprises 50% of the grade, and it can consume your life, but if you're interested in the topic you choose, it is quitesatisfying.",
    "Modern Indian History is a very good course that will only get better with time. In this year's incarnation, the course took the form of a lecture-discussion; there was not really a narrative lecture component, but rather a back-and-forth betweenprofessor and students on fundamental and broad topics of historical inquiry (with the history of India, of course, being the focal point). Prof. Desai brought commendable energy and dedication to the classroom. If you are interested in India, or history, or both, definitely check out this course."
