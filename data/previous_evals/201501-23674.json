    "Questions 8-10: Jim is obviously a busy professional with a lot going on. It's difficult to expect him to be easy to get a hold of if there are questions or issues on projects, but he was difficult to get a hold of even through email (especially through email). When we had guest speakers, it would have been more productive to have been able to have a conversation with them and\/or listen to their presentations rather than listen to Jim extrapolate for 20 minutes on something they mentioned. Certainly, giving more detail or information can be helpful, but I find continuously interrupting a speaker who's giving a presentation to be unprofessional and rude (for example: one of our guest speakers was interrupted no less than four times throughout her presentation for several minutes each time).",

    "The practical experience and networking opportunities you can gain in this course are incredible and I'm not sure any other course at F&ES can offer anything quite like this opportunity. And you also get to produce something tangible that is useful for someone.",
    "The field trip and getting an inside look at how Washington works was very useful.",
    "The client project was an excellent learning experience and helped me to make connections within the project's field. The class especially taught students time management and how to take initiative. The clients themselves were also eager to work with the students and very constructive throughout the semester.",
    "Being accessible to so many people who had a lot of experience on environmental policy in Washington, D.C."

   "comments": [
    "More opportunity to have some real discussion during class time could have been useful.",
    "The slides and lectures should be 1) more advanced 2) more organized. The client project should also have more directed content if possible, but that is largely up to the client to provide, not the instructor.",
    "The instructors commitment to the course, and their consequent organization of and intention toward coherent pedagogy and learning objectives.",
    "The client projects must be finalized sooner. All three projects suffered because there was very little time for analysis after data had been collected. Also, expectations for the course should be made explicit throughout the semester. Most students believed the supplemental documents (memo, talking points, etc.) were not going to be assigned since they were never mentioned between the first day of class and the end of the semester.",
    "The professor was often inaccessible, which is understandable because he's very busy for his Interior Department job in Washington. Also--perhaps it would be better to survey the students of their level of understanding for basic government knowledge before the course is taught. I say this because I think a lot of us in the course already knew the judicial, executive and legislative branches and their policy processes. Perhaps we could have used that time to focus more on case studies within the branches on natural resource management issues instead of going over the basic knowledge of them."

    "Our group worked together well and produced a great product. The biggest advantage is that you can divide and conquer most of the work, and with a smaller group like the ones we had, it's easier to make sure the work is divided evenly and that everybody is committed to doing their part. Strongly differing opinions on a given issue can be a problem, but we were able to resolve most of those. Like any relationship, there has to be give and take.",
    "The group project was good and was an effective way to learn about federal policymaking.",
    "This course taught me just how much work a group is capable of doing in a very short period of time. Since the projects were finalized so late, and the client agreements finalized even later, groups essentially did an entire research project in two months. On the plus side, this will be an experience I can point to when talking with employers about working under pressure. However, the intensity of the end of the semester was not expected and could have been avoided with better up-front planning. My group's members worked very well together, and I had a very positive experience working with the clients. In the future, I would suggest that project team size be more proportional to the difficulty of the project.",

    "This is an extremely valuable course to take if you have any interest in this field at all. The key for getting the most out of this course may be having clients that genuinely care about the project and being prepared to work on something you might not think you know anything about (yet!).",
    "Pick a project on something you don't know anything about. The learning is very fast but helpful and the client interactions are very valuable.",
    "Take this class if there is a project that you are very interested in. The focus of the course is entirely on the project, so if a project can help you connect with people you may want to work with\/for in the future, the course is extremely worthwhile. If the project is less in line with your career goals, the exercise loses most of its value. Be prepared to spend your Spring Break working on this project.",
    "Make sure you believe in the project that you are working on, and it will help you a lot since that's what you'll be spending most of the time on. You can also propose projects in advance, so try to rally some other students on a topic that interests you."
