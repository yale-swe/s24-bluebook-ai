    "This course imparted an excellent way of thinking about American politics and citizenship rooted both in theory and real political history. It surprised me the degree to which this course expanded both my theoretical and practical ideas about politics in our country.",
    "This class is an amazing introduction to the institutions that make up our country. I learned to look at our democracy in new ways and focus my thinking around new topics. I also loved the field trips... talk about making political friendships!",
    "This class does a great job of creating powerful discussions about political philosophy.",
    "Gained a tremendous appreciation for both foundational and modern political theory."

   "comments": [
    "Field trips and class discussions were huge strengths. Prof. Fotos also did a great job of preparing readings with memos and changing the syllabus according to our interests.",
    "The class provides a wide variety of topics, many of which are unique to Professor Fotos's life experience and personal input.",
    "It could have more opportunities for feedback during the course",
    "Professor Fotos is the course's greatest strength. He's a remarkably sharp and approachable teacher. He facilitated some truly memorable discussions.",
    "This course's strengths: Professor Fotos (a kind and insightful professor), the reading list (a broad range of texts from Tocqueville to MLK Jr.), the field trips (engaging hands-on look into American military institutions). This course's weaknesses: broad scope (the course focus is defined very vaguely, and it is often unclean immediately what the mission of the course is), some readings reflect this vague scope (abstract language -- not immediately applicable\/ relevant to real world circumstances), seminar discussion (sometimes engaging, but more often repetitive and contrived -- it sometimes seems a long course to sit through)"

   "comments": [
    "This course is absolutely worth taking. Professor Fotos is so committed to teaching in a way that is absolutely unusual at Yale he is funny, kind, demanding, and supportive in all the right ways. Even if you feel unsure about the content of the course, I would say take it, because Professor Fotos will find a way to make it matter to you.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. Prof. Fotos is an amazing professor who will take time to help you understand the readings and become a better writer and citizen in the country. We took trips to the U.S. Naval War College and West Point as well, which were incredible highlights. This class will help you understand our country better.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. The material is well-thought out and works well together. Although most of the seminars are dominated by discussion about the readings, they often evolve into theoretical politics which makes for outstanding discussions. Additionally, the field trips to West Point and the Naval War College were outstanding and really left me with a profound understanding of those institutions. Professor Fotos is an outstanding instructor. He cares very much for the students and makes every effort to ensure the students have an understanding of the discussions and their grades.",
    "Absolutely. It was a fascinating experience and the field trips were really special.",
    "Yeah overall a good course. Just make sure to work hard on papers and meet with the instructor beforehand. Professor Fotos is really kind and super passionate about the material. Hes a great professor and I would recommend taking his class.",
    "This course's strengths: Professor Fotos (a kind and insightful professor), the reading list (a broad range of texts from Tocqueville to MLK Jr.), the field trips (engaging hands-on look into American military institutions). This course's weaknesses: broad scope (the course focus is defined very vaguely, and it is often unclean immediately what the mission of the course is -- this means you have great freedom [too much, maybe] in choosing what to write about for papers), some readings reflect this vague scope (abstract language -- not immediately applicable\/ relevant to real world circumstances), seminar discussion (sometimes engaging, but more often repetitive and contrived -- it sometimes seems a long course to sit through)"
