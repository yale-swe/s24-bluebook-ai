    "Quirky, opinionated professor who is very funny. (Although sometimes can be scarily grumpy. But most of the time not.) I'm going to miss laughing so much every day next year.Second semester is finishing up grammar during the first two weeks and then reading German texts (including Bertolt Brecht! awesome). Most of the homework second semester is reading (and so translating) with some composition. Conversations about the texts in class.",
    "German 145 is the most incredible class. If you took 125, you must absolutely finish the year with this class! You will end with a great grasp of the material and grammar of German, and you get to read some really cool things! We even read two of Brecht's masterpieces: Der Augsberger Kreidekreis and Der Kaukasische Kreidekreis. Herr Stern is an amazing professor and cares so much about how much German his students absorb. The work isn't bad, and you will get much better at reading German as the semester progresses.",
    "It's in the title, it's intense. You have to be in it every day, and do the work. Falling behind is no for for anyone.",
    "I enjoyed this course much more than the first semester of Intensive German. We finished studying grammar after the first few weeks, and then we moved on to reading a selection of texts. The readings weren't the usual types of things you would read in an introductory language course though--they were interesting and significant (we read a lot of Brecht), and I really appreciated that. At 9 hours a week this class is still a big time commitment--I would be lying if I said I didn't kick myself for signing up for it sometimes--but the end result is totally worth it, and Herr Stern is awesome. If you've taken the first part of the course, I see no reason why you wouldn't want to finish by taking this part.",
    "I'm the 'Mean Girls' reviewer from 125 and I can't believe I'm writing an evaluation for this class. All I can say is, it gets marginally better when you start the reading; we read an actual Brecht play. But don't think this means you will not have to endure extreme spiritual torture three out of five classes each week--or be spoken to (let alone speak) in German.",
