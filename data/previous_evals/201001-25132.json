   "comments": [
    "I would not recommend this class to anyone. It was the worst class I have ever taken at Yale.",
    "Yes take it. It's kind of boring for the length of the seminar, but Kissick is really nice and the work isn't too bad.",
    "I would strongly recommend this class to another student interested in the American healthcare system. Recession or not, healthcare in the US will always be a hot topic. As an advisor, Dr. Kissick is unparalleled in his commitment of time and passion to his students. He is resourceful, friendly, and didactic. He wants to see you succeed, and will take the steps necessary to help you get there. That said, I feel that the lectures could be a little more organized. The class could also benefit from greater student participation or else one student may dominate the discussion. Finally, THIS is the class to do your senior thesis in. Kissick gives you a high level of independence and rewards hard work generously.",
    "Yes, the reading materials are great, the course load is very manageable, and you will learn a lot if you do the assigned readings",
    "A seminar on the health care system.",
    "This course is an overview of health policy models and health care institutions in the United States. The readings are very interesting, but you are never really responsible for them. Dr. K is one of the nicest professors at Yale, and he loves to get to know his students. Take advantage of his office hour lunches because you'll get to hear great stories about his life. The course is not difficult, but you also won't get much out of it if you don't do the readings.",
    "If it is offered as a lecture and not a seminar, then take it. Otherwise, don't.",
    "It's very interesting for the first third of the course and then gets incredibly repetitive. If you've had lots of health policy experience, you'll probably be bored. If not, it's worth a look. Dr. Kissick has had amazing experiences related to health reform, and you'll hear all about them. He cares a great deal for his students and is a wonderful guy.It's unfortunate that there aren't more health policy courses at Yale to complement this one; hopefully Yale will begin to build a series of courses related to this vital issue and PLSC 235 can be its vanguard."
