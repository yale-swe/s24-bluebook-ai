    "It's your standard E&M class but it's very cool being taught by Professor Iachello. He's incredibly knowledgeable about the material and adds another dimension to a subject that can often be somewhat dry. If you're thinking of taking it, odds are you already know you have to. But definitely take it with Iachello if you have the chance.",
    "I would not take this class if not required for your major, because it is a lot of work and difficult to mold the different material from the class into a cohesive idea in your head. That said, I enjoyed this class, even though it's not the most interesting subject in the physics major, in my opinion. The class is difficult mainly because of the breadth of material that is covered and the pace with which you cover it, and because it contains what may be a lot of new math... don't be fooled by the first few lectures.",
    "Physics 430 is a fairly typical junior\/senior level e&m class, and it's required for the major. You basically follow Griffiths (book) almost exactly, so occasionally it gets a little dull. However, despite it's relatively easy beginning, the class gets considerably harder after the midterm and doesn't slow down. The problem sets were fairly reasonable, and covered the main concepts of each chapter. Prof Iachello is pretty adorable, and though he can mumble in lecture at times, he's a super interesting dude. Definitely find some time to talk to him about partying with Feynman, transcribing music, and his friend Gerard 't Hooft",
    "I would not recommend taking the class unless you have to take it for the physics major. Going to class is only useful to the extent that you get to meet Professor Iachello, who is truly an amazing guy. I felt that I learned nothing from lecture since the entire class is him going over the Griffiths textbook too quickly to actually comprehend. Problem sets are not too difficult, and the exams are often fair since he'll tell you what will be tested. The class wasn't my favorite, but it's also one of the easier and less strenuous courses in the intensive major.",
    "If you are the intensive major, you have to take it, so the class has got that going for it. While I really like Professor Iachello as a person (he is absolutely an amazing person\/ you should read his wikipedia page), he's not the best lecturer. The book for course will be more helpful than anything said in class. But, you should go to class just to get to know Professor Iachello.",
    "Too much material. But interesting. Psets were far easier than exams which was annoying."
