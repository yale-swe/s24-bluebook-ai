    "I learned new information is this course, but it was somewhat of a disappointment. The student presentations\/exercises were not always well done and kind of disorganized. Considering half of the learning is through this method, I feel like I didn't get a lot out of it. I think there would be a lot of value to running this course like a real seminar where there is active discussion facilitated by the instructor.",
    "I found the course very interesting and rewarding. The group led discussions were my least favorite aspect because I didn't find them very helpful for learning the material. I enjoyed Dr. Khoshnood's lectures, the two days we had visitors and the readings chosen for the course. I have also really liked writing the final paper.",
    "the course was amazing. should be a req. course for EMD",
    "Really good, especially the lectures with that had speakers come in!",
    "Dynamic as a discussion-based course was good. Lectures were interesting and informative, professor certainly has a wealth of experience related to the subject-matter and was incredibly friendly and approachable. Discussions led by student groups varied in terms of value to the class; some groups tried to assign way too much work to accomplish during a short class time, which made the group activities feel rushed and stressful. Also, it would have been helpful to have a detailed syllabus at the beginning of the semester with readings lists and class assignments spelled out more than one or two weeks before the deadline. Finally, a mandatory meeting with the professor\/TA to discuss the final paper a few weeks before it was due would have been helpful as it would have pushed me to plan for the final paper further in advance than I did.",
    "Excellent course.Excellent professor.",
    "The course overall was a very good look at the reality of HIV\/AIDS both globally and in New Haven. Readings were very helpful and course instructor made the class very interactive.",
    "Excellent. I felt like the course really came together in a coherent, meaningful way. This was definitely my favorite course of the semester.The guest lectures were great but the general lectures were also really informative and interactive. I think this course had a pretty great structure.I wasn't fond of my student-led discussion but I'm sure that was my fault.",
    "Strengths would be the speakers such as the HIV positive individuals and those from CIRA and APNH. Those classes had the greatest impact. Kaveh is an amazing teacher and very knowledgeable. Weakness of the course was final paper being worth 40% of grade, and student presentations. I didn't feel I learned as much from them as from Kaveh's lectures and in class discussions. Maybe fewer presentations with larger groups.",
    "Course material was interesting, relevant and logically sequenced."

    "Instructor: Kaveh Khoshnood \u00a0I think Kaveh is a great person who is genuinely interested in students, but again, I was disappointed. He seemed kind of bored and unenthusiastic about teaching the class. I thought the class itself would be more dynamic. It seems like most of the work is pawned off to the TA.",
    "Instructor: Kaveh Khoshnood \u00a0Dr. Khoshnood is a very knowledgeable instructor and a great lecturer. He works well with the student groups in preparing for discussion and is always attentive and responsive.",

    "Instructor: Kaveh Khoshnood \u00a0Good, thoughtful lectures and organization of the class.",
    "Instructor: Kaveh Khoshnood \u00a0Extremely friendly and approachable, has a great deal of knowledge regarding the subject. While he seemed prepared for all class lectures, it would have been helpful to have a better sense of the trajectory of the class in terms of written assignments. It was hard to plan when to complete class work because we did not have the assignments spelled out for us very far in advance. Also, it would help to have a required meeting with him and the TA mid-way through the course or even following Thanksgiving break to discuss our final project.",
    "Instructor: Kaveh Khoshnood \u00a0Cool and nice.",
    "Instructor: Kaveh Khoshnood \u00a0Kaveh is a fantastic instructor!",
    "Instructor: Kaveh Khoshnood \u00a0Dr. Khoshnood is a very good professor; really connects with students and focuses not only on understanding the political and public health impact of HIV\/AIDS research but also the personal impact for individuals and families.",
    "Instructor: Kaveh Khoshnood \u00a0Kaveh is really responsive and forced us to think critically. I really appreciated that, I don't think many other courses I've taken at YSPH did that.",
    "Instructor: Kaveh Khoshnood \u00a0Kaveh is an amazing professor with a breadth and depth of knowledge.",
    "Instructor: Kaveh Khoshnood \u00a0Kaveh was a very engaging instructor and also helped students to get the most out of the course by using student-lead discussions."

   "comments": [
    "I'm not sure that I would recommend it if someone was deciding between two classes of equal interest. If you don't have a basic foundation on HIV and AIDS, I think it is worthwhile and actually a must for someone in a public health program--however, there may be better class options on the topic. Otherwise, the structure is not really that conducive to learning and it is disheartening to see what I considered a good professor who seems to actually be interested in students seem so uninterested in their own class.",
    "I would say that it gives a good foundation about the history and current status of HIV globally. Many of the themes are also important to other health problems and issues. It is not too demanding but involves a lot of reading, writing and discussion. I would recommend it to anyone who has an interest in HIV\/AIDS or global health.",
    "imperative for EMD.",
    "Really good course for anyone looking to learn more about different aspects of the HIV epidemic.",
    "Great overview of HIV\/AIDS and its continued relevance to public health. I would strongly recommend the course to anyone looking for a discussion -based class, with multiple opportunities to express ideas through written assignments.",
    "Highly recommend. I really appreciate the classes with invited guests.",
    "I would recommend this course to a fellow student; was a great addition and I definitely learned a lot about the context of global HIV\/AIDS.",
    "I'd recommend it.",
    "This course is really great and I would recommend it to other students who are interested in HIV regardless of their level of experience with the epidemic. There is a lot to learn whatever level the student is at at the start of the course.",
    "Yes, the course was very interesting and the instructor demonstrated his expertise on the subject material while also making the course very student-directed."
