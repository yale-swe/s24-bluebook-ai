   "comments": [
    "Decent overview of half of French grammar (second half in 151), with some reading and movies thrown in. Not particularly difficult if you do all the homework and participate. If you are on the French track I would recommend it whole-heartedly! My French undoubtedly improved as a result.",
    "It's a great advanced grammar review.I would recommend it, it was very useful.",
    "Absolutely recommend 150 and especially this class. Not too great of a burden from a work perspective, and Wynant is a fantastic professor. The material can be tough, but she is very good at explaining it.",
    "It's a pretty good French course, it covers most of the grammatical problems that trip people up who speak French well but aren't fluent.",
    "FR 150 is a very enjoyable course that enables you to greatly improve your command of French grammar. The texts and films are all enjoyable, and the instructors are great. For the aforementioned reasons, I would definitely recommend it to all students who are at the appropriate level, and who are even slightly considering doing it."
