   "comments": [
    "This is a wonderful writing class that really zooms in and focuses on skills that many students have forgotten.",
    "My writing got better. My ear got better. And in the process, I wrote some things that matter to me.",
    "Learning how to write more clearly",
    "I learned how to view the world around me with a bit more clarity -- and that is worth an incredible amount. I learned the value of my perspective, and I learned, through Verlyn's thoughtful advice and words, how to more clearly communicate my observations and ideas. I feel that I simply learned more -- about writing, about reading carefully, about how I interact with the world -- than I have in most any other class at Yale. I'm really grateful for that.",
    "To write for oneself and break the molds of genre. To truly treat writing as a craft.",
    "I believe that I've become a better reader. And I've been able to write more rhythmic prose and prose that listens to itself better.",
    "You learn to better judge and edit your own writing.",
    "Klinkenborg taught me, largely, how to be my own reader. That when a sentence is not clear it's often because the thought is not clear. If approached that way, writing becomes primarily of a tool for thinking and secondarily a tool for communicating.",
    "I learned how to be a reader of my own writing, and how to write more concisely.",
    "Verlyn for the most part offered us guided practice in writing. Although I didn't necessarily produce a better piece each week than the previous, my writing was markedly improved by the finish of the class, and I now possess the ability to better express what I mean without my writing becoming overrun with imprecise images and unclear language.",
    "This course was great! It refined how I write and how I approach writing. I thought about my voice in a way I haven't in other nonfiction writing classes at Yale. I also liked being forced to think about WHAT to write week after week. That led me in unusual directions.",
    "This class taught me as much about life as about writing. Verlyn's basic stance is \"What you notice is important. What you feel is valid. You have the authority to tell your story.\" I learned how to notice. I learned how to grant myself authority and trust that the reader will follow along. I learned how to un-learn the cliches, limits, and structures I'd always associated with \"writing and tap into the prose I needed and wanted to write."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I really only wish that everyone had a chance to take this class--it benefits people who have done a lot of creative writing work, and who've never taken a CW class alike.",
    "Verlyn is the class's strength. He's the reason you take it, and going to office hours with himand just writing with him in mindmade the whole class worthwhile. The weakness is rigor: the level of discussion isn't high, and we don't have to read too much, and the stuff we have to read isn't very old. I wish there was more older prose on the syllabus.",
    "There's very little I could think could be better-done about this class -- from Verlyn's teaching to the way he runs the class, the assignments, readings, and everything else. It's just an extremely well thought-out and well-taught class. The weekly assignments (writing 2+ pages of nonfiction writing about anything) were challenging, although you definitely get out of it what you put into it (you could not work hard on the writing, and sort of coast, but that'd just be a waste of time). The readings were mostly very short and very good. The strength though, really, is Verlyn -- he is a thoughtful teacher, an excellent listener, very accessible to students (encourages students to go to office hours and meet with him), and wants you to grow. I really can't think of any ways I'd improve the class.",
    "Verlyn can improve your writing.",
    "The random selection of students work for workshops was a bad idea. Some of my classmates had three of their essays workshopped while none of mine was. Other than that, the intimate atmosphere made sharing ones work easier and writing personal non fiction more enjoyable.",
    "I think that the looseness of the structure of the course made it difficult to improve on writing beyond a very specific, creative nonfiction or essay writing style.",
    "This course is pretty maxed out as it is: write a piece, go to class, discuss successful writing techniques in both published literature and in classmates' writing, and then go to office hours and let Verlyn tell you how to improve your writing more specifically. Reading was just right, and amount of writing was very manageable, especially coupled with Verlyn's flexibility.",
    "In terms of improvements, I wish we could have spent more time discussing other people's pieces every week. Maybe at the beginning of class, people could volunteer sentences or phrases that struck them in other students' submissions for that week.",
    "I wouldn't change a thing about the course. One of the most helpful parts were the weekly office hours with Verlyn. Future students, go every time you can!"

   "comments": [
    "Verlyn is frank and perceptive in the advice he gives, and you will think more critically about your prose. Definitely go to office hours if you want to get the most out of this course.",
    "Absolutely--as I already said above, I think this is one of the best classes I've taken at Yale and I wish everyone had the opportunity to take it.",
    "Yes, absolutely. This class will improve your writing. But you have to bring the initiative. Verlyn won't hand you anything on a platter, but he challenge you if you show up and work hard. If you take the class, don't be afraid to write about the things you care about.",
    "Yes, this course, without being too much work, really taught me how to write more clearly and concisely and be just overall more aware of my prose.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course. I feel like I simply learned far more in this class than I have in most other classes -- more about not just writing, but also about how to read well, how to value my perspective, and what great teaching looks like. You get out of the class what you put into it -- and if you push yourself to invest the time in writing a piece that challenges you each week, Verlyn will respond in kind, with very thoughtful comments that push you to become a better writer\/thinker. Also, definitely go to office hours -- it adds a ton to what you'll learn from\/get out of this class, if you take the time to go talk with him every week. This was my favorite class I took this semester, and absolutely one of my favorite classes I've taken at Yale -- I feel really lucky to have gotten to taken it, and would absolutely recommend it.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course.",
    "A great class. You will improve a lot both in writing and editing. He frees you as a writer, so to speak. You can put away pointless restraints that have been imposed on your writing since middle school. Take it.",
    "Yes! It is a great way to think about the mechanics of writing, which doesn't always happen in subject driven courses.",
    "Take it if you can get in; apply if you're not sure. A low-stress workshop where you can hone your writing with the guidance of talented peers and a caring, skilled, and honest professor.",
    "Take the class! It's a great writing environment. The other students were all lovely writers and reading their pieces every week was so pleasant - and, in its own way, inspiring. Verlyn gives you no guidelines, aside from the page limit (2). Each week, the topic and style are up to you. It's great freedom. The class probably won't transform your writing, but it will make it better. Definitely go to office hours -- as Verlyn will tell you, that's really the best way of getting feedback.",
    "YES. This class will change your life. It will influence the way you observe your outer and inner world and the way you express yourself."
