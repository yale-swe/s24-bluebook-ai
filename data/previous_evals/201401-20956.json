    "Each week you go into lab and work for your lab partner (who you're with for the year) on a different project. While there are weekly reports, there isn't any in class time crunch like there is in 205, so the experience is much more enjoyable. Additionally, while there are some reports that are quite tedious, others are very relaxed. In the end, you'll learn a great deal about interpreting data while getting to conduct some really awesome experiments.",
    "I would definitely recommend PHYS 206L over PHYS 166L. You are given about 25 labs to choose from at the beginning of the semester and you and your partner are able to select the 9 (or less) labs you would like to do. This is great because you can avoid certain labs (relating to transistors probably). That being said, the experience of this lab is highly dependent on your partner (the same one all semester) and your TA. I would recommend taking this with a friend or someone with a strong physics background. My TA was Anthony and if he TAs again, I would definitely recommend taking it with him! The labs we did that I would recommend are: Electric fields (E3), Nuclear Scattering (J3), Digital Logic (C1), Electron Diffraction (H3), q\/m (H1), and Fourier Analysis (J2). I would definitely not recommend any labs with transistors (D1\/D2) unless you have a very deep interest. Those labs tend to be long and difficult to write up. I also heard millikan's oil drop and superconductivity were really cool labs. Overall, great class. You know what you have to do and when and workload is very manageable.",
    "The labs are actually pretty fun and interesting, but you have to write a lab report every single week which is KILLER. They're pretty long, take forever, and aren't very valuable.",
    "Great great change from 205. If you were put off by 205 don't drop down to 166, but take 206. You pick 9 labs, get 2 weeks off, always end way early. The 10-15 pg. lab reports are pretty hefty every week, but you'll find yourself writing them faster and faster as the semester progresses. I would also recommend Jacob as a TA if you can get him. Also, everyone should do the nuclear scattering experiment, if for no other reason than to meet Larry, the accelerator operator.",
    "Physics 206L is so much better that Physics 205L. The labs are more interesting in materials, and there is no final exam or practical to worry about. As long as you keep on track with finishing the lab reports every week, you should be fine.",
    "PHYS 206L is much better than PHYS 205L. The labs you do are much more interesting, and if you want to understand the physics behind everything, you actually have the time to learn. You do have a write-up (mine were mostly 4-6 pages of writing) due almost every week, so the workload is much greater than 205\u2019s, but the class itself is much less stressful. Choosing the right labs is important. We had some issues with the transistor amplifier lab, and I\u2019ve heard bad things about Millikan\u2019s oil drop. Personally, I thought the particle accelerator and superconductivity labs were the coolest and would recommend them both.",
    "A lot better than 205, but also a lot more work. You get to choose your experiments, and there are a lot of cool ones! The reports aren't particularly difficult, but they do take quite some time.",
    "I took this class because I thought I was going to be a physics major, but I'm now sure that I want to do math instead. Overall, this is a chill class that taught me more physics than PHYS 261. Definitely take this class, even if you aren't a physics major. The lab reports are quite a bit of work, but you should invest time into them. They're worth it. Here are the labs that I did: 1) Digital Logic: This lab is tougher than one would expect, but the report is easy. 2) Optical Diffraction: The lab is easy but the report is hard. 3) Superconductivity: Fun lab, good write-up. 4) Nuclear Scattering and Reactions: You absolutely must do this lab. 5) Operational Amplifier: Equipment didn't work well, mediocre lab. 6) Fourier Synthesis: Easy lab but equipment didn't work well. 7) X-Ray Diffraction: Super easy lab with little work involved. 8) Electron Diffraction: Somewhat difficult report but easy lab.",
    "I would recommend Physics 206L. It is much better than 205. However, because you pick one partner and rotate through all weeks with the same partner, I would encourage you to choose wisely or try to get into the class with a friend that you trust. A great partner can really make your experience way better, while I imagine that a bad partner can make it way worse. The labs I did were B1, C1, E3, F1, H1, H4, H5, J3, and I was really happy with them!",
    "This class was much better than 205L, as you got to pick your own experiments. There are weekly lab reports, instead of doing everything during class, but I feel like it was a fair tradeoff, as we usually got out of lab early with 206, and there was no practical. I actually enjoyed this class almost as much as Orgo lab. Some of the experiments, like superconductivity, are just very fun. I would definitely recommend it over 166L.",
    "I only took this course because it was required, but I did learn some interesting things. The amount of time that I had to spend writing up labs was really annoying, because that isn't where the majority of the learning happened. Make sure you get a cool TA, that will make all the difference.",
    "I'll preface this by saying that I really don't like labs. With that said, this lab class was tolerable. Most of the labs were interesting, and they didn't all feel like a rote repetition of basic physics. Lab reports, however, were the bane of my existence. They took around 8 hours on average to complete (at least for me), and the lab handouts were sometimes misleading (some equations were flat-out wrong). But you need to take this class if you're a physics, etc. major, so just get it done, and get it done early!",
    "The course is set up so that you have about 9 reports to do (one less if you do the two-week particle accelerator experiment) with written reports due every week. The reports vary by TA (mine were 5-page reports at maximum), so choose your TA wisely by switching if you get a bad vibe on Day 1. There is no final and you get two weeks off from lab during the semester. Definitely recommend it if you're trying to solidify your PHYS 181 knowledge or just getting a requirement done for your major!",
    "Lots of fun labs. Would recommend it to non physics majors. Don't be turned off by 205 (which was awful). Take superconductivity.",
    "Amazing experiments that I never thought I'd get to do myself. Superconductivity, digital logic, and electron charge to mass ratio were the standouts. Relaxed, tons of fun, and also a great way to reinforce concepts.",
    "A really good lab; the flow of work in the class works really nicely. Focusing on lab reports, rather than lab notebooks, allows us to focus on the data analysis, the physics concepts we're dealing with, rather than a mad dash to get data in time.",
    "I wouldn't really recommend this lab to anyone. If you don't have to I don't see a reason to take this laboratory. There aren't any useful skills acquired. It feels like a hodgepodge of labs across physics history. It was boring at times and the lab reports were often tedious.",
    "If you have taken 205L already, then definitely take this lab. It is much better and you have more free reign in the experiments. Choosing the experiments is the best, if you pick good ones (stay away from transistors). I think most of the TFs are relatively laid back because of the individualistic nature of the course, and this makes the weekly lab reports much more manageable. If you are premed, this lab is definitely better than the other physics lab for premed students.",
    "This class will depend a lot on Your TA and lab partner, so choose wisely!",
    "PHYS 206L is a class where it is really important to shop sections because having a good Teaching Assistant is crucial since the lab summaries are confusing and the equipment frequently doesn't work. If you are taking this lab alongside Physics 181, it is fun to physically see some on the concepts taught in class. However, take the advice of former reviews on which labs to choose and make sure you have a good understanding with your partner about expectations.",
    "This was a really fun course! The labs offered in 206L are absolutely fascinating, though keep in mind that the reports will take some time. Take it!",
    "I would definitely recommend PHYS 206L to another student. It is the best way to get the physics lab requirement done. At the beginning of the semester, everyone picks which experiments they want to do from a wide array. The labs are interesting and not rushed. The reports are done outside, during the week between lab sessions, and usually they are not too much trouble. This course is TOTALLY different from 205L.",
    "You have the freedom to chose about 9 labs out of a list of around 20. They are more interesting than 205- you also have the week to write the report- both a blessing and a curse. To do it properly, it probably takes more than a half credit of work. Some, such as the Milikan oil drop experiment have the reputation for being tedious, but this one in particular is so historial it may just be worth doing. Definitely do the particle accelerator lab: Larry will make sure you know how to read all the equipment and will explain how he operates the instrument.",
    "PHYS 206L will be twice the work for half the credit, but you get to do some pretty cool experiments. It's not like 205L where you are panicking every week trying to finish. Instead, it's a more existential anguish. Knowing that you have to spend infinite time to make up some extremely sketchy way to analyze and present your data--it hurts on the inside."
