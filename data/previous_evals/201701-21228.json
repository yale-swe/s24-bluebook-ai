    "Was able to explore my creative passions. Got to work with my hands and create something. Every day was a joy to go to the shop to work.",
    "I had never taken an art class before this. I learned a lot about what art is and what it can mean to me. I also learned to weld, and I thought that that was really cool.",
    "I learned so much in this course. Not only did I learn how to use all the machines, but I learned the dynamic between them and metal.",
    "I learned how to better express myself through art. I developed a better relationship with my hands. I learned how to use amazing machinery: welding, cutting, bending steel."

    "This course is perfect, I absolutely loved it.",
    "It would've been helpful if we were shown more of the tools, techniques, etc. to grind, finish, etc. the materials. A lot was just figure out on your own.",
    "I think this is a good class overall. I wish that the paper were made clear in the syllabus and that the assignment itself was clear as well. I little paragraph describing the assignment would go a long way.",
    "I honestly don't think there are any weaknesses. This is has been one of my favorite courses so far and I grew so much during it. Brent pushes everyone to think and try new things and really get us to push ourselves.",
    "Great Professor and TA who are always willing to help and teach."

   "comments": [
    "I would 100% recommend this class to another student. It was so so fantastic to take, especially as a non-art major.",
    "This is a fantastic class, Brent is amazing at what he does and if you are lucky enough to get a good TA your experience will be unforgettable. Definitely, try and take this class, if you leave Yale without taking a sculpture class of some sort, you are doing yourself a disservice.",
    "Absolute gem of a class. Professor Brent is the coolest guy ever. If you can get into this class, take. You'll get to make some pretty incredible pieces and its so much fun.",
    "I think this is a great class, especially if you haven't taken (m)any art classes before. It's a fun class and Brent is a cool guy. The crits can be stressful and plan on spending at least 6 hours in the shop the week before the crit. It also seems like this class is about cozy-ing up to Brent, so I would recommend coming in as much as you can to build that relationship. It's one of the most rewarding courses that I've taken at Yale. P.S. There's a paper (3 pages) due at the end of the semester that isn't on the syllabus. It was annoying that we weren't told about that more than about a week before it was due.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. Take it!!! It is challenging and fun and Brent creates an amazing environment that is cool to be a part of.",
    "Yes, it's a great class to anyone who loves to work with their hands. Its very stress relieving and it becomes fun to work on your projects. You'll learn to weld, cut, and bend steel with machinery. Brent is a great guy. He expects you to come in at least once a week outside of class time.",
    "Fantastic course. Take it if you get in, with the understanding you'll need to put in some hours in the shop.",
    "Yes! Great course taught by excellent teacher"
