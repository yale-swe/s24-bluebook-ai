    "I could read and translate some Old Norse text without a dictionary. It's very surprising how much you get out of this course. I never expected to know a language so well in a class that only meets twice a week. Prof. Frank is amazing at explaining the linguistics of Old Norse.",
    "I learned to extract a lot of historical, cultural, and linguistic information from very small and self-contained texts.",
    "We learned the basic rules and structure of Old Norse, so that we could read easy things on sight and almost anything with a glossary.",
    "I learned how to read and translate the Old Norse language and I learned about the ancient Icelandic culture.",
    "I developed a whole new appreciation for both language and literature, and the history of the European canon during this class.",
    "This course taught me how to read and translate Old Norse. It also provided background in Old Norse culture and how it relates to modern day Scandinavian cultures.",
    "Better understanding of Norse culture (and obviously language)"

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Professor Frank is a master of her field and one of the best teachers I've ever had. Her course was a delight, particularly in how she was able, remarkably, to bring us from no knowledge of a language to decent reading knowledge within one semester, to say nothing of the great historical and cultural information we also learned. If I could change one thing, it would be slowing down the course's pace in the first two or three weeks. We jumped into texts immediately, which was difficult because we had to look up every single word in the glossary for the first several readings. It would have been helpful to spend more time on basic grammar and vocabulary before starting off so soon.",
    "Strengths of the course include fun atmosphere, understanding professor, and interesting subject material. Weaknesses include not enough explanation of linguistic structures (if you'd never learned a language with declensions before you were sort of thrown into the deep end), substandard comprehension of students' problems with the material, and a difficult, unhelpful textbook. The class could be improved by having a stronger foundation in the basics of the language.",
    "This was a really good class, although it went a little fast at times and the workload varied from day to day, so maybe evening out the translations a bit more would be helpful.",
    "Sometimes the workload felt very heavy, but the evaluations and in-class discussions were always extremely fun. The final project was also strong enough to demand engagement but not so intense that it became a burden. I thoroughly enjoyed the class.",
    "The greatest strength of this course was actually translating Old Norse texts. The daily translations helped me improve and practice my ability to read and translate Old Norse. It also helped Professor Frank provide daily feedback on my translations. There were no glaring weaknesses of this course."

    "Take this course only if you're serious about learning Old Norse. If you're shopping this because of the show Vikings, think twice about it and really ask yourself: Do I want to spend at least 12 hours a week translating some weird saga and poetry?",
    "Absolutely. This is a once in a lifetime opportunity to learn this kind of language and culture from one of the world's experts on them.",
    "Take this class if you want a course without many evaluations. You have to be in class and you have to have done the translation, but there's only one short paper and maybe three really easy quizzes. Professor Frank is fun, but maybe not the best instructor for people who've never learned a language with declensions before.",
    "This was such a cool class. You dive right in, so be prepared for translations almost immediately, and don't fall behind or else it's hard to catch up. Overall though, the language is surprisingly similar to English which greatly facilitates translation although it'll still take a good 2-4 hours a week. Professor Frank is amazing and she loves Old Norse, the class, teaching, and her students, so overall I would definitely recommend this course to everyone.",
    "Absolutely I would recommend this class to any student with an interest in language or Nordic culture.",
    "Yes!",
    "This is an awesome class to take. Professor Frank is amazing and really enjoys teaching Old Norse. The material is super interesting - think Viking adventures and mythology. The workload, quizzes, and final were all very reasonable.",
    "Yes"
