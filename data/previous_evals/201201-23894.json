   "comments": [
    "Instructor: Alan J. Plattus \u00a0Generally yes, but I think it's a no-brainer that every student should have at least two computer monitors. Having one monitor to make digital drawings is like having a monitor-sized drawing board to make hand drawings.",
    "Instructor: Alan J. Plattus \u00a0I did have to meet with a business school librarian to learn about city research. It would have been valuable to direct our research interests to the appropriate city resources and institutions.",
    "Instructor: Bimal Kausalya Mendis \u00a0No. I repeat only one critic knew anything about urban design.",
    "Instructor: Bimal Kausalya Mendis \u00a0Fine.",
    "Instructor: Bimal Kausalya Mendis \u00a0yes, they were.",
    "Instructor: Bimal Kausalya Mendis \u00a0yes",
    "Instructor: Edward Mitchell \u00a0Yes.",
    "Instructor: Edward Mitchell \u00a0Yes",
    "Instructor: Edward Mitchell \u00a0GOOD.",
    "Instructor: Edward Mitchell \u00a0The resources were sufficient.",
    "Instructor: Keller Easterling \u00a0fine.",
    "Instructor: Keller Easterling \u00a0Yes.",
    "Instructor: Keller Easterling \u00a0I wish the studio had been better organized. Assignments were often unclear, as were expectations as laid out in the syllabus. While I appreciated Ed's \"hands-off\" approach, I wish he had been a little more involved in terms of laying out clear assignments. I also think that the selection of two sites was problematic. I think it would have been easier to have assigned us a specific site.",
    "Instructor: Keller Easterling \u00a0The school\/course needs to bring in more guest speakers that deal with urban design in the real world to talk to the class. The only two such moments were Chris Starky talking about retaining water and a gentleman from Stamford talking about the city. What about transportation network? What about Stamford train station? And the symbiosis of different program in an urban setting?",
    "Instructor: Margaret Deamer \u00a0Our library is so frustrating.",
    "Instructor: Margaret Deamer \u00a0The library hours are generally inconvenient. The one-book out at-a-time policy is an impediment to education.",
    "Instructor: Margaret Deamer \u00a0More Server space from the beginning would have been useful, as the server is crucial when working with partners.",
    "Instructor: Sunil Bald \u00a0yes. although Stamford is a poor choice for a studio. do something more interesting like philadelphia or baltimore.",
    "Instructor: Sunil Bald \u00a0yes.",
    "Instructor: Sunil Bald \u00a0Excellent provision of resources."
