   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this because it seems to apply to a broad range of research. Dynamics can be applied to stars, or galaxies and bigger objects. The final projects were a good way to explore something that you're specifically interested in. I would recommend that the student take their own notes along the way, in addition to the teacher-written notes, because sometimes you forget if you don't write it yourself. Workload is heavy at times because the problem sets take time to do well, but I consider this appropriate for a grad level class. Also, it really helps to know some IDL or programming to do the final assignments. Otherwise these will take you much more time to complete.",
    "This course was a practical approach to stellar dynamics - a course that covered complex and potentially very theoretical material in a way that made it useful to anyone doing extragalactic research. I found that as the semester passed I was able to understand colloquia, my other classes, and my research field in much more depth. It gave essential background for the theory and observations behind my research.I highly recommend this course for anyone who is interested in extragalactic astrophysics."

   "comments": [
    "I don't know what my research will be, but I think that some things will apply. At least just understanding the general idea behind galaxies and some of the terminology will help. Also, the text Galactic Dynamics is good and I think I'll refer back to that.",
    "This course gave me essential background in my field and prepared me well for future research."
