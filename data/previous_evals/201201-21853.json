   "comments": [
    "I wouldn't recommend it--not really that interesting or that crucial of material to dedicate so much time to. It's essentially every single detail of the European economic system, rather than its history per se.",
    "You don't really have to go to class at all to do well in the class. All the lectures are online. Just go to the class before the midterm and the class before the final to know what he's gonna ask on the test.",
    "It's a great way to learn Abt europe and how it was shaped after ww1 and why it is what is it today",
    "A very interesting course with not too heavy workload. It has a midterm and a final. One can increase one's grade by attending the optional weekly section and writing an optional 8-10p paper.",
    "Semi-interesting material - the stuff relates to current events \/ affairs only at the end. Spends too much time on background. The plus side is there's almost no work - only a midterm and a final - and the professor posts the lecture slides online so you don't have to go to class. Also section is optional so no need to do the readings.",
    "It's a great way to learn about modern Europe, especially given the recent crisis. I would definitely recommend this course.",
    "Take it.",
    "I would definitely take this class - it's a must if you want to understand why Europe is the way it is today.",
    "Mmm hard to answer. The professor is an expert but the fact that he reads all the slides is not the best way a class can be lead however he is really helpful and the material is really interesting if you are interested in Europe.",
    "yes: solid course. manageable work. tests are reasonable.",
    "Good overview of the history of the European Union, interesting at times but it can get really boring",
    "If you have any interest in the financial formation of the European Union and economic history in general this is a fantastic course. Going into the course, I had no such interest, but was looking for something different to my other political science coursework. The class was great! Well developed with interesting readings. Prof. Cameron, is quite simply so knowledgeable and approachable. No question is too small , and he is readily available to meet with students during generous office hours and after class. A disappointment was the number of students who did not come to lecture. Their loss!",
    "great for credit\/d. you have the option of only taking a midterm and a final and you don't have to go to section because it is optional.",
    "If you are at all interested in Europe from World War One thorough the current Euro-zone crisis, take this course. It's a great overview of Europe through this time period.",
    "This class is an analysis of the early developments leading to the creation of the European Union, as well as the current and future debt crises in Europe. The information is interesting and relevant to today's world, but I would definitely not recommend taking the class--it's incredibly boring, and though the workload is low, you'd be better off reading some New York Times articles about the debt crises and be done with it.",
    "This class is really interesting and relevant - a must take!",
    "Yes, but you need to have a strong interest in the EU - without that you might find this class boring. David Cameron wrote the book on a lot of EU subjects so he is THE person to learn from. Also, write the optional paper and\/or go to optional section. If you don't, your grade distribution will be 67% final and 33% midterm which is brutal.",
    "It is not a difficult course with interesting material, but the lectures are boring.",
    "The course material is really good and the readings are really interesting. You really end up learning a lot about contemporary Europe. However, the lectures are extremely dull. Take it only if you are really interested in Europe, otherwise you'll get bored.",
    "Yes I would recommend it. The optional paper and section make the midterm and final less pressure.",
    "I left with a true competent understanding of European politics from World War I to the present day, a particularly useful bit of knowledge to have given the current economic and political atmosphere. In that respect, this class was a wild success. However, the class itself was quite uninteresting. Professor Cameron is nice and clearly means well, but be wary, because however much I ended up learning, I also went through each class repressing the urge to punch myself in the face just to feel something. And I was one of the few who actually showed up. On any given day there were say, 25 to 30 students, whereas at least triple that deigned to show up to the final (which is probably beneficial for the curve). Anyway, if you want to learn a lot in a fairly low-pressure environment, by all means take this class! I did learn a ton! I also was incredibly bored. But better to be bored and informedthan bored and ignorant, right?",
    "Great course for poli sci majors as a follow up to the Cold War.",
    "I would recommend this course for anyone with an interest in learning a bit more about europe's history. Just be prepared for alot of PowerPoint.",
    "It's a good class if you're interested in European history during the 20th century, especially post-1989. Otherwise, I wouldn't recommend it.",
    "Definitely take it",
    "Probably wouldn't recommend it. If you're looking for a gut, take something else. You'll learn a lot though.",
    "I would definitely recommend the New Europe--especially if you're interested in the recent history of Europe and how the EU will affect our economy and our global power structure going forward. And do the section too!",
    "I would recommend New Europe to a student looking for another political science credit who doesn't have time to put a ton of effort into the course except for the midterm and the final. I like how the course is sort of as hard as you wish to make it--optional section, optional paper. However, that said, not like an absolutely mind-blowing course, just one that fits well as a fourth or fifth course that is still about an interesting topic.",
    "Wouldn't recommend it, it's pretty boring. Lectures are just Prof. Cameron (who seems really awesome, btw) reading off a highly detailed powerpoint, which he puts online. Cut and dry memorization of facts. Midterm and final consisting of essays chosen from many possible questions.",
    "It's a really good overview of the history of the European Union and the events that have shaped the current arrangement of the Union and the problems that it faces.",
    "Take it! Very good if you want an understanding of what is going on in Europe today and how it got that way.",
    "Great course that allows you to get a lot out if you want to. If you attend the opiotnal section and pay attention in class youll be very prepared for te questions asked on the final and midterm.",
    "not that much work but i would take a class that is more interesting",
    "This is a rigorous and highly detailed lecture course meant to address some of the major themes of twentieth- and twenty-first-century European political history. Be prepared for an avalanche of detail -- in both the lectures and the readings -- and a very broad timescale (beginning of WWI up to the EU fiscal crisis) that will make it difficult to study effectively for the midterm and the final. The information -- if you're willing to put in the time -- is useful and important but nobody's trying to make the task of mastering it any easier for you; it's not presented in comfortably sized chunks or organized in any clearly thematic way. All that said, this is still a very good course, meaty and fascinating and very much worth taking if you want to be at all familiar with the postwar development of the European political space.",
    "This class is perfect for anyone looking for a fifth class. Professor teaches straight from the power point and posts them online, so you don't even have to go to lecture. Grade based entirely on midterm and final, but there is optional section and essay to improve your grade. Definitely recommend!",
    "It is much harder than you'd expect. A LOT of memorization and not too much guidance. Lets you decide how many components of your grade you want tho--just midterm\/final, or add an optional section and\/or paper. Information is interesting but structured more like a history class than a poll sci.",
    "If you want to learn about how the EU came to be, the problems it faces, and where it is going in the future take this class.",
    "This is a great class. The tests are very fair and based off the class material- they are essays with a lot of choices. If you are interested in government at all then this is a great class to take. It helps if you do the readings, which are kind of plentiful, but they are really interesting at the same time.",
    "The New Europe is a great introductory course to current European political system. The first half covers the history of the development of the EU, and the second half covers the challenges EU is facing including the Eurozone debt crisis.",
    "Yes, I'd highly recommend The New Europe to any student. The course is really interesting if you put a bit of an effort into it. Also, although the slides are posted online, make it a point to attend lectures. The discussion section was great and we had stimulating discussions.",
    "I would recommend this course, it is an excellent way to learn all about European History from the last century.",
    "PLSC 166 offers a great overview of how Europe evolved and developed since WWI from a poli sci perspective. I learned a lot, especially how events in different parts of Europe were connected and influenced each other. The optional paper and section allowed a lot of flexibility for students in terms of workload. The lectures, however, can sometimes be a little dry and boring, and the slides often contain a lot of text.",
    "basic lecture course, lot of information. tests are essay format",
    "A thorough (given the scope!) of Europe from the late 19th century onward as it moves towards the era of supranational integration. Will provide students with a strong background on the topic, and useful course material to refer to in the future."
