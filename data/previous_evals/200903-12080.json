   "comments": [
    "Econ 110 is the microecon lecture on steroids. It moves faster, is more competitive, and expects more of you. You have to be willing to be actively engaged in every class meeting; you have to be committedto getting the problem sets done and studying a lot for the midterms. I would recommend this class to another student if they have already taken Econ in high school (most kids in this class have, and that gives an advantage and makes it a doable but challenging class). If you've never done Econ, you just have to be prepared to be lost sometimes. At the same time, it's an excellent subject to know and it's not as boring as the lecture. And Tolga is awesome.",
    "A great into to economics. It is very informative and I think its got some great real world applications. I would definitely reconomend this class to another student. I think economics is critical for understanding the world today and Tolga teaches a very fun class.",
    "If you read the chapters and pay attention in class, it is not that hard. You just have to keep up. It's a good intro class but not the most interesting material.",
    "Yes- you get a very good understanding of introductory microeconomics. It is harder than the lecture course, but Tolga is a great teacher and really explains things well.",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone interested in Intro Microeconomics. For me, it was definitely more tolerable than a big 300 person lecture, and I think the smaller environment is definitely useful in helping students to understand the basic concepts necessary for a solid background in econ.",
    "If you need to take Econ for a major, etc, take the seminar, and take it with Tolga. Even if you're just looking for a QR, Econ was a good class if you put in the work. Tolga is always willing to go over material again if you ask questions or go to office hours. If you reciprocate the effort, Tolga can teach you very well. Make sure you form a study group for doing problem sets and studying for exams.",
    "I would recommend Econ 110 to another student because it is a rigorous economics class and is very worthwhile to anyone's higher education.",
    "I would recommend this course if you are thinking of majoring in Econ or just want to take an introductory course to know some more about the topic. Tolga is engaging and makes the most out of fairly mundane material, bringing in outside examples to make it more interesting. There is a curve which is somewhat unclear and nerve-racking, but Tolga is very open about meeting during office hours and answering your questions.",
    "This was a good class, but also be sure to shop the lecture. If you take the seminar, be sure to take it with koker, since he prepares you much better for the tests.",
    "If you are going to take this class take it with Tolga. Period. He is the best teacher for it and you will love him. Seminar is where you actually learn the material rather than lecture. It's probably easier to get a good grade in lecture, but you won't be as interested in the material nor will you know it as well. If you are going to major in Econ, definitely take the seminar. The curve is a bit tough, but other than that its a great course with Tolga.",
    "Yes. I had never taken an economics course before and did not expect to like it. This course has sparked great interest in the subject. It is very comprehensive and clear. The workload is quite managable. There are few assignments besides the tests, which are fair and directly relate to the material in the book and class lectures.",
    "Its a good class. Sometimes the material can be boring. Tolga is awesome!",
    "I would recommend this course, despite its heavy workload, because Tolga makes this class great."
