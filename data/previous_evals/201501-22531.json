    "You must take this course. Turkish is a fascinating language, and Etem is a brilliant professor. You will have so much fun learning Turkish.",
    "Take it! It's great. It's both very rewarding without being very intense. Imagine taking a non-European language that bridges the gap between Chinese and Indonesian: not much of a gut without taking away from your other classes.",
    "If you have any interest in Turkey, Turkish culture, or are looking for a new and interesting language, I seriously recommend this.",
    "Amazing class. Always an enjoyable time, great balance of work, and an easy environment to learn in.",
    "Take this course to learn a great, pretty intuitive language, and to have Etem Erol as your professor."
