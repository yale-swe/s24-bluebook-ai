    "None",
    "I learned how to use supercollider to design sound & manifest musical ideas while also becoming more efficient and proficient in my coding.",
    "foundational information for both SuperCollider and digital audio as a whole",
    "This course teaches you how to code in SuperCollider, and speifically create music with that coding language. Yet, one also learns about the larger programming world, and the history of machine-generated music.",
    "I learned to play around a very cool software (when you actually get it). The first few classes on the history of computer music are also pretty exciting. Scott seems pretty gentle, sweet, and funny in the beginning but can be downright (accidentally?) mean and a hard-ass.",
    "The supercollider language",
    "I definitely learned a good foundation for SuperCollider and a lot about coding in general. I feel like I could more easily approach learning another language if I wanted, which is great."

   "comments": [
    "Bad professor",
    "Very all over the place content and you dont really learn the programming language because it gets theoretical",
    "The strengths were the small class & discussions which allowed people to collaborate and learn together",
    "I think this course would benefit from having some kind of section. Even though it is a very small course, there is not enough class time to deal with both the conceptual aspects of digital audio AND the mechanics of SuperCollider. There has to be more time spent on coding in-class, not with in class hackathons but with detailed explanation of code that appears on the projector.",
    "Scott is an engaging professor, who has a passion that is palpable for what he is teaching. A weakness is that there is a lot of material to go through, and so it's hard to deeply understand all of the concepts.",
    "I wish we learned how to interact with the software on a more step-by-step basis in class, rather than over readings and extra work you're expected to do. The fact that it was at 9am (on the dot) did not help my intrigue and excitement for the course. Not a lot of people take it, and not everyone met the high standard aimed for in the class, so it can be pretty easy to perform in comparatively.",
    "It moved extremely fast, and I often felt lost in class. It was intimidating being a beginner coder. However, Prof. Petersen was available for office hours and via email to answer questions. The most I learned was what I figured out by myself or during in-class practice sessions. So I think there should be more of the latter."

   "comments": [
    "No. If you are an athlete dont take it. If you know nothing about music theorem dont take it. If you know nothing about programming dont take it. If youre a first year dont take it.",
    "No, not unless you are very into CS",
    "I would! I enjoyed it a lot and you can learn some interesting things",
    "I would recommend this course to another student, but it could be challenging for students without any experience with computer SOME kind of computer music, even if its only beat-making or musescore",
    "I would recommend this course to any student who is interested in music and willing to commit themselves to learning a (likely new) coding language. If you are new to coding, this course will likely be challenging, but overall worth it.",
    "Not really. Not unless you're already well-versed with both computer technology and music.",
    "If one is interested in computer music",
    "Yes, if you're actually interested in learning the language, trying out coding, and working with an expert. But be prepared to do a lot of work on the projects - there were only three large projects though and occasional homework assignments."
