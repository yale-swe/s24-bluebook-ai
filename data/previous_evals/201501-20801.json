    "See question one for summary. I would recommend Maurie's class to anyone with an interest in 19th-c. French literature, art, music, science, or culture. I would also recommend the class to anyone with an interest in 19th and\/or 20th Western Europe and\/or cultural history. I feel the course was particularly instructive re: these different subjects\/approaches.",
    "I would. Great class.",
    "Really a high-level survey course, but I think this works well. It gives good coverage of the period, is a accessible to non specialists, but the theoretical readings open it up to some very challenging approaches. A good balance."

   "comments": [
    "This was not a period of French literature that I was especially familiar with, so the course helped me fill a gap in my knowledge. The class was also helpful insofar as it introduced me to a cultural-historical mode of reading that I had not really encountered before. I got this mostly through the secondary readings, but also through the exercise of the historical presentation and through Maurie's own readings.",
    "I work on nineteenth-century French literature so it was very helpful. I actually liked the survey course aspect as many professors seem to feel obliged to teach courses that are \"out there\" to graduate students."
