   "comments": [
    "Course could have benefited from a little more structure and TAs could have used a little more guidance from faculty; not their fault that faculty seemed a little unenthused.",
    "A wonderful opportunity, I would like to thanks the TAs and Professors for providing the single best class I have ever taken in my academic career.",
    "TAs were very disorganized and never communicated assignments well. More than once the students were caught off guard by an unclear due date. \"Busy work\" assignments were given last minute and important assignments, like the midterm, were not communicated until hours before the midterm took place. TAs didn't respond to emails in a timely manner, leaving things often unclear. Instructors were rarely present and rarely answered emails. Everything I learned in this class I learned because of my group members and not because of the TAs or instructors.",
    "While the goal and intent of the course was noble, I don't think graduate students should be tasked with running a course on their own (essentially what was done). They're inexperienced and incredibly busy, just like the students. As a result, the course was not executed as well as it could\/should have been. If it is offered again, full time faculty must be employed to run the class.Instructions for deliverables were not communicated clearly, often came just before a deadline, and sometimes did not make sense given the goals of the course. At times, I felt the class was treated like a group of elementary school students rather than adult graduate students. Resulted in some frustration and confusion among students.The experience in Copenhagen was wonderful\/incredibly educational and it was all worth it but I wouldn't take the course again if it were offered again using the same format.In addition to the instruction, the syllabus seemed like it was made up class to class, likely a result of the busy-ness of the TAs. Sometimes seemed like the presentations we were giving were just done to fill time. I'd recommend fewer group presentations (once a month with more structure and time) and more structured content about the positions of each country, history of the issues etc. Also, a trip to the UN would really help! As would presentations from delegates, if possible, or a visit to them and NGOs that are directly involved. Getting the inside scoop is more helpful than anything else.",
    "7) This course was primarily run by the TAs, Alark and Kasey. It's clear they put lots of effort into it, but it could have been a bit more organized (e.g. assignments were often given only several days before class). Perhaps organization was sacrificed for more flexibility(and they were very flexible).9) The trip to Copenhagen for the COP turned into a logistical nightmare after access was restricted, but the TAs did a great job of keeping things organized. Something I wish we had done more of though was coming together as a group to work through what had gone on (maybe 2-3 times during the COP).",
    "This course fit very well with my interests in diplomacy and climate change.",
    "The TAs for this class were amazing. They both helped us a lot with organizing in general and taught us a lot. It seemed like they put more effort into this class than the instructors.",
    "Although the instructors actual teaching was often difficult to follow, the class was extremely well organized. Additionally, the instructor did not spend a great amount of time providing explanations herself, but instead provided materials and allowed guests to teach\/provide explanations and examples. The result was a highly effective class. In other words, while the instructor's explanations may not have always been helpful, the class was so efficiently run that it didn't matter.",
    "The trip to COP-15 made up for a lot of the inadequacies of this course. The group work was too much. People got frustrated with the constant requirement to present in class, and there was no system to chastise people who did nothing for the groups. It was really disappointing to watch people attend COP-15 without doing much in the class.",
    "Question 1This was an advanced seminar with very little assigned reading. Most of the work load involved individual research. That said, it would have been helpful for the TAs or the Professor to post important readings, and perhaps for each POD to post key summaries or particularly useful readings in their subject. Personally, I spent a great deal of time searching for adequate and useful information: these efforts could at least be compiled for future examinations of this same topic.Question 3It would have been helpful to have more assignments, if only short and meant to highlight general important principles. There was constant research every week to contribute to our POD presentation, btu I often felt a little lost, unsure of my results. Perhaps brief assignments to highlight major ideas and help students regain direction might be useful, if there is to be a future course.There are unanswered questions above because there was not a professor for this course, rather a few professors that would sometimes provide guidence."

   "comments": [
    "Organization of course itself as unrelated to the trip",
    "The midterm was sprung on us last second and seemed very disorganized but I guess the real negotiations will be to. The deadlines were very fuzzy.",
    "N\/A",
    "The course needs some kind of structure and some centralized organization of responsibilities. TAs were really bad, but at the same time, it's a lot to ask of them to organize an entire course when the professors aren't around or doing much to facilitate classes.",
    "See answer to Question 11 above.",
    "The organization of the course during the semester was lacking. Pod updates were often redundant or not particularly enlightening, assignments were explained last minute and people often didn't know what was going on, and I think we could have focused more attention early on in seeking out stakeholders and planning for the conference rather than doing busy work.",
    "further advanced notice of assignment due dates\/expectations.Also, while I understand this course was supposed to be an advanced seminar, from early on it was apparent that many did not have a good understanding of how the UNFCCC works. It would have been nice to have more lectures by professor Robinson on the process, the different working groups, etc.",
    "organization, should use the knowledgeable instructors far more and do less pod updating.",
    "The TAs were left to teach and run FAR TOO MUCH of this class - and they did an excellent job, but it was FAR TOO MUCH work for them, and seemed a bit ridiculous that they were left to deal with so much - and that we are still graded by the professors, who did not end up knowing our work as well as the TAs did. Anyway, the TA job was a bit much, seemingly, and I felt that the professors often had too much other stuff going on to be as available to the course. There was not enugh guidance overall on the amazing amount of group work and it often felt like a free for all.Also, if there were specific expectations for Copenhagen and for the conference, these needed to be LAID OUT ahead of time and clearly elucidated to us before arriving, and not in an email near the end of the conference - everyone was clearly involved in different work, projects, and endeavors while at the COP and if the TAs expected certain things from everyone while there, they needed to make these known much more clearly. It was frustrating to receive emails near the end telling people they were losing sight of what needed to be done when things had clearly become so chaotic and crazy with all of us being shut out, and people arriving at different times, etc. I feel that everyone was there to get the most out of itthat they could, and this meant that not everyone would accomplish as much as others, or the same kind of work all the time. If you give people freedom to arrive and depart when they wanted, etc...you are leaving them open to creating their own schedules while there and such, and this should have been fine. If this is not what the professors and TAs envisioned, they needed to be clearer from the start.",
    "More clarity in the structure and expectations from students",
    "The pace sometimes seemed a little bit slow. Maybe it could be improved by setting specific topics for the pods each week (like financing or latest text, or main stakeholders) or\/and improving the follow up with the Pods each week.",
    "Responding to student questions about deadlines and expectations.",
    "I don't think we need a full course in order to send people to the conference. Or maybe make it a half semester. The group presentations were awful and took up a ton of time to prepare. I wish we could have used more in class time to actually do our project for the class, it would have been a better use of time.",
    "Pod presentations should probably be more strictly organized and engaging. Also, somehow, each group should make sure to work closely with a delegation or organization from the beginning of the semester.",
    "The student presentations take up to much class time and they are sometimes difficult to follow.",
    "Less group work; more interaction with delegations or NGOs set up before the course begins.",
    "This is the first time this course has been held. It was organized and run predominantly by two TAs that worked tireless and incessantly. There is much commendable praise that they deserve. That said, if the course were to be held again, these issues must be noted:There was a general lack of direction and specifics at the beginning of the course. I felt I had a grasp of what was expected of me and what I could expect only in the fourth or fifth week, after moving class rooms and beginning the POD presentations.There was a great deal of confusion about the importance and role of the 'stakeholder' that PODs were to partner with. Again, only through various consultations with the TAs, and several weeks, did I feel that I had a grasp of the subject.It would be helpful if people can choose their PODs also knowing a bit about their fellow POD members: disparate interests and very different work styles can present a great opportunity to improve on one's group work skills, but can also become a challenging obstacle that will remain until the end of the semester.",
    "I learned the most during the midterm. It would be great to do a simulation earlier in the semester and then repeat it later on.At the same time, I felt that the course could have done more to prepare me for the structure of COP. Since I hadn't gone before, I was quite overwhelmed at first. It would have been helpful to start talking about side-events etc right from Day 1."

Each group was so different, and I did not always compare my group to the others, but it was hard to see some groups be so successful when others were clearly struggling. This led to very different experiences at the COP, which is fine and to be expected. I think that maybe smaller groups would be advantageous, or perhaps not making the ENtire class focused on group work. I realize that at this level, we should know how to sort out group issues and problems by ourselves, but it was highly frustrating to be left to our own devices so much of the time.",
