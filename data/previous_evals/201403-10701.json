   "comments": [
    "It is a difficult course, but you learn a lot. I would recommend it if someone is willing to put in the time and experience frustration at not being able to understand everything.",
    "The class is a good preparatory class for the other synthesis classes and helps reinforce the ideas learned in advanced organic. I would recommend this course for any student, whether it be undergrad or grad, to take this course.",
    "CHEM 523 is a survey course that introduces students to advanced concepts in synthetic organic chemistry including reaction mechanisms, theoretical considerations, and applications in the construction of complex molecules. I would recommend this course to anyone with a serious interest in organic chemistry.",
    "Yes, the class gives you a strong knowledge foundation and toolset for analyzing any organic reaction.",
    "The course is an introduction to synthetic methods and encompasses physical organic and synthetic techniques useful in modern chemistry. It introduces a broad range of topics and is fairly comprehensive. YEs I would recommend the course for any student pursuing a PhD or degree in (organic) chemistry.",
    "The course explores concepts at a surface to slightly deeper level while the burden is on the student to, shall we say, struggle through some of the primary literature. Take it if your'e an undergrad and are going to grad school elsewhere. Grad students, well they probably have to take it.",
    "I think this course is more of a mechanism course than synthetic method course. If you want to choos it please be aware of that.",
    "1\/2 basic phys org concepts and 1\/2 named reactions\/reaction classes. I would recommend this class. Out of all of the classes I took this semester, I learned the most in this one.",
    "Essential class for students of organic chemistry at the advanced undergrad or graduate level. Relatively difficult due to the large amount of material, but it will give you all the basic tools you need as a synthetic chemist.",
    "yes i would recommend it, it is a challenging and different style course that is a good environment for team work and class participation",
    "yes, very useful and fun class. just be prepared for some frustration with the organization"

   "comments": [
    "The course exposed me to a variety of important topics in synthetic organic chemistry. These topics will undoubtedly be important as I progress in my graduate career. It gave me an appreciation for the level of analysis required to be successful in organic synthesis. The strategies developed in this course will most certainly be used during my dissertation research.",
    "The class touched on all of the important factors to the outcome of organic reactions. This is extremely useful as all of the skills can be applied to research, as we conduct a myriad of different reactions.",
    "This course really did not helped deepen my knowledge of chemistry. Lessons were not well taught. There was lack of explanations.",
    "The course exposed me to a lot of knew techniques and topics in synthetic methodology. This will be very useful during research and as I further my studies.",
    "I learned some underlying principles of chemical reactivity and exposure to new reactions. Mechanisms were stressed to help analyze the processes at hand which is a useful skill for future work.",
    "The course encourages me to read a lot of literature, which is helpful for my research career. Also, it covers many useful knowledge for synthetic chemistry.",
    "This class introduced many useful concepts for research in organic chemistry.",
    "This course deepened my knowledge of the subject significantly. It took all of the pieces of synthetic organic chemistry that I had learned from other sources and put the together into a cohesive class. It also introduced many new topics that I had not previously seen, and which are essential to the field of organic chemistry. This course provided a great deal of the background to these methods and gave me exposure to the primary literature reports. This course will contribute to my research immensely by giving a very solid foundation to work from.",
    "right up my alley! the tangents were especially interesting"
