    "I loved this course both for the material covered and for the strength of the professor\/TA. While the reading load is very heavy, I thought it was definitely worth it. That being said, I plan on being an english major so for someone who doesn't love english the course might prove too intense.",
    "If you don't mind doing a lot of reading, this class is a great introduction into the critical study of the popular novel. It is a lot of fun, and not too hard. However, worth noting that mostly english majors takethe course.",
    "I would recommend this course in a heartbeat to anyone. Homework hardly seems like homework: you can curl up in bed or lean back in your comfortable chair and read a Victorian novel and say that you're working hard. Professor Yeazell's dulcet tone make you forget that you are in class learning as you get carried away in the lecture and in her readings. The novels are all very good and very human, and she gives you plenty of time to read each one (NB: she schedules homework -- reading Middlemarch -- over Spring Break). It's something that you really must take.",
    "This was my first English class, and as someone who is not an English major, this class was absolutely excellent. The readings are great and the pacing of them are very manageable. There are only two exams and two papers so the work load is not very high. Professor Yeazell is excellent and such an engaging professor. This is a great class for those individuals who aren't English majors and I'm sure also for those who are.",
    "In retrospect many of the books were not as interesting as I initially thought they were going to be, especially Great Expectations, which was a real disappointment. The Moonstone was a great book, though. I would argue that you should take the class if you want an English class with a light workload, as we only had to write two papers that were between 5-7 pages. However, the books themselves are not that great and Middlemarch was a LITERAL BEHEMOTH!!! Be aware that the book is 800 pages long and you do need to read it. Others have suggested reading it during spring break, but I read it after, during normal school time, and I was able to finish it within two and half weeks, so it is not insurmountable, but be aware that it is really long.",
    "GREAT class. Highly recommended. You really can't beat the reading list (I loved them all except Great Expectations, which I'd read before), and it's a good way to make yourself read long books which you might not otherwise have the stamina for. Yeazell is a great lecturer as well. It's a lot of work though - tons of read, two papers, a midterm and a final. My only complaint is that the tests were a little more nit-picky than I would have expected for a class with so much reading.",
    "A great, diverse overview of the Victorian period, from start to finish, covering a huge range of different stories in as compact a reading list as possible. I would definitely recommend this class to another student, because Professor Ruth Yeazell made the material immediate and important.",
    "I would recommend it. If you're up for doing all the reading--there is a pretty large amount--then you get a lot out of it.",
    "Read six Victorian novels, listen to fabulous lectures from Ruth Yeazell, and spending a little time analyzing them in essay and test form -- and get credit for it! Professor Yeazell is a dream and the books were great (though I found Middlemarch a little difficult to get through). If you like novels from the period, you would definitely enjoy the course!",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class to another student. I was very hesitant at first to take it asa freshman because I thought that the reading might be overwhelming, but I was completely wrong. Although there was a lot of reading the class, the reading was novels and more than that was composed of extremely compelling story lines. Professor Yeazell's lectures were incredible and I never got bored in class. The workload was completely manageable with only 2 papers (with 3 possible due dates), a midterm, and a final. Take the class before you leave Yale!",
    "A fantastic course, if you read fast or have a good deal of time to read. Prof Yeazell recommends you read Middlemarch over spring break\u0097make sure you do! It's a monster of a book to read during school.",
    "I would recommend this class to another student. As an English major who is more focused on pre-18th century literature, The Victorian Novel was a relatively painless way to finish the pre-19th century requirement. The book selection is engaging and the reading doesn't end up feeling like work.",
    "Yes. These books will change your life.",
    "I would DEFINITELY recommend English 265! The reading list was incredible- even though there is a lot of reading you'll actually enjoy doing it! Professor Yeazell was amazing! Her lectures are so interesting and she always brings a new way of thinking about the novel. One of my favorite classes at Yale!",
    "Great taste of Victorian Literature with a really cool professor. She has a beautiful voice and bad-ass leather pants. The work load isn't too much.",
    "I enjoyed this class very much. Make sure you can handle the reading, though: there's a lot of it, and it's really easy to fall behind really fast.",
    "Great class, read some classic Victorian novels (Wuthering Heights, Jane Eyre, Great Expectations, The Moonstone, Middlemarch, Tess of the D'Urbervilles). Take it - lots of reading but flexible when you finish it.",
    "An excellent course. You read a representative selection of the best Victorian novels, and Professor Yeazell is an absolutely wonderful lecturer. The reading load is heavy (especially when you get to Middlemarch) and you may be in danger of getting behind in the reading, but the essays and test workload is highly manageable. Strongly recommended to anyone interested in Victorian literature.",
    "The material is great, and I really enjoyed this class. Yeazell provided a lot of great material about the authors' lives which were enlightening and most of her lectures were good. I thought that references to Freud were made way too much though. But you should take the class because you want to read what's on the syllabus.",
    "Yes. I'd definitely recommend it.",
    "Standard english course in a lot of ways. You will look at themes throughout the novels and understand holistically how the Victorian novels represent a distinct break from those who came before them. You really do need to read the books but there are only six of them so it's not too difficult. A very doable course. If you like the reading list, take it. If you don't, don't. Also, Ruth Yeazell is great. Quote from an awed freshman sitting in on the class, \"Is every professor at Yale that wonderful, or is she just brilliant?\"",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone interested in English. It's a fabulous class with wonderful subject material. The workload is doable- about 6 long novels and two papers over the semester as well as a midterm and final.",
    "This class is a survey of one of the most delightful forms of literature to read in the English major. You read six Victorian novels (which is much more enjoyable than thirteen plays in the Department\u0092s much-too-quick Shakespeare courses) which span the long era and are all very different, but every one is enjoyable. It is a lot of reading, but Professor Yeazell\u0092s lectures are so enjoyable that I\u0092ve already been inspired to go back and read one of the books I missed. The workload other than reading is just right; two essays (with a helpful rewrite option on the first) and a midterm and final exam that are both very reasonable, more so than in most English lectures. Read as much of Middlemarch over spring break as you can; it\u0092s very long but worth it. I would definitely recommend this class to other students. Although I am an English major, my sense is that this class would be enjoyable to any student who likes reading great novels. Section is fun (at least with Annie Pfeifer, my TA). You might not want to take this class at the same time as another novel-based English class, depending on how much reading you can handle, but you can enjoy this class even if you don\u0092t read every last page, and if you\u0092re like me, you\u0092ll want to read more after the semester ends.",
    "Take it! Ruth Yeazell's lectures are fabulous, and section was fun too! And your poor friends who don't take it will be jealous of your reading list. Since the reading is really fun, it feels quite manageable, especially if you get a good start on Middlemarch over spring break. Once I finished the reading for the course, I was very much at a loss because my routine of reading at the gym, before bed, in line at the post office, etc. was all thrown off. Anyway, it's a fantastic class.",
    "Yes! A great course, filled with excellent reads and superb lectures. I'm sure all the teaching fellows could be great, and obviosuly I have no one to compare her with, but section with Fiona Robinson is terrific as well!",
    "A great course, but I think it would be even better as a seminar! You definitely have to adjust to hearing the professor tell you her (often fascinating!) interpretation of the novels and then not be able to really respond. Another problem is the workload--I thought I'd be able to read everything and was very sorry I couldn't keep up--it was still interesting but definitely would have been a better class if I had. Prof Yeazell brings in really interesting outside criticism and even shows you an occasional film adaptation.",
    "Definitely take this class if the reading list excites you. If not, it is a pretty heavy reading load and you may not have the motivation to get through it all",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to anyone who enjoys reading great books and hearing great lectures.",
    "If you're interested in the material, sure.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course -- if you like Victorian Literature, you will love this class."
