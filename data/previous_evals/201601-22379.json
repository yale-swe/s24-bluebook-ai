    "ENGL 672 covers Milton's prose and poetry across the course of his career from the early lyrics through his pamphlet writings, and finally, his longer narrative poems. The class addresses the most influential critical writings to shape Milton studies across the past several decades and attempts to draw out some of the key questions that inform recent Milton scholarship. I would definitely recommend the course.",
    "This is a hard class. There is a lot to read and write. However, I highly recommend it not only to the early modernists but also to all students who are interested in English literature in general. Just take it!",
    "eye-opening for students of Milton to his socio-political sides."

   "comments": [
    "I don't think that the material that we covered in this class is likely to directly impact upon my dissertation research, but I felt as if the breadth of the critical readings helped to enrich my understanding of the field and its history. It was great to have the opportunity to familiarize myself with some new critical approaches and to look again at other classic works from a new point of view.",
    "I am an early modernist, but I am a neophyte in Milton studies. Nevertheless, Prof. Roger's class has significantly deepened my knowledge of Milton and helped me think about what kind of research I want to do for my dissertation. At one point Professor Rogers even tailored the classroom discussion a bit to help me think deeper about my research questions. Thank you, Professor Rogers!",
    "On a pragmatic level, this course introduced in an effective way, the important scholarship on Milton, both the seminal pieces of work and the more recent. This solid introduction to the body of Milton scholarship was crucial to my own development as a scholar, and has made me more confident as I move forward.",
    "essential for students of early modern literature."
