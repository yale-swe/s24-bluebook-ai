   "comments": [
    "It's like writing, but it's fun.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS. You will look at every movie differently and learn to appreciate so many elements that you never did before, while also learning how to write your own script.",
    "In a heartbeat. Fun and informative way to learn about a new writing technique.",
    "Absolutely. This is one of the best seminars ever. Camille does a great job designing the class that her students need to produce their best work. We really bonded as a group in a way that was unique to this class. It was really satisfying, and not much work at all -- in fact, I would have loved to have been required to do even more writing for Camille!",
    "If you get in, take this class!!! Probably my favorite class at Yale. It's the creative writing class that we all wish we could take, but can't seem to find. Very interesting discussions, very reasonable workload, and Prof. Thomasson is the best!",
    "Take it if you're interested in screenwriting. Developing your own story under an actual screenwriter is also a tremendous opportunity.",
    "Absolutely take this class if you get in. It is incredibly fun and you don't have to want to be a professional screenwriter to get a lot out of it.",
    "See above!",
    "If you get in, definitely take this course. It's such a unique opportunity, and Camille is wonderful. The perfect CR\/D class.",
    "Take this course. Camille is a darling human being, and she allows you the opportunity to try your hand at screenwriting in a relaxed environment. Go for it!",
    "I would highly recommend the Screenwriter's Craft. Not only did I learn about how to formulate a story for the silver screen, I also became a more thorough and precise viewer of films. What is more, Professor Thomasson is a joy: energetic and compassionate, she keeps classes varied and interesting. Though the fact that this class is a residential college seminar means it won't always be offered, I would urge anyone with the chance to take it to do so."
