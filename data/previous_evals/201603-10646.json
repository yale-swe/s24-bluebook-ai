    "Cool economic models",
    "Decent overview of how the economy works both domestically and internationally",
    "I developed much greater macroeconomic insight and a better understanding of current macroeconomic discussions.",
    "Intro Macro is a course every student should take. If you were disappointed by Intro Micro, this course is completely different. You learn how the actual economy works and can apply what you learn to the real world. It's also interesting how macro integrates history, public policy, etc.",
    "I learned absolutely nothing from the lecture or the section. I had to teach myself everything. Going to class and section was a waste of my time.",
    "From this course, I learned the basics about how macroeconomic analysis works and applied it to current world economic events. I learned about the AS\/AD Model, and how changes in government spending impact other parts of the economy.",
    "Very interesting class. Best part of class was the connection to everyday events. Special time to take the class with the Presidential election this fall",
    "I learned about the basics of macroeconomics, (from AS\/AD model, to exchange rates.",
    "I learned a lot about interest rates, the Fed, unemployment, and inflation.",
    "This is a basic macro econ course that teaches you how to work through the topics",
    "This class helped me gain a much better understanding of the macroeconomy. I thought the textbook was very well written and the problem sets really helped to reinforce concepts.",
    "Very little.",
    "In ECON 116, we learned how the macroeconomy works -- learned about the multiplier effect, how changes in demand-side and supply-side policies affect the macroeconomy.",
    "I learned general macroeconomic knowledge including how to understand the different economic announcements made and the importance and impact of those results on the general outlook of the economy\/society.",
    "I got a basic understanding of macroeconomics which was great to have. I learned how to use and understand the macroeconomic models.",
    "Basic introduction knowledge of macroeconomics",
    "Basic understanding of domestic and international macroeconomic forces.",
    "Ah the intro Econ classes at Yale leave a lot to be wished for. I don't think that the proper material was covered in the lecture. Professor Fair assumed that we already knew a lot of things that a lot of people did not know",
    "The ability to look at news, and explain phenomena with economics",
    "Overview of macroeconomics and knowledge about the current markets.",
    "I had to teach myself everything and section helped a little bit!",
    "A basic understanding of the macroeconomy. Useful for better understanding news\/policy related to the economy.",
    "Learned very much about the macroeconomic approach of society.",
    "A pretty good introduction to macroeconomics.",
    "I learned the basics of how the American economy works and a little bit on how an open world economy works.",
    "I learned about how the overall economy works.",
    "I learned a lot about how the economy works, especially as related to fiscal and monetary policy.",
    "I got a general sense of the theory and dynamics of macroeconomics and the way that the economy work sin the world. I think it helped me get a greater insight into the beginnings of finance as well, and it helped me become a more diligent and selective news reader.",
    "I learned more about how macroeconomics and current events interact.",
    "Offered a great introduction to the workings of the macroeconomy. I came away with much more knowledge about how the U.S. and global economies function, and I feel much more comfortable reading financial news now.",
    "This class helped give me an introductory knowledge of macroeconomics hat I find is invaluable to understanding the way the modern world works. It's interesting to learn how interactions between firms, countries, and currencies have an impact on the economy.",
    "Interesting class that reviews the basics of macroeconomics and also incorporates current news",
    "I think I gained knowledge about how most of the things we hear about on the news--interest rates, other economic indicators--affect the economy in the long term, and how economic phenomena are related to each other.",
    "Basic skills and aptitudes in macroeconomics.",
    "Macroeconomic theory and its relation to the current US economy.",
    "I learned how to analyze the economy using macroeconomics and learned how to apply my knowledge to current news events.",
    "I learned how to analyze more global, far-reaching economic situations through various models and intuition (at least on a qualitative level). I worked through the various implications of random small changes in government spending, tax rates, consumer demand, and other related quantities. This course showed me how involved and interconnected the economy is (and I know that the model we used is probably a vast oversimplification of the real world).",
    "I gained a better understanding of Macroeconomics after my AP Macro class in high school, and I gained the ability to critically analyze current events in macro policy.",
    "I learned about the major factors at play in the global and domestic economy, -'d the basic theory behind them.",

    "I was really great to be able to look at the economy and actually start to understand what is going on a little bit. I didn't really understand the structure of our economy at all before taking this course and now I feel very confident with the basics.",
    "I got a decent overview of the macroeconomic principles that drive the US and world economies. Additionally I got to learn how an economic model is developed, as Professor Fair structured the class around the development of a basic economic model for the US economy.",
    "I gained a basic understanding of trade policy, monetary policy, GDP, and other macroeconomic concepts.",
    "Ray Fair is a terrible professor. Everything I learned, I learned from the textbook he wrote. The textbook is a font of useful information.",
    "How the economy works!! I now understand how economies work: GDP, Stock Markets, Bonds, Housing Markets, Recessions and Inflations etc. I learnt a whole lot.",
    "This course was a great introduction to macroeconomic concepts and topics. Professor Fair did a great job of tailoring his teaching to his class, and he presented the material in a manner that engaged his students. I became more confident in my ability to relate current economic news and issues to the macroeconomic concepts I was learning in this class. I became more aware of macroeconomic concepts present in my everyday life, and I was very pleased with this course."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The lecture is very boring and long.",
    "Somewhat disorganized lectures, but the textbook is very good",
    "A pretty big weakness is that it's more effective to just read the textbook than it is to attend lecture",
    "Intro Macro with Fair is a solid beginning in macroeconomics, but suffers a few key flaws. First, Professor Fair is very nice and knowledgable but is not a compelling lecturer and can bore students with his insipid delivery. However, his focus on the AS\/AD model really helps to illustrate how the macroeconomy works. In addition, he focuses on giving students a strong intuition about macroeconomic changes and variables, and I think he is ultimately successful. The main strength of the course was the textbook, which Fair wrote. Advice to other students: the textbook is the KEY to the course. It helps make up for Fair's uninspiring lectures, and is very well-written and will help you do well on all assessments.",
    "Like all of the core econ classes, you can pretty much just skip every lecture and teach yourself out of the book. Honestly, Professor Fair was so boring I was disincentivized to go to class because I knew I wouldn't be able to focus on what he said and just reading the book would be a better use of my time. I'm sure he's a brilliant economist, but he is not engaging at all.",
    "The professor is completely incapable of articulating his lessons. He goes completely off topic.",
    "The strengths are that the tests are curved, the TAs are excellent, and Prof. Fair is a committed professor. There were times, however, when certain ideas were not explained well in class. Not because of bad teaching; there were just times when definitions weren't given, thus leaving the students to figure them out for themselves.",
    "Teacher was a little boring, and TA seemed to engage students more than teacher. Cold calling in a lecture also isn't great because many times students would be sick and miss class and then lose points because they were called on that day",
    "Strengths are that the textbook is very helpful. Weaknesses are that the midterm solutions were returned very late in the semester.",
    "Lectures weren't too helpful. I basically learned from the textbook. If lectures followed the course material more closely and powerpoint had more notes in them, that would be helpful.",
    "I think professor fair is great and knowledgeable. However, the lecturers are not structured well and I found them hard to follow. Professor Fair knows so much, but the nature of the slides in class made lectures very difficult",
    "The course needs better in class teaching",
    "I thought the lectures could be more clear and include specific practice problems more often but other than that I thought it was a very good course.",
    "Interesting and useful material. Lectures were very dry and confusing.",
    "Strengths -- solid textbook, really good content. Weakensses -- Slides were terrible. If Fair continues to teach, he should please make an effort to put more effort into the slides. He can be a digressive speaker and he knows this -- he should make an effort to craft thoughtful slides so that people can follow along when they lose his train of thought.",
    "The teaching structure for lectures was very disorganized and often hard to follow. The course content was interesting enough, but the way it was presented was rather soporific.",
    "This is a great survey course, but I wish the lecture slides are a little better organized.",
    "The textbook (written by prof. Fair) was fantastic. The structure and curriculum flowed well and made for an enjoyable class, but the lectures were often not particularly helpful. News analysis, conversations about talking through situations and analysis of concepts were good, but derivations of formulas and lecture slides were quite useless. Section \/ textbook were necessary to have any clue what was happening.",
    "Nothing to change.",
    "The material is difficult to engage with and the format of the class is difficult to follow. The professor is not exciting, the problem sets were unhelpful, and the exam content was surprising. My teaching fellow didn't even hold office hours which made it very difficult to seek help as extra tutoring sessions were few and far between. The course seemed to be set up against students.",
    "Poorly taught, Professor Fair is very nice but not the best at explaining complex models, and also he's very boring.",
    "Weaknesses: no one comes to lecture lectures are sometimes quite boring textbook price strengths: material TAs workload",
    "Awful professor, class was worthless",
    "Ray Fair is not a good lecturer, despite his obvious mastery of the material. The lectures were miserable, and his point system forced us to attend. I learned everything in a few days before each exam and learned almost nothing from the lectures. The textbook is excellent.",
    "Lectures were hard to learn from and filled with a lot of unnecessary information",
    "Would have liked if there were two midterms.",
    "This class was very badly taught, you had to teach yourself by reading the textbook, lecture was not helpful. The psets were not connected to lecture at all and were all from the book and the exams were very out of the blue, we never really knew what to expect. The class was not clear in what we were expected to learn and know.",
    "The professor was a terrible teacher, but my TF was really good and made up for it.",
    "Strength: The material is interesting. The assignments to do macro readings for lectures was fun. The problem sets covered the material well and did not take ages to do. Weakness: I wished the professor would provide more organized and typed notes or slides and try harder to have his lectures be comprehensive instead of telling us to read his book for more information.",
    "The strength is the core of what's learned and the actual ideas of macroeconomics. Also the TF's are super good at explaining. However, the lecture teaching was at times very uninteresting and scattered. Also the big variation in what's taught depending on the teacher is a weakness.",
    "A weakness is the lack of coherence among the TA's. How they teach, what they teach, and how well the teach it varies greatly. A strength is the accessibility of the professor.",
    "Section should play a more important role in the course, and the lectures should be more organized. The lecture slides especially could be more informative and should align better with the content instruction.",
    "Lectures were boring and toward the end of the semester not well attended.",
    "Strengths: - very relevant\/interesting course material. - problem sets\/exams relevant and interesting Possible improvements: - The \"news\" sections were often somewhat unfocused. I enjoyed it more when professor Fair chose relevant news to explain to us.",
    "The material is interesting and useful, but the instruction was unclear at times",
    "The strengths were the practical pieces of information we learned--like the term structure of interest rates. The weaknesses were the lecture notes, which weren't entirely that helpful and difficult to follow during lecture; however, this wasn't a big issue because the textbook was so helpful.",
    "Professor Fair could be more engaging and more instructive of actual material on the exams.",
    "The course was well organized because the material built upon itself and required students to use prior tools to analyze new concepts. Sometimes the course felt as though the slides could have been more explanatory.",
    "The course was effective in showing how the economy functions and developing intuition for how the economy is effected by various shocks or changes to the system. I would have liked to see more hard numbers and mathematical examples, as I think this would have helped my understanding of the concepts (although maybe this is just because I'm a math major?). We did derive reduced forms of some of the models, but they were never really used, and by the end of the course everything was qualitative and intuition-based. As a result, I didn't really have a firm grasp of how big in magnitude the effects we studied were and, if the effects were in opposite directions, which one won out (other than just pure memorization of \"this effect is stronger than the other\" with no real intuition provided). I also would have appreciated more detailed feedback on the midterm and problem sets, as it was mostly just check marks and x's and I wasn't really sure what exactly I did wrong most of the time.",
    "The textbook is great. Lecture was almost never helpful.",
    "Poorly organized and lecture was incredibly boring and disorganized",
    "The course begins very slowly. The size of the lecture makes it almost impossible to stay in focus and awake the whole class. Professor Fair is incredibly knowledgable in the subject but his lecture style is monotone and dull. I found that the best moments of the class came towards the end when half of the class stopped coming to lecture, and the interested students remaining and Fair engaged in conversations about Macro.",
    "The lecture is not engaging. There need to be better lecture slides as well.",
    "i liked the current event\/new part",
    "The lectures at times could be extremely dry. Professor Fair's slides had very little information on them and seemed to be written more as short notes for himself rather than as information for students to refer to.",
    "The course becomes very applicable in its later terms. I think the material is very straightforward, and students can use the models we learn in class and apply them to real life events.",
    "Very well taught, and Professor Fair has a deep knowledge of the subject. Also the material covered was very useful and interesting. Also, the course relates topics taught in class to current news, which helps us gain a better understanding of the concepts taught.",
    "The strength of this course was the textbook, it was well-written and corresponded well to the problem sets. The weakness of this course was the lecture: the notes were disorganized and poorly written, the lecture was long-winded and confusing without giving much content, and it was deathly boring. Going to lecture was not worth the time.",
    "The lectures weren't necessary if you read the book.",
    "The biggest weakness of the course to me was that the development of models and theories were not as concrete as I was looking for. There was a lot of storytelling, with minimal engagement in the mathematics of the theories.",
    "Lecture was pretty poor. The professor did not have clear slides and I relied on section to really understand the material taught in class. Also, I think calling on students during class wasted a lot of time. Students who want to know the news will read it anyway and those who don't don;t really learn anything by cold calling.",
    "Strengths: The textbook, TA's, and the curve. Weaknesses: Ray Fair's teaching style.",
    "The best strength of this class is the textbook. Ray and Oster and Case wrote the best textbook I have ever read at Yale. Possibly in my life. This textbook was a life saver. It had everything you needed. The TAs are great. If you get Esteban, you will have an amazing time. he explained all the things that were not well explained in lecture. Ray Fair is a gret professor. Sometimes he glossed over things in lecture and he would sometimes not explain things well.",
    "The course was excellent! The textbook's importance cannot be understated, and Professor Fair and the TFs were always there to help explain topics in more detail; however, I think the lecture slides could have been more informative. Oftentimes, the notes went into mathematical detail that confused some of my classmates; however, the class was great in aggregate."

   "comments": [
    "I am not majoring in Econ and I definitely still learned a lot of econ and thought it was much better than micro. The lecture was just horribly boring.",
    "Sure, you cover a lot of topics that help you better understand economic news in the real world.",
    "Take it with Fair; the class is VERY easy week-to-week (you only have to spend about 45 minutes weekly to do the problem sets, as they're graded on a completion basis) and you just have to kind of crunch a week or two before the exam to teach yourself the material via the textbook, which is a much better resource for learning than is attending lecture to be quite honest",
    "I would recommend this course. Many students will complain about Fair and the course, but overall I thought it was a strong introduction to macro. If you read the textbook and pay a moderate amount of attention in lecture, you will learn a lot and have a good grasp on macro. Students will have to be active and diligent though, as simply showing up for lecture won't be enough.",
    "Intro Macro is a course every student should take. A lot of students are turned off by Intro Macro and vow to never take another economics class. If you were disappointed by Intro Micro, this course is completely different. You learn how the actual economy works and can apply what you learn to the real world. It's also interesting how macro integrates history, public policy, etc. The material learned in this class will make you much more able to read the front page of the newspaper without confusion.",
    "I would strongly recommend this class. Professor Fair really cares about teaching, and does his best to engage students with current news and events. Also, the book required for the class, which was written by the professor together with his wife, is really clear and helps a lot.",
    "Unless you have to take this class for a major requirement, I would not recommend this class -- especially when taught by this professor.",
    "No.",
    "Yes, but preferably not in the fall",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to all Yale students, because the material is really important for everyone to understand (more so, I would say, than intro micro). Now I understand the financial news... just the other day I overheard a conversation between some people discussing the economy, and I actually understood what they were saying! It's like I learned a new language--the language of economics!",
    "It's good to know about the macroeconomy of the world we live in. Now I can actually understand the Wall Street Journal :)",
    "Take it if you need it, not too bad",
    "If you have to take macro I would recommend doing it with Ray Fair. The textbook and problem sets were useful and not too time consuming.",
    "Yes -- I'd recommend. It does help you understand the US economy (global economy too). Can be dry at times, but it's actually interesting if you check-in and engage.",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone who is interested in learning the major economic movers in our society as well as to understand generally what's going on in our economy and its relationship to other world economies. This class would be great for anyone, not just economic majors as you learn a lot of skills and knowledge that would benefit you in everyday life and generally make you a more knowledgable person.",
    "It is a mandatory course for the Econ major, so if the student is doing econ, the recommendation isn't really relevant. That being said, this course provided a good foundation for macroeconomics and understanding things like the government spending multiplier and how economic policies actually work (an understanding that seems to be horribly lacking in the general American populace)",
    "I would recommend taking this course, especially after you have taken intro to micro and you are not sure whether you like it enough to continue with Econ. After intro to Micro, I couldn't decide if I like or dislike economics, so I took this course. I found it much more enjoyable than my first semester of econ, despite people's warning about how poorly organized the lectures are. Definitely recommend taking!",
    "Far better than the other macro section. Professor Fair's lectures aren't always super helpful but he makes for a laid back class that I am glad I took this semester. Assessments are interesting and there is a fat curve. Don't be swayed by the lackadaisical attitude of the many students who zone out for or skip class.",
    "No. See above.",
    "Only take if if you have to",
    "As someone who dropped this course in the spring, I strongly prefer Fair's ECON 116 over Tsvynsky's. The material is more intuitive, and it is much clearer what you will be tested on This course is not exciting, but it gives you a good economic sense for the macroeconomy. Weekly P sets, midterm and a final, and optional section, made for a doable workload.",
    "This course is quite poorly taught. If you really have to take it in the fall, make sure to get into Ahsan's section, he is an amazing TA and the only person who will really teach you microeconomics.",
    "DON'T TAKE THIS CLASS UNLESS YOU HAVE TO, TAKE IT WITH DIFFERENT PROFESSOR. The material is really interesting but the teaching was so so bad.",
    "Do not take unless you absolutely have to. It is not a demanding course, but it is terribly boring. Professor Fair is not an engaging lecturer to say the least. The material is easily learned solely using the book.",
    "Not an extremely difficult class but hard to learn from. Lectures are boring and hard to learn from so you need to go to section and read the textbook. If you do not put in the work weekly you are going to end up cramming. Format was midterm final but the final was worth 40% of the grade and very difficult.",
    "Take if you're interested in macroeconomic theory.",
    "If you have to take intro macro or want to take it do it, you'll learn about how the American economy works which is actually interesting but I would not recommend taking it in the fall. Professor Fair's lectures were very hard to engage with and you had to teach yourself the class by reading the books. The psets ask questions that you can find the answers to in the books, however it was very unclear what the midterm and final were going to expect us to know. If you're debating between this class and another one, don't take this class.",
    "I'd recommend the course but not the professor.",
    "Not a fun course but necessary for economics majors.",
    "I would recommend this course because the material is interesting and the problem sets covered the material well and did not take ages to do. However, I think the professors at Yale teaching this course are not that good (at teaching- their research and publications are great). Professor Fair spoke softly and went on tangents, and he did not provide organized or typed notes or slides and often told us to read his book for more information.",
    "Only take it if you have to for your major. Make sure you're in Ahsan's section - he makes the course so much better.",
    "I would recommend it in that macroeconomics is important to learning and knowing more about the world we live in. Also, it's super interesting generally in theory. However, I would make sure that the student knows they would gel with the teacher. That's super important in this class and on'e ability to learn in it.",
    "Make sure you find a TA that is right for you.",
    "This course offers a great introduction to the macroeconomy, and I would recommend it to anyone who wants to understand how economies function. Ray Fair' lectures could be dry, but he was good at explaining concepts and really gave me a good intuition about how the economy works.",
    "Yes I would recommend this clas to another student. Anyone who wants a cursory understanding of macroeconomics needs to take this.",
    "I highly recommend this class. The class covers material that most people need to know, to have any understanding about the economic components of contemporary political debates. The lectures are very good. Professor Fair might not be the most vibrant lecturer but his lectures are insightful and much better (more concise and relevant), it seems, than the textbook. Listen to the lectures, take some notes, and the exams\/problem sets should be a breeze.",
    "Yes",
    "Don't take it with Ray fair unless you can get Ahsan as your TA",
    "I'd recommend this course if you need to take macro for your major, but I think it's less valuable than micro. You may see bad reviews of Professor Fair; the people who have left these reviews in all likelihood attended ~3 lectures but are still mad they didn't breeze through the course. If you go to class, put in a normal amount of effort, and have the stamina to deal with a professor with a monotone voice (which, honestly, is kind of a petty thing to let ruin a class), then it'll be fine.",
    "I would not recommend taking this course unless it's necessary for your major. The lectures are confusing and are not connected to the problem sets or sections.",
    "With a different professor, this course could be interesting and very relatable to the current economy.",
    "Econ 116 was a good introduction to macroeconomics course. I would recommend this course to any student who wants to learn more about and have a better understanding of the economy at large and\/or needs the course for their major.",
    "This class was amazing. If you actually work, you get really engaged with the material and will enjoy it.",
    "If you're interested in learning some qualitative intuition for how the economy works, take this class. It is useful for seeing patterns and as someone who hadn't taken a macro class before, I learned a lot. However, the lectures aren't the most engaging and as a math major, I found myself wanting more rigor and numbers at times. I wouldn't recommend the class one way or the other; if you think you're interested, take it, and if you're not, don't. The class is basically what you think it would be.",
    "If you must take it go ahead. If not, I would not recommend.",
    "Only if you need to take it",
    "A very interesting course, and a great professor to learn it from if you can make it through a month or two of boredom and can find ways to keep focussed.",
    "Yes, a necessary course",
    "i think it's good to have a general understanding of the economy for life in general, so yes",
    "I would recommend this class to any student considering a major that relates to economics. This is a fundamental course in the field that is worth taking, even if it is the only or last economics course you take at Yale.",
    "Intro macro is meant to be a general overview of different macroeconomic principles. I genuinely enjoyed the course, but I think it's helpful to come in with some type of idea of why it is you want to study macro. If you can find the ways to apply what you're learning to an area of interest, I think the course can definitely be very rewarding. Generally very straightforward. Attend lecture and take notes on what's taught. Read the book. Ask questions in section. I would say that Professor Fair is also someone who is incredibly interested in being engaged with students (even if it doesn't seem that way in lecture) so always feel free to ask him questions after class.",
    "Yes. Would recommend it because it covers very useful material and relates it to current news events to gain a deeper understanding. Also, Professor Fair is an amazing professor, and is always willing to help his students.",
    "I would not recommend this course, but it is required for a lot of majors. In that sense, Yale seems to get lazy with required courses, they're often boring, dry and unhelpful. This course does not need to be this bad or this frustrating--any of the TAs would be better lecturers than Professor Fair is.",
    "Yeah it's an interesting semester and not horribly difficult if you do the readings",
    "I took this course because I had to. I think everyone should take macroeconomics because everyone should have a general understanding of how government policies impact them, but this particular class was not well taught. I learned very little in lecture and instead relied on reading the text and sections to learn.",
    "No, take the second semester Econ class with a different professor if you get the chance.",
    "Yes. Take it with Ray Fair. He teaches you based on instinct and not maths. At the end of the course, you know you can apply the concepts you learnt in life outside the classroom anywhere in the world. he doesn't focus on the calculations but on the main concepts.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. The topics presented in this class are integral to real world economic fluency and understanding, and Professor Fair does a great job of explaining these topics whenever anyone has further questions. I thoroughly enjoyed taking this class, and the workload is not overly difficult."
