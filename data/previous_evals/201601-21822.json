   "comments": [
    "Sounds interesting, but the co-teaching and history side sort of ruins it - randomly jumping between one group of native americans to another with no real link made it pretty difficult to follow. In hindsight I wish I'd taken it credit D, but I wouldn't even recommend that - whilst the grading is so harsh that it'll ruin you if you take it for letter grade, it is nowhere near rewarding\/easy enough to waste a credit D on. Would recommend probably any other freshman seminar.",
    "Interesting material, the class needs some structural improvements. Not too much work but substantial papers.",
    "A very good class that would have benefited from a sharper focus. Most of it focuses on early American history involving the Native Americans and the African slaves. While most people probably have already learned about such things thoroughly in middle\/high school history classes, analyzing them through the lenses of linguistics and power dynamics helped helped me understand them in a new light and really enriched my understanding of those events. The course itself is a unique blend of history and linguistics, and of a seminar-style and lecture-style class, combinations that were not always successful but that definitely made the class interesting. Workload is reasonable and professors (one for history and one for linguistics) were very nice and clearly passionate about their respective subjects.",
    "I do not recommend this course unless you are really specifically interested in this subject of historical linguistics. The lectures were somewhat interesting but there was never any meaningful class discussion, which seems like a waste of a seminar setting and brilliant professors.",
    "I would recommend this class to a student who has a developed interest in either linguistics or history, because it will supply plenty of food for thought on both topics. On the whole, because the two sides of the class felt somewhat disjointed, a student without investment in either topic might feel confused or unsure of what the point is."
