    "Depends on your advisor, but I highly recommend taking this course to get credit for outside lab work.",
    "The biggest strength of this course is that it gives you a good amount of flexibility to do what you want to do with it. You can work on a research topic you are very passionate about, so even though the workload can be a lot sometimes (i.e. the crunch I went through to get the stimuli ready before starting testing), it doesn't feel like meaningless effort. Seeing how much you can do, you really feel confident in your abilities.",

    "Yes- if you're working in a lab in a cogsci field, take this course.",
    "Yes, I would especially recommend this course to a student who wants to pursue research in the future. It exposes you to what that is and how it would look like in the purest way possible.",
    "Absolutely!"
