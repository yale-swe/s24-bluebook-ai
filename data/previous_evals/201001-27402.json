    "Yes.",
    "I would definitely recommend it. It is a class on environmental and social issues in Brazil, all taught in Portuguese. Gives students access to a wide variety of texts, ideas, and discussions.",
    "This was a really interesting class where we covered many socio-environmental issues of Brazil that you would never learn otherwise. It's a great opportunity to improve your reading, writing, listening, and mainly speaking skills in Portuguese. And Tania is a wonderful professor. A lot of work, but mostly worth it.",
    "This class was absolutely amazing! I would definitely reccomend it to everyone!",
    "Social and environmental issues in contemporary Brazil, as seen through articles, research, and multimedia presentations."
