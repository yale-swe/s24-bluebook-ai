   "comments": [
    "This class changed my life. I knew almost nothing about feminism and queer\/lgbtq topics before, and this class gave me a sampling of these two histories. The questions you talk about in class will keep you thinking all week. Such a great course!!Warning: There is a lot of reading!!",
    "If you are deeply interested in feminist and queer theory, take this class. Otherwise, take something more introductory. If you've never been exposed to this material at all, you will likely feel massively out of your depth.That being said, Prof. Homans is BRILLIANT, and she makes the class (and the huge amount of reading) totally worth it.",
    "If you're a WGSS major and you have to take this course, try to get the most out of it. It can sometimes be a lot of reading, but the writing assignments aren't too bad at all. This course is more like a historic overview of feminist and queer theory. Personally, I enjoyed the later, more contemporary things we covered, not so much earlier works.",
    "I would recommend it if you like theory, WGSS, English, or want to work with Homans and have great class discussions reading very crucial and relevant material. I had trouble understanding all the theory and getting through all the theory at times but Homans' thoughts and my peers' opinons on the material clarified what I read and really made the class great for me. The two essays we wrote were not too bad (one 5 pg one 15 pg) and Homans offered a lot of support for both. The last essay was really long but if you start early you should be fine.",
    "It's all theory so be prepared for that. Discussion can get muddled as there is a lot to cover and opportunity for confusion between the readings. The last assignment is confusing.",
    "A fascinating and intensive overview of important pieces, thinkers, and ideas in feminist and queer theory. Incredibly valuable, definitely would recommend. Prof Homans is excellent, easy to contact, and very understanding about how demanding her course is. I'd guess it depends a lot on the group of students, but ours were great. Take this class if you like theory and you can get in!",
    "Great overview of important issues and authors in feminist and queer theory. I recommend taking an intro course first, perhaps Intro to LGBT Studies.",
    "I would recommend it to anyone because of how important the material is."
