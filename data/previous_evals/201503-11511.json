   "comments": [
    "It is really a great course. You can have a basic and relatively comprehensive understanding of the neurobiology field.",
    "The course is ideal for someone who does not have knowledge of neuroscience. I would not recommend this course to someone who already has general neuroscience knowledge.",
    "A cursory overview of some parts of neuroscience with an emphasis on molecular and cellular aspects. For someone who has never taken a neuroscience course this is essential but for someone with a background in this type of neuroscience there is not much to gain from this class except a review of material.",
    "Get ready to learn a lot and then be ravaged on the final. Take it for the knowledge but if youre an undergrad student, prepare your GPA.",
    "A broad survey course of basic neurobiology",
    "It is a helpful introductory course covering basic principles about different fields in neuroscience, so I would like to recommend it to fellow students.",
    "It is a overview of the molecular, cellular and circuit levels of the nervous system. It was a good and challenging class.",
    "Yes, this course is interesting and useful.",
    "A good review of neurobiology. I would recommend to course to other students if they have not taken a neurobiology course. Otherwise, the course is still a good review of neurobiology topics."

   "comments": [
    "My research is human neuroimaging, so the majority of the topics covered during the course were not directly relevant to my dissertation research. However, the nervous system is intrinsically interesting, so I appreciated learning new topics nonetheless.",
    "I am not sure that this course taught me things I had not learned from previous neuroscience classes, as such it became largely about remembering words rather than learning concepts. However, I feel I am an unfair judge of this class because it is meant as a general neuroscience class. If this were my first neuroscience class I believe I would feel much differently but as a graduate student it was largely review.",
    "It deepened my knowledge to a great extent but demanded too much time for outside studying and took away from my lab rotation.",
    "This introductory course covered basic principles about different fields in neuroscience and made me more prepared to learn about more advanced research.",
    "This course has deepen a lot of my knowledge.",
    "The course was a good review of neurobiology and systems neuroscience."
