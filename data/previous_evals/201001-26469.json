    "Question 7: Professor Eckelman was a fantastic teacher. He was good at explaining challenging concepts and actively engaged all of the students.Question 8: This was one of the most valuable courses I took in my time at F&ES. It provides a solid skill set in a complex field that is rapidly growing.",
    "I audited this course which was a great experience for me. The discussions and lecture material were great supplements to my other work and sima-pro is a very useful tool. If I had had more time in my schedule I would have loved to actually take the class for credit- but I recommend that students take it even if they only have time to audit.",
    "LCA is on the rise in importance, not just within industrial ecology but with wider applications. The tool will be great to have in my belt in any future position. I'm so glad FES offered it this spring and I strongly suggest it be continued.",
    "This was the most useful class I have taken at FES. I really learned a great deal about LCA and its nuance."

    "Learning how to develop a very useful set of LCA skills. I also gleaned a great deal from our case studies and the final projects.",
    "The course project.",
    "This course provides students in the industrial ecology track with a valuable and employable skill.",
    "The first LCA course at yale!",
    "I really enjoyed the readings. It was helpful walking through them together, as many were dense, and I never got everything out of them on my own that Matt picked up on. The group projects were all pretty interesting. It was a nice balance of practicum and readings. Matt is fantastic, flexible, and willing to patiently walk you through basics if you don't understand something.",

    "We need access to additional LCA resources (books, journals, etc.) through the Yale Library and the Center for Industrial Ecology.",
    "Some of the homework assignments are poorly structured.",
    "More examples and use of SimaPRO in class would have been very helpful.",
    "The second half of the semester we walked through several LCA studies together. That was a little slow, since we could spend an hour or more on a 6 page paper, but the subject matter was dense and I never picked up on everything that Matt did. The project updates were a little tedious, since if contacts hadn't gotten back to folks, there wasn't much to say. I think there was likely more material that Matt could have covered. He presented an overall view of LCA, but it would have been good to hear more of the stories on the LCAs he's completed and his experience using the software.I also enjoyed the Hitchhiker's guide to LCA book, but that wasn't required reading. I wouldn't have minded more assigned reading from there.",
    "The groups seemed imbalanced in terms of skill levels.It would have been nice to have seen other LCA software\/approaches."

    "Excellent. Professor Eckelman was very helpful.",
    "Matt was available more than any instructure I have ever had, and was very approachable and helpful.",
    "The TA was incredibly accessible.",
    "Instructor was very helpful in both explaining the theories as well as helping students with technical issues.",
    "Matt was great. He knows the strengths and weaknesses of the SimaPro software, and emphasized where to put our energy (not to waste time on details of the software, but to think more broadly about our scope and implications of our final product). He also spent a ton of time with me and my team, which was really generous of him.Also, there were some engineers and chemists in our class, but Matt was nice enough to include a few of us without hard science backgrounds in the course, and kept the discussion of the material at an understandable level and good pace.",
    "Matt was one of the most engaged instructors I have ever had. He was willing to spend significant time helping students with even the most mundane problems."

    "This course is one of only a handful of courses at F&ES that teaches a specific skill set. Learning these skills has been extremely helpful, especially since my background is in Industrial Ecology. Life cycle assessments have become a central component of my research. My only complaint is that F&ES didn't offer this course during my first year here.",
    "It is very important in my focal area of Industrial Ecology, and I'm greatful that I was able to participate in the first course ever given on this topic. It may be the most practical and useful class I'll take at FES",
    "Fits nicely for students who focus on industrial ecology.",
    "This course is perfect for my areas of interest - not just industrial ecology, but sustainable systems more broadly, as well as greenhouse gas emissions reductions (the software we use is often used to track product GHG emissions).",
    "Very well."

I also couldn't take Advanced Industrial Ecology due to a scheduling conflict, and this seemed like that only other way to get an advanced IE course, which is technically my FES concentration. There's not much depth at FES in general, so I was happy to be allowed into this course to get a bit of advanced training in an important area.",

   "comments": [
    "Nearly all professional LCAs are conducted by groups of practitioners, rather than by individual. Thus, it was very helpful to work on a semester long project with other students. We complemented one another very well, and we produced a good final product.",
    "The groups were kind of small. It would have been nice if every team had at least 3 people.",
    "It is good to have a collaborator to work with to complement my skills, and make up for my weaknesses.",
    "Working with a partner was very helpful. It was nice to have someone to talk through the process of constructing and running a model.",
    "It was kind of frustrating working on a group project with this computer program (SimaPro), since any changes to our model on one person's computer wouldn't be reflected on the others, and they had to be manually tracked and synced, and it was hard to do work on your own without impacting the other team members work. But there's no other way to do it at this point! These are the software's flaws.",
    "The group was a bit imbalanced. It was difficult to get consistent work out of everyone.",
    "You had to do this as a group. No way someone could have completed a project on his or her own."

    "The professor is incredibly knowledgeable so take full advantage of his real world expertise.",
