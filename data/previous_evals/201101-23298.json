    "this course is really an independent project with a seminar series. more attention should be paid to creating more stages for the final project. if you really want the final project to be a research paper then there should be time for hypothesis development and discussion of the ideas along the way, rather than just bunched into the end with little feedback.",
    "This was clearly an experimental class but I think it worked well! Work load was VERY unevenly distributed though - hardly any work in the fall and much more work (because of the paper) in the spring.",
    "Question 8.Very interesting class, but feels like the content of the course is to scattered. I am sure this class would be much improved if it's offered the 2nd time.",
    "This is a very hard course to rate, since it is clear that its unique structure and uncertain demeanor were artifacts of it being experimentation. I acknowledge that the people involved are trying something new, and we desperately need more classes about integrated urban systems at Yale FES, given the massive urbanization that is underway around the world. Such classes would be rigorous and multidisciplinary, with key messages that students can take away. This seemed scattershot."

    "To have a chance to make a video",
    "Lots of work to bring in speakers. Great format idea",
    "I wasn't optimistic, but the workshop at the end of the class was better than I expected. Karen Seto was able to ask questions that really got people talking. Maybe it was also because we were sitting in a circle and we were relating it to things more relevant to our interests.",
    "I really enjoyed writing my final paper. I thought the TA (Peter Christensen) was incredibly helpful to me during this process. Also I really enjoyed almost every single visiting speaker.",
    "The speakers were great and interesting",

   "comments": [
    "It didn't really feel like a \"class\". We just sort of attended lectures together. It have been nice to have more class time to discuss themes without the presence of the guest speaker - in a more relaxed environment.",
    "Need to have expectations of students laid out at the beginning.",
    "There were way too many students to have meaningful conversations. This aspect defeated part of the purpose of the class.",
    "I thought the discussions were too unstructured - Perhaps assigning discussion leaders for each week would help to keep the discussion more focused.",
    "Information and communication. Often confusing and late. Scheduling needs to be more in advance.",
    "The class format (lecture series followed by discussion) was frustrating because students weren't able to plan for lectures until a few days before (flexibility was required to work around guest lecturers' schedules) and the topics didn't seem to come together into anything cohesive. Maybe discussion would have been better if Karen Seto was leading it.",
    "Although the visiting speakers were usually quite good, the post-lecture discussions were slow, meandering, and frustrating. The assigned readings did very little to inform the discussion. The professors were not very engaged in leading the discussion in a forward direction, and as a result the students were pretty much unengaged the entire time.",
    "It was a little bit scattered because the courses were every few weeks. More organizational clarity would have been great.",
    "I did not get much out of different guest lectures other than being exposed to a series of interesting perspectives. There could be a way to link these great seminars together better. I would recommend to have an additional workshop scheduled in the late Fall, for people to summarize things learned in the first half of the class and begin to brainstorm research ideas."
