   "comments": [
    "Definitely worth taking! Super interesting, low workload (interesting readings, 5-page midterm paper, 10-page final paper, and a chill final exam), and wonderful to learn about such a fascinating topic from a great professor in a very intimate environment.",
    "Take it! Not to develop an opinions but to understand whats out there. He is the best teacher, hogh standards but helps you meet them. You feel invested and excited about your work. Amazing. Totally reasonable expectations. Do not be afraid to ask questions.",
    "Wonderful course, would suggest it to anyone, interested in Israel\/Palestine or not. If interested, the course is essential to understanding the conflict.",
    "I originally took this class expecting to gain a better insight about the conflict in the Middle East. While the final section of the course did cover a large bit of the modern day conflict, most of the course was dedicated to Zionist thinkers and their ideology, which at some points felt like a bit of overkill. Still, Professor Stern did mention that next time he taught a course like this, he would make it about the conflict, which is something I recommend. He makes the lectures interactive, and is respectful of other students' opinions while able to explain and hold to his opinions.",
    "The course was fascinating. Professor Stern was engaging, knowledgable, and a super instructor. If the Palestinian-Israeli conflict or Zionism interests you at all this is a must take class.",
    "Very interesting look into a topic that everyone seems to have an opinion on. If for nothing else, take this class if you're interested in nationalist narratives and nationalism in general."
