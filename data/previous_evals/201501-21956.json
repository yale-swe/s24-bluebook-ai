    "A should-take, even if you are majoring in something completely different (like me). Amazing (and my favorite) class. Readings were interesting for the most part, and we delved into what I think were surprising interpretations of the texts. My writing also improved further; ME was a phenomenal professor (who unfortunately is going to Harvard next year). Only misgiving was the large number of times she was absent from class, but that's understandable given her status as a last-year grad student. (Well, that and the pop quizzes...)",
    "Great english class, you read fantastic books and write 4 essays. Improved my writing significantly and I learned so much.",
    "Definitely recommend.",
    "English 115-02 is a very intriguing approach and introduction to the study and assessment of literature. I would definitely recommend this course to any student who is interested in improving their writing abilities while furthering their literary knowledge through the analysis of varying types of courtship present in literature."
