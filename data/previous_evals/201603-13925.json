   "comments": [
    "This class gave me a better understanding of the complex problem of human trafficking but also of the different perspectives and viewpoints. I found the readings to be really insightful as they showed how many different perspectives there are pertaining to the abolitionist movement, religious views, and the role of government.",
    "A wonderfully rich and diverse exploration of human trafficking and the complicated nature of advocacy on its behalf. The readings struck an excellent balance between the theoretical and the practical, and the visual material (films, photography, etc) was a wonderful analytical supplement. I learned to analyze emotional subjects in a thoughtful and rational manner, while never forgetting to question my own position in the worlds we studied.",
    "Rhetorical analysis skills I hadn't been forced to develop previously.",
    "So so so so much!! I feel like this course gave me an entire new way at looking at almost everything -- I now feel like when I'm analyzing something, I realize how important rhetoric and discourse are. While I was a little apprehensive of a rhetoric\/english approach to a global affairs issue, I think this is an experience everyone should have -- especially if they hope to do policy work in the future. I feel like I became a better writer and thinker!",
    "The class strengthened my rhetorical analysis skills and gave me more experience with identifying frameworks. I had no previous knowledge about human trafficking before taking this course.",
    "I've never taken any class like this, so I feel like I learned a new language. The professor is really caring and accommodating, so for my first writing class here, it was a great fit on a really new subject.",
    "rhetorical analysis and close reading",
    "I developed the ability to critique certain forms of rhetoric and the harm they can reinforce, despite attempting to do good. I learned how to draw information from a wide array of scholarly works and draw connections across various subjects.",
    "It really complicated my understanding and thinking about what human trafficking is. It felt great to be thinking in ways that felt more evolved-- moving beyond simplistic representations and campaigns and really breaking down human moral assessments- to move beyond \"this is bad\" and to think about why we arrive at that conclusion, and how we can be constructive scholars and participants on the global stage and not fall into visual and rhetorical traps.",
    "I learned a lot about human trafficking and how it is depicted in the media and academia. This course challenged my own views on trafficking and human rights. I learned how to use different mediums to express my views."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The course provided a lot of strong texts that were really engaging and helped change my perspective on the issue, however, there were a few seminars that were primary focused on the \"rhetoric\" of the issue and less about what actually is the issue of human trafficking.",
    "I would've loved to see a little more class discussion, and a little less structure, but that is a minor complaint. Overall, very stimulating course.",
    "Amazing professor, lots of interesting material. I would have enjoyed more on the policy\/solution side of human trafficking and slightly less on analyzing how it's talked about.",
    "As I mentioned above, I absolutely loved the unique approach this class brought to the issue of human trafficking. The focus on rhetoric was so important. I enjoyed almost all of the readings we did, and I appreciated the variety of media used to teach us (readings, guest speakers, presentations, films\/video clips, photo analysis, etc.) It sometimes felt like some of the readings were a little repetitive, so many look into the syllabus more. I also would have like to look at a couple more positive solutions within the world of human trafficking. It felt like I got really good at critiquing proposed solutions and representations, but less of an idea of what a really good response would be.",
    "Good breadth of material covered, room for individual study. No strong weaknesses really.",
    "the biggest strength of the course was the readings it offered. however, class discussions veered away from these readings. i would have liked the class more if there was most interactive conversation.",
    "Overall, it was a very good course! I very much enjoyed using various mediums in class to aid in our learning (i.e. videos, websites, photos). I think one thing that could help would be to provide more definitions of terms, or at least some more guidance when introducing certain concepts.",
    "I think there could have been more selective choices about the readings-- a lot of the readings were repetitive and if there are 90 repetitive pages saying similar things as another author students are less likely to read that than if say 15 pages of each of those readings are emphasized as key."

   "comments": [
    "yes",
    "Absolutely. A wonderfully rich and diverse exploration of human trafficking and the complicated nature of advocacy on its behalf. We discuss everything from harmful gender stereotypes to religious aspects of activist organizations, and there is absolutely an opportunity to shape the class around your interests. Readings are manageable and fascinating, Prof Hesford engaged and always willing to help with papers. The class is often structured around an introductory lecture, so be prepared not to talk the entire seminar, but I personally found the openings very stimulating and a welcome respite from seminars where the onus is always on the student to begin. Definitely take if you can!",
    "Yes~",
    "Yes!!! I absolutely loved the class. Professor Hesford brings a unique approach to the issue of human trafficking that improves your ability to critically analyze frameworks and their subsequent solutions. Readings, videos, and presentations were all very interesting. And the critical lens essays gave you a lot of freedom to explore any issue within human trafficking. I love that she incorporated OUR interests into the class plans.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course. The topic is so interesting , and I liked the focus on rhetoric and frameworks, although it was more theoretical at times than I had originally anticipated. Professor Hesford is wonderful and engaging, and she structured the class in a way that allowed students to explore what was most interesting to them. A great introduction into human trafficking and rhetorical analysis.",
    "Yes, low workload highly intellectually stimulating course.",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend this course to other students, especially because you get a writing credit out of a very interesting course!",
    "This was Professor Hesford's first year at Yale and I believe of teaching this class, so there are definitely a couple of kinks to be worked out in terms of how the material is presented (it was often more of a lecture vibe, which I was actually ok with because I prefer lectures to seminars, but sometimes that in-between isn't the best for engagement). Readings could get repetitive but that also meant you could ascertain the gist of them pretty easily. That said, she was so sweet (she brought cookies every week!) and smart, and this is her life's work. Thinking about her now makes me smile! I loved hearing her speak about her own scholarly pursuits (rhetoric is really fascinating! I had never thought about it before in the terms she put it in). This class really complicated my understanding\/thinking about what human trafficking is. It felt great to be thinking in ways that felt more evolved- to be able to move beyond simplistic representations and problematic \"human rights\" campaign strategies. It really broke down our human moral assessments-- we moved beyond \"this is bad\" to think about why we actually arrive at these conclusions of right and wrong, and how we can be constructive scholars and participants on the global stage. I really liked analyzing trafficking campaigns and the common tropes used in them (like visibility\/invisibility, slavery\/freedom, etc). I feel like I now have a much greater understanding of this issue (and also of how nuanced it is!)",
    "Take this course! It is interesting, the expectations are clear, and you will learn a lot about trafficking and the ways it is displayed to the public."
