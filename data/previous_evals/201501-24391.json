    "I would recommend Art 142 to another student so long as they were truly interested in film making. It seems that a lot of students were not very invested in it and were not prepared for a studio class, so they dropped. You'll also need a lot of patience (especially with the technology, and the work picks up towards the end. Like any art class, you get out of it what you put into it.",
    "Would definitely recommend! One of the best classes I have taken at Yale, and I will definitely be pursuing more classes in production. Be warned, it's a lot of work, and you have to show that work in public (both for in-class crits and for your final film fest), so half-assing it is not really an option unless you're down for letting other people think you're a terrible filmmaker.",
    "Take it!!! It's awesome! Dot.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class, even if you do not plan to be a filmmaker. Everyone should try something creative at least once during their time at Yale, and this class satisfies that need by also being incredibly challenging. Do not expect to skate by in this class, nor would you want to. In working hard to make these short films and assignments, you are learning a new way to effectively organize your thoughts and ideas to be perceived by an audience outside of your own head. That's a skill useful in any discipline. While it is very technical and you will be working with cameras and editing software, the DMCA staff and Professor Luckow are an incredible resource to help with that aspect of the class, so don't be afraid if you don't know how to use the equipment at first.",
    "Don't forget that film requires an immense amount of time, energy, and effort. Take the class if you're willing to put all of that in, it'll be worth it. Also, hopefully they restructure the class to make it a bit more organized and to make the process a little less painful."
