    "Great class, great teacher take this seminar or anything taught by her",
    "Is the act of voting a right or privilege? Who deserves the right to vote and under what circumstances can the voting rights be withdrawn. Also looks at the ways in which minority groups living in the U.S. gained the right to vote.",
    "Good introduction to the discipline of African American studies or a corrective to majoritarian Political Science discussions. Very manageable workload--might recommend a junior or senior AfAm student take a grad seminar in this place.",
    "I would recommend this class to another student. The topics were interesting and the workload was fine. Overall, I'd say take this class.",
    "Absolutely. Take it. Keeps you very update on current events and affairs",
    "I would not recommend this course to another student. While the subject matter is something I am personally interested in, this class barely furthered my knowledge of the subject. The discussion was not stimulating, and thereadings were repetitive."
