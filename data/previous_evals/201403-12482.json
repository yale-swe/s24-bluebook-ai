    "I would recommend this class to students with musical background. I had very little classical training, so I had to catch up a lot towards the beginning of the semester. Taking the class with kids that have perfect pitch or years of experience in music is intimidating when you don't have that background, but it is possible.",
    "I would recommend it. It's a logical process through the knowledge of music theory. It explains a lot about how music is set up and structured and why.",
    "I would highly recommend this class to anyone remotely interested in music theory and Tahirih is a great instructor! I felt like I learnt a lot from this class while also enjoying it.",
    "Really depends on which section. Not too bad, you learn a decent amount of you do the work.",
    "Despite the rather ordinary-sounding course title, Musi 210 turned out to be great fun. The various topics cohered well by the end of the course. Although it was a theory course I found that it has certainly enriched my understanding of music-in-practice. There was a good balance of learning and application. The workload was a right balance of demanding and manageable: we had homework due for almost every single class, but it wasn't unreasonable and always matched the pace of our learning just right. I might have liked to do a bit more composition, though - even if only very short compositions of several bars. I feel much more equipped to do analysis now, but the only notable composition that we did was some counterpoint. Take the course with Tahirih if you can! Tahirih was a very talented instructor. Her teaching was concise, informative, inspired, and engaging.",
    "If you want to learn music theory, i would recommend it."
