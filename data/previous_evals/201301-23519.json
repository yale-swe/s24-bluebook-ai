    "The class is amazing, the professor is great and is a wonderful course in etting a well rounded education about the Incas and the Inca Empire. The variety of subject matter: anthropology, archaeology, architecture, art makes the class awesome and great to engage. I reccoment it and believe it is totally worth your time to take especially if you love anything to do with the Pre-Columbian world in the Americas.",
    "Only take this class if you are actually interested in the Inca. I learned a lot, especially from the weekly readings, but the volume of assigned pages means that you really have to be dedicated to the topic to get much out of it.",
    "This class is an overview of the Inca Empire. It also focuses on the archaeologists that have made important contributions and the various \"schools of thought\" that have been prevalent in studying the Incas."
