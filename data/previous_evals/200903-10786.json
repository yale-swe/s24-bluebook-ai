    "I would recommend HSHM 710 as a strong foundation and preparation for future work in the history and philosophy of science - for thinking about what theoretical tools to bring to one's analysis of sources, in particular.",
    "An essential methods class, I would highly recommend it.",
    "HSHM 710 is a methdological survey course designed to acquait students with the major trends and themes in contemporary HSHM. It provides a useful refresher for students with an HSHM background, and is an excellent resource for those who come from other disciplines. I would highly recommend HSHM 710 to other students owing to the diversity of the readings and the professional applicability of the material.",
    "The students found the course rewarding, but would have preferred it, if they had taken the Problems in the History of Science first."

    "See above.",
    "HSHM 710 familiarized me with the main trends in contemporary HSHM and provided valuable tools to analyze my own stance vis-a-vis the current historiography. I believe that I will utilize many of the methods and topics we addressed in class in my own dissertation and independent research. A highly valuable class.",
