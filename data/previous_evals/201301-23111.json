    "Yes.",
    "This was a great class! Professor Gonzalez is super sweet! She cares so much about what she teaches and really genuinely enjoys when we like it too. It didn't end up being the most intellectually stimulating class, but it was really interesting and a lot of fun. Great 4th or 5th credit.",
    "I would recommend this course. There is not much work at all and the two group projects are really fun and creative to do. It's a great look at interdisciplinary approaches to solving developing world problems. And Professor Gonzalez is simple the sweetest woman! She is so passionate about what she teaches and makes sure everyone understands the material. Great course!",
    "Definitely!",
    "Good course, but you get more out of it if you do the readings (probably) and if you don't know a lot about global health going into the class. I know several people who thought they might be interested, and are much more interested in global health after taking the class. The other students and the teacher definitely make the class. Not much work, easy grades, but you still learn. Almost a perfect class, and a fun one at that.",
    "Incredible class. Good mix of concepts and real world application. Great introduction to the field of global health and non-profits that are often not touched upon by other Yale classes. Very fun and fair assignments. Professor Gonzalez is amazing. She truly cares about what her students have to say. Lots of energy and brings us treats! :)",
    "This is an amazing course which teaches very practical skills for someone interested in international development projects. It takes an interdisciplinary approach to development so the cultural, social and technological perspective becomes crucial in this course. It's not a class for just engineers; the reason it's so strong is because students from the social sciences also contribute significantly to the course. It's the perfect class for seniors because there's very little busy work yet you get a lot out of the course. Anjelica is not too harsh on your GPA either.",
    "Great intro to biotechnology in a developing world context. Technology is approached from technical, political, economic, and social points of view. Definitely a must take for any engineer or non-engineer interested in appropriate technology.",
    "Absolutely! Anyone with half an interest in anything from aid to development to technology innovation would enjoy this course.",
    "I would recommend this class if you're looking for an easy, not very scientific approach to biotech in the developing world. The science is very light, but the economics and politics is somewhat interesting to make up for it. The class spends too much time on student presentations, however, which are often uninteresting and a distraction. But there's not a lot of work and Prof. Gonzalez is really nice and really excited about the class, which is great.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS! It has been one of my favorite courses here. I read in another review (and can absolutely confirm) that the class focus on the positive and affirming roles that we can play in biotech\/global health in the developing world is incredibly inspiring. The workload is light, and Prof Gonzalez is the best.",
    "yes, if you get it, take it",
    "This is a fantastic course. The readings are carefully selected and very informative. You'll undoubtedly come out of this class with valuable new perspectives on the public health challenges facing the developing world. The current events presentations (given by students) were really useful for bringing the class up to speed with active developments and the midterm and final projects were fantastic opportunities to take a design\/ appropriate tech perspective in addressing biotech challenges.",
    "This course is a great examination of the various biotech tools that are and may soon be used in the developing world. As a premed student interested in global health, this class is very relevant and there's simply no other course offering like it at Yale. It really focuses on science and engineering, in contrast to many other global health courses that focus only on the social science aspect of the field when it is really interdisciplinary. Perhaps because I'm also a science major, it was particularly fulfilling to know about and even design technologies that have been proven to succeed at a fairly low cost. It's pretty hands on as well (for the final project you design your own technology that could be reviewed by the Gates Foundation, and class projects involve going to CEID and Mason Lab). Professor Gonzalez is an enthusiastic and very knowledgeable professor, although she can be a bit disorganized.",
    "Absolutely. It will the best class you take at Yale. Take it for yourself. You will be amazed with all you learn. Just take it.",
    "This course was amazing!! I loved it! I wish every course at Yale could be like this: covering interesting and relevant subject material with a professor who is enthusiastic, extremely well informed, and eager to share her knowledge with her students in an innovative and exciting way. I loved that we were able to actively participate in this course as well as learn from our fellow classmates in the current event, midterm, and final projects. I enjoyed the guest lectures that brought a unique and intense perspective on particular areas of our subject matter. And I enjoyed the \u00e2\u0080\u009clab\u00e2\u0080\u009d days where we built voltmeters and experimented with microfluidics. The workload is minimal, with occasional reading responses, a presentation on a current event in global health, and group midterm and final papers\/presentations. Take this course if you can get into it - this was one of my favorite courses at Yale!",
    "Take the class!! Loved it--more hands on than other classes. Gives ample opportunity to be more creative as well and the final project is actually relevant\/can be submitted for Gates foundation funding depending on what you choose to work on."
