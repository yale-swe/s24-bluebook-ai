   "comments": [
    "This course is fun and helpful if you have music and theory background. Otherwise, it might be somewhat stressful.",
    "If you're looking for a light workload course where you can directly pick up on really practical skills as a musician, look no further than 218. You'll become a master of melodic and harmonic dictation, chord progression, sight singing, keyboard realization, listening to \"real\" music, and more.",
    "If you have a good ear, the class will be fun and not too challenging. It is a lot of time for a half credit, twice a week for 50 minutes plus the 30 minute keyboard lab. But hardly anything needs to be done outside of class.",
    "Great class to improve transcribing melodies and harmonies, harmonic progressions, and sight-singing. Figured bass is cool, too. The whole class is definitely half a credit's worth of work, which is nice."
