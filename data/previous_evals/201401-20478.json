    "Actually, I was a little nervous to take this class but since it's a requirement for the major, I had to take it anyways. Those anxieties were completely unfounded. Yes, some of the readings make no sense and are difficult to get through (hello, semiotics) but Professor Rizvi is so knowledgable and insightful that she can guide the class through it. She's awesome and so nice (she brought us snacks and funny flavored seltzer). It's great having 2 page papers every week and not one huge one at the end of the semester. It really does help your writing and gets you ready for the senior essay. You and your classmates set the tone for the class so that is something to consider.",
    "History of art history, insight into the development of the field, great discussions to be had, see the many disciplines that converge in art history.",
    "Great class! Really gets you thinking about the field. Take it with Professor Rizvi if you can!",
    "You read a tiny bit about a lot of different ways of thinking. But you don't have the time to really get into any one of the frameworks. It's required-- so suck it up I guess!",
    "I have heard negative things about all the professors teaching this class except for Rizvi-- take it with her!! The readings are so important for any art history major, and it is truly an enjoyable course. The workload is great and with no midterm or final paper, it will be a huge relief.",
    "It's a pretty good class! I'm definitely glad I took it with Rizvi- the discussions were well-structured and usually interesting, even when we were all in a bit over our heads. It's also a writing credit, which is really nice.",
    "Excellent class for laying the groundwork of the study of art history; useful and interesting to majors and non-majors alike."
