    "This deepened my knowledge extensively. I admit my knowledge coming in was very cursory, given my focus on design, but I was able to learn a lot on a subject I've been interested in. I believe it fits very well with my train of studies and projects, and even if my training in art history is limited, I feel that this will help me in my research in this field.",
    "The course introduced me to cinema studies, an area with which I was not familiar, and allowed me to write a paper related to my thesis."
