   "comments": [
    "I developed a meaningful form of ecological thinking that allowed me to conceptualize ecological systems better, and to better think about these systems mathematically.",
    "Interactions between populations, effect of environment on populations, lots of models, some stuff about climate change. A little bit of a mixed bag in terms of content.",
    "I learned about the ecological processes governing some of the phenomena we observe across biomes worldwide. I also learned some about the methodologies that ecologists use to draw conclusions about the world we live in.",
    "Lots of general knowledge of ecology, including population and competition dynamics, modeling of many different environmental systems, and what current research in this field looks like in light of climate change.",
    "This course provided a survey of the theoretical mathematical bases for understanding ecology, and the interconnections of resources, nutrients, and atmospheric processes that create the earth system.",
    "I learned about fundamental principles and concepts in ecology like predation and competition, and did a lot math-based ecological modeling. I also learned how to write a rather significant research paper in a very small amount of time, based on real field data.",
    "I learned about ecological processes that shape our world. I also gained a better knowledge of how ecologists take data and interpret it.",
    "I thought this was a great introductory ecology class. We learned a lot about the broader processes that have caused modern species distributions, and also a lot of models to understand populations and what affects them. The class had a ton of great information and I thought that it was well taught. The labs were also helpful for learning how to write scientific papers.",
    "I gained insight into how we can think about ecology using models, and model natural systems mathematically. I also enhanced my understanding of ecosystems and ecological concepts.",
    "I learned a lot about ecology, and how it is used in a practical sense.",
    "I learned about the foundations of ecology, and the principles and models central to the topic",
    "I gained a basic understanding of the topics that fall under the umbrella of ecology, and how to complete data analysis to answer questions that ecologists might pose. Topics ranged from earth systems to population and competition dynamics. Basically, I learned what it means to be an ecologist.",
    "I learned lots of practical skills regarding ecology (rarefaction, calculation of stored carbon, etc.). I also feel like I got a strong understanding of the theoretical backbones of ecology and the math that we use to analyze them in specific situation. Through this class, I feel like I got insight into what it looks like to be a professional ecologist.",
    "I developed a knowledge of ecology, primarily through a mathematical approach utilizing, comparing, and contrasting a variety of models. These models were used in class to compare to real life examples, eventually leading to research-based papers and in-class discussions. This course focuses primarily on these models as opposed to behavioral reasons, however."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "It's a very good course!",
    "The overall structure\/organization of the course could be improved as the links and transitions between topics are a little unclear.",
    "The main weakness of this course is that its title did not seem to correspond with the material we covered. This did not feel like a general introduction to ecological principles, but rather an in-depth and often mathematical exploration of the intricacies of population dynamics. Another weakness, I found, was the lack of formal office hours. They had to be made by appointment with the TFs, who were very helpful, but it would have been nice to have some scheduled office hours.",
    "This course was fantastic! An overview of ecology was presented in fascinating ways and the use of mathematical models was a particular strength. All of the problem sets were interesting and worthwhile assignments. If any weakness existed, it was that the use of two professors was sometimes confusing; at times it was unclear who was teaching what material and to whom communications should be addressed.",
    "The course's lectures are very good. Some of the assignments are unclear, and there's not a high degree of transparency about what to expect on the exams (e.g., no answer key for practice problems, not disclosing a formula sheet before either of the midterm exams).",
    "I really liked the Friday discussions of current literature, and the lab reports were challenging but important for the field to understand and have experience with them.",
    "I think that the main improvement this course could have would be more in-class and take-home problem set examples that made us more accustomed to the math equations and graphical models. I think that repetition of word problems would entitle more work but also would provide more vigorous guided practice and learning.",
    "just make sure you do not take it as a freshman. Its meant for upperclassmen fulfilling their major. I wish i knew that beforehand, but even if you are a freshman you can still do well in the class",
    "Both professors were excellent lecturers, and the material was very interesting. Sometimes, problem sets and exam questions were worded confusingly.",
    ".This was a very good course. Having two teachers meant that the material was approached from two different perspectives, making the class feel fresh.",
    "This class had many strengths, but one area that could really be improved were the psets and especially the labs. The psets included a lot of data analysis and excel work. While I appreciated the opportunity to apply the class material to real world data, I don't think there was much overlap between the psets\/labs and the lectures. Especially for the labs, we would have to do so much excel work and data analysis that I had never done before. While my TA was very willing to help me, I still had to teach myself a lot of excel and just how to manipulate data in general. I would hope for more instruction on the psets and labs, or maybe less quantitatively heavy classwork.",
    "The class had a lot of information that was fairly well taught. Especially the models I think had the possibility of being confusing, but the professors taught them well. The TAs were helpful, the material was pretty interesting, although be prepared to do a lot of math rather than just general info about ecology.",
    "The lectures were engaging! The tests were always really confusing, and made it hard to show what we had learned. The course could be improved by not making lab reports due immediately after students return from October and thanksgiving breaks.",
    "This course did a good job of combining theory and practice as well as small-scale and large-scale concepts in ecology. I felt like I got a good overview of mathematical underpinnings of ecology, important theoretical concepts from famous ecologists, and applications of ecology to the real world. I also thought the lab exercises were interesting and useful in understanding how to put all of the material together. This course would be much improved if the two professors did a better job of coordinating their lectures. It felt like sometimes they would repeat what the other professor previously said (especially after missing class when the other prof lectured), and even when they did not repeat what their colleague said the lectures felt disconnected from each other.",
    "Overall it was a good course. Sometimes it was a little heavy on math, I wasn't expecting that. It would also help if there were more practice questions to study for exams, but overall the professors were engaged and it covered a good variety of subjects.",
    "The course was well-taught and covered interesting content. At times it moved a bit slowly in my opinion. I have taken a differential equations course in the past so I did not find the models difficult, but I think other members of the class without the same math background would benefit from more explanation of the differential equations used.",
    "The strengths of this class are that it forces you to become better at excel and it teaches you what kind of questions ecologists are asking. The weaknesses are that it fails to go in depth into any one topic because it covers such a wide range, and that there is not much practice at the topics that are covered before being tested on them. The format of having two different teachers, while it probably suits the professors because they have different areas of expertise, did not work super well because of how different their teaching styles are, as well as the topics that they teach about.",
    "A strength of this course is that it provides insight into what the work of ecology research is like. This is helpful for those, such as myself, who are considering ecology research as a career as we make life decisions. I also really appreciated the discussions on Fridays and feel like I got a lot out of those. A weakness of this course is that it often felt very rote: like we were cramming the information into our brains without acknowledgment of how cool it is that we have these tools with which . I would have appreciated more integration of how the theory we study has impacted policy making and management decisions. I thought this was done well in the discussion about California wildfires and in the Life Tables, Conservation, and Management lecture.",
    "Honestly, the textbook is quite dry, and while all the material was covered by the halfway point, it often utilizes equations not covered in class or covered in a different manner in class, which made it very hard to understand what to study before lectures. In addition, the exams were brutally pressed for time, and the vast majority of students' scores would have rose significantly if more time, even 15 minutes, was allotted. Finally, I preferred Professor Staver's lectures, as well as the lectures of Madelon Case, as they focused more on the processes leading to the models as opposed to the models themselves, which, while covered in a respectable manner, often took multiple tries to internalize. Finally, I was often left not knowing what to do for labs and problem sets, as while my teaching fellow Madelon was available, I lacked concrete examples to compare it to."

   "comments": [
    "Definitely recommended if you are interested in ecology! You will learn so much.",
    "I wanted to like this class more than I did, but it's a major requirement for E&EB track 1, so you would have to take it. Not a good class to take for a science requirement for a non-STEM major, as it was a lot of work and complicated concepts.",
    "Unless it is required for your major, no. Don't take it for an easy science credit, and don't take it for a general introduction to ecology, because it is neither of those things. Most of the material we covered seemed to be centered on an in-depth and often mathematical exploration of the intricacies of population dynamics. It was rarely exciting or engaging, and did not make me feel inclined to pursue EEB as I had been considering. The professors and TAs are helpful but the material itself was just not engaging for me. I took notes throughout every class but had a hard time absorbing information and digesting equations until after the fact. Not an easy class, and not very exciting.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to students who know they want to take ecology or are even vaguely considering it. The course is in-depth without being impossibly hard and provides obvious avenues for further work if students care about learning even more ecology. Both professors were wonderful and knowledgeable, and the course layout was well-organized for learning.",
    "Dear lord, no.",
    "Yes, if you want to know more about ecology and learn from some really amazing scientists.",
    "Yes, it provides a great baseline for the study of ecology and related fields.",
    "I would probably not unless its a requirement. It tends to be pretty dry and is a lot of mathematical models.",
    "Yes, I enjoyed it and I learned a lot about ecology, in both mathematical and earth science perspectives.",
    "Yes, it's a good basic intro to Ecology.",
    "Yes, it's more work than it looks like, but very interesting.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to other students. It is well taught and has good material.",
    "I would warn anyone interested in this class that there is a lot more math and data analysis in the class than I expected. All the psets and labs are very quantitatively heavy, and you should really have a working knowledge of excel and maybe R before you take this class (neither of which I had). Also half of the lectures focus on models of population dynamics, including many different equations. I still enjoyed the class, but I really did not expect the quantitative work.",
    "Yes, it covered a lot of interesting ecological models. The lab reports were kind of annoying and didn't really relate to the content of the class but I guess they helped us develop practical skills. Profs Staver and Vassuer are really great lectures and nice people",
    "I think that if a person is genuinely interested in ecology then this is a great class. Otherwise, the material can be a little more than what someone thinks about when they think of an intro ecology course, so for that reason people who aren't EEB might not like the class.",
    "I would recommend it to students who want to get a better understanding of ecology.",
    "I would if you're interested in going into ecology as a field, since it's a good introduction.",
    "Not unless you have to take it. It is much harder than you may think at first!",
    "Yes. I feel like I've gotten a broad understanding of ecology as a field, and I found the lectures to be interesting.",
    "I would recommend this class only to someone who has to take it for their major. If you are an E&EB or EVST major, this class might be worth your time primarily because of the introduction to different types of research that are going on in the field. But, it's a difficult class and the material is not always super clear, making it a mediocre class just to take if you're interested.",
    "Cautiously. This course is indeed a foundational ecological course and required for ecology majors, but students taking this course for fun would be better off taking a more general organismal course such as plant diversity, which I believe will give an ecology experience more akin to what is expected. Know that the exams are quite difficult due to time and that the course material is often dry--you will need to thoroughly internalize when to apply equations in order to succeed, and this course could easily qualify for a QR with slight changes. You will often feel lost, and the lectures may move too quickly, but it is overall necessary and you can get through it. I believe it is curved, and exam averages are quite low, so do not let that worry you. a"
