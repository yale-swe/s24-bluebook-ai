    "If you have to take L3, definitely take it with Oscar. He is a really fun professor and helps his students do well. Prior to this course, I was planning on quitting Spanish after I ended my requirement, but now I am considering continuing my studies. Our class was fun and the environment was really great for practicing Spanish. We never faced criticism or judgement from the professor if we messed up, just instruction on how to improve.",
    "I liked Spanish 130 more than Spanish 120 because I enjoyed the pace of 130. Furthermore, I like how the HW is online now with more constant feedback on how you did on the HW. Overall, the course is a good one.",
    "A continuation of 120, with very little new grammar, a lot of new vocab, and longer\/more complex reading assignments.",
    "The course is a great refresher in Spanish, and hopefully will help you improve your ability to speak the language. There is a big focus on speaking and writing essays, which is better than the busy-work required in L2. I definitely recommend this course, but you're probably taking it for the requirement, anyway.",
    "I'd definitely recommend this course, whether you need it for distributional requirements or you just want to take a Spanish course."
