    "The course absolutely accomplished my goal of an intensive semester of learning how to become a better writer. Simple in its structure, but I could not have asked for more.",
    "This course was wonderfully designed and should remain as long as FES will allow.",
    "For whatever reason, and maybe this is my own shortcoming, I found it very difficult to understand how to integrate writing concepts discussed in class to scientific\/academic papers I have to write.",
    "Great course, valuable for any student. The importance of communication skills is so often overlooked- not communication as in simply regurgitating facts but as in using language to eloquently express and inspire. I'm a better writer for taking this course, and good writing is essential for any environmental professional."

    "Verlyn slowly but surely imparts his wealth of writing knowledge to the class. Fun atmosphere and great way to improve writing.",
    "Writing a piece each week and getting comments on it were really great. It was really hard to write an essay every week, but it became somewhat easier along with the semester. Also, reading classmates' writings was helpful to improve my writing skill, by comparing theirs with mine.",
    "Its simplicity and Professor Klinkenborg's willingness to do anything possible (moving assignments, direction of discussions, etc.) to accomplish his goal and actually teach us.",
    "The writing feedback andability to humbly step into your own voice.",
    "Getting to write personal stories and trying to write fiction.",

    "Instructor's experience",
    "Weekly writing.",
    "Writing assignments and their discussion.",
    "Weekly writing forced me to improve.",
    "The Professor. Hands down one of the best I've ever had for writing. I actually feel like my handwriting improved tangibly.",
    "It was incredible how every part of the class was very clearly in service of the goal to teach us how to recognize and write good sentences and then string them together into good paragraphs and string those together into good pieces. The readings were short enough and varied enough that we could discuss them in detail and parse out the nuances of each sentence. The weekly assignments were deceptively difficult but I learned a lot about my writing and my interests by struggling to find a subject I cared enough about to spend two pages and several hours working out one sentence at a time."

However, I'm also glad that so many people got a chance to be in the class because the lessons that Verlyn wanted to teach were valuable for anyone and everyone."

    "Writing a casual, but clear essay is really important to pursue a professional career. This class gave me an opportunity to practice my writing skill by doing numerous readings written by professional writers and classmates and writing essays on regular basis.",
    "I sought a course that would help me become a better writer. SOM doesn't offer anything. I was honored to be get into this class, and truly believe it made me a better writer. I leave with confidence in knowing I now possess a skill (in progress) that few of my peers do.",

    "This course is more fundamental than something that belongs to one particular \"program.\" Good writing should be the base of any discipline and this class made me realize how rampant bad writing is among respected scholars and policy-makers and how vitally important it is for people in any program to start from the basics and focus on how each sentence should work in order to make their ideas clear, intelligible and interesting to read."

    "Absolutely take it. You learn a ton, the workload is very manageable, Professor Klinkenborg cares about his students and their success as much as any professor I've had contact with.",
    "Definitely be willing to be open to critique and be able to laugh at yourself. You will do fine",
    "Make sure you have a good background in grammar, otherwise work on that first.",
    "Start your pieces earlier in the week. You'll get a lot more out of writing them if you give yourself enough time.",
    "I would recommend this class for everyone and anyone. You will learn, through the course of the semester, the satisfaction of being able to write beautiful, accurate and powerful sentences about whatever you chose. The weekly assignments can be challenging because there are never any prompts, but having to choose what I wanted to write about every week, helped me discover the things that feel significant and important to me and also helped me focus on the very basics of how I construct sentences. Verlyn is a compassionate and encouraging teacher, always willing to answer any questions and help with any struggles. It is incredible how much your writing will change in the course of 12 weeks."
