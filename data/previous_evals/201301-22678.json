    "I love Spanish, so take it. Why would you not?",
    "Overall, not bad. You're probably taking it because you have to so just roll with it. Do all the work and participate in class and you'll be in fine shape.",
    "I learned quite a bit of new grammar and vocab from this class, which I was not expecting. I liked the movie and the novel. The workload was a bit much at times but I'd recommend it.",
    "If you are interested in learning more about Spanish grammar and culture, this is a good class to take. Be prepared to put in the effort.",
    "It was a graduation requirement for me; I am not a language person and I thought it was a lot of work, but if you like languages a lot you definitely learn a lot and if you are willing to do a lot then I would say it is worthwhile.",
    "Spanish 140 teaches you some of the more advanced levels of grammar, and some specialized vocabulary about both Hispanic culture and the world at large. I would definitely recommend it to another student. It really helps you understand the language better and gain a high degree of proficiency.",
    "Yes, if you want to sharpen your language skills this is a good way to do it.",
    "If you have to take L4, take it. It's an incredibly rigid course -- individual instructors are not permitted to alter or deviate from the syllabus and it also relies heavily on a textbook, from which most of the homework, videos and readings in the course are drawn. It's hardly an intellectually stimulating course -- discussion of the novel we read are limited to rehashing the plot and we never really have any \"real-world\" conversations. Definitely take it with Terry Seymour, though -- she's nice and compassionate and clear."
