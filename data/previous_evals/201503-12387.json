   "comments": [
    "Stefan is great! Very accessible to students and genuinely wants them to succeed. This was the first year this class was taught with a real curriculum so it was a bit disorganized, but still fun most of the time. Proof-based parts can be tricky and lectures a bit confusing, but the applied\/programming parts of the class are a lot of fun (or at least I thought). Final project adds a lot of work but throughout the semester not too bad..5 hour pset each week and 2 midterms that don't take too much time to study for. Also no final is a big plus since you can do the final project early! I would recommend this to anyone who doesn't mind a slightly disorganized lecture. Super interesting material if you don't stress too much about understanding every little bit. Cool applications to physics and data analysis.",
    "I would recommend it to other students. It is a great introduction to function spaces as well as some other important topics in applied mathematics, including PCA, PageRank, Spectral Theorem, Markov Chain, etc.",
    "It is a great course. The various topics we covered were very interesting. I loved the enthusiastic teaching.",
    "Would absolutely recommend it to other students, but be prepared to spend a lot of time trying to understand the material since Stefan does not assign a textbook for the class (he says the material is too cutting edge for there to be a textbook on it)",
    "Math 260 changed my life. Stefan showed us the magic of Fourier Series, PCA, Spectral clustering and even proved crazy theorems that were tangentially related such as Poyla's theorem of Random Walks. He is an incredible professor and put so much effort into the class by bringing us published papers on the stuff we were learning to show us the context of the material. We would learn a lot of interesting abstract things and then immediately he would bring us a paper (sometimes his own work!) where he would show the applications. Although this class only requires linear algebra as a pre req (having that under your belt is a good idea), some minimal amount of programming (mathematica for example) would be a good idea. I had almost no programming experience it was the only reason the psets took me even longer than 5 hours. Class work is very mild with Stefan and he is very fair with exams. We had two midterms and one final project. The first midterm we found fairly difficult, but he made the second midterm very fair. Take this if you want to learn about how a lot of interesting ideas in math are applied in the real world.",
    "Math 260 was awesome because Stefan was given free reign over what to teach, so he just taught us everything in math that he thinks is cool, which is definitely not the norm for the course. It was fascinating material with applications in a wide variety of fields (I'm a CS major and there was a ton of CS in the class). The class is a little unorganized because Stefan does not use a textbook, but that's completely okay. Very reasonable homework and overall workload with two midterms and a final project. Definitely recommend.",
    "This class is an interesting situation. It's a small class that surveys topics in analysis and the practical applications of those ideas. Big themes are matrix operations (SVD, PCA, Laplacian matrices) and Fourier series (and many proofs using Fourier series 'tricks'). Take it if you want to see a lot of cool ideas in theoretical math without delving too deeply into any particular one. Stefan is a good professor overall. He's wicked smart, funny and approachable, and pretty flexible regarding grades and deadlines. However, he finds proofs and theoretical concepts quite easy, and can rush through them, meaning on occasion there are classes where you feel frustrated and feel like you might have not learned anything. Keep Stefan on track and slow him down on proofs, and you can solve this problem. Overall, good class, cool professor!",
    "Math 260 is definitely an interesting class. The workload isn't crazy, but you cover a lot of really cool topics with some real world applications (this year many of the topics were related to data analysis, but that might change year to year). While the course jumps around a lot, Stefan's derivations are surprisingly rigorous, although probably not so much as you'd get in real analysis. Overall, if you're interested in the application of and connections between cool topics in math, this may be a good class for you."
