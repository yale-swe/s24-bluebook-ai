    "I got placed into 162, which was a lot higher than I expected. If you are in this situation I would say it's worth it--the first couple weeks are difficult, but you get used to it and improve in reading and writing a lot over the course of the semester. The lessons are also pretty interesting and more legitimate than what we did in Chinese School. We had either an essay or a presentation every lesson, which was a lot of work but doable. The first test is hard but the next two are pretty much exactly like it, so you know what to expect.",
    "This class is pretty challenging but you learn so so much! If you are deciding between this and 152, I would say take this if you are serious about improving your Chinese. Su laoshi is such a great teacher and you will really enjoy getting to know him just as a person. He makes the class feel relaxed even though you are learning a ton of stuff. My vocabulary has expanded tremendously and my parents are so impressed. This was my favorite class this semester and I am really glad that I challenged myself and pushed through.",
    "Though challenging at times, the results are amazing. My Chinese has improved so, so much. I definitely recommend this course to any student looking to learn and to understand the Chinese language and culture in a much deeper way.",
    "I would definitely recommend Chinese 162 to any student who is taking L5 Chinese, or simply wants to work on their technical basics of the language, since although it isn't that difficult in terms of ideas and comprehension, it's very good for building and cementing the necessary language skills of Chinese.",
    "There's a lot of work, and this Chinese class departs from the colloquial Chinese you learn in lower levels. There aren't as many speaking opportunities since this class only meets three times a week but you can request a TA or tutor. Even after beginning at 132 and going on Light, this class was still a challenge for me, but it was definitely really good practice for my Chinese and I got better at writing Chinese essays. This is the highest level for heritage learners and the catch all for the students who did well in the Chinese placement test, so there's a large range in skill level and many people may be better than you. Su Laoshi is a little disorganized but you'll benefit from his stories about the cultural revolution and lessons in Chinese philosophy. The book they use is kind of old and it talks about Chinese history and culture, so don't expect subjects about modern China. If you have the determination to improve your Chinese, then take this class and get to know one of the first US scholars from China."
