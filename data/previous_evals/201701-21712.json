    "I learned so much in Professor Dimitrova's lab - various lab techniques, how to analyze and write scientifically, how to use specific instruments, it was all interesting and a great learning experience.",
    "I gained many skills and insights as a result of taking this course. Due to the independent nature of this course, I learned what it takes to pull together an independent research project, stay on track, write a cohesive paper that summarizes a semester worth of work, and present such work. Technically, I learned how to perform PCR, gel electrophoresis, and gibson assembly laboratory methods.",
    "I had the chance to do research over the course of the semester as a part of my classwork. I learned valuable laboratory skills, including lab techniques, how to pose a scientific question, and how to interpret scientific data."

   "comments": [
    "The strength is the amount of independence it gives the students enrolled - we simply propose our project and write a summary at the end, so we do not have to stress about any assignments in between and instead can just focus on the lab itself. This is really great.",
    "I do not think there any any weaknesses of this course. It is highly independent, so it is a challenge to find a general response to this question, but the independence granted to the experimenter is a true strength. Perhaps there could be a colloquium at the end of all people working on independent projects so that they could present their works or just discuss them over dinner.",
    "Strengths: I like the proposal and final report--great way to organize our thoughts and plans for the project.",
    "The course is well organized.",
    "Not entirely sure the 15 page paper at the end of the semester is necessary."
