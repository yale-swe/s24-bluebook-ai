    "A class that is medium level difficulty and a significant amount of work. I wouldn't recommend it unless you need a course to fill your quantitative reasoning distribution requirement.",
    "I recommend learning the content via youtube videos because sometimes the book and the professor are both confusing when it comes to learning calculus topics. Also, do not fall behind. Learn it AS YOU GO; it is very hard to catch up later or before a midterm\/final!",
    "I would not recommend this class to any incoming student who did not take calculus in high school.",
    "It's basic calculus. Take it if you need it. It's a good place to start. Good idea to take it as early as possible since a lot of what you learned in high school will come in handy. Tutors are available and if possible find a study group. I didn't and wish I had.",
    "I would. Although it was a little difficult for me, I really learned a lot in this class and feel confident going forward.",
    "It's not essentially an introductory course as most of the text is pretty difficult. It is quite challenging and the notion of it being an easy class because it is an introductory class shouldn't be used.",
    "Take only if needed.",
    "It is a good course for learning calculus, even if you already have a background in it or not.",
    "It is a good intro to calculus.",
    "Great class to take if you like math and have taken calc before.",
    "understanding is easy but tests are hard",
    "MATH 112 05 is good class to take if you have no experience in college level calculus. I would recommend the course because you will leave with a basic knowledge of calculus."
