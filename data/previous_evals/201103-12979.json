    "I would definitely recommend this course. You learn a lot in one semester, but it's not overwhelming either. The professors all seem wonderful and charismatic, and the workload isn't excessive.",
    "If you have a romance language background, you might want to look into taking the combined L1\/L2 class, as this class can feel a little slow at times, but it is very enjoyable, you learn a lot, and you should definitely take it with Asensio if you have the chance! She's wonderful.",
    "Yes, definitely. You learn a lot in this class. I don't know how every section is, but Pilar's section was super great. She was so good. She's one of the best teachers I've had at Yale. It goes fairly fast, but the homework is not at all overwhelming, with moderate studying.",
    "Introductory Spanish course as the title suggests. Would recommend it if you would like to solidify the fundamentals or are just rusty or out of practice otherwise the class might seem boring or too fast paced.",
    "I would recommend it if you have an interest in Spanish.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class, and definitely take it with pilar. The workload isn't unreasonable, even though there is homework most nights, and you learn a ton. Starting from knowing nothing to being able to read a short novel in one semester is a great feeling.",
    "A strong introductory course whewre one would learn a lot. I would recommend it for another beginer.",
    "Yes. Great class to take, especially w\/ Prof Asensio",
    "Yes. It's a lot of work but you learn quite a bit and, taken with the right professor, it can be a great experience.",
    "Take it! Worth going to class everyday. The coursework is not difficult and you will enjoy the classes.",
    "I would recommend the class, but",
    "TAKE IT, but don't be lazy"
