    "It's exactly what they say it is. Lots of elementary philosophy over a huge range of topics\/concepts, with connections drawn well between the various thinkers. It's a very slow class sometimes, so if you shop it and don't like the pace you might want to consider a more advanced philosophy course. Be prepared to write papers differently than you ever have before if this is your first real philosophy class.It shouldn't be a deal-breaker if you want to take DS and like the other sections; philosophy is useful for everyone. Do the reading until you understand the concepts; if you feel like everything said is fairly obvious and\/or not worth discussing, it's alright to miss a section or two - you won't fall behind or anything. If you're the kind of person who has ten different objections to every work, be ready to pick the best one and state it very quickly\/clearly when you get the chance.",
    "Basically, a Western perspective on philosophy and attempts to reconcile the Ancient Roman and Greek perspectives with Christian ideals.",
    "It's a good overview of philosophy where you'll learn a lot about important philosophers. Your writing won't improve, and the grading will be frustrating. The amount of reading is astronomical; you'll have to make sacrifices to do all of it.",
    "I would recommend it because I think that philosophy is an extremely interesting subject for those who have never seen it before. The quality of lecture and section really enables you to get to the heart of the text and understand the main arguments, which is something that would be very difficult to do on your own. The class exposes you to the foundations of Plato and Aristotle who provide interesting ways of viewing the world.",
    "DS Philosophy was wonderful. I really enjoyed reading the foundational works of thought and seeing how they connect to each other. I would definitely recommend it to anyone who is interested in doing lots or reading. Elizondo is great and does a really clear job of explaining difficult concepts.",
    "DS Fall semester Philosophy is personally my least liked of any DS class. Ancient philosophy approaches the big ideas in ways that we today at least would consider archaic and outdated. Many of these arguments you will spend weeks on may not seem to be worth studying, but the course does try to build an appreciation for this ancient philosophy. Just know that studying philosophy in other classes is not the same as studying the history of philosophy. This class is equivalent to courses at Yale marketed as that, taught by philosopher, and not by idea. That said, DS is still a wonderful program and, if taught well, DS fall semester Philosophy is great, too. Professor Elizondo is a great guy, but because this was his first year, was not the best in class discussions, which were often bogged down in a few ideas, and were not so clearly explained (this also had to do with our class, which was not the most participative). His lectures were great though. But the classes could have gone much better.",
    "I would recommend DS to another student and I found the philosophy section of ds to be a transforming in terms of critical thinking.",
    "A fast-paced introduction to ancient philosophy. If you are ready to read a lot then take it. It is a good introduction to philosophy and how to approach a philosophical work which is something you generally do not get taught in high school.",
    "Good. Yes. Though it is tough and heavy on the reading, one comes out feeling educated.",
    "Yes I would recommend 00307. It helped me a lot, in my method of study but also in my understanding of other subjects. Although the method and approach were very new to me I was able to gain so much from this course and apply what I had learned to the rest of my subjects. The study must be very rigorous, sometimes nearly scientific. Although this can be challenging it enables a deeper understanding of philosophy. By the end of the term I was able to really appropriate to myself the concepts we had learned: I think this is specifically due to the method used in class. Professor Elizondo was wonderful. Professor Elizondo had the habit of making sure an argument was understood by dissecting its structure step by step. His relationship with the students was also very positive as there was no evident \"superior\/inferior\" interaction. Professor Elizondo valued each of our opinions carefully and was very flexible in his office hours. However, be prepared on your papers, he is a hard grader.",
    "A surface-level exploration of the philosophical texts deemed by the DS admins to be the foundations of the Western philosophy cannon. Great for relatively brief, but valuable, exposure to core philosophers."
