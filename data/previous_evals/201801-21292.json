    "I developed visual analysis skills and a background on Buddhist art and culture.",
    "Learned about art and architecture of the Buddhist world as well as a few Buddhist concepts",
    "I learned a lot about religion from a more objective perspective than what I have been used to from attending Catholic school. Also I learned a lot about how to critique and consider art.",
    "Developed my understanding of Buddhism, all the realms located in the Buddhist cosmology, and it helped me appreciate Buddhist art.",
    "I learned a lot about buddhism, as a religion and also as an inspiration\/style of art. I also learned various different ways, perspectives and ideas on buildings and art.",
    "Buddhist ideology and practices",
    "I learned so much about Buddhism and how to analyze artwork.",
    "I learned some very basic and fundamental principles of Buddhist theology and visual tradition. I'm now able to visually distinguish Theravada, Mahayana, and Vajrayana art and architecture.",
    "Learned the history of Buddhism from the perspective of an art critic. Very interesting information.",
    "This course is an overview of Buddhist Art and Architecture. The scope spans over many centuries and geographical locations including India, Sri Lanka, Myanmar, Thailand, China, Japan, Tibet, and Nepal.",
    "crash course in buddhist art",
    "I felt I had a deeper understanding of the way Buddhism expresses it's beliefs.",
    "I learned so much about the techniques employed when making buddhist art, the history of the regions where Buddhism spread, and the details of architecture."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "A lot of emphasis on the 'art and architecture' and I think that more emphasis on the religious aspect would have been better to contextualize art and make it more interesting",
    "I liked how it was organized, really interesting material",
    "The lectures were dry and didn't contribute to how I did on evaluations",
    "Mimi is interested in the material and the TAs were great. Could structure the class so that attendance was more mandatory.",
    "Overall and interesting course but the lectures felt very overwhelming due to the large amount of information presented.",
    "The course was great!",
    "Strengths: The course was interesting and the course load was very manageable. Professor Yiengpruksawan (Mimi) is incredibly knowledgable about the topic and deeply cares about her students' education. The fact that many of the pictures used on the lecture slides were taken by Mimi herself testifies to how experienced she is with Buddhist visual tradition and practice. Weaknesses: At the beginning of the semester, some of the readings were hard to access or find. Eventually the TFs starting making PDF scans of the readings, which really helped.",
    "The class was fun and well organized",
    "This course is well structured between Mimi's lectures and the TA's sections. However, I would have liked more online resources. Many of the course readings were only accessible from books on reserve in the library. This made it difficult to complete them. Additionally, much of the lecture was parallel to or repeating the readings rather than incorporating them in an engaging way.",
    "honestly great class. Cool lectures. Mimi's super knowledgeable",
    "Strengths: very comprehensive, fair exams Weaknesses: should emphasize Buddhist philosophy more, architecture should be explained in terms of its philosophical underpinnings rather than just having the structure described"

   "comments": [
    "If you haven't taken an art history class, I think this is a good class to see if you like that kind of thing.",
    "This was a really chill class with a lot of interesting material, especially if you're interested in Buddhism (which was the reason why I took this class). I feel like I'm able to appreciate Buddhist art a lot more and learned the basics of the different tradition without feeling overwhelmed by the class. Highly recommend!",
    "Yes; I would definitely recommend this to interested students",
    "Yes, if you are interested in Buddhism then take this course.",
    "Mimi is very passionate and knowledgeable about this subject, but the material is quite unfamiliar and lectures tended to be a bit disorganized, which is somewhat challenging for an intro art history course. As an art history major, I would say you should take this class if you are very interested in the subject matter, but if you are looking for a more general art history experience, I think there are some better intro classes.",
    "yes",
    "Yes if they are looking for a survey course that works a broad and large area without going into specifics. Otherwise, no",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS. Mimi is amazing and the material is engaging.",
    "Yes",
    "I would recommend the course to someone who actually wants to engage with art. This is not a gut course as I was led to believe, but I'm really glad I took it! There was a 3 page essay and then a final 10 page paper, as well as 2 midterms where we had to memorize around 70 art pieces for each one, including artist, time period, date, material, and place of origin-- it was not easy! Mimi was a great lecturer and the TA's seemed genuinely engaged with the class.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this to any student who is interested in art history. It was unlike any other art history course I've taken, and it opened my eyes to the diversity of visual expression within a religion context.",
    "Yes, great class if you are looking to learn more about a new topic",
    "I would recommend this to any student interested in the topic or in taking a lower-level art history class.",
    "Totally for anyone looking for a solid intro to history-of-art",
    "This course offers a perpective on an art form that is not often taught and introduced me to some truly beautiful works.",
    "Yes. Great survey course not too much work. Interesting."
