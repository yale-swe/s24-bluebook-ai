   "comments": [
    "I felt that I didn't learn much.",
    "I would recommend this class only to people with the proper preparation. Unless you have a good grounding in biophysics some topics may be new or explained too superficially for you to really appreciate some concepts.",
    "I learned some stuff from this course, but I would only recommend it guardedly.",
    "I would recommend it because it makes you think more critically about data your see in papers as well as your own data.",
    "Yes, but don't have the mindset that everything will just be handed to you.",
    "A good course for grad students. A challenge for undergrads but worth it. Hard, long psets. One midterm, one final paper this year.",
    "This class is a way to understand\/quantify how proteins interact with their ligands and other proteins. I would recommend this class but with some reservations because of the overall effectiveness of Lynne's teaching style, the homework, and the discussion sections. Also, it was not fair to decide on a date for homework to be due at the beginning of the course and then have this date modified for most of the course's duration.",
    "Yes I would.It gives a very experiment-centric overview in looking at macromolecular interactions, from isolated complexes (and the interpretations of their experiments and characterization techniques) to modeling large networks."

   "question_text": "How did this course deepen your knowledge of your discipline\/profession? To what extent did this course contribute to your dissertation\/research?",
   "comments": [
    "I didn't feel that I learned much.",
    "It did, but I would prefer more teaching and less lecturing.",
    "Teaches critical thinking about sizes and relations in systems.Makes this course individual",
    "It helped me critically think about my own discipline and the papers I read within it as well as my own data.",
    "I think this class is pretty fundamental. Every paper operates on assumptions and it's part of critical reading and thinking and experimental design to know the foundation for those assumptions.",
    "Some of the techniques that we learned about I may use, like ITC. I never knew about it before and it was certainly enlightening.",
    "Got an overall context for some topics that I have learned in other classes. Felt that we learned how to 'put it all together'",
    "I have never understood macromolecular interactions like I do now, and probably will never understand them like this again.",
    "I benefited most from the final project where I could investigate a topic (a set of interactions) of interest to me. The rest of the course was moderately applicable. A greater amount of the class would have been more applicable if I better understood the concepts that were trying to be taught. For instance, Lynne said that we needed to know the Scatchard plot --- this plot was never discussed in detail. Rather, it was thrown up on a PowerPoint and we were told to know it. A graduate education should not rely on Wikipedia for understanding topics that we have great professors for.",
    "This improves my knowledge of the protein-protein interactions very much. Exposes me to the limitations of the techniques used in elucidating these interactions.Proteins almost do not work in an isolated fashion when carrying out their biological functions. Hence this is definitely useful in my career looking at proteins."
