    "Take this course and be sure to take it with Professor Khawaja. She is amazing, everything you would ever want in professor leading a small seminar. Don't be scared of existentialism, but I do suggest to either be in a mental state where you can handle some prodding and questioning when really engaging with the text, or to be able to read more detached, but that's less fun and meaningful.After this course, you'll be a more honest human being with greater awareness. It's up to you as to whether you think that will make you \"better\" or \"happier\" or give you \"purpose.\"",
    "If Professor Khawaja is teaching it, you have to take it. Otherwise evaluate the professor and decide. The material is incredible, and should be a requirement for every graduate of a high-intensity academic institution. However, it can also be difficult to understand without the help of a great professor.",
    "You should definitely take this course. I took it because I wanted to read people like Nietzsche and Kierkegaard before leaving Yale,and I don't regret anything. This class has challenged me and my beliefs and for that reason I think it's one of the most valuable courses I've taken at Yale.",
    "I loved this course! The readings are all fantastic and Prof. Khawaja is extremely knowledgeable. Our conversations were often interrupted by the end of class period. Prof. Khawaja even hosted several out-of-class sessions to cover material that we missed, and these were all well-attended. The material is deeply personal, and with some of the readings, we examined ourselves as much as the reading. I only wish we had done this with more of the readings. Of course, this has to do with the course as much as it has to do with the students in the room. We could have done a better job of bringing it in. Overall, take this class. I also think you will enjoy it more in a seminar setting rather than a lecture setting. Existentialism is a personal philosophy (it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mostly written in the first person). You should read it and discuss it, not hear about it in lecture form.",
    "Yes, it's a great class. We read Kierkegaard, Nietzsche, Heidegger, Sartre, among others. Prof Khawaja is knowledgeable, approachable, friendly, helpful. The papers are engaging. Definitely worth it.",
    "As expected from an existentialism course listed under religious studies, this is a philosophy class focused on several existentialist thinkers and emphasized their place in dialogue about religion a little more than a class listed under philosophy might. It was theoretically structured as a seminar, but ended up being less student-centered discussion of ideas than expected, perhaps because of the difficulty of the texts. It was typically a 45ish minute interactive lecture interspersed with questions about definitions, what the text meant, etc., with a little time at the end for more discussion. With the fast pace of the class, the density and philosophical rigor of the texts, and the storm fiascos (which cut two days of class, that we actually made up plus more time, but it threw the schedule off), it was hard to gain a deep understanding of each work\/author and the ways they interacted with one another - as soon as things started to click, we moved on, which was both great because we got to cover a lot of material and frustrating because it didn't leave room to really sit on a text and dig in. However, the structure of the writing assignments was GREAT because what Professor K. asks is basically just that you grapple with something happening in the text that interests you, so it's an awesome learning experience to just have to try to figure something out and then present your thought process as a paper. Those were the most fun for me and I loved them. This is definitely a philosophy class, and as such, it was really rewarding to see a variety of styles of writing that embody philosophical dialogues (a novel, a pseudonymously written \"diary\" abouta relationship with another along with a written correspondence between the two and a reaction by a third party, several different styles of philosophical prose) and be challenged to do philosophy in a rigorous way myself.There was A LOT of reading in this class - like an overwhelming amount. But given that there was a consensus among students that it was simply too much (which occasionally detracted from discussion because people just hadn't read, or read well), I bet that it will be adjusted to be a more manageable amount of reading.This is not an easy class, but it's a rewarding one, and your peers are ones who actually care about learning the subject material, which makes it more enriching.I would restructure this in a few ways, but still definitely recommend the class."
