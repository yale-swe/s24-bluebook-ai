   "comments": [
    "114 is a good intro to academic writing class. I came from a foreign education system where writing was completely different so I do think I learnt a fair bit about just style and structure (114 was also very hyped during OIS).",
    "This English class not only offers deep insights into its topic (\"Consumer Culture in the U.S.A.\") but also serves as a fantastic introduction intro writing the college paper. Regardless of skill level coming into college, this course still has something for everyone; you can always learn.",
    "I learned how to be a more critical writer and to sharpen my style. I also experienced a great introduction into the world of academic writing, for college writing is very different from high school writing.",
    "I learned a lot about the resources available for me as a writer here at Yale including how to contact writing tutors, librarians, and access the very extensive barrels of secondary and primary sources in Yale's many libraries. As a writer, I learned about the the importance of drafting and the importance of having a clear plan of attack before writing. I feel I grew as a writer and as an academic by taking this class, particularly because I am a stem student.",
    "Writing!",
    "Through taking this class, I feel that I have developed significantly as a writer. I have been pushed to analyze and respond to academic writing at a deeper level.",
    "I was taking this course in order to improve my writing skills, and it helped me tremendously. Not only Andrew teaches how to write, but also how to think and justify your point of view like a scholar."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "This course does an effective job of having students practice their writing and editing skills. I think a weakness is sometimes in-class discussions don't lead to deeper understanding of the texts being analyzed.",
    "Strengths: 1. small seminar, interesting in class discussions 2. well organized Weaknesses: 1.didn't really learn much during discussions that directly contributed to improving my writing. Most of my writing feedback came from my professor.",
    "The strength of this class is the seminar\/discussion style that the class exists in. The professor, in addition, facilitates a fantastic learning environment that nurtures students to become better writers. Everything was well scheduled and well planned out.",
    "The writing drafts, as cumbersome as they were, were very helpful in improving the quality of papers, for my professor was able to provide very helpful and clear feedback that I used to improve my paper. I would, however, suggest that each paper has two drafts rather than one and that there are instead less papers, for I feel like my papers would have still benefited from more feedback even after final submission.",
    "The format of this class was awesome. The weekly readings made every class organic and the open discussions were very conducive to creating a communal environment. And, the class time at 4pm was very accommodating. There are no notable weaknesses; perhaps it would be nice if more peer-peer editing was implemented.",
    "Strengths: Professor Wilson's English 114 seminar was very engaging and enjoyable! I feel like I have gained great insight on consumerism in both historical and contemporary contexts. The course content was interesting in itself, and I believe that the best parts of the course were the class discussions mediated by Professor Wilson. The readings were thought-provoking, insightful, and weren't too long. Weaknesses: None",
    "No major weaknesses."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "If you want a low-stress course that helps you practice your writing skills, I would recommend this course.",
    "Whether or not 114 is right for you depends on your background and comfort with academic writing. I have friends who came away saying they learnt nothing from the course and others who skipped it entirely to take ENGL 120 which is more creative writing oriented. I learnt some things from the course and maybe i could've gained the same skills had i taken another writing intensive course, but the topic of seminar was interesting and not something I would have studied otherwise, so no complaints!",
    "Take this class. Just do it, you won't regret it. Even if you think you're an English hot-shot who doesn't need 114, this section is for you. \"Consumer Culture\" is not only engaging and fun, the level of discussion and help you get in learning how to write a college paper is fantastic. Easily the best course I took all semester. At the end, you can see the improvement you have made as a writer.",
    "If a student truly appreciates writing and really wants to improve their writing and learn how to write a college level paper, I would 100% recommend this course. If writing is not one of a student's favorite activities, the course may seem a little laborious and painful, albeit still manageable. Nevertheless, for any student who seeks to improve the quality of their writing, I would definitely recommend this class.",
    "Yes I would. In general I would recommend writing to any student, but this section in particular was awesome. The professor was engaging and the course load was manageable yet stimulating.",
    "This class is good for students who are interested in improving their essay writing. It is laid back and not too stressful, and the multiple draft process gives students the opportunity to get feedback from the professor multiple times before submitting the final product.",
    "You probably have to take it for the writing credit, but worthwhile nonetheless. Would recommend.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student! Professor Wilson is an amazing professor, and the course content is very thought-provoking and relevant to our lives. The workload is very manageable, and the readings are not that long either.",
    "I was taking this course in order to improve my writing skills, and it helped me tremendously. Andrew is great at teaching. Not only he teaches you how to write, but also how to think and justify your point of view like a scholar. If you are interested in advertising, marketing, and consumerism you will probably love this course just like I did. There is a lot of work, though. The readings are interesting and easy to understand (can be done hour before the class starts). However, the papers are very time consuming -- so better start early."
