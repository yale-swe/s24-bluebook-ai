    "I learned a ton about US-Russian relations, particularly about Russian strategic ideals and why the world looks like it does right now. Furthermore, I learned how to see complex issues, such as those that dominate the US-Russian relationship, through multiple lenses.",
    "So much relevant insights into larger global relations than simply just US and Russia. IT went deeper than I could have imagined International relations could go",
    "Knowledge-wise, I learned alot about Russia and its perspective on the world, and the US response to Russia. In terms of skills, we practiced a-lot of critical thinking in terms of counterarguments, implications of arguments, limitations, etc. Dr. Safranchuk really pushed us on our thinking and as a result I think it helped us develop a more nuanced understanding of geopolitics.",
    "I now have a strong understanding of US Russia dynamics in the context of the larger world since the Cold War.",
    "Great way to think about US foreign policy, and an insightful introduction to Russian strategy. We also examined every major interaction and issue-area between the US and Russia since the Cold War which provided key background and an interesting lens with which we could discuss more current matters."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "A strength was the readings, course structure, the papers, and the teacher-led discussions. My one gripe was that some topics would linger into the following week, which would take time away from the assigned topic of that week and were usually unproductive because they were just rehashing old discussions from the previous class.",
    "Requires intentional and deep preparation to truly be engaged",
    "Dr. Safranchuk does a really good job of balancing lecturing and facilitating discussion, through starting seminar with his own presentation but then posing questions to the class. Due to the small class size, students had a lot of opportunity to participate and argue back and forth with one another and the teacher. The course content and structuring around regions, core issues, etc worked very well, and I enjoyed the readings from current magazine sources, though I think less readings per week would enable us to go into more depth on them. Additionally, though I walked away with a strong understanding of the complexity of the conflict, I don't feel like it was always clear what the goal of the course was- to have a specific view on US-Russia relations, to just understand it better, etc. It would have been helpful to end seminar discussions with a summary of key takeaways.",
    "We covered everything relevant.",
    "Subject material was a strength and the readings provided good background and prep for each discussion. More feedback on the papers would be nice."

    "Definitely take this class if you're interested in US-Russian relations. There are a variety of topics discussed, but at its core it is a security\/IR class.",
    "YES, Ivan was the best professor of all time and the class is so relevant, it might be a can't miss class",
    "Absolutely! I think it's a topic that is very relevant to many people and Dr. Safranchuk does a good job of making it accessible to anyone, regardless of major or past experience. I really learned alot.",
    "Yes. You wind up with a complete understanding of US Russia dynamics and Russia's goals in the world at large.",
    "Take this course if you like foreign policy or strategic thinking. Prof. Safranchuk is great."
