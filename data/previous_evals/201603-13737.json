   "comments": [
    "Learned much with regards to thinking deeply about philosophy and philosophy of religion questions, and have definitely grown as a reader.",
    "This class completely changed my perspective on religion and Christian doctrine.",
    "I learned how to read philosophy in a new way, and began to understand Kierkegaard's difficult thought on things like faith, despair, knowledge, and love, as well as beginning to understand how to apply my thoughts about these things to the real world, and my own life.",
    "Thinking Critically.",
    "I enhanced my ability to read carefully and think deeply.",
    "I learned to think alongside Kierkegaard and to grow with him through his brilliant thought. His philosophy has deeply influenced my own thoughts about the world and I will carry the ideas gleaned from this course with me for the rest of my life.",
    "I learned to think about questions of religion and faith and love differently, as well as learning to make an argument based on an abstract text.",
    "As a philosophy seminar, this class really taught me how to engage critically with the text at hand. We looked at few pages of work over each two hour period but I felt that even the amount we read was an ambitious goal. I definitely feel I have a better understanding of how to read philosophy more critically concerning one certain other without being force-fed a reading of the text. It is a difficult skill that I obviously need to develop more but this was a great start",
    "Good introduction to Kierkegaard's writing. Also a good first philosophy class for people looking to dive into the subject.",
    "I gained a deep and complex breadth of Kierkegaard. I also learned new skills and insights into how to delve into a text, spending a great deal of time focusing on specific and even minor parts.",
    "Kierkegaard is someone I know I'm going to return to again and again for the rest of my life, and this was a great introduction to his central texts. Both in terms of close-reading a rather unorthodox philosophical text, and in terms of the radical reinterpretation of Christianity and Platonic philosophy that Kierkegaard offers, this was an enriching, challenging course.",
    "I learned a great deal about Soren Kierkegaard's writing, but also learned how to engage with multiple works from a single author."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I think class discussion could have been a bit more guided. They often felt a bit winding and directionless, so hard to follow. Would often be confused about how to even enter into the conversation in a productive and beneficial way for others.",
    "I often walked out of class more confused than when I walked in, which I believe is a good thing. It was very stimulating to hear about other people's readings and interpretations, which informed and sometimes even changed my own. However, the class could use some structure. Kierkegaard's books, pseudonyms, and arguments are hard to follow, so I think it would have been useful to extract his central points in order to better understand his posture.",
    "This course was great. Just enough reading to be doable, without feeling like we skipped too much or went too slowly. Also had good conversation every class period. Definitely one that is better in at least a two hour period.",
    "I like that the course left us on our own to decipher Kierkegaard's confusing language and forced us to enter his world on our own terms-- that being said, I wonder if we could have benefitted from reading more excerpts from certain books (rather than the whole thing), which would possibly give us more samples from more works and the ability to look at them closer together, so that we'd be able to more clearly trace his thinking across texts.",
    "It was incredibly invaluable to focus on a single author and his books in isolation. The once a week, two hour seminar organization was effective for me, but Professor Levene would tend to let students start the class somewhat arbitrarily. As a result, there were sometimes long silences before our discussions really began.",
    "I liked how the readings increased over the course so that I could ease into them. I also really liked the way the professor discussed the readings. I did think it was a little too large as a seminar (though I realize I may not have been able to take it if it hadn't been)",
    "Strengths: Great texts and very engaging discussions. I always loved the open-ended nature of discussion that turned into a back-and-forth of the text's messages and the implications. The seminar itself was run really well. Weaknesses: I was at a loss for words concerning each essay. There was just so much to write about that the freedom was paralyzing (ironically one of Kierkegaard's themes). While I understand the skill we are trying to develop is original thought and critical thinking, I feel that at least a bit more direction during class would help. Obviously we all come up with our ideas independently but some assistance concerning \"how do i come up with a topic\" or \"how do i make my argument better\" would have been very helpful. Another possibility is to hand out a sample paper. It could be a class discussion or a \"read it on your own kind of thing\" that just gives us a sense of what is missing. You obviously can't just tell us to write a certain way but I felt this would have been more helpful.",
    "The conversations were interesting but sometimes felt a little bit tangential. Although I guess that's the nature of philosophy discussions, so I'm not sure if this could\/should be changed.",
    "A lot of times it felt like the discussion was getting nowhere. We would talk in depth about the major tensions in the text, but moved on without tying loose ends; and after each seminar I would leave exhausted, feeling that I had given the text my all, but hadn't really reached any clear conclusion about it. Over all, though, the seminar took my reading of the text and turned it upside down; it was both fun and refreshing to encounter and debate out such disparate positions on the text. And as long as a seminar keeps pushing you to think beyond your original reading, I think it's accomplished its pedagogical objectives.",
    "I loved the amount of student participation in this course. Professor Levene was always engaged in class and active in directing the discussion, but one of the reasons that I enjoyed this class was that I constantly got to hear the perspectives of many students in the class, which is pretty rare, as typically no more that two or three students are constantly active. One unfortunate consequence of this style of class was that I did not leave the semester with a strong and consistent interpretation of Kierkegaard, which can be frustrating (but I think the takeaway was that this is also the right way to study him)"

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "I strongly recommend this course. It is one of the best classes I have taken at Yale.",
    "Yes. Kierkegaard is hard to get into sometimes, but massively interesting once you are there, and Professor Levene makes him as understandable as he can be, while pushing students to see if they agree with him and how these arguments play out in our lives.",
    "yes",
    "I would fully recommend this course to another student. Kierkegaard's thought should be studied closely, not just by philosophers or theologians, but by everyone because he is offered a nuanced portrayal of the world that, in my opinion, gets closer to reality than any other thinker I've read.",
    "yes, as long as they were interested in the questions it was asking",
    "Take this class it will be hard to get into but try it (~40-50 ppl shopped it for a mere 18 spots) This is not an easy class per se in that it differs greatly from your typical philosophy seminar. You will have at most 40-60 pages per WEEK (meets once a week) and even that will feel like a lot. But understanding a guy like Kierkegaard is a lot of work. It doesn't come easy and if like me, this is your first seminar, this will be a learning experience. But fear not. Prof Levene is an amazing seminar leader that really pushed us to understand the text in our OWN way, not just some way that she saw the texts. N.B. YOU ARE NOT GRADED ON YOUR SEMINAR PARTICIPATION. This actually is a positive because it makes you feel free to experiment how you approach the text over the course of the semester. However, the papers are tough because they are very open-ended. Basically everyone felt that they were still lost while writing the paper but it did come together in the end. At the end of the day, you will have a slightly unique reading of the text, and will have something to write about. Just get started earlier and talk to Prof Levene if possible.",
    "I'd recommend it to students looking to dip their toes into some philosophy or anyone looking to learn more about Kierkegaard.",
    "Yes. The material is fascinating, and Professor Levene is a wonderful instructor.",
    "Kierkegaard pretty much turned my life around this semester. This class not only became the cornerstone of my intellectual pursuits but also changed the way I interacted with others and shaped my spiritual life. You might want to take a couple of philosophy classes (esp Plato and Hegel) before though.",
    "I would definitely suggest taking this class. Professor Levene is great, and Kierkegaard is an incredible author. While it can be frustrating to read him, he is certainly a much more engaging and approachable philosopher than many studied in other philosophy classes."
