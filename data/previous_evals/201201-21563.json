   "comments": [
    "Kind of hard to participate in discussion at 9am in the morning. It was a pretty fun class, a lot of time to do essays. Don't save them until the last minute.",
    "Good introductory writing course. A bit boring but the teacher was passionate about the subject which was cool. Got solid feedback on essays.",
    "It is a tough course that requires a lot of work and time, but will be very beneficial to you for the rest of your college classes.",
    "It is a really good class for revising papers. I found this very helpful because it let me know what I was doing wrong but also allowed me the chance to fix it.",
    "The course was a really cool progression taking monsters and applying them to the modern world. It really made me stop to consider problems facing our world today, which I really enjoyed.",
    "I don't know if I would take this course again if I had the chance to go back to the beginning of the semester. I mean the course was interesting and we really delved into the meaning of what a monster is, but I mean the teacher was so busy! She teaches english at barnard and also is a phd student at columbia. Interesting class, though.",
    "Great. The course had very interesting readings and in class discussions that made it very easy to pay attention and learn the materials that the teacher was presenting. The topics were very easy to write about and enabled me to focus on improving my writing style.I would recommend it to those who need to improve the essay writing abilities.",
    "I would recommend this class. It has a unique approach on monster analysis, and Prof Hurley is good. If the topic interests you, take it.",
    "I would recommend the course because monsters are a terrific writing subject, and fascinating to read about. This course will make you think about them in a new light - and their relationship to society and culture.",
    "English 114 seems to be the standard English freshman seminar to take (apart from 120, which is obviously for the more creative and personal kind). I thought it was the most interesting of all the 114s, 4 papers (as in all of them), although I wish the 3rd and 4th were not so crammed into the end of the semester. The research-oriented basis was good I think, although I wish we spent more time on learning to write better than on the course readings. Hurley was very knowledgeable about the subject matter and had a great, approachable attitude, but she constantly fell behind with grading and assignments which got annoying. The grading was really tough (as was expected), but I think this was one of the better 114s to take.",
    "hard work, but would recommend it if interested in monsters (including abstract ones such as science). Hurley was slow returning work, but very engaging and friendly.",
    "English 114 is an effective blend of literature and grammar for a college student. I would recommend it!"
