    "Most certailny! I would recommend that they only do so if they have some knowledge and background of either medieval history, theology, or literature - otherwise the course might be a bit disorienting.",
    "I would summarize it as an examination of the ways in which literature and theology worked together in a particular medieval period. I would definitely recommend it to those with some demonstrated interest in the subject matter.",
    "I would recommend it by saying that it has allowed us to get a holistic picture of an intellectual historical moment that can only be approached in an interdisciplinary manner. The class was full of some excellent students from the divinity school as well as from thehumanities, and that relationship worked really well, I thought.",
    "I would recommend it but explain that it is best to have significant background knowledge of the historical time period before taking the course.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course, for the reasons stated in my response to Question 1."

    "I took this course as a Religion and Literature student, and it definitely deepened my understanding of how those two categories worked together and even worked as the same thing in this particular historical period.",
    "This course has allowed me to explore further the role of women in the Middle Ages, the debates around women preachers and writers, as well as the ways in which the art of writing and theological inquiry intersect."
