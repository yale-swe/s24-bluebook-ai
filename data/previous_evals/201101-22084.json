    "If you have an interest in Woolf and the moderns, take this course. Professor Homans is an exceptional guide and teacher. It is always a delight when you take a course about a wonderful writer with a committed and skilled professor. This course will not disappoint you.",
    "This is a great course; it's definitely a traditional English seminar, but Professor Homans is brilliant and kind and Woolf is so rewarding to study in this much depth. It's a ton of reading, but well worth it!",
    "Great seminar if you want to read a lot of Woolf!",
    "Take \"Virginia Woolf\" if you know and love her already. Otherwise, this may be too much to handle outright.",
    "This course is the greatest!!! Take it if you love VW, or even if you've never read her works--the syllabus is well-thought out and the readings will enrich your semester. Professor Homans is a wonderful professor who ensured that we always had a rewarding class discussion; I always looked forward to Tuesday afternoon seminar.",
    "This course was good, but not quite as great as I had hoped. The discussions are fine and Professor Homans is very smart.",
    "English 446 offers a great study of Woolf's career. The reading can be, at times, heavy, but it's manageable, and the final paper is a pleasure to write. Professor Homans is great. If you're interested in the material, take this class!",
    "See question 1",
    "Yes!!! It is a great course. The reading list is wonderful! Virginia Woolf has such a healing and restorative and wonderufl power. But beyond some sort of self-therapy, I really would recommend it. Professor Homans really knows her stuff and is so eager to share. It is well organized and you don't end up doing lots of busy work so to speak (especailly good if that's not your thang)."
