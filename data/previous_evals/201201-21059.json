   "comments": [
    "Genetics 760 should be a required course, especially with the decreasing cost and increasing frequency of high throughput sequencing data. This class not only teaches you about next gen sequencing, but also teaches you how to analyze the massive data sets that are generated by these technologies. I most definitely recommend the course, and I would suggest that it should be required, especially for the genetics department.",
    "This is a good course for those interested in large-data analysis, review of fundamental aspects of genomics, review of technical aspects of high-throughput methodologies used in genomics, through the use of problem sets different aspects of analysis are explored.I would recommend the course.",
    "GENE 760 is a crash course in modern bioinformatics techniques, primarily focusing on how to process and interpret large datasets generated from next generation sequencing. You will learn how to use Yale's supercomputers to process data, various online evaluation and visualization tools, as well as some basic programming (perl) and statistical techniques (R). It is extremely practical, and fairly well taught. Lectures don't always match up with the problem sets though, so please be aware that you will need to do a fair bit of self-teaching with the programming -- although the Teaching Assistants and Professor Noonan did make themselves accessible.",
    "This class provides an introduction to genomic methods, including RNAseq, ChIPseq and whole exome seq data sets. It gives a flavor for how one might go about analyzing large sequencing datasets from scratch. This class provides a strong foundation from which one can learn methods necessary to carry out any number of analyses in genomic sciences.I strongly believe that all students receiving a phD in Genetics from Yale should be highly encouraged, if not required, to take this course. Classical genetics methods which we all learned as undergrads are no longer practically applicable, and modern methods which we all read about in current literature are simply not taught in any other class. I find it unacceptable that many graduate students rely on someone else to analyze sequencing data for them. Graduate students don't need assistance in analyzing a DNA gel or a western blot,so there is no reason why analyzing sequencing data should be any different. If data derived from sequencing experiments play an integral part in one's thesis project, there is simply no excuse not to make effort to learn how exactly the necessary analysis is carried out. Lack of resources to learning these methods is a huge impediment for many students to execute analysis of their own data and taking this course provides with some basic knowledge that will undoubtably become useful at some point.",
    "This is a challenging but very rewarding class. This course was one of the most useful classes taken at Yale for MCGD program. I would recommend this course for students seriously interested in learning how to analyze genomic data. Work load is heavy but appropriate.",
    "This course is not for the faint of heart. It certainly teaches cutting edge genomic methods (the future of biology), but in an ultra-intensive manner. It is useful for anyone who will be utilizing genetics in their future experiments, but may be overkill for those with only a passing interest.",
    "I would definitely recommend it.I came to Yale with almost zero knowledge about Genomics. After this course, I have some intermediate understanding of various genomics techniques. And also learned to run some basic analyses.",
    "A good introductory class for bioinformatics. I would recommend the class to another student",
    "This course gives a thorough overview of the theoretical and practical aspects of genomics in the era of high-throughput sequencing. By the end of the course you will be able to analyze and interpret the majority of genomic data.I would thoroughly recommend this course since it is the best means to rapidly learn this rapidly developing area of medicine."

   "comments": [
    "I now have a much better understanding of high throughput technologies, both how their data are generated and how to analyze that data. Even though I am not going into a sequencing lab, I still recognize the value of understanding this technology when I read scientific papers, and I expect that in the future many more people will be using this type of technology.",
    "The research techniques were hugely useful to any and all genetics research I might conduct in the future. Even if I don't use these tools directly, because so much research is driven by next generation sequencing, my literacy \/ \"taste\" for good work that might inform my on research was very helpful.",
    "Taking this course provided me with a foundation from which I could use new methods in genomic sciences. In the short time of the course, I was able to not only learn a bunch of new skills, but also learn how to learn new methods in genomics. I applied the knowledge that I acquired in this class to learn novel techniques which were useful for my 3rd rotation project. The type of analysis I performed would not have been possible had I not taken this course.I anticipate that I will be using the knowledge I acquired in this class during my dissertation research. If I do not immediately use the exact techniques that I used in the class, I feel that now I know how to find and learn methods that may become applicable to my research.This course has also introduced me to new Yale faculty, which allowed for terrific networking opportunities. This may become relevant when I choose my thesis committee, or need scientific guidance that one of these people likely have expertise in.",
    "This course helped me better understand genomics a lot more! And is very relevant for my research, which is also genomics-related.",
    "I learned a lot of bioinformatics analysis stills for the analysis of next generation sequencing data from this course. The knowledge that I learned from this course help me to analyze my own deep sequencing data for my dissertation research.",
    "Gave a thorough understanding of modern genomics approaches which I expect to form the basis of my dissertation\/research."
