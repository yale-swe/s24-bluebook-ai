    "Yes because it solidifies everything you learned in L1 and L2",
    "You probably need to take this class for your language requirement if you have already taken L1 and L2, but expect to not be taught much and be expected to learn it all on your own. We rarely focused on anything in class that we were tested on. Although L3 is mainly a review of old subject matter, it is still frustrating to spend no class time on the material. If for some reason you are considering L3, but do not need it for a language requirement, do not take it.",
    "basic continuation of L2 and L3. Standard language class.",
    "This was a good section of Italian.",
    "Ital 130 is a waste of time, but if you're taking it, you probably have to. You learn no new material. You spend days reading works and then never discuss (or understand) them. Much like many days throughout the semester, the entirety of the final two weeks is spent doing nothing. Like the rest of the material, the final presentation at the art museum is lifted directly from the L2 curriculum. You never really learn the material in class. Every 50 minutes spent in this class felt longer and longer.",
    "Great course. Try to take it with Patrick Waldron. He was very helpful.",
    "If you want to spend an entire semester wanking your d, by all means take Italian 130.If you have to take 130 to finish off your language requirement, go ahead but don't expect any learning to come out of it.Otherwise, do not take this class. It is a waste of a credit and a waste of your time.A little review, you spend each test relearning the grammatical structures you already learned in L1 and L2. You learn maybe, 1 new concept? Probably something you knew already but got of forgot about.Then you watch some movies for a week and read a few stories but don't worry you won't understand them at the end anyway.And then the vocabulary your learn? Nothing useful, just topics that you will never ever use in your life. Learn how to pay a mortgage on a house? WOW I'm going to use that.This is definitely a joke of a class, you have to spend maybe an hour studying before the exams if you are decent enough at Italian.But I just can't fathom anything needing or wanting to take this class unless you really just need 1.5 more credits to graduate.Such a joke.",
    "Solid class, I had way more fun learning Italian than I expected to given my distaste for foreign language study. Prof Waldron rocks"
