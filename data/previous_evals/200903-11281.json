    "Econ 330 is an interesting application of microeconomics. It is not too rigorous, but you do benefit from going to class and section. The math is not difficult, and none of the concepts are too hard to grasp. You will put in a bit of time going to class and mandatory section, but overall, a relaxing and interesting course.",
    "A broad, qualitative introduction to environmental economics. I enjoy going to all the lectures but I feel frustrated sometime cuz there is no textbook for the class. The exams are tricky (not hard) though.",
    "Yes, take it. You'll learn a lot but in the end, you'll probably want to learn more.",
    "Econ 330 is really interesting, but Prof. Mendelsohn does not have any lecture slides or text book, so you must attend all lectures and take very careful notes if you want to do well on the exams. The tests are not particularly difficult, but, again, take good notes in class! Problem sets are really easy. The sections are easy to get a good grade on if you get a nice TA and the section quizzes are really easy and are not worth much anyway. Take it if you are looking for a fairly easy Econ class, but do not expect to do well if you don't attend lecture.",
    "Absolutely not. Complete waste of your time. I got a good grade in the end but a lot of my friends didn't. The grading is really arbitrary and the only thing lecture is good for is nap time. Robert Mendelsohn is the worst teacher I've had at Yale and is completely disorganized.",
    "Yes, finally an econ class that has important real world applications",
    "Yes! Global warming, pollutions and natural resources management are alarming issues and one should have a critical perspective rather than just follow the media.",
    "This class moves at an extremely slow pace. The problem sets are very easy, and there isnt much work beyond them. Don't need to do the readings. He gives a nice straightforward introduction to issues of environmental use. Take this class for an easy econ credit, but don't expect to skip class.",
    "Absolutely!",
    "Take it! Take it! Take it!Even though it's a easy class, it totally revolutionized the way I think as an Econ major. The class also corrected a lot of the misconceptions I had about pollution control. The class covers loads of interesting material from how we should be extracting nonrenewable resources to allocating property rights of a common good. The professor is an awesome speaker. I looked forward to this class every week and talked about the material we covered to my parents and friends. It's a truly inspiring class that instills a sense of mission in you.",
    "I strongly recommend this class. The economics of natural resources is an extremely important subject. The class sheds a lot of light on how economists approach environmental issues and, therefore, offers some realistic policy improvements that we can and should be making. It is not a PoliSci course, and for that reason Professor Mendelsohn talks more about the theoretical goals than how to achieve them politically. But this course puts into simple terms issues that many consider too complicated to be worth understanding in detail. Highly recommended.",
    "A great intro the environmental economics. It definitely get me interested in issues that I didn't care about before, and it was cool to have everything I've learned in my other econ classes applied to something that matters.",
    "If you're interested in learning about some interesting topics of natural resource economics take this course. This course does not present global climate change economics quite as you may expect, and instead focuses much on the examples of timber and fish economics. I recommend it for majors and non-majors interested in the subject.",
    "If you're an econ major definitely take it as it's relatively easy, and if you're not I'd still say yes because it's also pretty interesting. The problem sets are cake, the tests aren't difficult, and the readings are unnecessary. You do need to go to class though as there's no textbook and thus lecture is the only way to know what stuff is important.",
    "A good economics course with several interesting micro models. I'd recommend this course to an econ major.",
    "Yes for non-econ majors.",
    "Awesome course! I don't want to sound stereotypical, but this course really did entirely change the way that I look at the environment. Even if you aren't that interested in the environment itself, the topic provides many extremely interesting situations to study through an economics perspective.Not much work (10 short p-sets, midterm, final) and short but substantive lecturers. The topics range from global warming to fishery regulation (actually a fascinating topic, despite the boring sound of it).Makesure you know calculus if you take this course; it would be difficult (though possible) to take the course without it.",
    "Good class, but midterm was a bit arbitrarily graded this year. Felt that TA makes or breaks the course.Avoid Snaebjorn, though -- worst TA ever. Doesn't offer any help outside section, doesn't announce quizzes in advance, and sections are utterly useless.",
    "Take it.",
    "This course was great. It was a rational, economic look into natural resources and environmental management. It has been one of my favorite classes at Yale and I found it to be thought-provoking and fascinating. I have a much better understanding of how to look at environmental problems that can help me discern between the ideas of the \"tree-hugger\" and \"greedy businessman\" camps and everything in between. It was a pleasure to take this class and I definitely recommend it for anyone interested in the environment.",
    "I would recommend this to an Econ major who is looking to fill out a schedule. It's a fine, low intensity class. However, grading can be punishing because the tests are easy enough that most people do very well.",
    "If you're willing to learn irrelevant, useless material in the most disorganized way possible, take this class. There's no textbook which makes it impossible to follow the material in a coherent manner, so instead you have to sit through the boring lectures and distill what is important from what is utter bullshit. There are much more valuable economics courses out there...don't waste your time on this class. The curve sucks, too.",
    "Yes, I would recommend it. It's not very difficult and you learn a lot about environmental issues that are interesting.",
    "It is a good course with practical and relevant material.",
    "Yes, it's not that hard and lectures are really interesting. That said, TA's are not accessible, so if you don't understand something make sure you get someone to explain it to you before the midterm or final. it's easy to bomb the exams if you have a lot of gaps...",
    "Great econ lecture for major credit, especially for right after intro lectures. You'll also learn about what's going on in environmental economics, gain some substantive background on the 'green' debate, and apply what you learned in more theoretical intro classes. Readings are pretty much optional if you keep up with lecture (Mendelsohn does a good job of summing up the take-away points), weekly psets, one midterm and one final.",
    "take it if you're into the environment or need a QR that's fun to sit through. GO TO LECTURE. it will make exams a lot easier.",
    "it is a good class for an econ major to add to his or her econ portfolio.",
    "Absolutely. It's an easier econ course with manageable problem sets and a really engaging professor. You'll learn about real life applications of economic models for solving environmental problems and there is no need for a text book.",
    "For an economics major, definitely. It won't be that challenging for you, its an interesting course, and its better taught than a lot of economics courses. For a non-major, maybe. It depends on how comfortable you are with basic economic concepts. The curve will be very tough if you don't, and you won't learn them in this course.",
    "Econ 330 is one of the best econ classes at Yale. Only a background in into micro is needed. The class is interesting because of applications to the real world. Professor Mendelsohn is an expert in the field and he is truly enthusiastic about the subject matter. The workload is manageable. I would definitely recommend taking this class.",
    "Very interesting course, with great material. Professor sometimes goes off on tangents, but overall is very insightful. This is his field, so he knows a lot about the subject.",
    "Yes, the class is pretty easy and interesting. Problem sets take almost no time. Tests are manageble but there is still a good curve.",
    "I thought this class was going to be a cakewalk based on what other people told me. It further proved to me why I shouldn't have decided to be an econ major. The class itself was incredibly interesting since we talked about things like pollution, forest\/land\/water management, and fisheries in ways I never really thought of before. Professor Mendelsohn is a fairly good lecturer and really knows what he's talking about. His presentations are usually pretty clear, but things may get a bit confusing when he draws figures and graphs on the board. Because of its reputation as an easier econ class, there were quite a few athletes in the class. Some of them sauntered in late or insisted on \"whispering\" during class, which made it difficult to hear what the professor was saying at times. Somewhat unrelated to the athlete thing, but if you're a sophomore considering being an econ major, please take a moment to reconsider (like I wish I had done).",
    "Econ 330 is a really good class. Professor Mendelsohn is a really good lecturer who stays on topic and manages to hold your attention for the entire 50 minute period. Careful with the sections though-the topics they cover changes from section to section so it's worth looking for a good TA.",
    "Take it if you're interested in the material, cause I wasn't and the class got old by the end.",
    "Good class, i definitely recommend it for econ majors. You have to go to lecture and section and take good notes, because it doesn't have a text book. But if you go to class, you'll be fine and you don't have to put in much time outside of class. Weekly problem sets aren't bad.",
    "Take it. It is so much less painful than pretty much ALL of the other economics courses, it is a 50 minute lecture, and the material is more than just complicated calculus and endless graphs. The stuff you learn in this course is applicable to more than just the field of economics and Mendelsohn is a great guy. Definitely one of the better economics credits in a highly lackluster department.",
    "I approached Econ 330 thinking it was a gut. Then I got my first quiz back and decided to take it seriously. If like me you end up doing so, you will be rewarded. It delved into complexities that I wouldn't have otherwise expected and even though I was not particularly interested in the management of natural resources at the beginning of the course, certainly at the end I was. Mendelsohn is one of the Econ major's more engaging lecturers. The only thing that will bug you about the class is the extent to which the TAs (by and large, are clueless). If you can, put yourself in the section taught by the Econ graduate student (Rick Mansfield -- by far the course's best TA when I took it). I don't know what they teach at the School of Forestry, but it sure as hell ain't anything useful.",
    "It is like intro micro and is helpful. It gives insights into EPA regulations and policy measures.",
    "Yes",
    "Take it for sure. One of the gems of the econ department. A good 5th class- and interesting easy stuff.",
    "I took it as a course that fulfilled a requirement. I think its a good 5th or 6th class to take, as it did not take much time, and i learnt quite a bit. If you do take it, make sure you sit in the first couple of rows, cause otherwise you will learn nothing.",
    "Yes, though the class is not as organized and effectively taught as it could be, the subject is very interesting. The professor is a pioneer in the field and you can tell that he is very passionate about what he does and wants to inspire the next generation to take it up as well. As interesting as the subject is, the course is pretty broad, but it's okay because all the topics are related. The structure of the course is good, starting with the basics of microeconomics and pollution economics and covering important microeconomic concepts and environmental areas such as fishery, forestry and nonrenewable resources. It is one of the easier econ courses (though not as easy as I thought, having read the evaluations). You still need to understand the concepts well.",
    "Interesting class; the problem sets are often unclear, but the TAs are usually willing to help. Make sure you do\/understand the readings for the midterm and final, which often pull from these for the qualitative questions. Also, the \"tricks\" on the exams are that the professor will perhaps switch around an equation that you're used to and write it differently, e.g., instead of MC=4A +32, he'll perhaps give A=.25MC-8...seems simple, just keep that in mind for the exams so you don't get tripped up. The quizzes are kind-of annoying, but helpful to keep you up on the info.",
    "Yes, especially if you are an econ major. interesting and not too much material.",
    "Take it but pay attention from beginning to end, go to all lectures and choose Rick Mansfield's section. Keep up with the class, don't think it'll be a gut.",
    "yes, it's a great class",
    "It was interesting - mainly focused on the material covered in lecture. There were readings online for the first half of the class and then no readings for the second half. We had no text book. The first half is focused on pollution control, and the second half is split between nonrenewable and renewable resources.",
    "Yes, if you're thinking of being an economics major take it",
    "This class is the easiest class I've taken at Yale. It applies basic concepts from micro to pollution and natural resources. The math is VERY simple (easier than intro micro). Grading feels somewhat arbitrary; it really pays to go to class because all of the questions on the midterm are based on the lectures. The reading is completely unnecessary. The homework takes about an hour a week. The problem with the class is that because it's so easy, it's hard to differentiate which students know what's going on. If you pay attention in lecture and can handle basic math, you should be fine.",
    "A good class. Definitely should take.",
    "It's kind of strange because it seems like it's not a lot of work, but I didn't find the exams to be that easy. IfI could go back, I probably wouldn't take it because I didn't think it was that useful a class for me and there were some other classes I probably would've felt better about taking. If you're looking for a QR, there are probably better classes to take. I guess taking this class might seem like an easier QR to sum, but I'd probably rather take math or something.",
    "Yes. Take it.",
    "This course is a great introduction to economic approaches \/ solutions to some of the most pressing global environmental issues of our time. The professor is very engaging and cares deeply about the subject. The midterm and final are very doable, the workload is fairly light and the course focusses more on conceptual understanding than on the mathimatical aspects of the problems. Overall, I'd definitely recommend this course to anyone who has some interest in the environment, even if you aren't a econ \/ environmental studies major.",
    "Easy material, medium curve.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course.",
    "Mostly economics majors here, who think it's an easy class. As a political science major, I struggled a bit more, but overall I would recommend this class. Ten problem sets, a midterm, and a final. Learned a lot about the environment, and brushed up on my econ skills.",
    "Good class, problem sets are not too bad if you dont feel great with your math. You learn a decent amount of material you likely didnt know before.",
    "I would recommend it. It was easy and interesting.",
    "Very easy problem sets to anyone who has ever taken an Econ class before, and overall you'll learn some cool things about economics and the environment."
