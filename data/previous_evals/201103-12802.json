   "comments": [
    "I would only recommend it if the student knew the class was right for them.",
    "Yes. Take it! So much cool information!!!",
    "great!",
    "I would recommend this course highly. There is some physics, but not a whole lot. If you want a good grade, you'll need to spend a lot of time studying, but fortunately the material is interesting enough so you really feel knowledgeable at the end of it.",
    "I would definitely recommend neurobio! I left pretty much every lecture thinking \"wow, this class is amazing.\" It was my favorite class this semester. If you're interested in neurobio\/neuroscience at all, go ahead and take this!",
    "It is a great course in terms of the material covered in the class. I was always excited to go to class and learn the new material. However the textbook is awful and the exams are pretty tough.",
    "Definitely take this class if you interested in the material and looking for a medium-intensity upper-level science class. I would not take this class unless you have already taken cell bio, physics, and biochem, as those classes provide a critical foundation to the material in neurobio.",
    "A lot of content. My main suggestion: memorize EVERYTHING for success on the midterms and finals. This is not enjoyable and not interesting. It's not true when the professors state that this class is based on knowing broad concepts, not memorization. I think that grad students and undergrads are graded on the same distribution, which is also not fair. I started off very interested in the physiological material Forscher taught and got very jaded with the class when Keshishian's lecturing came along. For such a difficult class, at least for undergraduates, it does not provide very much support, which is deplorable. The professors very clearly use the same materials as they have in previous years. For these reasons, I think this class is complacent and static. The professors should strongly consider interesting ways to make the class less based on memorization and more based on understanding, improve the relationship between the class and the section and consider having the class for 2 longer sessions\/week instead of 3. There are many ways this class can be improved, and the professors should challenge themselves to explore the possibilities.",
    "I would take a different bio class if I had the choice.",
    "This class didn't quite live up to my expectations, and I am glad I decided to Cr\/D\/F it. Not much work, just two midterms and a final. The professors are decent, but not great. Professor Forscher would gloss over some concepts, leaving you confused as to the relevance of some of his facts. A background in physics is also highly recommended for his portion of the class. Overall, the material was interesting if you want to learn about concepts at the micro level, but lectures were dry. The textbook reading is extremely dense, and not necessarily helpful for exams, but does help you get a better understanding of the material. Not sure how the curve works, but midterms averaged around 75. The final is worth 50% of your final grade, so if you do well on that, you'll be fine (the final was pretty long and difficult though).",
    "This is a good course that covers important fundamental principles of neuroscience (action potentials, synaptic transmission) and some special topics that illustrate circuits (motor control and disorders, dopamine circuits, Hebbian plasticity). It's a demanding course that covers a lot of material in significant depth, but is very interesting, so I'd recommend it if you're interested in neuroscience research.",
    "The material in Neurobio is extremely fascinating. However, the reading is extremely dense, and I would advise going through only what is described in the packets. There are no practice questions for the second midterm, and it's essentially just remembering the facts - there was one question that asked on a specific detail from the packet.I would recommend the class but tell students to be aware of the workload. Also, there is some overlap with Physiological Systems if you're interested.",
    "This is a pretty hard course overall because if you don\u0092t pay attention in lecture (not the most interesting lecture...) then you are screwed for the tests. I could not manage to keep my attention for more than five minutes, so I recorded every lecture. But then I had the same problem while trying to listen to the lectures in the library, so I read the book instead. Then I was screwed on the tests. Not sure why I kept making the same mistake over and over again haha...",
    "This course investigates the nervous system, starting from the physiology of the single neuron and expanding to consider the synapse, then neural circuits, and finally complex neural functions such as memory. There's a substantial amount of material spread out between two midterms and the final, which are the only substantial grades. Overall, this is probably one of the better upper-level MCDB courses, and it's fundamental for anyone looking to pursue the study of the brain.",
    "Definitely one of the more interesting and rewarding courses in the department. Professors are great. Lots of topics to cover and exams are a bit rough, but nothing excruciating.",
    "Yes, take this course if you are interested in cell biology and neuroscience. It really gives a strong understanding of the brain in a thorough fashion. You will not even realize how much you have learned until it all comes together at the end of the course.",
    "Highly recommended. The course is not easy, but it genuinely synthesizes material from a wide variety of courses you've taken previously--and the results can be pretty awesome. (A special shout-out to Paul Forscher's section of the course, which I absolutely loved.) Great material and effective teaching make this one of the best science courses I've taken at Yale."
