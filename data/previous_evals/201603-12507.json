   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "This course was impressive in the range of model organisms and methods covered.",
    "This is such a cool course because it allowed students to use really nice equipment (microscopes, iPads, etc.) and also fun organisms such as sea urchins. However, it required long hours and a lot of work, which made it less fun and engaging.",
    "Very good atmosphere in the lab. Professor was great, TA was great, my favorite\/best lab at Yale.",
    "The experiments are very fun. I think the class is very top-heavy in terms of work, but I feel like that might be better because we avoid having a lot to do after October break.",
    "Teamwork on the final and most experiments so you really learn as a group, which is very practical in a real-life situation in an actual lab.",
    "I appreciated the exposure to fundamental biology methods and techniques. I learned new concepts that I was not knowledgable of before, and I got to actually practice techniques that I had learned of via textbook but never had a hands on experience with. One negative was that there was not enough structure for one of the initial lab reports; this led to some confusion over what material was expected, i.e. what methodology was \"right\", making the time spent on this assignment more than it needed to be. Also, the quiz questions were sometimes very nitpicky- the answers were right in the lab manuals, but the wording of the quizzes often caused overthinking over questions that were supposed to be easy.",
    "Strength: many opportunities to develop lab skills in an engaging way, Professor Moreno cares a lot about students and offers many opportunities to learn more about course material Weakness: some experiments were a repetition of AP Bio",
    "The class setup and workload distribution makes this lab course manageable while still being fun. We got to work with a lot of different organisms, an exciting process which we were provided lot of information and material for.",
    "Very good instruction.",
    "Dr. Moreno is extremely well organized in everything she does. Really wouldn't change anything about the class.",
    "MCDB 221L is an incredibly well organized course and provides an introduction to a variety of different lab techniques and model organisms",
    "I think the strength is that Professor Moreno and the TAs were great. The labs were interesting and fun yet informative. The only suggestion that I have is that the course should show example lab reports because I was very uncertain how to write my first one.",
    "Strengths of the course is that there are a vast range of the techniques used in each week of the lab so students are exposed to many concepts that can be used in further learning.",
    "The course is very well structured, and each lab provided a valuable introduction to a model organism. Dr. Moreno's lectures at the beginning of class were informative and helpful, and both she and our TA were always willing to answer questions. Lab procedures were never overwhelming, and I like how students worked in groups. The model organisms themselves were fascinating to work with. Being able to work through such different procedures as PCR and cell culture plating all in one class is a huge strength of this lab, especially for students taking it as freshmen. Another great thing is that the procedures are applicable to real research done on campus and beyond. I really liked how the final exam involved the whole class engaging in an epidemiological investigation. Lab reports took a long time to complete, but feedback on reports was helpful, and the lab was a good practice in scientific writing. Overall, it is the best lab I have taken at Yale so far.",
    "I think that Prof. Moreno has done a great job of streamlining the experiments so that they always work, and is pretty good at explaining herself and the methodologies. The weakness of this course probably lies in the fact that it is a once-a-week class, so there's not really a lot of time for follow-up experiments or experiments that take multiple days, but I really don't think that's something that should be changed. i think that it's just an inherent weakness of a course like this, especially one that wants to get through as many technical skills as possible."

   "comments": [
    "A solid lab that exposes you to a whole range of model organisms and that never gets boring. Dr. Moreno is one of the most caring and understanding professors out there. Take it with her!",
    "This is a great course for learning very basic concepts - pipetting, PCR, etc. i was very thankful for the time to constantly repeat these skills and understand the theory behind them. The course was definitely a lot of work but worth it in the end.",
    "Best lab at Yale. Such a relaxed atmosphere that really allowed me to learn and enjoy the lab rather than panicking and stressing to finish and know what to do. All expectations and procedures were perfectly clear.",
    "This class is definitely worth it if you want to get an idea of the things you could do in an actual lab setting.",
    "Good basic lab which introduces you to what a biology lab entails, also lets you be exposed to the different animals used. Honestly underrated, really nice professor and TA who are super willing to help. 4 lab reports, lab quiz that doesnt really take up alot of time, final is done as a group. This lab is really to make people learn more than anything.",
    "I think it is one of the better Bio labs offered at Yale, especially that doesn't require a class taken concurrently. Prof Moreno was really a nice person and was very passionate about her work. The first half of the semester was stressful though, work wise, and the grading is not easy. After the halfway point of the semester, the work load does lighten up. I would find myself not looking forward to going to lab, but once I was there it was actually not an unpleasant experience.",
    "If you want to learn lab skills, this class is for you! Professor Moreno is really great and I feel a lot more comfortable in a lab by the end of the semester.",
    "Challenging but pretty interesting. Seems to be better than most labs. Not very much of a support structure, though, and it moves very quickly. Graded reports handed back very slowly, extremely difficult to asses how you're doing in the course throughout. Read the lab packets before class and keep up with your lab notebook!",
    "Hands down one of my favorite labs at Yale. Great for someone who likes bio but isn't a bio major; also good for premeds. Dr. Moreno is fantastic, and all the labs are both fun and genuinely educational.",
    "MCDB 221L is a great lab course.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone without much background in experimental method or a comfort in writing a lab report. It's highly engaging and Dr. Moreno is very reasonable and informed.",
    "Yes.",
    "Great class that will introduce you to a wide array of lab techniques. Highly recommend, especially if you have no lab experience.",
    "You should definitely take this course if you are looking for a bio lab credit. In terms of workload, it was in between orgo lab and physics lab, so I thought it was manageable. Professor Moreno is great, and it will definitely be worthwhile!",
    "I absolutely would recommend this course to another student, especially if they have never had experience in a lab before, because there is such a variety of techniques used that can be utilized for future endeavors.",
    "Yes I would recommend this course. This is the best lab I have taken at Yale. The model organisms are incredibly fascinating, and lab procedures are both applicable to real research and manageable within the time class period. It features neither the extreme tedium (intro physics lab, gen chem) or the at times excessive stress (pchem, for some orgo chem lab) of other labs. Lab reports do take a long time, but at least feedback for them is fair and you will feel like you are at least practicing scientific writing. Dr. Moreno is a great lab instructor, and the class is designed such that even people with little to no lab experience can follow along, which is the point of an intro class like this. It is a particularly helpful class for figuring out what kinds of biological research (if any) you may be interesting in pursuing. After my experience in previous lab courses, I was pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed this lab, and if you are looking for a premed biology lab, this is an excellent choice.",
    "Definitely take this lab. There are four lab reports due throughout the term, though they are mostly due in the beginning of the term. The final exam is a practical exam with a lab report due at the end, and it's extremely fair. The lab reports don't take as much time as you get better at writing them, and Prof. Moreno gives a lot of resources to get you started. It's a course geared towards underclassmen, though, so if you're a senior or someone with a lot of lab experience, take it with the expectation that most of your learning will be in writing reports and such. The class is still engaging, though, so I would recommend it to a senior looking for a lab credit!",
    "Yes."
