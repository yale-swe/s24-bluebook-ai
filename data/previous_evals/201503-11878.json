   "comments": [
    "Yes! If you're at all interested in creative writing please take this class. You will not regret it and take it with Professor Chapman. She is lovely and helpful.",
    "A solid class if you enjoy creative writing and are willing to push yourself a bit out of your comfort zone at times. The workload is pretty reasonable, but the final portfolio (you revise everything you've written and write a 4-5 page essay about it) requires a decent amount of time if you really want to do a good job. I would suggest starting to revise pieces early if possible so that you don't wind up feeling crunched during reading week.",
    "Great introduction to all forms of creative writing! Lots of work but definitely worth it!",
    "Fun writing course that provides outlet for creativity. Not too challenging.",
    "This class is an introduction to writing short fiction, drama, and poetry. With a focus on the process of writing, workshopping, and revision, the class focuses on the craft of creative writing. With several guest lectures from faculty and reading of works from a variety of contemporary authors, the class focuses on the analysis and learning from their craft.",
    "I definitely recommend this course. I was skeptical enrolling in the course, but it ended up being my favorite course of the semester. I had no background in creative writing, so I began the course Credit\/D\/Fail, but I converted to a letter grade halfway through the semester because I had already become comfortable with the class. It's a great class and you'll have a lot of fun while learning how to improve your writing skills.",
    "It's an introductory writing course split into three sections: fiction, poetry, and playwriting. You'll be introduced to the works of a lot of great writers and sometimes the writers themselves in lecture. Furthermore, you get to work in a more intimate class setting with a great professor. It's very collaborative and you'll produce a pretty good body of work by the end."
