    "Yes, it was a very interesting course. I think that it could have had a bit more structure, but overall it helped me develop a framework and confidence for attacking numerical problems.",
    "If your looking for a cs elective that is not too much extra work or a survey of commonly used numerical methods take this course! The professor is also very interesting so definitely shop it if unsure!",
    "Lectures are sometimes hard to follow, but you will learn from the programming assignments, which are pretty easy after taking CS 223 with Eisenstat. The class has a very practical focus: if you need to program in real life, I recommend taking it."
