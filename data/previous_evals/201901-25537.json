    "this course was incredibly insightful. Professor Dove is by far the most thoughtful and thought-provoking educator I've had at FES and Yale generally. Most important, he challenged our understanding of what exactly disaster means and the structural social and political issues often made invisible by mainstream disaster narratives.",
    "I developed and solidified social science (anthropology) critical thinking and approaches.",
    "I learned a ton about colonialism and modes of analysis in environental social sciences. I'm a much better writer and thinker about those topics after taking this class.",
    "The anthropology of dystopian situation",
    "Understanding different historical anthropological understandings of social structure in the face of environmental or others stressors allows for greater insights into universal aspects of human organization and response. Particularly in light of the growing prospect of increased environmental stress, it is an incredibly insightful course.",
    "Insight into foundational texts and theories critiquing problematic, common understandings of disaster and degradation.",
    "Critically analyzing the foundations of modern economic development and environmental policies, and how holistically understanding how experiences of social disaster and environmental degradation must be approached from the perspective of those who experience and know the impacts",
    "I was exposed to new topics in social science. I found the readings on swidden agriculture, Prof. Dove's draft paper, and the banking system to be particularly insightful. The course heightened my ability to question and understand why certain beliefs\/systems are the way they are as well as the underlying incentive structures\/biases.",
    "Rethinking the idea of dystopia, a sense of intellectual openness, moved master's research forward"

    "They surpassed my expectations. Every course I've taken with Dove have done so.",
    "This class completely aligned with my expectations.",
    "We actually didn't focus on literal disasters as much as I was hoping, but beyond that the depth of content exceeded my expectations.",
    "Yes",

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of the course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The course is great. It's a bit messy in the middle but I think that was a benefit. The best part was the discussions, fostered by Dove and Zhou's thoughtful comments, as well as their fostering of an open and respectful discussion environment.",
    "The reading list and engaged discussion aspects of this class are excellent. Dove's lectures are great. My one suggestion would be to shorten the lecture period slightly to make more space for student-led discussion--it often felt like we ran out of time for the discussion.",
    "I can't think of many improvements. The reading response assignments were super reasonable. Maybe a bit more feedback on why we got the grades we did? I got a couple H-'s and I wasn't sure where I'd fallen short of that perfect grade.",
    "All great",
    "Massive quantities of reading are time consuming, which isn't necessarily a bad thing, just requires balance against other workloads. The reading responses could possibly be lessened to four or five which would allow for greater focus.",
    "Strength of the class was definitely lectures and discussions. I think one weakness was the reading list felt a bit scattered all over the place, and could be improved.",
    "I appreciated that there was a range of topics, though I found most of the readings and lectures less compelling than those offered in the course Society and Environment. I also felt the course lacked a more cohesive main theme and build-up (as in readings and weeks building upon each other).",
    "Sometime Prof. Dove's comments seem less targetted to the student's paper and more to his own thoughts. He could do more to guide students in that that way. Also, we had a guest lecturer who provided way too much reading late in the term. That was just unrealistic."

    "Take all of Dove's classes. He's the most insightful and thoughtful professor at FES.",

    "Buckle up for a lot of (very enriching) reading. Try to get a head start on your paper throughout the semester, and make sure you talk with Dove about your ideas. I ended up incorporating a couple of his suggestions in major ways into the paper, and they turned out well. Dove is your friend, even if he doesn't immediately seem like it.",
    "Take it!",
    "Be prepared to spend much of your time reading and drafting responses. Don't be afraid to explore intellectual curiosities or seeming oddities.",
    "Definitely take it!",
    "Just take it. Dove is thinking from a different perspective, he will help you push your thinking"
