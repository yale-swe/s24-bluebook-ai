   "comments": [
    "Good balance between theoretical concepts in lecture and concrete applied use in TA lab sessions. I wish we had more time with Martha though.",
    "The course was excellent, however there did not seem like enough time to cover all of the material.",
    "Need to work more on lectures as they are too theory based, easy to get lost in the material. The lab sections were more helpful.",
    "Sometime the class is too difficult to understand.",
    "Hope the primary instructor did the better job in delivering such a difficult information to students.. Hardly understood the lecture, so had a difficulty in understanding the concept generally.",
    "Great class!",
    "This course is helpful, since longitudinal data is a really common type of medical data.",
    "This class was a good introductory course to longitudinal analysis. However, I am not sure that I could preform an analysis independently or with much confidence that it is truly correct. There is still much to learn. Sometimes I thought the lecture and the lab did not coincide very well. However, I still enjoyed taking the class. It was understandable and very informative. I think it will be very useful for me in the future.",
    "It is helpful but hard",
    "A total of 4 homework assignments were assigned, along with the final projectWhat I learned from this class I learned almost entirely from the TA - Martha. She is a great TA and I don't know how good this class will be without her. She taught the concepts in a manageable and understandable way, while Dr. Lin's descriptions were over my head sometimes. Although it was nice to have the concepts described from two different perspectives. The homeworks were fine, with a few tricky questions for which help from the TA was crucial. There were a total of 4 homeworks this semester, and we were given 2-3 weeks to turn them in, which was very manageable. Overall it was a solid class, but don't expect to become an expert in longitudinal by the end of it. You will just the basics with some knowledge of how to program it in SAS.",
    "The course gives a good overview of longitudinal statistical methods. I feel that examples could have been better presented as sometimes it was difficult to comprehend the theory.",
    "I find the course very useful when doing longitudinal data analysis. It helps me understand the theory better and sharpen my SAS skills.",
    "Good topic.Difficult to understand lectures. Could be organized better.Didn't really know how to approach any problem, except for how it was showed in lab.",
    "good",
    "This class is more theoretical rather than applicable. Unlike the linear regression class, this class contains a lot of formulas and equations that are more suited for biostats students rather than the general student population.",
    "strengths: extremely useful, lots of SAS output interpreted,weaknesses- may be counted as strengths for people who will pursue a degree in stats: the mathematical apparatus was extensive and well taught",
    "I think we need more lab sessions.",
    "This course is too advanced for people coming with no background in longitudinal data analysis. I walked away with a very cursory understanding of it because the way we approached things in lecture and discussion were over most of our heads.",
    "The professor is very passionate and understanding of the students, but a clearer presentation of the lecture material will be more helpful."

    "Instructor: Haiqun Lin \u00a0Very kind and caring instructor. Sometimes felt lost in lecture, but she was very receptive to questions and encouraged participation without consequence, even when we were likely to get the answer wrong.",
    "Instructor: Haiqun Lin \u00a0Dr. Lin was extremely knowledgeable and enthusiastic about the course. Her lectures were well-organized and her examples were helpful in understanding the methodology.",
    "Instructor: Haiqun Lin \u00a0Needs to learn to teach more at an applied matter rather than theory esp for non-BIS students.",
    "Instructor: Haiqun Lin \u00a0Very helpful.",
    "Instructor: Haiqun Lin \u00a0She was passionate and diligent, though.",
    "Instructor: Haiqun Lin \u00a0Her lectures can be a bit dry sometimes, but Dr. Lin definitely knows the material really well and is willing to help students out during office hours.",
    "Instructor: Haiqun Lin \u00a0Professor Lin is good at teaching. The powerpoint is very clear and understandable.",
    "Instructor: Haiqun Lin \u00a0Dr Lin is nice instructor. She explains the concepts in a very detailed way. Just a suggestion. I hope she can make the slides more printing-friendly, because there are some redundant slides.",
    "Instructor: Haiqun Lin \u00a0The instructor for this course, Dr. Lin, was good. She explained everything in great detail (almost too much detail for some of the non-biostats students). I feel that what she had to say about the course material matched our readings, which was appreciated. However, it was hard to understand her thought process sometimes in class and would look at TA notes to supplement the lectures. I also wished her slides were structured a bit better. There were a lot of overlapping slides from week to week which created a lotof unnecessary slides to print.",
    "Instructor: Haiqun Lin \u00a0She is very nice and patient, clear",
    "Instructor: Haiqun Lin \u00a0Dr. Lin was okay. She tried to be very clear and repetitive so that we understood, but still it was sometimes not clear what she was saying (especially with her accent). She tried to teach the class at a level that is appropriate for non-biostats students, which is somewhat difficult for a subject like this. It was a lecture-based format and more student interaction would be much preferred. She answered questions when asked, but the environment wasn't very conductive to question-and-answer. And she would ask questions to the class and half the class wouldn't understand what she was saying, and no one really ever answers her questions, which was awkward.",
    "Instructor: Haiqun Lin \u00a0very helpful",
    "Instructor: Haiqun Lin \u00a0Dr. Lin was very courteous and seemed dedicated to addressing the needs of the students.",
    "Instructor: Haiqun Lin \u00a0Dr. Lin is a wonderful instructor\/mentor who cares about her students and exemplifies characteristics that those who pursue academics should strive for. She has helped us to adjust to an unfamiliar subject area and made my experience at this class significantly worthwhile.",
    "Instructor: Haiqun Lin \u00a0extremely approachable, very practical in giving advice, conveys enthusiasm for longitudinal analysis in such a great way",
    "Instructor: Haiqun Lin \u00a0Very much, we love Prof Lin",
    "Instructor: Haiqun Lin \u00a0Dr. Lin is extremely nice, approachable, and cares about her students. However, she's not very effective at explaining things and lecture notes are just not very helpful.",
    "Instructor: Haiqun Lin \u00a0Dr. Lin was very approachable and sensitive to her students' needs. Her lecture notes were helpful.",
    "Instructor: Haiqun Lin \u00a0The professor is very passionate and understanding of the students, but a clearer presentation of the lecture material will be more helpful."

    "Martha is fantastic - her notes are extremely organized and well written. As I mentioned before, I think this class could use a 90 minute weekly session with the TA.",
    "This is the second course I have taken with Martha as the TA. Her lab materials are incredibly well-written. In addition to being extremely knowledgeable about the course material, she is able to teach really well. Martha does not have any weaknesses.",
    "Helpful. The labs were helpful for homework but wish they correlated more!",
    "Martha is a nice TA.",
    "This was my second time to have Martha as TA following Applied Regression Analysis last semester, and she was one of the best TAs I ever have had. Her TA session material was very thorough and very helpful, in particular.",
    "Martha is AMAZING! Best Biostats TA ever!",
    "TA's lab session is very helpful.",
    "TA's lab session is really helpful in helping me with my homework. The lab session's notes are well prepared.",
    "The TA was Martha, who I have greatly enjoyed as a TA for another class as well. I really appreciate the level of detail in her notes. When I could not understand the lecture, I would read the TA notes.",
    "Martha is very helpful",
    "Martha is the best TA. She is clear, engaging, prepared, organized, knowledgeable -- and everything else. She was very helpful for the homeworks, responded to emails quickly and was available to meet and even offered to talk via Skype when she was away. Her notes were amazingly detailed and usually provided us with everything we need to know, making the textbook (which was sometimes too complex for our level) readings unnecessary. She was a superb TA.",
    "Martha is very nice",
    "Martha was very knowledgeable and provided excellent notes to help us with the homework problems.",
    "The teaching assistant Martha did a very wonderful job, the materials for every lab session are well prepared, and her instructions are clear and inspiring and very helpful to solve the problem of the homework.",
    "Martha was always prepared for the lab sessions and TA office hours. She helped make the class more applicable and she created very detailed and helpful handouts.",
    "Martha is simply fabulous. I took this class because she taught some of the linear regression class and I knew to expect her clear headed slides and lots and lots of good tips in using sas and she overwhelmed all my expectations!Wonderful personality and very eager to help too!",
    "Excellent, very helpful",
    "Martha Skupp was great as always in leading the discussion and explaining what we needed to know in terms of SAS programming and doing the homework sets. I learned mostly from the discussion sections.",
    "Martha Skup - her notes were incredibly helpful for the applied component of the course",
    "Martha and her lab notes are extremely helpful. She is willing to help students."

    "Yes, I will. It's very useful.",
    "The material is difficult, but useful. The course just didn't give me what I expected out of a semester's worth of time.",
    "A challenging course."
