   "comments": [
    "Solid CS elective. It is very qualitative and feels like a psychology class. You don't need any other CS classes to take this. All of the material was interesting and well organized. The midterm was reasonable and the final project can be good depending on how much effort you are willing to invest.",
    "YES. Great class.",
    "Scaz is a good lecturer, and the material that we cover in lecture is interesting. Without a textbook, the problem sets and midterm are more difficult simply because you don't know how to answer the kinds of questions that are asked or what kinds of questions will be asked. The final project is fun.",
    "This is a very interesting and fun course! You don't need much computer science background; should be relevant to CS, cog sci, engineers, even bio. Scaz is a good lecturer and lectures are quite interesting. The class is very low-key work-wise before spring break; afterwards, the final project can take a lot of time, but it's just up to you to be a team player and put in the necessary work.",
    "I thought the course was pretty good, but the Intelligent Robotics section is a lot about how AI and how to react and interact with the world, and the research project is about human robot interaction, which are two very different things.",
    "Do not wait to take this as a Junior or Senior like I did. The material can be understood by a freshman, and is extremely interesting...",
    "If you like the material, great class. Not too much work, but also sort of dull at times. I would recommend it if you're into robots and stuff, or have an already packed schedule. Don't put all your marbles in this class being the best of your semester though.",
    "Don't be deceived by the first lecture. It promises a lot, but doesn't quite live up to it.",
    "Definitely -- very interesting theory of mind and the intellectual challenges with robots.",
    "This course is perfect for anyone who wants to learn more about robots. The material isn't so technical as to keep out non-CS majors, but it's still technical enough to intrigue full-fledged CS majors. Scaz is a great professor and the workload is minimal. There is one midterm, a final project and two problem sets. The problem sets were fairly time-consuming, but actually really enjoyable. In theory, you don't have to attend lecture after the midterm since the material is unnecessary for the final project although it might give you a better idea as to what you want to do for the project.",
    "A great introduction to robotics. The best part is that you get access to the robotics lab and can do actual robotics research.",
    "This is a phenomenal class. You should absolutely take it whether or not you are a CS student. The class is a survey of a lot of different topics related to robotics. The last few weeks of class were really not ever tested on any test, but I went to class every time because the material was so interesting and Scaz is such an engaging lecturer.Absolutely take the class.Make sure to get started as early as you can on the project - the end of the year really sneaks up on you.",
    "Do not take this if you are looking for a technical\/mathy course. Scaz is a compelling lecturer but the material is so-so.",
    "Absolutely take it, but only if you have genuine interest in getting some research experience--otherwise you'll miss out on the main point of the course.",
    "I think they are splitting this course into two terms, in which case I would say take it. If I'm wrong about this, though, I wouldn't recommend it. The presentations were wonderful and well-connected, and I enjoyed the material a lot, but the course covers such a broad range of robotics history and theory that there is no way to learn anything in depth, yet the midterm required us to know very specific and trivial details that we would never use again in the course. It seems like the bulk of our grade will come fromthe project, but the projects are so open-ended and we had very little direction even in finding groups in the first place. We had some major imbalances in the amount and quality of work put in by the members in my group, and I do not think this came across at all to the graders. There was a lot of work crammed into the end of the semester, and the whole way through I was very confused about the organization of the course.",
    "Yes! I was worried that the course would be mostly about human-robot interaction (HRI), which seems more like psych than cs, but the vast majority of lectures were on other, really fascinating things - robot architecture (i.e. different approaches to programming autonomous robots), using models of biological organisms to design robots (and designing robots to model organisms), machine learning, robot hardware, etc. The lectures were fantastic, and Scaz provides lecture slides, which is really helpful. The workload is reasonable - two reasonably involved psets, a midterm, and a final project. Since there was no final, it wasn't really necessary to show up to lecture after the midterm, but it was worth it anyway since the material is so fascinating. Definitely a broad survey course,though, so don't expect to come away with practical robotics skills.",
    "Great class for anyone interested in robotics. It's technical enough to keep technically focused students interested, but nontechnical enough to allow pretty much anyone to take the class with enough dedication.",
    "Scaz is easily the most entertaining CS lecturer. If youre interested in robotics, theres a lot to keep you busy. If no, you could get bored",
    "It's a CS class that isn't super hard. It's also kind of just a psych class. Worth taking for the heck of it. If Scaz likes your project he'll really help you out.",
    "The course describes several different aspects of robotics, but lacks teaching in practical applications. It has two psets, which were easy to do wrong, and a midterm. The final project is half your grade and really the only work you'll have to do. Don't expect to be able to use a ton of your knowledge, though. Much of the class did simple HRI experiments (instead of legit programming projects) that are sometimes interesting but usually a pain in the ass. You do get access to some awesome robots, though.",
    "Intelligent Robotics is a refreshing change of pace from most of the other CS courses Yale has to offer. The first half of the class is a survey of the history and current state of robotics development with two minimally important problem sets and an easy midterm. The second half of the semester is spent working on an original group research project. You have the typical issues with important group projects (some people don't pull their own weight, and if you don't think this happens then you're one of these people), but you get to do real research on whatever you're interested in. Great class."
