    "Absolutely! The Russian language is incredibly beautiful; even at this level my appreciation for Russian literature has increased. The class is challenging but not impossible, and actual native speakers teach us the language, which distinguishes the Russian dept from many other foreign language depts at Yale, especially in levels 1 through 3 and 4.",
    "Po-rysski! What more can be said?",
    "Its awesome!!! Russian is a beautiful language and it is really well taught and a lot of fun. This is a continuation of year 1...definitely worth sticking with a hard language!",
    "A necessary step on the road to learning Russian.",
    "It's a great class, and I would recommend it. But I would caution against the notion that you'll be able to speak fluent Russian after 3 or 4 semesters-- it's a difficult language with complicated grammar, etc.",
    "It is not exciting because you are consolidating the basics, but the relaxed atmosphere makes this quite inoffensive; definitely worth the while to get to the really exciting courses later on."
