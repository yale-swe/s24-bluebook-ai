   "comments": [
    "Overall, this was a decent review of the Cold War. HOWEVER, do not take this class unless you are prepared for an entirely US-centric view of the Cold War. Even focus on the Soviet Union is clearly covered in pro-American bias. There is also little to no emphasis on any other actors except small focus on Eastern Europe and China. Latin America, Africa, and the Middle East are largely ignored, which seems to be a startling omission from a class purportedly about the Cold War in general. Professor Gaddis also substantially dumbs down certain aspects of the material and doesn't seem to expect as much from students as other history professors in similar survey courses, both in terms of broad conceptual complexity and specific historical detail. His lectures are interesting but not outstanding. He also has a definitive pro-Reagan, conservative bias that students should be aware of. It is not a bad class by any means, but certainly not worth all the hype.",
    "If you want to learn about the Cold War, American foreign policy, grand strategy and diplomacy, definitely take this!",
    "It is a very interesting class. Gaddis is very much and neocon and seems to believe in the great man theory of history, but I guess that it is good to see other perspectives.",
    "Ehh I mean it's famous so take it if it's offered but its not amazing",
    "I would summarize the Cold War as a class that every history student must take. Not only is it important to learn about the conflict that influenced the second half of the 2oth century, it is taught by the best professor who could possibly teach it. I would recommend it to all my friends who are interested in history and those who are interested enough to finish all the reading.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to anyone interested in learning more about the Cold War. It probably would not be a great class for someone who already knows a lot about the Cold War, as the class is definitely a survey course. Also, despite the hype that the course gets, it probably wouldn't be all that interesting for someone not already interested in history. The tests aren't that hard as long as you do the reading, and the amount of reading is manageable.",
    "PLSC 176 is a history of the Cold War from beginning to end, from before the end of World War II to the final days of the Soviet Union in 1991. I would recommend the Cold War to any student who is looking for a history or humanities credit, but at the same time I would caution them to make sure they have time to do the reading and study for the exams. If you go to lecture, the midterm and final exams aren't incredibly difficult; however, you also have to have to read the books because a lot of the IDs on the exams are pulled directly from the books and are not mentioned in lecture. Really great class, but you may want to take it Credit\/D if you don't have time to put the work in.",
    "Great course - must take to learn about the Cold War.",
    "Definitely recommend. A very easy, interesting, and fun humanities credit.",
    "Yes!",
    "An absolutely fantastic class taught by an expert in the field. One of those \"must take\" classes at Yale regardless of your major.",
    "THIS IS A GREAT COURSE. There are not many courses in Yale that can compare to how great this class is. There is a lot of reading that accompanies the lectures, but the opportunity to learn from Professor Gaddis is not one that you should willing miss if you have the opportunity.",
    "You'll leave this class being well versed on essentially all aspects of the Cold War. Gaddis is witty and really really knows the Cold War.",
    "This is a great class to take just to learn things, hopefully Gaddis returns.",
    "Take this class! I knew nothing about the cold war before coming in and now I feel like I could have a really good discussion about it. You come away with so much knowledge; best class I've taken at Yale!",
    "TAKE IT TAKE IT TAKE IT. This was the best class I have ever taken and I wouldn't be surprised if, after I graduate, it's still the best class i ever took. If you have the opportunity to take this class you ABSOLUTELY MUST. I feel to lucky to have been able to take this amazing class with Gaddis (a cold war legend). DO IT.",
    "It's a classic Yale course, and if you put in the effort you'll learn a lot. It's not worth it if you're not going to take the time to do the readings though. Gaddis is great.",
    "This is a great history lecture taught by one of the most famous lecturers at Yale. Definitely take it if it's being offered.",
    "Great class. As everyone tells you, it's a must take class at Yale.",
    "HIST 261 is a lecture on the Cold War that covers the conflict from its inception at the end of WWII until the collapse of the Soviet Union under Gorbachev. The lecture itself is not overly mired in details because there is such a large time span to cover, but readings supplement these lectures and add detail. The lectures are also supplemented by video clips\/interviews on the Cold War. I would definitely recommend this class to another student, it was really interesting and well-structured.",
    "Would recommend for anyone that wants a comprehensive summary of the Cold War.",
    "Its a great class. The opportunity to take a class with John Gaddis is a must for any Yalie.",
    "This is one of the most-hyped classes at Yale, and as a result I think a lot of people are disappointed because it doesnt live up to expectations. Gaddis is one of the foremost scholars on the Cold War, and his lectures are polished (although there was too much video footage for my tasteover the course of the semester you watch several hours of the documentary that he helped produce). There was a fair amount of reading but most of it is interesting. You should know that Gaddis style of history is very political and focused on Washington, D.C., other than a couple of lectures on Mao. Its a legitimate interpretation and the lectures are engaging but it wont revolutionize your understanding of the Cold War.",
    "I think that if Gaddis comes back to teach Cold War again it is a class that students from a great variety of interests can take. I am a major, but a lot of nonmajors really enjoyed it. Gaddis is amazing and so much fun to take a class with. His lectures are informative and very well-designed after all these years. He also uses videos from a 24 hour series he produced on the Cold War. The world load is really reasonable - 5 books, a paper, a midterm and a final - and the books are interesting supplements to the material. Reading Gaddis's book on the Cold War (assigned) is a great reinforcement of lectures. I wouldn't skip lecture, because I think that Gaddis is the heart of the class and you shouldn't miss him.",
    "It's wonderful to hear someone who is an expert in their field lecture. Gaddis has the insight of someone who was formulating policy in the middle of everything going on, which makes his commentary more substantial that what you would otherwise hear. Apart from that, though... you would get a lot of the same information from the Cold War documentary that was shown in just about every lecture.",
    "Take it!",
    "If this is ever offered again, take it! This is easily the best class at Yale taught by the most legendary Cold War historian. I guarantee you will not regret this course.",
    "PLSC 176 01 was the best intro to foreign policy and grand strategy I could have asked for. I got an acceptably unbiased look at many historical events and people, which helped me view the happenings of today through a more educated lens. I would certainly recommend this course. The readings were fantastic, and the teacher better.",
    "I really liked it. Not too much work, though exams were tough. I think it's an important subject to learn in general, but Gaddis definitely added to the experience!",
    "Take it! Class is half videos, and Gaddis is a good speaker, obviously an expert in his field, and one of the few conservative professors you will meet at Yale. I enjoyed this class a lot, and it required hardly any work.",
    "Classic crash course in the Cold War taught by an amazing professor. A good amount of reading, but definitely manageable. The exams felt a little bit like they wanted you to just puke up information, though: lots of rote memorization and very specific terms...points were awarded for extensive detail as opposed to concision and substance in my opinion...",
    "Cold War is a great class, giving a well-paced and thorough overview of that period of history. Professor Gaddis also certainly knows what he's talking about in each lecture, though I didn't find him to be as life-changing as others say. I was concerned beforehand that I was already familiar with a lot the material that Cold War would teach me, but I really did come out of the class learning a lot more details than I came in knowing, which I found to be incredibly valuable. Take this class if you're interested in history and want to learn more about this period - and don't be scared away by the reading! I did very little of it and ended up fine, as I know was the case with many other students as well.",
    "The foremost historian on the Cold War gives his take on the Cold War, what more could you ask for? If he teaches this again, it is a must take by any Yale student.",
    "I 100% recommend this class to other students. It was my favorite class this semester.",
    "Much work towards finals",
    "It is a really clear comprehensive course. There is a lot of reading that is important to the exams.",
    "Gaddis intertwines video documentaries into his lecture seamlessly, so he goes back and forth between talking and playing a 5 to 10 min video. Going to lecture is like watching the History channel - you learn a lot while being entirely entertained. CREDIT\/D\/FAIL KIND OF COURSE. YOU WON'T REGRET IT.",
    "An amazing, eye-opening class on the Cold War. Completely changed how I viewed the past seventy years. From fascinating figures, to pop culture, to modern geopolitics, this is one of the best courses I've ever taken. Gaddis is the best. Each lecture is perfectly crafted with takeaways and taglines. I wish everyone was able to take this class because it is life changing.",
    "DEFINITELY take this course if you're interested in the Cold War era, nuclear weapons, China, or international relations at all. I'm a STEM major and I loved this class. I feel like I have such a better understanding of the current balance of power today, and I absolutely loved having Gaddis for a professor!",
    "I would suggest it to a freshman who is nervous about taking a college history course. But if you're a major and an upperclassman, as I was, I would probably avoid it. It just didn't offer much of what I love about history-- the opportunity to look at primary sources, a sense of how it might have felt to live then, and challenges to assumptions about the past and the belief that the status quo is the inevitable result of the accumulation of time.",
    "Solid course. No, it didn't change my life. Yes, the lectures drag on a bit, the books can get pedantic, and just about all of it is in Gaddis's book anyway. BUT, Gaddis is truly a legend, and no one knows this stuff better than he does. Take it, you'll learn a ton-- but don't expect this course to change your life.",
    "A great course that I would recommend.",
    "One of the best courses at Yale especially for anyone interested in military history, modern US history, politics or diplomacy. I started it credit\/D and ended up switching to a letter because I liked the readings so much. Gaddis is a great instructor.",
    "If you can take Cold War, you should. I took it on a whim and ended up being wholly drawn in to the history we talked about. There's a lot of reading, but it's fascinating. This class is so well known for a reason: it's amazing. It also gives you a different perspective on general 20th century history due to Gaddis' lens of grand strategy. I feel like I have such a better understanding of the time period that shaped all our current geopolitical leaders and debates, and at every turn, I see threads of the Cold War coming to the surface.",
    "I really enjoyed this class, but it may not be for everyone. Very low-stress, but you have to keep up with the readings because the questions on the exam can be veryyy specific. If you like international relations and history and want a better understanding of the players and factors of the Cold War, then this is the class for you.",
    "A classic Yale course that everyone should take if they have the chance, especially history majors. Gaddis is a great lecturer, but also relies heavily on documentary clips. While Gaddis focuses on diplomatic history, these clips help illustrate the very real human impact of the actions of larger-than-life leaders. This is easily one of the most compelling history courses that I've taken: I laughed, I cried, and I gained a more nuanced understanding of the events that shaped our world in the past century, and which continue to influence it today. If you can, take this course!",
    "great lecture on a part of history that is really important to know and understand. you do need to do the readings, Gaddis made that very clear with the ID's on the midterms, but otherwise amazing lecture.",
    "This was an overall wonderful course that I thoroughly enjoyed. I would recommend it to any friend, regardless of whether the friend likes history or is a history major.",
    "This course gives a really interesting introduction to the Cold War. The reading assignments are lengthy, but you don't need to do them for the class, which is frustrating. But it's a wonderful lecture, so I'd recommend it.",
    "There's a lot of reading, and your responses to he exam IDs depend on you remembering very obscure details.",
    "Take it if you can.",
    "I am glad I took this course. The lectures were interesting and the workload was definitely manageable. The professor is interesting and knowledgeable, and the only thing I did not like about this course was how US-focused it was. Otherwise, the course was enjoyable, and I felt like I was learning a ton.",
    "Great course for a survey of the Cold War and just to tell your friends that you've taken it.",
    "A nuanced examination of the what, how and why of the cold war. I would recommend the class, for I feel that the class fulfilled this purpose.",
    "If you have the chance, I'd recommend taking it. Good to have knowledge of important historical events, and it's not that hard of a course.",
    "Absolutely worth taking just for having someone as qualified as Gaddis as the professor. A must-take at Yale--it is not too complicated material-wise and anyone can take it.",
    "Fascinating overview course of the Cold War, and a great opportunity to be taught by Professor Gaddis. If this class is ever available again and if you have any interest in political science\/history\/general global affairs, you should take it while you have the chance.",
    "Highly recommend. Interesting, informative, and a great introduction to not only the Cold War, but also modern history\/international relations",
    "Strongly recommend!!",
    "Definitely take this class if it is offered.",
    "I highly recommend this course, as it is a fascinating look that changes the way we view geopolitics today.",
    "This class couldn't possibly live up to the hype, but it is absolutely worth taking. Midterm, essay, final, and a series of informative and interesting lectures on what essentially set the stage for the modern political world. Gaddis does a good job giving as deep and balanced of a portrayal possible with the amount of material to cover.",
    "Yes, great intro survey course if you know nothing about the Cold War. That said, take it all in with a grain of salt as it is only one perspective of the Cold War.",
    "The class was good, not great. I might have enjoyed it more if it hadn't been so overhyped. You can get away with not doing the readings. Get a study guide for the final, otherwise the IDs are impossible.",
    "I would recommend it because I learned a lot from this class. Most of the things we learned still hold relevance today. It was a lot of work to cram for finals and midterms but if you just spaced this out it would be much easier.",
    "Definitely recommend; great class and learned a lot about the Cold War and foreign relations",
    "If available again, take it",
    "This is a great class and opportunity to learn from the best in the field.",
    "",
    "A very solid class. Make sure you have enough time to do (most of) the readings - you'll learn as much from them as from the lectures.",
    "A really good class. Gaddis moves quickly through materials, and most of the readings are interesting. There is a lot of reading, but the lectures are really good and interspersed with video clips. The class isnt life changing, but its very solid and a Yale classic.",
    "I would recommend this class to another student.",
    "It's awesome. You should take it.",
    "Yes I would recommend HIST 261 to another student. The class was both enjoyable and interesting.",
    "I would recommend this to another student.",
    "This course's reputation speaks for itself -- it's taught by a legend, it gives an excellent background on one of the defining conflicts of modern history, and it's supremely interesting. Be warned, this class is no gut -- but it's definitely worth taking for any student interested in history.",
    "Interesting history class- a Yale classic. Your grade will depend on the difficulty of your TA.",
    "Everyone should take this class",
    "An account of the Cold War from an American perspective, covering proxy wars as well.",
    "If you are at all interested in this period in history, you must take this class. Truly fantastic.",
    "I would say that it is an in depth overview of a critical period in time taught by one of the greatest historians of the subject. It was challenging at times in breadth and scope especially in studying for exams, but I still fee I gained a lot out of it. You get out of it what you put in. I would recommend it even though it isn't being taught again. If it were being taught again, I would suggest perhaps selecting readings that lend themselves more easily to section discussion alongside the lectures.",
    "An easy fifth credit.",
    "I would shop it first, but don't feel strongly either way.",
    "This class is a must take at Yale. The time period is fascinating and Gaddis does a great job teaching it.",
    "I would recommend the course to another student only if he\/she was very interested in the Cold War. This is because I felt that at times, I was learning major events but without some important nuance. I would have loved to learn about more Third World Events, such as more detail on people like Che Guavera and more details about US involvement in places like Afghanistan.",
    "The Cold War was a terrific class, one of the best I have taken at Yale. The course was well structured and engaging, the lectures were excellent, the exams were fair, and the paper assignment was flexible and enjoyable. Professor Gaddis is a master of his craft. I enjoyed all of his lectures and was often on the edge of my seat. Highly, highly recommended!! One suggestion: do some supplemental reading. Professor Gaddis presents a certain interpretation of the Cold War, and it is valuable to consider additional perspectives.",
    "This is one of those courses very unique to Yale. I would greatly recommend this course to any Yale undergraduate as few are the times you will be able to learn from those that actively participated in the historical events they narrate. Professor Gaddis's is constantly referenced in historical academic work and taking a class from him really helps understand both the history he teaches and greater patterns in historical thought.",
    "Great class.",
    "Lots of reading but amazing course. Highly recommend",
    "It's an amazing intro to the Cold War, and Gaddis is the absolute expert in the subject -- TAKE this class while you still can. It's a very basic intro history class, not a lot of work at all, but you'll learn a ton. I genuinely enjoyed every class and felt like I learned so much about the Cold War, and historical research in the area. Really interesting use of video\/documentaries to illustrate the topics, it really brought the topics to life.",
    "This is a great class, but requires that you do the reading-- of which you do a LOT. So it's a lot of work, but if you're interested in learning about the Cold War, there's no better way to do it than to take this class, at least as a first dip into the subject.",
    "As comprehensive and inclusive an approach to the Cold War can be. Be prepared to commit yourself to both detail and broader themes and theory.",
    "The class is great. Professor Gaddis is amazing. I learned a ton and would definitely recommend. The world load is very fair. I would say the only weaknesses are the many videos Professor Gaddis uses in his lectures and the pace at which he talks (very fast), which makes the lecture at times difficult to follow.",
    "a big lecture everyone should take",
    "He was a great teacher and nice person.",
    "A lecture course on the Cold War that covers different aspects over time and geographic regions.",
    "A must-take class. As members of a generation who did not grow up during the Cold War, this class really helped inform me about how the world came to be the way it is today.",
    "Cold War was an enjoyable and intellectually stimulating course. I would definitely recommend taking it to a fellow student.",
    "Definitely would recommend. Learned a lot just from attending the lectures.",
    "The Cold War is an incredible class that anyone who has even a minor interest in history should take. Professor Gaddis is truly a legend and you'll learn an incredible amount from one of the foremost Cold War historians on the planet.",
    "A interesting class with a doable amount of work. I really enjoyed it! I totally would recommend it to students who are interested in political and legal history like I am.",
    "I would recommend this class to another student because I think the information is really important to know about. The lectures could feel long sometimes, but the videos and Gaddis' charm and wit made it enjoyable.",
    "Cold War is an excellent lecture the important topics of the Cold War. Gaddis, being the scholar he is, was able to bring to light interesting anecdotes and facts that otherwise would have gone unnoticed. If you are interested in this time period at all, take the course.",
    "Cold War is a thorough and in depth course about all aspects of the Cold War with a fantastic professor and interesting lectures. I would most definitely recommend it.",
    "The class that I looked forward to every week and was sad to say goodbye to at the end of the semester. You cannot scrape by without doing the work (the IDs on the tests are VERY specific details from the readings), but most of the readings are very interesting and relevant (not a big fan of applebaum, however). There was no bad lectures. Would recommend.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone that is interested in political science, history or just becoming a more informed and responsible global citizen. Professor John Gaddis is an excellent instructor. His unparalleled knowledge on the Cold War as well as his sincere desire to share as much information as possible with the class is truly an asset to the course. The lectures and readings are also extremely interesting. You will not regret taking this class.",
    "Yes",
    "Very satisfied!",
    "This course provides an in-depth perspective on the events and themes of the Cold War, and how they relate to the past, the present, and the future. Lectures were interesting, entertaining, relevant, and often funny, and I was never bored in class. Gaddis was a superbly engaging, intelligent, and informative professor. This course dramatically increased my knowledge and understanding of the Cold War, and also changed the way I look at current events now that I can better understand their causes. This was my favorite class this semester.",
    "Cold War is a class that you have to take at Yale, unfortunately I don't think it's going to be offered anymore, but if it is, then you should take it.",
    "Awesome course, but BEWARE: GADDIS KNOWS ABOUT THE BIBLE NOW. Some kid showed it to his TA or something; the final didn't have a single ID from the bible on it.",
    "A fun, but relevant class to the world today. If available make taking this a priority.",
    "A definite must. A lot of reading, but all the material very interesting and applicable to today's world politics.",
    "Yes! The Cold War is a very important time to learn and understand, and this class is a great overview. A heads up that the midterm and 10 page paper were scheduled within a week of each other, so the spacing of those two could have been better.",
    "Incredible course. Gaddis is a great lecturer and the content in fascinating and extremely worthwhile.",
    "I loved the lectures. Gaddis is the legend on the topic. If you are not a fan of the videos in the lectures, then be wary; however, the videos are a fantastic way to keep things engaging, and Gaddis's commentary is still top notch.",
    "This is one of those Yale courses that you have to take before you graduate. Gaddis is a fantastic speaker and a master of his field. Take this course and you will not regret it.",
    "HIST 261 was a very interesting course. Going into it, I had a general understanding of the Cold War; by the end of the term, that understanding had grown considerably due to the in-depth lectures, readings, and papers. Both the course's main bookJohn Gaddis's The Cold Warand its documentary conveyed novel information concisely and powerfully. I do wonder how much I really learned from lecture, thoughsometimes, it felt like I could get all the information I needed just from reading the book and watching the documentary. I would recommend taking this course anyway, though; it's worth it just for the objective view of the conflict Professor Gaddis offers, and for the questions of moral ambiguity he raises.",
    "TAKE IT!!! best decision ever. You learn so much and it is very engaging",
    "It's an overview of the Cold War, as the title suggests - think of it like an intro History course. It doesn't go in depth in any particular area but you'll come out with a good understanding of the history.",
    "would recommend, but be prepared for all of the things that come with large lecture classes",
    "One history class you just cannot miss.",
    "This class is a must-take before you graduate. Professor Gadd is witty and approachable, and not to mention, an expert on the Cold War. You will have to work hard for the tests and pay attention in class, but does not feel like a chore because the class is so relevant and fascinating.",
    "Its a sweeping course on American and Soviet relations\/activities from the end of WWII to the 1991.",
    "Great introduction to the cold war. Take it!",
    "An overview of the Cold War - I would recommend it for any student, it is a must take!",
    "Take this class and go to lecture! It's a very interesting class, and taught brilliantly by Professor Gaddis. The courseload isn't too heavy, and it makes for a fantastic 5th class, especially if you're remotely interested in history. If you do have to skip on some readings, do read Professor Gaddis' book. It can't substitute for lectures, but it does cover a lot of what is said in lectures.",
    "Absolutely yes.",
    "great class and would strongly recommend to others.",
    "A wonderful survey course. Necessary history to know as millennials still affected by the legacy of the Cold War. Definitely recommend.",
    "I would summarize this class as a must-take history class. It delves into the interesting details and could make anyone a history-lover. I would absolutely recommend this class to anyone, mostly because of Professor Gaddis."
