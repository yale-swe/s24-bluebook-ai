    "Painting Basics gives you the opportunity to develop your interest in painting regardless of your starting point. The studio and assignments offer you a freedom to develop along lines of your interest, while providing enough guidance to challenge you as you go. Highly recommended.",
    "Yes! It's a fun class!",
    "Fun class to take if you are looking for a different type of work. A strong focus on color and composition. WE also spent time working on gesture vs contour. Painting does take some time - so don't underestimate that!",
    "ART 130 is a class that gives students a basic understanding of how to paint and draw. It's a class for non-art majors who want to learn how to paint.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to anyone, regardless of artistic experience",
    "I found it relaxing to paint for 2 hours twice a week. Homework typically assigned Thursday and due Tuesday. Class started with still lives, then moved to landscapes and portraits.",
    "very good introductory course for anyone who enjoys painting and art in general. might be a bit time consuming if you are a perfectionist"
