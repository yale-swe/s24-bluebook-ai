    "This class was a really great and thoughtful exploration of the historical foundations of the current problems in Haiti\/the Dominican Republic. Professor Ramirez is really sweet and knowledgable. There are films, books, and other materials, which make for interesting discussions.",
    "Absolutely wonderful class, and I know it will get even better in the coming years (we were the first ever to take it). For the most part, the readings and films were engaging and not too bad to read. Papers were very fair, although prompts are given to you and those could be a little restricting. The best parts, by far, were the professor and the in-class discussion. Dixa is a fantastic professor, incredibly engaging and entertaining. She has a thorough knowledge of Hispaniola (because she's researched it herself) and an excellent way of analyzing and talking about the literature we read. She makes class discussions intelligent, comfortable, with no right or wrong answer, and expects the best from her students while being the best herself. The only negative I can think of is the fact that some weeks had a LOT of reading (but she says she'll fix this), and days when we had a paper due were also jam-packed with readings. Overall, DEFINITELY TAKE THIS CLASS (if you can)!",
    "I would highly recommend this course for those interested in Caribbean cultures, geopolitical issues, imperialism in the Western Hemisphere, African-American studies and race theory. The depth and complexity of the history you learn about the island of Hispaniola is impressive, and it doesn't just come through monotonous literature -- instead, you learn the rich cultural, social, and inherently political history through an eclectic selection of novels, short stories, and critical scholarly writing. The reading is manageable because Professor Ramirez often makes adjustments and is open to feedback. Definitely do the readings though, because the literary analysis is in-depth and comes from many intellectual angles (feminist, racial theory, class, etc). Altogether a really enlightening course."
