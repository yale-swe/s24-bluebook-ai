   "comments": [
    "Professor James is wonderful, and while the class is a decent amount of work and has some really tough readings, I'm glad we were required to take something like this class in the end. Try to frontload some of the reading responses so you can focus on the final paper.",
    "Yes!! Learning about methods helps with art history research a great deal! Also, the theories we learned in class intercept with other disciplines as well, so it's fun to discuss about them with friends from other majors.",
    "HSAR 401 examines art history as a discipline. Its \"objects\" are primarily textual, as opposed to the majority of courses which focus on artworks. In this way it provides a framework for the study of the field. I would recommend this to students who are interested in the major, or very passionate about the study of art. It is also possible to take the course without being a junior; and, considering the framework it provides, taking it earlier seems beneficial.",
    "This course if meant for the art history major, so it is quite rigorous. There is a lot of reading every week and there are many assignments, most of which are writing intensive. Given that assignments are often on readings, this class can be difficult because the readings themselves are very complex, as are the concepts. I would only recommend this course if you are interested in art history and have a penchant for writing. Take it if you genuinely want to understand art history as a field. Also, Professor James is lovely, so if she teaching it, that is certainly a bonus. Once again, beware, 100+ pages of reading every week. But it is a great class, and it's small so you really get to know your peers well, especially through weekly roundtable discussions of the week's reading"
