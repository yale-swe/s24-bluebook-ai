    "This is a very introductory class to inorganic chemistry, which will give you some insight about what inorganic chemistry is. Be careful, as the initial material is super easy and then it gets harder and harder. It's the best to do well on both midterms and then drop the final, which is the hardest exam.",
    "You will probably be taking CHEM 252 if it is a requirement for your major or to fulfill pre-med requirements. Professor Crabtree is phenomenal as a professor, and his midterms are fair. You are allowed to drop one of the the three exams: you have two midterms and one final. But, you still need to be very attentive and timely, because problem sets count for 33% of your grade in the class. Overall, well-taught and Professor Hazari substitutes as well once in a while.",
    "I would recommend Chemistry 252 to any student interested in the basics of inorganic chemistry. The course reviews material from introductory chemistry courses, teaches introductory inorganic chemistry, and shows how the concepts relate to current topics such as energy, industry, and biology.",
    "This class is fairly straightforward- powerpoints in lecture, problem sets each week that are broken down in lecture. I think the material is really interesting, but it starts out slow. Please take my advice and do not take that to mean that you should skip class. You should go to class and pay attention. Then you will do well.",
    "Take it if you want a second semester of chem (after Chem118) - a fantastic course made all the better by the instructor and TA.",
    "Fine class. Tests are fair, and low pressure since one gets dropped. P-sets are not a big deal because you get all the answers you missed in section. Competition can be tough because it's full of junior\/senior chem majors.",
    "Necessary, fairly interesting, and fairly easy."
