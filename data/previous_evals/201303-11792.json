    "A truly fun course. Work may compound if this is your first exposure to the language, but the work all has an educational purpose.",
    "I would recommend Hebrew to someone looking to start a new language because it is a fun language to learn and Ayala is a great teacher.",
    "Great course, definitely take it if you're looking to really learn Hebrew.",
    "Hebrew 110 gives you a lot of work, and a lot of love for Ayala and Hebrew. Its sort of a paradox - it was definitely more work than the rest of my classes combined, but I grew to love Ayala and class so much that it didn't matter. Which is ideal. You end up learning a TON, and wishing Ayala was your Jewish grandmother. Also, definitely there is a variance of knowledge going into class, but it is not a great issue.",
    "Yes take it. You will lezrn a great deal and the class is a pleasure each day."
