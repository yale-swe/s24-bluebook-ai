Also valuable for history students because challenges conventional categories of historical analysis.Instructor was quite reticent at times and relied on the students to carry the discussion without really bothering to structure the discussion very much.",

    "The readings were quite interesting",
    "The readings and the opportunity to go to and discuss the environmental history conferences. I also really enjoyed the opportunity to have Richard White visit the class--what a treat. Perhaps you might consider having such visits be a more integral aspect of the course. The other aspect of the course I enjoyed was the sparring between the historians and the foresters; it was quite informative. I hope you continue to keep the course open to both groups.",

   "comments": [
    "I feel like the course got a bit repetitive towards the end of the term - we were discussing the same themes over again. If there were a way to bring in new themes for discussion, that would be good. Perhaps a more chronological structure might also help, to give students more of a sense of historical change in narratives\/perspectives\/human relationship with the environment.",
    "This course is taught as a history class. The professor seemed to put little time into preparing to guide the discussion and instead let the discussion simply go where it would. As a seminar, I felt it devolved into various students simply pontificating.",
    "Organization. Deadlines shifted around a bit so you were never quite sure when things were due, and the readings weren't always available. Discussions could have been better, but I think it depends a lot on who is in the class.",
    "I believe that this class doesn't really work in its current format. While I appreciate the effort to integrate different disciplines, these are two fundamentally different groups trying to work together in one class. I certainly have plenty to learn about historiography and how this whole process works academically, but it is not beneficial to my career nor any of my fellow MEMs. I also felt that I didn't have much to contribute towards conversations when my fellow students are pursuing PHDs, in many cases specifically in environmental history. I haven't taken history class since 11th grade. I'd rather learn about environmental history and try to connect themes to current issues, whereas for an academic history phd student, they are at a completely different level. I think there is a real need for MEMs to develop their understanding of environmental history, but I believe it should occur in a different way.",
