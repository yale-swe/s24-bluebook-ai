   "comments": [
    "The lecturing is far, far, far, too narrative and often sways off-topic. It's impossible to discern as a student what's most important and what's less-so. It's impossible to discern what we're expected to know. The stories we get in lecture have nothing to do with the actual problem set and exam questions, which are far more quantitative. Going through practice problems and actual course material in lecture will entice more people to go to lecture. As it stands, it feels we attended one class and were taking the exams of some other class where they were actually learning. In addition, TAs didn't provide correct answers to incorrectly answered problem set questions, further stunting learning.",
    "The content is interesting. Professor Shiller is an amazing resource--he has incredible stories and historical understanding of the material. At the same time, his teaching style can be a bit scattered and lectures were hit or miss. The problem sets are way too hard to do given what we learn in class and highly time intensive for this not being a QR class. They should be much shorter and stuff that we would know given what was covered in lecture. The midterms were pretty challenging, and they as well as the problem sets were not spaced out well.",
    "contents tested doesn't seem very relevant to lectures?",
    "Strengths- Shiller salons were awesome! Rare opportunity to have lunch with a Nobel prize winner (and discuss thought-provoking, relevant topics to boot). Good psets. Weaknesses- slides were very dense and rambly. I wish there were more practice materials provided before exams!",
    "Lectures are informative but, could be better structured in terms of key concepts",
    "Strengths : > Robert Shiller! > Interesting content, and very engaging (albeit unstructured) lectures > Strong TFs Weaknesses: > Massive disconnect between lecture content and p-sets\/exam content. > Requiring students to memorize formulae (closed book exams). It would be so much more helpful if exams were open book, and p-sets and exam problems were more aligned with real world financial problems.",
    "Just do the readings. The lectures are just Happy Hour with Shiller and don't make that much sense if you didn't do the readings.",
    "Strengths - very engaging, interesting choice of topics, which were all very well connected throughout the course Weaknesses - content in lecture and discussion section were very separate",
    "It covers a broad range of material, but could perhaps be tightened -- more depth than breadth would be nice.",
    "Strengths: Shiller is a good guy, and he clearly is passionate about finance and has developed a lot of his own insights. But lecture can get tedious at times, as he does ramble about details. What he talks about in class is very disjointed from section & psets, as those are mainly math based.",
    "Shiller's personality and experience are the strengths; the seemingly disorganized material and syllabus is the weakness. I loved listening to Shiller lecture, but the problem sets had nothing to do with lecture, and there was little to no support on them other than the extremely dry sections. Also, not giving away solutions to exams is unheard of!",
    "Exams do not match material learned in class.",
    "Lecture was profoundly unhelpful, the material was straightforward though",
    "Strengths: interesting lectures, depth and breadth of material Weaknesses: lectures did not cover enough about the homework; the sections were helpful in this regard; sometimes, it was difficult to distinguish which formulas we were supposed to use to solve for something like variance, because there were several options. Standardization would be beneficial",
    "One of the biggest weaknesses of this class is that the lectures dont provide the majority of the information that is expected of students to know on problem sets, midterms and the final. The problem sets, were fair, but pretty much all included information that was alluded to in class, rather than discussed. The midterms were a completely different story, as the short answer questions seemed to be arbitrarily picked from a random point of discussion in class, or from a brief moment in one of the multitudes of readings that were assigned. Overall, the class simply discussed the history of financial markets rather than really giving much in depth information into them.",
    "Problem sets didn't have anything to do with lecture at all - learned how to do all relevant math in section. Exams pulled information from seemingly nowhere, was almost impossible to answer all questions that weren't related to the mathematics on the problem sets.",
    "Less material, more focused lectures",
    "Strengths: fantastic professor who is a leader of the field and thus has clear, interesting insight into current and past financial events Weaknesses: tests DO NOT reflect the material learned in class, as many other students are taking 4 or 5 other classes (I took 6 this semester), studying for these exams seems unreasonable and impossible - the conceptual material is usually worth less than the math in the exam and is covered in four different parts (textbook pages which may be upwards of 300 or 400 pages of material for a midterm, lecture slides, math PSs, and extra reading) and makes it impossible to be 100% ready for an exam. To incentivize students to study the conceptual material, I'd suggest making a study guide outline that offers a reasonable subset of the textbook pages to study for the exam.",
    "Professor Shiller is very interesting, but I wish the course had a bit more math.",
    "Lectures have almost nothing to do with the problem sets or exams. Frustrating",
    "The course covers a wide range of interesting financial concepts, but we aware of the arbitrary nature of qualitative exam questions and the lack of instruction to prepare you for the quantitative work. Taking Corporate Finance before this class would be very highly recommended.",
    "Strengths: Very interesting, enthusiastic professor, SHILLER SALONS Weaknesses: Historical content very interesting but sometimes felt irrelevant for tests (I'm not a grade grubber so that's ok with me though!)"

   "comments": [
    "Absolutely not. The course would have to undergo some fundamental restructuring in order for me to recommend it. As it stands, it's a pass, and someone could in theory circumvent it and get a similar education from MGT 541\/ECON 360.",
    "Definitely if they took it credit\/d and just wanted to learn. Especially good for non-econ majors who are interested.",
    "Easy class, personally didn't need to show up to class, oops.",
    "no do not take this class, professor shiller is a very smart man but he cannot lecture. he is dry and not engaging whatsoever so no one goes to lecture or section and then you have to teach yourself everything for the midterms and final. the tests are also super hard and not reasonable at all. people actually fail them (obviously the econ curve helps you) but this was just overall not a good course.",
    "Useful survey course for Financial Markets! Professor Shiller makes himself very accessible. Would definitely recommend going to section.",
    "Depends. I would not recommend this course to someone who is serious about [pursuing economics. However, if you want a slightly in-depth understanding of finance and markets (as I do, I don't really care about economics as a subject), then this is an excellent course to take. It's easy (if your pre-calculus math is strong), lectures are fun, Robert Shiller is super cool (and you get to meet him in a salon), and you can learn quite a lot if you do the readings and the p-sets properly.",
    "If not for anything else you should take it for the prestige. Also if you're a woman expect to be made to feel uncomfortable at times. If you're comfortable woth math though Financial Theory is a lot more rewarding and engaging.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course. Professor Shiller was fantastic - very engaging to listen to.",
    "Yes! Nice professor and engaging material -- but do come in with low expectations.",
    "If you're interested in finance and want a more chill econ class, I recommend this course. You'll walk away with a basic understanding of the various players in the economic system and the forces that shaped them. There are only 5 psets, and the TAs will go over how to do the math for each one in section. The exam is roughly 50\/50 for short answer questions and math. To study for short answer questions, read over the lecture slides and make sure you understand the concepts he brings up even if definitions are not explicitly typed on the slides themselves. Also skim the readings outside the textbook. The math part is fairly similar to the psets.",
    "Yes. Great introduction to financial markets. Probably the second most helpful class for investment banking after corporate finance.",
    "No, because it was a mostly self-taught class.",
    "Not really, pretty much all work\/learning is to be done in your own time. The material is vaguely useful though",
    "Yes, if they want to learn about financial markets. But, the lecture material did not always match well with the level of technical requirement needed for the problem sets.",
    "No. This class is confusing with respect to its assessments, and is far too historical rather than substantive.",
    "It is interesting to read the textbook and hear stories from Professor Shiller, but you will be receiving a grade for your ability to teach yourself.",
    "Yes, but be prepared to work hard and learn a lot of the test-relevant material yourself. Professor Shiller's lectures are enjoyable and memorable, but only if you have a strong understanding of the basic material; which is mainly covered in the extensive readings you will have to get through.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to someone who is interested in learning a bit about finance but doesn't want to dive too deep.",
    "No, not organized well and the exams are made too difficult to actually succeed on. Have to rely on a large curve.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student. Even if the lectures are boring (which they are), there is definite value in taking a class taught by Prof. Shiller. The material itself was interesting, and the class provides you with a solid baseline understanding of a swath of financial concepts. I would advise taking Prof. Pascuttis Corporate Finance class before this one, however, as it helps you with the quantitative problems that arent explained very well in this class.",
    "This is a great class if you want to learn about finance and I would highly recommend taking it. My advice on how to do well in the course would be to know how to do the psets perfectly and have thorough knowledge of the lecture slides, the readings aren't actually necessary and neither is going to class. Overall it was a really good class that taught me a lot about the world of finance!",
    "Yes - great to understand finance more anecdotally than a purely number-ey approach."
