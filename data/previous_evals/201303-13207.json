    "I would strongly recommend this course to other students.",
    "The course begins with the question of persistence. What does it mean for a thing to persist from t1 to t2?This question is answered by two divergent positions in contemporary debates. Perdurantism considers time as a determining factor in that each moment corresponds to a metaphysical part of a larger whole that exists across time. Endurantism considers the identity of a thing as wholly present at each moment in time.But there are problems. Either things are scattered parts that cannot add up into wholes, or there is no reasoned explanation for how one thing continues onto being itself at another point in time.The divergent opinions are locked in an impasse.Why?Perhaps we are asking the wrong question.The problem is that we cannot resolve the fact of individuated things. This is a question of relations.We climb a steep mountain. This is the Parmenidean Ascent. The air is cold up there...and few are around to keep us company (or at least they don't know that they are keeping us company in eternal solidarity).We write our papers to console ourselves (or out of joy).",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course."
