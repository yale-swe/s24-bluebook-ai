    "Question 4 - At times work load was very light, but when a problem set was due, work load was very heavy. It would have been better to have a more consistent workload.Question 1 - Readings were informative, but they were rarely referenced in class. Would have been nice if the professor had integrated the readings and lecture better.",
    "the course had a lot of potential, and the professor himself was interesting and approachable, and good at explaining things. the problem was that the lectures were horribly organized and seemed to be randomly constructed. the slides were often confusing, vague, or badly constructed. the problem sets were incomprehensible and though the TAs tried very hard, they were unable to provide much clarity. it was difficult to see concrete linkages between the lectures, the problem sets, and the exam. the course could benefit greatly from a detailed outline that explains what information is trying to be conveyed. i often felt like we all (professor included) were swimming in a sea of facts and figures with no real plan for reaching the shore.",
    "Outstanding course and professor. Professor Koomey is extremely well qualified to teach the course, very responsive to students in and our of the classroom. I was able to meet with professor Koomey outside the classroom to discuss my interests and my research project several times. Professor Koomey gave me excellent advice and support. Professor Koomey also gave many presentations on energy efficiency topics outside the classroom. I hope FES take the opportunity to bring professor Koomey back at least part time to fill the gap of energy classes at FES.The course overall provides an essential foundation on energy and it is a must for any students with even remote interest in climate and energy. The problem sets were challenging and great learning tools.Great class and outstanding professor.Please bring professor Koomey back!!!!!!",
    "6. The issue with class material was that the three hour lecture blocks were too long with too much information being covered in each. Two hour and a half blocks would be much better.",
    "Q7. The TAs were grading our problem sets. Out of 4 assignments that we submitted, we did not get back two. One problem set was returned just days before the final exam. At times, I found that the TAs were not able to articulate their concepts well and they also made glaring conceptual mistakes. Each problem set takes about 2 weeks to complete. It is really unfortunate that after a lot of hard work, the TAs did not get enough time to go through it all.",
    "This course throws an incredible amount of information at students - too much, I think, to really process it all. Three hours of 50-100 .ppt slides per class is a LOT. The content was all VERY interesting but just too much. Concentrating on fewer core issues would have probably helped us all. Might want to consider splitting this course up into two semesters!",
    "Both TAs were of very little help. First, they had only limited knowledge of subject. Second, when they did know the subject they had a difficult time relaying that information to the students in a clear and constructive manner. Finally, the timeliness with which they graded the homework assignments was the worst I have ever seen. Actually, the course is over and we have yet to receive feedback from homework assignments that were completed in the first week of November.",
    "Overall a good class.",
    "The course is good for anyone interested in energy. Unfortunately having the 3 hours class once a week makes it difficult to stay focused throughout and it was very much just a lecture by the prof. It may be different when Grubler is back teaching it.",
    "Homeworks did not relate to anything that useful in the real world. Some high level knowledge imparted in the class good to know info about energy, but minimal on the ground pracical knowledge was provided. The lectures were dense and the takeaways not very significant. The whole course should be re-vamped because the topic itself is very interesting, but execution not great.",
    "Lectures need to be more interactive.",
    "Adrian Horotan was also my TA (question 7). I found him generally responsive to email questions but not extremely helpful during TA sessions. Daniella all around did an excellent job TAing and was extremely responsive.",
    "Koomey was a good professor, though I think it was challenging for him to jump in and give Arnulf's lectures - this showed sometimes.",
    "Prof. Koomey was excellent. Three hour classes can be a bit hard. Problem sets takes a lot of time to complete but are very helpful in teaching you what you need to. Final test was extremely long for the time given.",
    "This is a very useful course and Prof. Koomey was a skilled instructor - but the structure of the course itself was an obstacle. Instead of one long class per week, it would have been better to break it into two smaller classes (perhaps with an additional discussion section to go over concepts in smaller groups). The class was very large, which discourages discussion and interaction, and it was difficult to remain focused and absorb complex concepts over a three hour period, especially in late afternoon.In regards to the TAs, Daniela in particular made an effort to meet with students, address questions and provide notes. However, it would have been better if we had gotten feedback on our problem sets within a more reasonable amount of time - at least prior to the exam. The problem sets were a useful tool for applying course concepts, but they were complex and sometimes confusing, and talking through the results would have been a really valuable teaching tool.The readings were structured a bit strangely. It was almost like a set of unconnected research for students to consider. Is there anything that could be used as a text?",

    "problem sets were great for building skills and for stronger absorbtion of concepts",
    "Professor Koomey is extremely well informed and interesting. His real-world experience is very valuable in this area...its really too bad he's not a full time faculty member, as he fills a desperately needed space in our faculty.",
    "Professor Koomey is outstanding. The class provides a great foundation on energy systems.",
    "The problem sets were among the main strengths of the course - I would have liked more instruction in similar types of applied analysis, vs. the theoretical\/conceptual material.",
    "The course offered a whole new perspective to energy systems. I have studied a few concepts in energy before, but this course introduced me to a completely different set of ideas.The course featured a few guest speakers who have done exceptionally well in the energy industry. The best part was a dinner with the speaker at a fantastic restaurant.The course also introduced me to back of the envelope calculations and critical thinking skills. For example, we had to determine how much energy an individual consumed while at Kroon Hall.",
    "Learning about the fundamentals of energy - facts and figures, benchmarks for countries etc. That, and the problem sets. While they were incredibly intensive (sometimes requiring ~20 hours to complete), working through the calculations was incredibly helpful - I actually developed some practical skills that I'll use in my career!Also, learning from someone as knowledgeable as Professor Koomey was wonderful. He rocks. He's not just a lecturer - he's a practitioner. Would be wonderful if he were a permanent lecturer!",

   "comments": [
    "The time and day of the class made it drag: Mon 2:30-5:20.",
    "This class would have been much better if it had been divided into two lectures and maybe even an additional Friday discussion section. The 3 hr time slot was far too long and by the end, the prof was exhausted and so were the students. I also think the class would have been better if we focused on fewer issues in more depth rather than so many issues very superficially. The prof tried to cover far too much information and I feel like I only absorbed a small fraction of what he taught. A discussion section would have been helpful because in such a large class, there is little opportunity to discuss and really breakdown the issues.",
    "The lectures. Not the professor's style, but rather the lectures' content and organization.",
    "lectures could be improved. explanation of some of the conceptual material was hard to follow at times",
    "A text book! There was no go-to reference for a lot of the implied or underlying topics--a course packet would be a start, but a list of references or a textbook with basic explanations would go along way. Also this class should NEVER EVER EVER be a 3 hour block class. It should be a 2x a week class, given the dense material and the assault on the senses the topics can be. It was WAY too much to take in on a Monday afternoon (the third class of the day for many of us) for three straight hours.",
    "I would suggest define specific TA sections for review of the more technical aspects of the course.",
    "Again - breaking up lecture sections and increasing the practical calculation\/modeling\/etc. would be helpful.",
    "The problem sets were recycled from previous years. Some of the problem set templates, which was supposed to be blank, had answers to a few questions. Also, some questions were worded very badly and we found it really difficult to understand what was being asked.",
    "Again, the amount of information. It's too much. Slow the pace and allow students to really digest fewer topics in more detail. That, and the problem sets should be graded and returned before the final! Regular review sessions from the TAs would be great as well. Reviewing the highlights every two weeks or so would be hugely helpful.",
    "The assignments were time consuming but required little thought or analysis. In fact, most of the assignments were little more than a matter of data collection and working through the specific instructions to yield the desired answer.The final exam had about 20% more questions that was probably doable in the allotted time.",
    "I think having class for 3 hours on a Monday afternoon was problematic - it meant it was difficult to follow. it would be useful if we had more specific readings to prepare for specific subject matter in class. That way, I think we could get more out of class sessions.",
    "Just as we are required to turn in the four homework assignments on time, we should have recieved graded responses within two weeks. Also, inputting the solutions in excell added nothing, was cumbersome and often more time consuming than the actual homework. There should also be a more detailed and formal review session to prepare for the Final beside \"any questions?\"",
    "1. Three-hour classes are a bad model and rob students of adequate time to digest topics and learn. We must have at least two classes a week. Students are exhausted and dreaming about other things after hour 1.5.2. Use the Socratic method. The professor was out of touch with what the students understood or didn't or even whether they were listening.3. Powerpoint presentations were poorly executed. Too much information on one slide, graphs were confusing and had too much data, slides were not adequately explained by the professor.4. Homework assignments were not well enough connected with class. We were basically left out to dry with any explanation of how to complete the homework assignments.5. Final exam was basically quizzing how much we could regurgitate what was quoted in the powerpoint slides. We did not need to internalize the information, just find it in this open book exam and put it in the test. Have a final exam that tests whether we truly can explain the concepts we have learned.",
    "The problem sets were worded oddly and made them even more difficult and time consuming!",
    "Lectures, charts for lectures, homeworks. This is not a high school chemistry class... i did not take an energy course to learn about conversions - i knew how to do this and could figure it out on own.",
    "I think that only 10% of problem set material was worth it's while.A different problem set format would be more helpful to absorb allthe material and prepare us for the final exam.",
    "The lectures and homework were extremely disconnected. The questions to the assignments were sometimes unclear, making it a timely process. Although much was learned from performing calculations in these assignments in this course, the required navigation of the internet for obscure random facts (e.g. what energy use was in 1800) in order to complete the assignments did not feel like a good use of my educational time allocation.",
    "The slides are too many and not self-explanatory;It is hard to follow all of the instructors' notes for 3 hours;There is not good ways to prepare for the final exam.",
    "I think Prof. Koomey was entirely disadvantaged by working from another professors slides. The lectures often seemed disjointed and you got the feeling that a certain amount of critical information necessary to fully understand the information was missing. Additionally, I felt that critical concepts were covered, but not supported by the homework. The homework often felt like a laborious exercise in absurdity. It didn't feel as though the course had a coherent arc from start to finish. Additionally, I was frustrated by the macro-scale of all the material. The details were supposed to come out in the homeworks I suppose, but I didn't think that was particularly coherent or effective. I would like to see at least a few lectures dig deep into the",
    "I\u0092m not sure what can be done about this, but the slide presentations were simply too long and too dry. I know that the subject itself isn\u0092t easy, nor is it the flashiest topic, but I thought that some more tenable case studies to define the concepts could have made things more interesting \u0096 or perhaps longer case studies that tied multiple concepts together instead of each slide being something new. It was hard to hold concentration for nearly 3 hours of constant lecture.As with almost every F&ES class, I would suggest that the professor review each presentation and really cull out what the learning-goal is for that presentation. Identify what the main concepts that students should gain and keep coming back to these in the lecture. Over 60 slides for one class is dense \u0096 we need to make sure that the essence of that day\u0092s lecture \u0096 the X # of things that we should take away from it \u0096 stays in the forefront and isn\u0092t lost in the shuffle. Even review slides interspersed throughout the lectures would help.The homeworks and lectures did not overlap generally. I think this is by design and overall, I\u0092m okay with it \u0096 it\u0092s a good way to learn a lot of different things when the homeworks are more technical and the lectures more general. However \u0096 more tie-in wouldn\u0092t hurt. Some review of the concepts or at least an overview by the professor of what is to be gained in each homework and what the learning-goal is for each homework would be good. I think there\u0092s also a good opportunity to mix some of the concepts in the word problems in the homework with the lecture material.Lastly, the exam was too long for the allotted time. If the exam is graded with this in mind, then strike the complaint. However, most folks did not finish or were not able to put in the requisite effort on many problems",
    "The lectures are really technical, which is tough to focus on for 3 hours straight. I wish the problem sets had been graded sooner and returned, so I could have looked at them before I took the final!",
    "the timing. too late in the day, too long.",
    "I felt the class could have been taught differently. There were way too many power point slides making it difficult to pay attention and learn. There was no connection and references made back to the readings we were supposed to have completed. There was also no connection between the lectures and the problem sets, which seem to have come out of thin air.",
    "Classes need to be splitted. Being too long make them tedious",
    "See my comments in Question 11. Better scheduling for the class, more discussion, more feedback on problem sets and perhaps a discussion section (maybe an optional one?).",
    "The problem sets should be more fully integrated with the lectures. The course needs to be split into 2 lectures per week, not a three-hour marathon.",
    "Too much reliance on powerpoint. Lectures need more variety. Coursework could have been more engaging and educational, less busywork.",
    "I would have liked to receive more feedback on my assignments earlier in the semester.",
    "It is more quantitative.",
    "=Faster feedback from TAs. We turned in our problem sets then didn't get any of them back until after we'd turned in our last set.-I would have preferred to have had a midterm and a final, rather than have everything loaded in the one final exam at the end.-More student debates\/projects would be welcomed.",

    "The TAs had very different styles. Daniella was very helpful. Her review sessions were really well structured and I felt she had a vested interest in helping us learn the material. She was slow to return our problem sets, but at leastshe posted the solutions online so we could see the correct answers. Adrian did not seem to have any interest in the class or the students. During review sessions, he sometimes dismissed questions and did not provide answers. He was extremely slow in returning our problem sets and never posted solutions. A general comment to both of them was that it would have been helpful to have our graded problem sets returned to us so that we could learn from our mistakes throughout the semester. Even after the final exam, we still have not received two of the four problem sets. If they are too onerous to grade, the prof should either devise a better system for grading them (ie dont put all the burden on the TAs) or make several shorter problem sets rather than only four really long problem sets.",
    "the instructor was remarkably available given his crazy bi-coastal schedule. he was very kind and always wiling to meet with and talk to students. the TAs, too, were quite responsive, but it seemed that the course material itself was unclear and so they sometimes had a hard time explaining things.",
    "Jon was extremely available, even given his tight schedule, by email, phone and through office hours. The TAs were far less available and at times downright unresponsive.Rather than dividing up the problem sets and taking responsibility for half the problem sets each, they should have divided up students so that you had 1 TA that could be in charge of answering your questions\/emails. I frequently got no response to questions sent to both of the TAs.Furthermore the delay on the return of the problem sets was ridiculous. We were having to turn in problem sets that drew on answers\/information given in a previous problem set, prior to getting the original problem set (or even the answer key!) back. As of the end of class\/after the exam, there is a problem set I STILL have not received back.",

    "Prof. Koomey one on one was great. He's very knowledgable and responsive. As I said in question 13, I think the main problem with the course was that Koomey was presenting Grublers class. I have no doubt this course would be much more successful if Koomey built it from scratch or Grubler was presenting the existing material.",
    "I didn't visit with Koomey specifically, but he always made himself available and was quick to respond to email. Daniella held review sessions for some of the homeworks that were helpful - these need to be continued next year b\/c some of the homeworks are simply too challenging to work on without assistance or at least it's too hard to understand what it expected without some help from the TA.",

    "Somewhat. It was very focused on critiquing data, which is helpful, but I was hoping to learn more about energy systems themselves rather than how to assess them.",
    "no, not really.",
    "yes",
    "I had heard that the course was disappointing, in that it was rather shallow about the stuff people were really interested in. That part, unfortunately, did ring true with me. I also think it was a challenge for Jon to teach Arnulf's slides\/course. I'm reasonably sure that if Jon had written the material, it would have had a very different approach and feel.",
    "Absolutely. It exceeded my expectations. Professor Koomey is outstanding and super qualified for this class.",
    "Yes.",
    "The qualitative aspects lived up to my expectations. The quantitative aspects did not.",
    "Yes.",
    "I think it was only at the end that I realized actually all that I'd learnt and all that had been covered. Because so much was covered in each session, it was sometimes difficult to grasp it at the time. This could be helped by weekly reading directed toward specific topics.",
    "Yes",
    "Yes it did",
    "No. It didn't come close. The teaching was not good for the many reasons cited above.",
    "Somewhat.",
    "No. only touched surface of what i wanted to know. I learned so much more just by doing a paper on solar energy for a different Yale class.",
    "No. For me problem sets did not teach me anything new.I'd prefer to learn this material with more applicable problemsets that impart real tools and information I can actively deploy.",
    "Yes",
    "Sort of. I feel more comfortable discussing macro-concepts of grid scale production. But I wish there was more discussion of how those concepts transfer down to smaller scales.",
    "Yes, although I was hoping for a bit more concrete knowledge about renewable energy resources. But i understand that renewables aren't what's currently entrenched in the world, hence fossils are still important.",
    "Yes.",
    "No - though I learned a lot through the problem sets, I didn't learn much from the lectures. It was hard to pay attention and overall the process of learning could have been improved if the class was taught differently.",
    "Sure did",
    "Yes - overall I learned a lot and enjoyed the class. However, there is SO MUCH material to go over that you could almost have a second class in the spring that is a Level II Systems Analysis. Many issues could be explored further, with more time available.",
    "Yes.",
    "There was a large volume of materials and I definitely took away some new concepts, but could have had a better understanding rather than the volume that was presented.",
    "Yes",
    "I thought it was more qualitative but it was more quantitative.",
    "Yes.",

    "It would have been very tough to do the problem sets alone, if only for 'sanity checks' of complicated calculations.",

    "pro:learn from each other, more efficientcons:hard to find a good time for each other.",
    "It was absolutely necessary to work in groups on the problem sets, and I learned a ton just sitting around with my group figuring everything out. However it wasn't clear at the beginning how long these take solo (I spent like 30 hours on the first one and didn't finish!)",
    "It was a more enriching experience to work on the problem sets with a work group. Learning could had been much less if not being on work group discussions.",
    "I worked in groups on the homework problems and it was really valuable. It can be hard to schedule but I benefited a lot from discussion and from others' knowledge. That really helped the practical applications to sink in, and the knowledge to \"stick.\" More discussion, perhaps through discussion sections, would be useful."

    "Work in groups when you can and start your problem sets early - they can take more than 1 week to complete.",
    "very useful class for those interested in energy",
    "Because it is one of the only energy courses at FES, if you're interested in energy, take it.",
    "Put your effort on the problem sets because they are great learning experiences (start early!). Do the readings. There is a lot of value and content on the readings. Take advantage of the office hours. Professor Koomey is great!",
    "Start work on the problem sets early as they require substantial time.",
    "The course is a must for all those who want to work in the energy sector. I would advise students to enjoy the problem sets and to get as much as possible out of solving the questions.Also Prof. Koomey will not be teaching next semester. It would be worthwhile for students to talk to people who have attended Prof. Grubler's class to understand the differences in teaching styles.",
    "Start your problem sets as soon as they're distributed. DO NOT WAIT TIL THE LAST DAY. You won't do well and you won't learn anything. Do all of the readings and take advantage of office hours with the professor. The content is complex and voluminous - ask questions! Group workon the problem sets is helpful as well - everyone has their own take on how problems should be done and I learned a lot from that process.",
    "Stick with it - it's tough at first, but definitely a valuable course.",
    "Prepare for the quantitative work",
    "Be prepared for the final",
    "Professor Koomey is a very nice man but not a good lecturer and I would not take the course or recommend the course to any other students. I generally am positive about courses and recommend them. I feel bad giving such a poor recommendation, but it would not be fair to other students and FES not to give honest responses.",
    "Definitely do a big group study session for the final exam where you split up topics and aggregate notes!",
    "Do not take the course unless it is modified dramatically from it's current format and content.",
    "Ask if problem set format has been altered.",
    "This course is extremely time consuming, make sure you are willing to endure!",
    "focus on the lectures.be prepared for the final exam from the starting of the class",
    "Wait for Grubler or take from Koomey if he's reworked the course to match his teaching style.",
    "Overall, it was an okay course. It didn\u0092t change the world for me, but I think it provides a good base of knowledge for energy. It was a tough class to sit through for 3 hours and the homeworks took an extremely long time, however I don\u0092t regret taking the course.Start early on the homework and ask the TAs questions about them earlier rather than later. Also \u0096 work in a group on the homeworks b\/c they can be challenging and its important to have sanity checks when dealing with so many numbers and conversions.If you\u0092re not a math person \u0096 I wouldn\u0092t be afraid of the course. There\u0092s math involved, but a lot is done through online conversions. If you don\u0092t like doing very detailed analytical work that involves math and conversions, I would be afraid as this is required for the homeworks.",
    "Get a good group for the problem sets and start them really early, they take forever.",
    "Make sure you finish your problem sets, do them with your fellow students.",
    "Work in groups on the homeworks and take it upon yourselves to discuss course concepts outside class. Get comfortable with unit conversions and technical concepts.",
    "Great course! If you are interested in energy, you should take it!",
    "Prepare for the problem sets in advance.",
    "Go to lectures and ask lots of questions.",
    "It is more quantitative and there are many questions for final exam.",
    "Keep up with the readings.",
