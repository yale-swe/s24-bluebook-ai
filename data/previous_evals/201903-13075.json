   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths: I like that the homework always had an audio portion, the study guides for exams was very helpful, I liked having tests every two weeks Weakness: I didn't get to speak very much in the course which was unfortunate, the material we read and watched was very outdated (like Jules et Jim and Le Petit Nicolas)",
    "Strengths - Chandler was nice, you cover a lot of material Weaknesses - SO MUCH WORK, way to much material discussed",
    "I think the course could be improved if there was more of an emphasis on pronunciation and complexity\/length of phrases spoken. As for strengths, I think the courses focus on grammar and the rigorous practice of grammar concepts was conducive to my learning.",
    "I think this course could help students more with the audio portions. I think many of us struggled and most of the work\/practice we received for audio was independent. I think it would be better if the instructor helped students directly.",
    "I think the layout of the course is very intense and lacks actually solidifying key grammar concepts.",
    "Although L3 is much better than L1 and L2, there is a consistent amount of a lot of homework every night and prepping for exams and quizzes was stressful and time-consuming. I think the course depends on the instructor. Chandler was excellent, but other professors made their classes much more stressful and unenjoyable. Chandler allowed me to really enjoy the course. She is light years better than the other French professors and you can tell she cares about her students and their understanding of the language. If she teaches this class or another course, definitely take it with her!!!"

   "comments": [
    "I would. I know a lot of my classmates complain about the heavy workload; however, if you actually enjoy learning French, you will not mind the workload.",
    "NO! If you are just starting your language, GET OUT WHILE YOU CAN! If you are on your last semester of French, maybe suffer through it but it really isn't that worth it. You have 2 hours of homework a night, and are constantly switching topics of instruction. For the tests they expect you to learn meaningless vocab and phrases characters say. They do not accept synonyms for vocab (even though in normal conversation those would be fine). Also, the class is not curved despite the fact that it seems that it is almost impossible to get the 95% in the course to get an A. This class may help you learn French, but it really is not worth it unless you want to devote your full attention to it. If the class was curved, I would say maybe take it, but they punish you with grades and it does not help you learn. Also some days in class are useless and other days you cover 34573 grammar concepts in 50 minutes. If you do take it, be careful with who you have. Chandler was nice and provided was pretty available to help us, but she also did not correct us enough to truly improve. On the flip side, M. Koizim is very strict and some of my friends in her class say her attitude discouraged their learning and passion of French. Basically, suffer in this class if you want, but if you do not already hate French, this class will probably make you hate it. Save yourself and go take Polish or something.",
    "Yes, it really takes your French to the next level by introducing you to reading full novels and watching full movies entirely in the language. Both the novels and movies we look at during the course are also quite interesting.",
    "If you want to learn French, 100% take this class. If you just need to fulfill your language credit but are not as invested, definitely consider other courses.",
    "Not unless you have to or you are really set on learning French or you don't care about your grade. Any other language besides Chinese is much easier at Yale to learn and do well in. The french department makes their courses unnecessarily hard and burdensome with an overwhelming amount of homework, assignments, and exams\/quizzes."
