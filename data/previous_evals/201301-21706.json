    "A good class, but better for someone who has not taken a lot of psych courses. Being a psych major and taking this class as a senior, I was very bored as I had already learned much of the material covered in lectures. The observations, however, were very interesting and fun. Not much work--journals due twice during the semester and one final paper. Readings unnecessary. Professors are very knowledgable. Some interesting guest lectures. I think this would be a better class to take freshman or sophomore year, but since they give priority to juniors and seniors, that's not really possible.",
    "I would absolutely recommend child development to another student, as long as they're committed to doing a 3 hour observation at a day care once a week. it's a trek to get to any of the daycare centers (calvin hill, EBJ, or Y-NHH) but well worth it. journals aren't too bad and the only other assignment is a 10-15 page paper on a topic of your choice.",
    "Yes, absolutely, I LOVE THIS CLASS",
    "The best part of this class is the observations at a preschool once a week. The lectures are not the most engaging but some of the guest speakers are good. The no laptop rule is a little tough. Writing credit for not a ton of difficult writing and playing with the kids is really fun.",
    "This course is a wonderful introduction to childhood learning and development as it occurs in the earliest stages of life. The combination of lecture and observation was a really refreshing change from my previous paper- and problem set-based classroom experiences. I loved the regular and structured interactions with children and found that this course added a grounded, human element to my semester, which can be sorely lacking from the theoretic liberal arts environment. Certainly a large time commitment but rewardingif you are invested in the experience!",
    "Child Study is the class for you if you're thinking about having a family at some point in your life. Take it!",
    "This is such a fantastic course! The class consists of a weekly seminar and 3 hour observation at a child care center near campus. While studying child development theory, you get to actually see it in practice during your observations! Each week you write a journal entry combining your observations with the readings and there is a final term paper on topic of your choice. All of the class coordinators and guest lecturers too were great!",
    "Great class that will change your perspective on early childhood education. Whether you have interest in going into education or not, you'll likely deal with younger children later in life, and this class offers some great ideas about how to best prepare the child for independent thinking.",
    "I would recommend the class. It is a substantial time commitment, but it's also really enjoyable and adds a lot of variety to your schedule. I learned very different things than in any other class.",
    "Child development is an amazing class - if you can get into it (i.e., are a senior, or a lucky junior), and you like children, definitely take it, regardless of your major. Professor Close is a great lecturer, and she brings in top lecturers from many fields of child development. In addition, you spend four hours a week observing at a daycare. Although the four hours is a lot, it does not feel like traditional work, and instead is a nice escape from the normal work of Yale. At day care, you really have a chance to become part of the classroom instead of just observing. Also, the reading load is lighter than most classes, so that makes up for the time commitment. Overall, a great class, I learned so much about both children and observation skills. Definitely, definitely, recommend.",
    "This was an absolutely wonderful course. The practical component of the class (you spend three hours a week observing\/participating in a day care center classroom, i.e. playing\/learning with the kids) was an awesome way to really connect with the material presented in lectures. Some of the guest lecturers are quite good, and cover a broad range of topics including policy, literacy development, and parenting. Section with one of the directors of the day care center you observe at was a great experience as well. Workload is more than manageable, but you still come out of the course with a great appreciation for the complexities of child development before age5. Take it! Professors Close and Horwitz are wonderful people.",
    "Take this course if you are at all interested in the psychological, mental, and social development of children ages 0-4! Not only will the observation periods be the highlight of your week, but the lectures are always engaging and you'll come away with a very comprehensive understanding of the subject matter. I feel like what I've learned in this course will inform not only my future academic career, but how I perceive early childhood education and how I want to parent my future children as well.",
    "If you can get into this class, it's worth taking! You get to hang out with babies for 3 hours a week, which is a ton of fun, very educational, and breaks up the rest of your Yale routine very nicely. I get the feeling that this class is very different depending on which child care center you're assigned to so choose wisely.To do well in this class, you should always show up to your observation and to class. You don't need to do any of the reading, just skim some when you're writing your journals. And start working on your final paper early enough to get some support from the professors in finding resources and what not.."
