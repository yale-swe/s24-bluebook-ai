   "comments": [
    "I developed greater problem solving abilities when approaching dynamics related problems. I did not previously know how to quite approach multiple reference frame problems and how involved rotational motion problems could become.",
    "This is essentially an extension of physics, so there isn't too much more to learn. The concepts are the same maybe just a little more in depth.",
    "I feel like I got better at applying vector math to real world problems. This came at the cost of my (what I thought was very grounded) intuition about physical problems.",
    "spacial reasoning, general physics problem solving skills",
    "We learned a lot about the motion of particles and bodies with varying centers of mass.",
    "In this class I developed the skills to solve more difficult kinematic and motion based problems. It was essentially a continuation of PHYS 180.",
    "I learned several equations to learn how to solve different kinematic relations such as varying acceleration and moment of inertia in several dimensions."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "This was a very organized class--one of the best that I have taken in terms of organization and content. In terms of weaknesses, sometimes the questions asked to the class are very vague and confusing to answer.",
    "I think the biggest issue with this course was that it seemed to just be a recap of basic physics. Combined with a general lack of enthusiasm from Professor Schwarz, it was very difficult to get excited about the material.",
    "Would be VERY useful to have the lectures posted ahead of time. The professor says he wants some of the \"surprise\" you get in class from derivations and I understand it could discourage students from coming to class, but honestly the people who don't come to class rely on posted lectures, anyway. This would not affect their attendance and would actually allow students to follow the lectures DURING class and ask any questions. Would be useful to have more demonstrations and to actually have a textbook or a few textbooks with practice problems and all. The professor copies the problems from an existing book, anyway, and has to re-draw all the diagrams because of copyright. Finally, PRACTICE PROBLEMS IN CLASS are so much more useful that spending the class deriving what is already in the lecture notes... ANOTHER REASON TO POST THEM AHEAD OF TIME.",
    "first midterm and a large portion of the second midterm didn't worrespond to much with classes. classes don't do much for homework since we are just deriving equations and don't learn how to use them",
    "I only have 2 real complaints of the course. 1. the exams are out of 10 points, so if you get 1.5 points off, you're automatically at an 85. If it were out of 100, I think TAs would be a little more judicious in their point assignment, which would be nice because even though I got more than half of the problem right, I got 1.5 off because it seems trivial whereas if it were out of 100 I would've gotten much less taken off. 2. the homework sessions are worth bonus points, but they don't give an alternative for if you can't go to them. I had work during them for a lab I helped out in, and I emailed asking for alternatives (going to office hours, etc.) because if I could have, I would have gone (i.e. I wasn't choosing not to go), but they said no, so I wish they had worked with me a little more on that",
    "Udo could give more incentive to come to class. His teaching still is quite boring and not engaging at all",
    "Udo has great notes, but the notes are the exact same thing as said in class. This means a 10:30 class implies that it is not worth going.",
    "This course is dry. It very much feels like 'Physics, volume 2'. The problems are similar to physics in style, but everything is more complicated. On the plus side, you learn a lot of interesting tidbits and explanations for idiosyncrasies in Newtonian mechanics.",
    "The course is taught at an introductory level but the derivations are quite tricky and the material can be a bit difficult to follow. The homeworks are usually pretty fair, besides an extremely difficult problem on each pset.",
    "The lectures are great, and Professor Schwarz is very responsive to questions. He also prepares great lecture notes. One thing that could be improved would be to have more practice problems and applied examples outside of the problem sets.",
    "The strengths of this course have to do with how thorough it was - nothing was skipped or left uncovered. That being said, I felt as if we started too basic. We did not begin to cover anything that I hadn't learned in a high school physics class or in freshman year physics at Yale until at least after spring break. I think that in order to really call itself an upper level dynamics course, it needed less review (perhaps starting at the same point but moving more quickly, or starting at a less basic point) and more advanced theory\/work.",
    "I liked seeing applications of the concepts and equations we learned in class in physical form: for example different disks with different masses rolling down a slope or a demonstration of Tsiolkovsky's rocket equation. I wish we could see more of how these equations were used in mechanical engineering applications."

   "comments": [
    "It's only required for ABET, but this is a very well taught and effective course and worth taking for all MechE majors who also enjoy physics. Problem sets will seem hard and very involved, but they are doable especially in study groups. Even better is that Udo is aware of how difficult tests should be and creates very fair tests. If you pay attention and are studious, you will do very well.",
    "Dynamics is interesting and allows you to do many things if you apply it. But the course, especially during an intense semester, is something.",
    "it's a dynamics class.",
    "If you've taken physics and are Mech e, might as well take it because it's essentially the same, so it's a pretty easy course to take as another credit.",
    "It's fine. Just do the work and study normally and you'll be fine. Schwarz is helpful if you reach out to him.",
    "I wouldn't necessarily recommend this course, unless you have a very strong physics background and can follow the slight gaps in lecture very readily. It could be a great course, but it just isnt there due to a few reasons.",
    "If you're thinking about taking this class, you're probably either ABET or doing the BS12. If you're Abet you don't have an option, and if you're doing the BS-12 this is fair, relatively light workload class to take. Professor Schwarz is a fair teacher, and goes through his notes very thoroughly. That being said, if you're thinking about taking this class for fun, it's essentially a slightly more difficult Physics 180 class - it's not terribly interesting and you won't come away with any mind-blowing insights or new information. The psets aren't terribly long, and the tests are fair, so if you do take it, the course isn't terribly difficult.",
    "This course presents the information on how to solve different equations on dynamics well. The homeworks and the midterms were also fair in the amount of knowledge that was expected."
