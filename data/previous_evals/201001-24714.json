    "If you're looking for a relatively easy seminar with no 20-25 page paper, yes. If you're looking for engaging discussion, no. The class's organization of having 3 people present papers each week leaves very little incentive to do the reading, and, as a result discussion lags.",
    "This course is the worst (non-science) course I have taken in my three years at Yale. A quarter of the course material is very interesting, such as Harms' book; a quarter of it is moderately interesting. But, many of the questions we examined in the course were intellectually unsatisfying to me. There is no reason to do the homework\/reading for this class (except for the 3 weeks when you'll present a reading summary) unless you plan to go to graduate school in precisely this topic. If you want a course with a light workload that counts as a rest-of-world history seminar, you could take this class. However, know that you probably won't get much out of it. Also know that Prof. Harms is a poor discussion leader. There will be plenty of awkward silences, and even though it's a seminar, students will simply tune out and surf the internet once they realize that there's no discussion happening. Often, the discussion was so poor that he would adjourn class early.",
    "The material was interesting, but often times dry. Professor Harms does a good job of covering basically all of the literature on African Slavery. Unfortunately, the only people who did the reading each week were the people responsible for writing review papers for the reading that week. The discussion was pretty minimal because people didn't do the reading.",
    "Take it if you really need a non-Western history seminar; be aware, though, that conversation often lags and readings vary from heavy to light each week.",
    "Seminar that surveys the history of slavery in Africa. I would recommend it to another student if they want to learn about this subject, not if they want to be in seminar with lots of open ended discussion.",
    "I would definitely take this class if you are interested in slavery in Africa. If you already have a background, some of the material may be repetitive. But overall, the course probably features authors and scholars you have not read.",
    "I would not recommend this class, unfortunately. There are currently too many kinks to be worked out before this class is a truly worthwhile seminar. Professor Harms is an extremely friendly and knowledgeable professor, but there are better history seminars to spend time on."
