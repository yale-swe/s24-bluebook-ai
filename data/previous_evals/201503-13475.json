    "Open discussion",
    "Disease\/pests in multiple contexts, including ecology, genetics, agriculture, and human health.",
    "Extremely interesting.",
    "Very good spread of topics. Good moderation by instructor.",
    "The readings were very interesting, as was the discussion.",
    "Overall, I thought that this course was amazing. LC did an incredible job presenting the material and leading discussion. It was fun, interesting, and could not recommend it more highly (assuming your interested deeply in the subject material). I wish there were more classes taught at FES with this style and structure. I think one of the greatest aspects of this course is the fact that it is entirely discussion based. I loved how discussions were NOT contrived, with particular students leading discussion, while no one else reads the material. Participation by everyone was really engaging. Very much a self-learner structured course. Light on assessment, but heavy on engagement."
