   "comments": [
    "An incredible class. Intriguing topics, great professor, challenging but not overwhelmingly so, and I recommend anyone to take this class if they're interested in science but don't want to take BIO and CHEM.",
    "MCDB 050 is perfect for anyone on the fence about pre-med, or who are considering any work with diseases. Despite finding out that I am most certainly not built for pre-med on day 2, I found this course incredibly engaging, thought provoking, and exciting. An absolute must take.",
    "I thought this was a interesting class; it provides you with a good overview of the immune system. Professor Kavathas exposed us to a variety of readings and she made the class more engaging and interesting by changing up each class; some days we had lectures and others we had class discussions. We also had a trip to the Art Gallery to see works done by HIV patients, which was fascinating.",
    "A great course and a good introduction to immunology and medicine generally. The course seemed surprisingly technical for a freshman seminar, but the grading is not very tough, and certainly fair. Professor Kavathas is extremely knowledgeable and gives lucid explanations. If you have any interest in immunology or disease, I would recommend this class.",
    "Take this class! It is a great collaboration between science and the social\/ethical implications. The class makes you think about the world and life and what illness, immunology, and microbes are! There are no tests so work really hard on the problem sets because they are graded much harder and are looking for much more detail than you think. Great community and discussion within the class.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. It is not a high stress science course and you walk away with a great understanding of immunology.",
    "This course was fantastic - I would definitely recommend it. The material is fascinating, and Professor Kavathas is incredibly knowledgeable and presents the science in an engaging way that encourages questions and discussion - I came out of many classes with my mind blown. The readings often delved beyond the science into the social\/ historical context of diseases, and were well integrated into the course."
