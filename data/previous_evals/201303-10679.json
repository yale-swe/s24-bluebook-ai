    "Excellent class with a lot to offer if you commit to doing the reading. Dan is fantastic and it's worth taking the class for that alone. We covered so much of musical theater history (I thought I knew a lot about musicals, but I learned so much more in this class). The other students definitely affect the experience--the best classes are when everyone is thoughtful and engaged and the discussion is balanced among many perspectives, which happened multiple times this semester. Take it if you're interested in musical theater, and don't be scared off by the intense music focus at the beginning of the semester. This class was fun and interesting!",
    "Awesome class. If you love musical theater and don't quite know why or how to articulate it take this!! Egan is amazing.",
    "This course provides great exposure to musicals you may not have known about and covers all the \"classics\" that anyone hoping to make a career in the theater ought to know.",
    "Yes; if you're reading this, you probably are interested enough that you should try to get in it. It's a terrific, unique class that covers an incredible amount of material to the perfect extent. Egan lets the class help shape a lot of the discussion, although you still learn an incredible amount and think about specific departments, productions, shows, and theatre itself differently at least once over the course of the semester.",
    "YESSSSS. If you stumbled across this course title and it looked *remotely* interesting, show up Day 1. And take it. You do NOT have to be a Music or Theater Studies major to get in (our class had two biologists, two philosophers, an art historian, and even a geologist). It is NOT difficult and doesn't presuppose a ton of knowledge about Broadway or musical theater (though if you got it, you can flaunt it) - you'll listen to 2 or 3 shows a week and read a few chapters\/articles, usually 40 pages a week tops. All you need to succeed is a willingness to think and be challenged intellectually about Broadway shows, which I had certainly been waiting for basically all my life. Dan Egan is an INCREDIBLE educator, who will expand your mind in all sorts of ways and introduce you to a bunch of new perspectives on musical theater, no matter what your angle is. (Previous takers of this class will no doubt remember that unforgettable article comparing a certain Broadway staple to Nazi-occupied Poland.) Historians, actors, musicians, dancers, directors, designers, producers, close-readers, and mere fans all have a ton to get out of this class, since we approach from all those angles.",
    "Absolutely, absolutely, absolutely take this course. Dan Egan is a paragon of a professor, the material is delightful, the work--simply reading articles and listening to two shows a week! You will not regret it.",
    "Take this course. This was one of the best courses I have taken at Yale. Egan is so willing to work with his students, kind, and engaging. You leave the course with a new perspective on musical theater and theater as a whole.",
    "If you're interested in musical theater, take this class! It provides a great background in American musical theater history, the workload is manageable, class discussions are enjoyable and interesting, and Professor Egan is engaging, understanding, and articulate. You'll get more out of the class if you put more into it, so do the readings and pay attention during discussion.",
    "Absolutely must take! The class is probably the most accessible, interesting, well-organized class I have taken in my 4 years at Yale. It really does help a bit to have some interest in musicals, because it'll let you enjoy the class more, but it's not necessary. Dan Egan is amazing as a professor and a practicing professional. The class attracts a group that is incredibly knowledgeable in the field. The readings are interesting. The music is great (and fairly diverse, but I knew I was going to like it). Plus, we got to go see Pippin! __________ PROFESSOR: Professor Egan (or Dan) is the clearest and most organized yet also most interesting seminar leader I have had in my time at Yale! He had worked in opera and theatre for decades now, and he knows theatre from top-to-bottom in his personal, professional, and academic lives. Kind of wish he could be my uncle, but oh well. __________ CONTENT:The class is a mixed music analysis\/historical writing course. Each session involves us going through an era or theme of theatre - three include the 20s shows, political shows, Rodgers and Hammerstein, R&H-inspired shows, \"mega-musicals,\" and 20th century are a few of them. Dan spices up the content with visits by professionals in the field, in-class exercises on musical performance interpretation, and musical structure and element analysis. There were a few shows that didn't quite do it for me, but I was never bored. My classmates and Dan knew a ton, and had enough opinions to spark a debate or conversation on basically any topic. When things got out of hand, Dan always got us back on track in no time. We were also required to see two shows on-campus (fun!) oh, and did I mention we get to see a Broadway show? This year it was Pippin but it changes every year. __________ WORK: There are ~100 book pages to read per week, so very manageable. The readings are really interesting too, so I strongly recommend that you do them, although he does summarize some key take-aways in class. There are 3 writing assignments: a 5-page analysis of a single musical that's almost like a \"close reading\" in English; a 2-page op-ed concisely outlining whether a show should be revived or not; a 10-page final paper on ANYTHING! Make sure you hash out the final paper topic with Dan. My original topic was way too broad, but I loved writing it. __________ SUMMARY: Take it! One of the 2 best classes I've taken in my time at Yale. Great prof, great subject, interesting work and readings. This course is the kind of experience you can only have at Yale.",
    "There are three papers, two longer ones and one short one. The reading is super manageable, and listening to the soundtracks isn't work so much as fun. The class does tend to be filled with theater geeks--this can be a major pro for some people and a major con for others. Even though this course is labeled as an \"introduction,\" everyone pretty much already had a working knowledge of musical theater, either as a fan or as a practitioner. I can see how this class could be an intimidating environment for a musical theatre novice, but Dan Egan is super supportive and wants to fill the class roster with as diverse a group as he can."
