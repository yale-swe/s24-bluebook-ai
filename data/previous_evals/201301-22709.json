    "Take it if you like these poems, want a great discussion environment to focus on a small number of text per poet, and practice close reading together as a class. These are some wonderful textual discussions that helped me see much more from these initially obscure and difficult texts. Professor Jacobs is a delight to listen to, and she is also an excellent seminar leader. All in all a great class!",
    "Yes, absolutely, if you have any interest in Rilke or Yeats yes. If you have never heard of either of them, then probably no.",
    "Prof. Jacobs is one of the best professors I have ever had at Yale. Be prepared to do a lot of your own thinking; Jacobs won't just fill you in with an interpretation of a text and leave it at that.Do the readings carefully and return to the texts as the semester progresses.",
    "Definitely take the classes if you are interested in the poets. Jacobs make the class a memorable experience with lots of revelations.",
    "Great class!",
    "We sit there and talk about Rilke and Yeats poems\/plays\/experimental novels (Malte Laurids Brigge). The class got off to a weird start because we had a ton of vocal grad students and then many of them dropped it, leaving an odd dynamic where even the most literature-ey and English-ey students felt intimidated into not talking. Something like that. It was just one of those seminars, you know?",
    "Excellent if you're interested in a thoughtful close-reading of a selection of very interesting poems and a certain amount of discussion of how the poems of a given author relate to one another. Not a great deal of attempt to tie the authors together, however. But Professor Jacobs is excellent, as are the poems."
