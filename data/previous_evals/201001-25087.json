    "Obviously, one wouldn't enroll in this course unless one was a philosophy major. That being said, this class gives one the opportunity to engage with material and thinkers unlike any other class. Honestly, I wish I could have taken more classes like this one. Of course I recommend it.",
    "The best possibility to engage deeply with one subject that the major offers.",
    "Yes! A great way to conclude the philosophy major.",
    "Yes--write an independent senior essay. You're going to have to write a paper anyway, and this frees up a lot of time you can use to write one you are really passionate about.",
    "Writing an independent essay was wonderful. I would absolutely recommend it. It might have been better to have a set draft deadline so that I had a goal to work towards before the final submission date. But everything worked out okay in the end!",
    "If you are passionate about a particular topic and there is no seminar around which would give you the excuse to write about it - then the Senior Essay is the way to go."
