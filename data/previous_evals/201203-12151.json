    "This class requires self-motivation and flexibility, but I learned a lot. There are quizzes every Friday on the chapter we studied that week, which kept me on top of my work, but the grading system is unclear. The midterm and final projects were both fairly easy and not high-pressure. The homework is often posted late in the evening the night of, so it can be a little frustrating. Overall, if you want to learn Hindi, I would recommend this class, but I wouldn't take it just to fulfill the language requirement.",
    "Take it! Great experience for native and non native Indians alike. One of the least demanding intro courses at Yale, but you still come away learning a lot. It can easily serve as a 5th course.",
    "Hindi is one of the most widely spoken languages around the world. Of course!",
    "I would recommend this class.",
    "great if India is important to you",
    "The class is a very fun introduction to not only the Hindi language and culture. The instructors are very kind and encouraging and I really loved learning from them. The class is not very structured, but it is also flexible in that manner.",
    "Take it but study hard."
