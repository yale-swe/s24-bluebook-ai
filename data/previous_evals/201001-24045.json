    "I would recommend this course to anyone and I would summarize this course as a discussion about the injustices in our law.",
    "yes, I'd recommend it. Blacks and the Law looks at the history of race-related case law and precedent in America; run like a law school class, with most of the grade determined by moot courts.",
    "The most valuable take-away I got from this course was that I do NOT want to go to law school. That said, this course was still worth taking, even if it wasn't as good as all of the glowing evaluations from previous years made it out to be. The Moot Courts are actually a LOT of fun if you do them right (although a lot of work, so be prepared) and really get you to start thinking like a lawyer \/ judge. Be warned, though, that pretty much everything in this class is a group project (and there are some Cr\/D-ers in the crowd), so if you don't like working in groups, I would steer clear. There's also a final that for us was open-book open-note on laptops -- so not difficult at all IF you had done all the reading and written case briefs along the way. So be warned.Norcott deliberately tries to create a cult of arbitrariness and tends to pick favorites, which was irritating at times. Lectures are also generally not very informative, because he cold-calls people and then others jump in to have said something in class, so the discussion ends up being somewhat repetitive and you often don't get to hear what Norcott thinks. So anything you do take away from this course will be from the Moot Courts, and your own reading \/ thinking. Definitely consider taking it, but go in with your eyes wide open...",
    "I would definitely recommend it!",
    "I would most definitely recommend it. The only problem is that the workload is very demanding, but nonetheless completely worth it. I would recommend taking it maybe senior or junior year just because as a freshmen, the course often feels intimidating.",
    "Super interesting topic. Section can be valuable if you have a great TA. The moot court projects are a lot of work and the final was semi- divorced from topics covered in class. I wouldn't necessarily recommend it because lecture with Professor Norcott was not the most fruitful - the material sometimes took a back seat to Professor Norcott.",
    "This is a great class. It's a nice change of pace from regular class because it pushed forparticipation and was super involved. You will work hard if you wanna do well. You can't slack this class; even if you're taking it credit d you're gonna have to commit yourself. But what's nice is that when you commit yourself you get such an amazing experience out of the course.",
    "I recommend this class. It's structured differently from most at Yale and the change is refreshing.",
    "Yes. Be prepared to work, and be prepared to be challenge (especially if you've never taken a law course), but learn the system and you'll be fine. Ask questions when you need to, but understand that you'll have to defend your position whenever you decide to join the conversation. Make sure Norcott knows your name by the end of the semester.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class because of the Moot Court assignments. This class will definitely make you talk and make you step outside of your comfort a little. Lectures wandered a bit, but the class was sweet overall.",
    "Best class I've taken at Yale. Definitely take this.",
    "The topic is incredibly interesting and everyone should study it. I may be one of the few people who doesn't think Justice Norcott is as phenomenal a lecturer as everyone claims. But the Moot Court exercises are fun and really teach you a lot, so I'd say the class is worth it. I definitely know loads more aboutlaw and the Supreme Court than I ever did before coming into the class.",
    "Yes, if you are interested in the course materials - or a career in law, or a stint in law school - then I'd definitely recommend this class. Be prepared for work around the moot court times, but it will be fun.I think this course is special because it offers a real law-school experience, taught by a great lecturer (Justice Norcott), with a class who genuinely wants to be there learning with you. Few people are taking this class for any requirement or arbitrary reason - students are there because they're interested. This leads to great discussions and interesting forays into various legal cases spanning the history of african americans and civil rights in this country. The biggest downside may be that in some cases we did not have the opportunity to really get into the material as much because we spent time on other kinds of class discussions more tangentially related to the day's material (but related to the themes of the course.)",
    "Highly recommend.",
    "One of the better courses I've taken at Yale. You will tackle some of the most interesting Supreme Court cases (about affirmative action, employment discrimination and the criminal justice system) and debate them in a moot court exercise. Professor Norcott is great as he forces you to think&respond to his questions in class - rare for a lecture. There is a good amount of reading, but it is manageable. I'd definitely recommend this class to everyone!",
    "A great course. The moot courts really made the class for me. Add in the professor (a CT supreme court justice?!) and the wonderful TAs and you have a really great experience. Know that there is a ton of reading (2 course packs around 400 pages each). Know that a lot of the class will be discussion--aka hearing different people's opinions in the class--and not as much straight \"learning\" per se. Overall, Highly Recommended.",
    "Definitely take this class if you are thinking about going to law school. But even if you're not, i would absolutely recommend it.",
    "I don't recommend this class, especially if you're a senior. The class discussions would have been interesting as a freshman or sophomore who has very little experience with issues about race\/employment discrimination and criminal justice, but they were so boring because you're surrounded by many people who are just figuring these things out. I had taken immigration law& policy with Alexandra Dufresne prior to this class, which I think is a much better class for understanding the different dimensions of lawyering, judging and just general statutes. This class was more about feelings and issues, not the legal reasoning (aside from the two moot courts, which were EXTREMELY different from class). Don't take the class if you're looking for a good law class, only if you've never, ever thought about blacks and the law.A lot of students will say this is the most awesome class, but my guess is that most of them have yet to experience even better classes.",
    "It's a survey course of racial history with a focus on racial law. The Moot courts make you feel like you're a law student- pressure and all- and the class is made to be a real discussion- something I loved during the class. I would take it if you're willing to work and read and really make the most of the class.",
    "Yes",
    "This class is phenomenal - one of the best I've taken at Yale. Take it.",
    "Lots of reading but a great class. Good discussions, great professor. Definitely take it.",
    "Take it if you are interested in the Afican-American condition, or are looking for a good pre-law course. It satisfies both. Plus you need to experience Professor Norcott.",
    "Blacks and the Law is the most unique course I have taken during my time at Yale. After two years of classes focused mainly focused on lecturing with little student participation, blacks and the law really challenged me as a student to contribute my own ideas to the class. The topics brought up during the class required thoughtful consideration and the semi-socratic style made sure I was on top of the reading. One of the greatest strengths of the class was learning how to prepare a legal brief.With all the thought provoking exercises, one weaknesses of the course is the balance of secondary literature about the topics covered in the class. Professor Norcott has very strong opinions about the development of law and race which is reflected in the reading. However, there are very few readings that challenge his thinking. The lack of diversity in the reading undermines a students' perspective. Another trend during the class was the increasing disorganization of class time. By mid-semester, we were so far behind in the syllabus in class that we were unable to reach the final topic of voting rights.Professor Norcott is a powerful teacher due to his year of experience in the legal field. His proclivity to go one step further in his line of questioning to students is a method that should be replicated by his colleagues across disciplines. One limiting aspect of Norcott's teaching style is his penchant to call on the same students over and over (even when their hands aren't up and other students want to participate). In a class that seeks to teach about expanding \"equality of opportunity,\" it would be great to see this practice extended to student selection to ensure all voices are heard.",
    "Best class I've taken at Yale. You'd be an idiot to not try to get in.",
    "learn alot. very tough. take it if you are interested in law. DO THE READING.",
    "Take this class. It is informative, fun, and it tells you how to read an opinion.",
    "This was a terrific class. Even if you do not have an inclination of going to law school after Yale, this class brings up topics and discussion that truly help form students' views of the world today",
    "It is a survey of the civil rights cases in american history with specific focus on education, criminal justice, voting rights etc. Also, the moot court is a lot of fun. However, don't try to be too creative with the assignments or the oral arguments because they'd rather see you do it by the book.",
    "If you've taken Con Law, this is basically a waste of your time. If you don't mind sitting around inaimless discussions about race in America, it's a solid class--and very easy. Don't be intimidated by Norcott's first lecture; this is one of the easiest classes I've taken at Yale. Sometimes the discussions can be interesting, and you'll pick up a few facts about how the law has treated African-Americans over time. But this class certainly did not live up to its hype.",
    "This is the class you dream of attending when you go to college. High-level thinking paired with rewarding discussion and an outstanding professor. This has been THE BEST CLASS I'VE TAKEN AT YALE and anyone interested in law, race, or just being a better person should apply.",
    "Yes, the amount of work is doable, the reading is interesting, the class is stimulating, Justice Norcott is a great professor.",
    "I would recommend the class to another student because I enjoyed the experience of moot court and learning about Supreme Court history. The class is a great introduction to the world of law. It prepares students by assigning required court cases and moot court activities in which students interact as lawyers and judges. The open discussions allow students to hear and appreciate opinions that differ from their own."
