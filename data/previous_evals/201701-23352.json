    "Good",
    "It was a good course and Dr. Makuch was great!!",
    "Interesting perspective on drug regulation from an insider. Pretty dull material however. Homeworks were fairly good exercises however some of the material, both in lecture and as homework was redundant. It's nice that exams are open book and note, but some of the exam questions, particularly on the final were ridiculous! True, false, or it depends??? True and false are absolutes, when is everything ever absolute? An answer can be practically always true, practically always false, but in actuality is 'it depends' ever wrong either and yet it's on option? Silly line of exam questions. Claude Petit was a phenomenal guest lecturer! Presenting the material is a clear and even engaging manner.",
    "This is a good introductory course with enriched materials. The class is easy....",
    "the class is helpful in understanding regulatory affairs",
    "Great course. The professor was passionate about the information and delivered it in an engaging manner. It was a joy.",
    "It's an easy class, easy HP, easy H for those who pay attention in the class",

    "Instructor: Robert Makuch \u00a0Seemed like he wasn't particularly prepared for the class at times. Couldn't figure out how to technically operate his powerpoints, some of which were half in Chinese and weren't modified to reflect material he wanted to present to the class as the audience. Cancelled class due to snow at seemingly the last possible minute. Also has distracting throat clearing tendencies.",

    "Instructor: Robert Makuch \u00a0Great professor.",
