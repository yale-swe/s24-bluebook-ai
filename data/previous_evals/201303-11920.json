    "Has greatly improved from past years. Good intro to Arabic class.",
    "It is a tough class, but one worth taking. It requires a lot of extra work on your own as learning any new language would.",
    "Yes, definitely take it.",
    "It's a lot of work. Three hours a night of homework at least for the first month, and they're not kidding. But it gets a lot better after that. Hasmik is fantastic, definitely get her if you can.",
    "I will start by saying that this is the most difficult class I have taken in my life. You have to learn everything from scratch and it can sometimes be very difficult to wrap your mind around the concepts. Yale is known for having a terrible Arabic department so only take it if you know for sure that you will put the work into it. It is A LOT of work, on the first day of class the teacher said that there was about 3-5 hrs of homework per day and, although we laughed at first, she definitely was not lying. It is extremely rewarding to learn Arabic but only if you have the time to put into it. Professor Tovmasyan is really nice and explains concepts well but I felt unprepared for the tests sometimes. This was because the classes taught by other teachers got mock tests and we didn't so there is a little unfairness between teachers. All in all it is a ton of work but rewarding if you can survive it"
