    "#1 - the readings were extremely well-chosen. Excellent material each week. #3 - sometimes the reading assignments were on the heavy side in terms of the length, but I dont think it went too far beyond what's expected in a graduate level course. The instructor was very skilled at explaining complicated topics or theory. She was able to clarify concepts each week and I appreciated the time she took to make sure that everyone was able to grasp the material.",
    "THE READINGS AND BIG IDEAS WERE INCREDIBLE! Kristin is a great professor, explained neoliberalism, intersectionality, and other hard to grasp concepts in ways that made sense. I would say sometimes the discussion got off topic or didn't fully take on the readings, and I often felt like I gained a lot more from the readings than from the discussion that followed. With that said, however this had been one of my favorite courses because Kristin assembled an amazing, amazing syllabus that deals with all the stuff ANYONE going into food work should know! I would definitely recommend the course.",
    "This was really just an outstanding course overall. The field of food justice has taken off in the last few years and our readings reflect what's happening right now. The class provides a good foundation in critical race, class, gender--all important things to know as a human and citizen apart from food studies . Professor Reynolds is engaging and an expert in her scholarship and activism. I think you should take the course!",
    "I thought this course was very well taught, especially as someone who had very little academic reference for social justice before this seminar. I learned a lot in the course and the readings were essential and never felt extraneous."

   "comments": [
    "The readings were fantastic. I also think the discussions were the best I've had at any course. It was a good balance - rather than have too much of the talking coming from the instructor which sometimes makes it difficult to stay focused. Instead, we were all engaged for the entire class period, I think.",
    "The content of the class was amazing. Also, loved hearing from activists and visitors! The people we heard from shared a lot of important information about what they do and gave us ways to envision moving forward despite systemic inequality.",
    "Readings were carefully curated and the flow of the course over the semester made sense. The content of the course is really important--you come away with social frameworks for thinking about justice, identity, and equality. The food system is a rich area to apply these frameworks.",
    "The content and the deep conversations among students on hot topics.",
    "The in class discussion was a highlight of the course. Dr. Reynolds was great about letting the class conversation go in the direction of the students' questions and thoughts while keeping it on topic and relevant to the week's themes."

   "comments": [
    "I think the discussions should be better managed so that one or more students do not dominate the discussion or take too much of the space. I understand it's difficult to cut anyone off, but I found myself wondering if there were ways to better facilitate the discussion for better balance or to help stay on topic.",
    "As stated above, the discussions could be more targeted toward the readings, and perhaps more guided by the professor toward some end objective, new level of understanding. Having a class at the farm was really nice and seems like something that could happen more often. Sitting around that big table seemed really conducive to conversation and it was a beautiful day.",
    "More instructor provided review of theory might help clearly define vocabulary. I think the course relied too heavily on student discussion.",
    "The reading is heavy, which is understandable and unavoidable, but some weeks it was to the point where attention had to be spread thin across readings. That can take away from the value of the readings in class. If they could be parred down slightly, that would go a long way to ensuring everyone is more consistently engaged."

I am interested in food, and I wondered at first if I would learn much given that I considered myself to be relatively aware of social justice issues in the food system. However, this course not only expanded my understanding of the issues, but also provided me with the skills to be more self-aware.",

    "I care about justice in the food system, and feel that our world is structured by the way we produce, distribute, eat and waste our food. Thinking about the oppression of people's, whether through slavery, marginalization, inequality, one always comes back to the question of a food regime or food system. I want to keep doing this work and understand how I reproduce the things I'm fighting against when not acting with great attention and care.",
    "To have a foundation of social and food justice, see if this was a field that I wanted to dive deeper into",
    "In my past courses on food and agriculture, the social justice considerations and human-value discussions were always peripheral. I really wanted to take a class that centered the concerns and worked deeply on understanding what a just food system would be.",

    "Yes, overall my expectations were surpassed. The theory provided me with very different lens through which to analyze and perceive complex issues. Rather than being too abstract, I think it has provided me with a better understanding of the material we covered. I also see how the material is helpful for other courses as well. Although I do not know if the class discussions improved my ability to articulate my thoughts or ideas, but it certainly helped me process them.",
    "Yes!",
    "Yes the knowledge and skills gained exceeded my expectations. The syllabus was crafted really well and the seminar discussions were facilitated so that we could learn the most from each other.",
    "I didn't have any to start with. it would have been nice to have come out of the course with a more solid working vernacular",
    "I went into the course hoping to get a grounding in what the social justice considerations of the food system were. And I definitely got that. It exposed me to spheres of academia that I wouldn't have otherwise been able to read. It was really incredible to have a professor working at the intersection of food and social justice teaching the seminar.",

    "Although it may be tempting to skip some of the readings, I highly recommend reading all of the material. I think a lot of care was taken in designing the syllabus and each reading is valuable.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS! THE CONTENT IS REALLY IMPORTANT. If you want to be involved in food work you have to learn these social justice concepts. I have a greater understanding of how racism operates in the food system, a greater understanding of how oppression operates, a greater understanding of what intersectionality and positionally really mean. Very helpful stuff. Do the readings, they're great! I really enjoyed the course, though sometimes felt like discussion didn't get me to a new level of understanding with the readings. come prepared with questions in order to channel the discussion toward particular parts of the readings you found most compelling.",
    "Take the course! (if you're interested in social justice, the food system, or both) The topic is mostly self-contained so the class is accessible to students without any background in food systems or social justice. A course in sociology, anthropology, or ER&M might allow you to better understand some of the more technical readings. I might read the intro to \"Cultivating Food Justice\" --if that sounds interesting the course is probably a good fit.",
    "Make sure you have the time to read all the articles.",
    "You get as much out of this course as you put in. The weeks that I did the readings most thoroughly and brought my questions to class are the ones that I felt the discussion were most fruitful. There is a lot of independent learning that happens outside the classroom but the course discussions are very interesting and helpful for furthering understanding of the material as long as you put in the work.",
    "Come in with an open mind and do not be afraid to share your thoughts or push back on some concepts. The conversation and debate in class is the strongest quality of this course."
