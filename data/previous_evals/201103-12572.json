    "Yes. It is certainly a large amount of reading, but it is definitely rewarding.",
    "If you're reading this, you're most likely an incoming freshman thinking about doing DS, just like I was last year. I was on the cusp, and obviously decided to go through with it, and this was a great decision. Apart from the standard cool things about DS (great professors, builds writing skills, intellectual atmosphere, etc.), perhaps the best thing is that by the end of it, you just feel extremely knowledgeable about all those books everyone knows about and hears about, but that few have actually read back to front. DS Literature is probably the class most akin to your AP English classes in high school, and the essays you write are similar to analysesyou did then, which to me made it the easiest of the three. T-Rob is a great professor, DO NOT switch out if you get him unless you have to do so. Though he sometimes rambles on for half the class, there's alot more to that rambling than meets the eye (or ear). He's also a fair grader with the best comments.",
    "There is a lot of reading...but if you like it, go for it.",
    "I would definitely suggest the course to another student. The readings are great but are definitely things you want to talk about with others, which is what you get to do here.",
    "I would recommend DS to another student because of the magnitude of the works. I would not recommend DS to anyone who does not have a natural love for classical literature.",
    "You must do the reading for DS Literature. Reading a plot summary on Sparknotes does no justice to any of the immortal works of the syllabus. Granted, there are many pages to read. But if you pull through, you will highly value the class.In my particular section, each Tuesday section begins with Professor Robinson speaking uninterrupted for 45 minutes, placing the work in its historical and literary context and elaborating on its core themes. The following half-hour and the entire Thursday section is devoted to students being randomly chosen by Professor Robinson to comment on any particular passage. This led to incoherent discussion and made it difficult to take notes. Personally, I believe I would have gotten more out of this class had I been placed in another section that had more guided discussion.",
    "If you get Professor Robinson, you've lucked out. All the caveats of DS apply, so there's no need to go over that here. I will say, however, that going into the program with a little bit of trepidation about literature, that evaporated within a week and a half. The readings are worthwhile, and Professor Robinson's extensive knowledge of classical languages (even including Sanskrit) lets him illuminate another dimension of the work, and to draw important comparisons with other works that the curriculum unfortunately does not have space to cover.",
    "professor robinson is extremely nice. section discussions aren't necessarily always lively but he's funny and friendly and a very lenient grader.",
    "Definitely. You study all the \"classics\"which is a great basis for understanding western culture from then on out, as well as for comparing to other cultures, and you'll learn a lot while having a lot of fun. It is a lot of reading but its the kind of reading that I at least found interesting and always wished I could do in my own time so having it assigned was awesome. Even if you've read the books before, the lectures and discussion section with your peers open your eyes to something new you didn't see before, and connect the overarching themes of the various readings. I found the papers fun to write, they hardly seemed like work to me sometimes because I was so excited to explore my ideas in a particular vein of the topic given. It's a challenge in the best possible way.",
    "I would highly recommend it. You read Homer, Greek Tragedy, Vergil, Ovid, excerpts of the Torah and Bible, and Dante. Worth every page."
