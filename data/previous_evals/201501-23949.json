    "Completely up to you how much you want to get involved in the class--if talking about economic sanctions and financial pressures for 2 hours doesn't float your boat, don't take this course. If it does, it'll be a meaningful and enriching experience.",
    "Great class about the real world",
    "I'd recommend this course to students who are interested in global affairs and U.S. foreign policy. Pretty minimal requirements. The reading was dry at times but it was cool to be able to understand the how sanctions actually worked in the context of the continuing Iran negotiations. I feel like I came out of the class with a better understanding of U.S. foreign policy and how sanctions work in general.",
    "001. Professor Bronin is an excellent professor, and very knowledgeable within his subject area. Yale is lucky to have him teach. The grading structure was also optimal: two papers and class participation. I would absolutely take this class again."
