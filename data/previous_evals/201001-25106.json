    "terrible.",
    "Not at all AP gov, actually a very interesting look into democracy in general and public control of government. DeCanio is a saint. Even though this was a lecture, he encouraged student participation; the class was essentially a seminar. However, it might lose this advantage if the class is large, which is wasn't this year. Not much reading, very lenient grading policy - half is from very simple quizzes, the other half from a end of year paper.",
    "Great class, very interesting. Not a gut, but still highly recommended.",
    "Take this class. It is very interesting and covers much more than an intro to american politics. It is taught well and has a good grading schedule.",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone who has a passion for law or politics. It is a great way to fully understand the relationship between the executive and legislative branches and the populace.",
    "Yes. Worthwhile look at basic concepts in American politics pertaining to public opinion and the workings of govt. Decanio is a solid, interactive lecturer.",
    "Take this course if you're at all interested in American government--Professor DeCanio provides you insight into politics that isn't available in any other Yale class. Additionally, DeCanio is an excellent, thought provoking, logical lecturer who makes lectures easy to follow. He's articulate, sensible, and even cracks a joke or two in class, which is great. He's also flexible with paper topics, willing to give extra credit if you earn it, and has a really fair way of doing grading (quizzes every class instead of a tortuous cumulative final exam)."
