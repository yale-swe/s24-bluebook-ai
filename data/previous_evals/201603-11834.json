   "comments": [
    "The setup of the course whereby each week consisted of different readings, topics and guest speakers was conducive to a comprehensive understanding of the course's theme.",
    "The class wasn't very structured, it was moreso just a group of new people coming in each week to talk about topics relating to global tax justice. Surprisingly, though, it ended up being sort of the same material taught about week after week. I wish this class had a better organization and moved through more material. The guest speakers were all amazing in their own right, but some classes were definitely more fruitful than others. We received zero feedback about our intermediate assignments (2 class preparations\/essays) prior to handing in our final paper, and received 0 feedback overall (as of yet nothing turned in has been returned). The first piece of info that I'll be getting on how I did in this class will be my final grade.",
    "Excellent guests",
    "Very knowledgeable seminar leaders and guest lecturers who were effective in synthesizing both technical accounting\/economic aspects and the broader justice issues in different cases of illicit financial flows around the world. At times the class felt a bit unstructured and it would be great if in future iterations there were more focus on ensuring all participants understand some of the technical nuances better."

    "I strongly recommend this course to any student, regardless of major. It provides insight into the world's financial state and the professors and guest lecturers are amazing, and are leading experts in their fields.",
    "Interesting material and worth learning about, but this class could have been way more. I'd say take it to hear the guest speakers, but I'm not sure that's enough to justify a slot in one's class schedule.",
    "Absolutely recommend! This is the start of an important field and it's happening at Yale...take advantage of it."
