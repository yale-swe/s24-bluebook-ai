    "Take this class if you want to write a long play. Why? If you want to write more plays later and haven't written a two act play yet, what are you waiting for? Professor Margulies and his predictably strong teaching assistants and the predictably strong other members of the class will illuminate your play and teach you valuable lessons and skills. It's a no-brainer, fellow student.",
    "Take this class. It totally depends on who else is in it, but the class can be spectacular. It builds on Donalds previous class, and encourgaes personal growth ad a writer above all else. Prof Margulies is a superb professor, and hearing his comments on your work is an eye opening, unforgettable experience.",
    "I would recommend this class if you are serious about delving into the world of playwriting. It is a rigorous workshop, but it leaves you with a finished product and you learn a lot. I absolutely loved it, but you have to be eager and willing to write to enjoy and learn from this class.",
    "If you have an interest in playwriting, take a course with Professor Margulies. It is the smartest thing you could do."
