   "comments": [
    "I learnt about different approaches to the question of 'what is political philosophy?' and I improved my ability to read philosophical texts and write extended essays about them.",
    "This course is a chance to read what 20th century philosophers thought about the problem of historicism, relation between political philosophy and sciences, the meaning of political philosophy and the distinction between political theory and political philosophy. It's a great opportunity to take a step back from all the political theorists\/philosophers you have read in other classes and to think about how these people understand what they are doing and why they believe it is meaningful to engage in political philosophy.",
    "Learned to read political texts closer than I ever had before. Learned how to speak at length about incredibly nuanced topics. Figured out where to situate the philosophical and political pursuits. Gained insight into the modern debates and tensions on studying philosophy."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The strengths were the teaching and the readings, which were both engaging and insightful. The main weakness was that sometimes the seminars were not as productive as they could've been and we did not cover all the necessary material.",
    "Spending two weeks on every philosopher in the syllabus often felt like too much class time spent on one philosopher. Discussions tend to be slow, given that the seminar is small in size and not everyone comes to class prepared to fully engage. If you care about the authors and readings on the syllabus, then you should take the class for the experience of reading them. Be warned that you will be thinking about a lot of questions which concerned these philosophers but you will not always come away with very clear or straight answers to those questions, which can sometimes be frustrating. The syllabus would also greatly benefit from having a more diverse group of philosophers to read, and reading the debate between Foucault and Habermas would be a great addition and improvement to the existing syllabus in my opinion.",
    "This was a great course! The syllabus was great, it included a range of important and interesting political philosophers. It also provided the unique chance to discuss what different political philosophers thought political philosophy is. Professor Entel used our weekly responses to help shape discussion, which was also nice.",
    "Better instructor guidance and facilitation. The discussions were often poorly lead and unstructured.",
    "I really appreciated that this course dedicated two weeks to an author. It allowed me to dive into an author's work and feel satisfied that I did in fact gain something substantial and informative. Still, I felt that with just a few other students, the reading load was quite heavy & two hours of talking and thinking usually left me exhausted. I learned a lot from this challenge, but still it was draining. I also did not enjoy doing weekly reading responses the night before, as I often had to finish my readings just before class, and so my responses were often incomplete. I think it would be better to start the class by opening for questions to address during the seminar, if students have any, and then diving into things."

   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this course to another student, but only if they have taken previous political philosophy classes and are really interested in the readings on the syllabus.",
    "If you don't have a strong background in political philosophy or European intellectual history, then you're probably not prepared to take this seminar.",
    "I would recommend this course to any student interested in political philosophy, as it offers the chance to study so many important thinkers.",
    "If you purely want to do the readings, then yes. But honestly, I think taking some time in the summer or on breaks to read these texts would better serve you rather than taking the course. The discussions and essays were relatively unhelpful and unstructured.",
    "Yes and no. This is a very specific class with a very high intellectual challenge. If you're game to talk about important readings in minute detail for 2 hours every week (and with just a handful of other students, yes, you will be talking), then go for it. I learned a lot in this class and I'm grateful to Lucas for challenging us so much by refusing to let us get away with skimming. However...this class was exhausting. I often dreaded Thursday evenings because the class was quite draining and intense. Still, as a small seminar you do become close as a group, and I am glad I took the course. Just shop it and see what you think. Lucas is brilliant and very nice, but also slow to grade and respond to emails. Oh, and the coursework is weekly responses and two papers."
