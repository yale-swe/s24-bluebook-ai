    "I would recommend this class to students only if they are willing to be self-disciplined with complicated readings and materials. We were never tested on readings in the traditional way, but had I not read I would not have benefited from the class nearly as much as I did. You will learn a lot, but also work a lot (and think a LOT). Also only take the class if you are comfortable with a loose structure of learning and curriculum scheduling.",
    "Good course, a lot of interesting material and you come away with a great perspective on what makes a democracy work--and what makes it fail. Professor Stanley asks the hard questions and is very interested in the answers--and you will be too. There's a lot of reading but not too many assignments. Could be more class discussion.",
    "I would recommend Philosophy 083 to a fellow student because it is a very engaging and rewarding course. You learn so much.",
    "It was a small seminar class that introduces the student to several well-known political philosophy texts. Take this course if you have an interest in learning about democracy or democratic theory.",
    "A great class that allows individuals to become philosophers themselves with the assistance of the great works of other philosophers. Great class to learn how to question and think critically as a writer and reader."
