   "comments": [
    "I wouldn't recommend this course - it's sort of a wishy-washy class that doesn't really have any substance. If you're interested, study the basics of industrial, ecosystem and landscape ecology by yourself off wikipedia and then research any urban related problem (which is what we did for our final papers). The course is not tight enough.",
    "Fun class, interesting topic, does not fulfill any distributional requirements....if you are interested in the topic, take the class.",
    "This class has some good concepts working for it, but the implementation is lacking. Only take it if you are interested in the community based learning aspect and make sure you get a good CBL project. The class could be great if it is tweaked in the future.",
    "I would not recommend this class to anyone interested in learning the actual methods of promoting sustainability in cities. It focuses more on New Haven and meeting with eco groups working in the city itself. Which is interesting in a way, but not what I was looking for.",
    "Take EVST 012 if you want to have a really cool and personable professor but you do not care about feeling like you learned very little at the end of the semester.",
    "Unfortunately, I would not recommend this class. I was looking forward to becoming familiar with New Haven through my community-based learning project and building on my knowledge from AP environmentalscience last year, but this class let me down. Few people found their CBLs meaningful, and I learned nothing in the class itself. On the bright side, the course requires minimal work, Professor Geballe is incredibly nice, and its a good chance to meet other freshmen.",
    "I would recommend this course only if you are very motivated to do a fairly self-driven project in the New Haven community, and to do a great amount of research (for a 20 page final paper) about a topic basically completely up to you. The regular workload otherwise is quite light. Class is less than riveting (though this probably depends upon who is in your seminar), but I suspect Gordon is an excellent resource if you are interested in getting involved with this sort of thing in the New Haven area - he seems to know everyone.",
    "The course is a unique combination of an ecology class, an engineering class, a community service project, and an introduction to New Haven. The community service element or CBL involves working with a local organization on a project relating to urban environmentalism. Most of the projects were interesting, but varied in time commitment required. I did not take any environmental science classes in high school, and took the class because of an interest in city planning and urban issues. I was a little disappointed as only a few class days were spent on the \u0093urban\u0094 part of \u0093urban ecology.\u0094 I would highly recommend the class for those interested in environmentalism and ecology, but would not necessarily recommend it for those interested in urban issues.",
    "Urban Ecology in New Haven had the potential to be a great class, but I didn't end up learning very much. The concept of urban ecology was never well defined, and I mostly learned a few simple concepts from ecosystem, landscape and industrial ecology. The community based learning project is a big part of the class, but mine ended up being a frustrating experience because of the lack of structure and competence in the organization I worked with. However, because of the openness of the assignment, the final 20 page paper was a worthwhile process. There were a lot of interesting guest speakers, but very few field trips into New Haven. Professor Geballe is a really great person, and I would definitely recommend another class with him, but not this one.",
    "I would recommend this class to another student, but with great great caution and hesitation. Passion for the topic will both frustrate you (potentially) while making other aspects of the class extremely worthwhile. For me, the greatest strength of the class was absolutely the Community Based Learning project. I feel like the work I did will actually help New Haven and wider Connecticut and it was a very tangible project for so early in the year. I know many students found their pairings much less rewarding than I did, however, and mentor pairing was very hit-or-miss and success unpredictable. Class itself was often very slow, and not always moving in a clear direction. I immensely enjoyed the final research paper, but it was almost completely self-directed and I think that what a student would glean from this depends entirely on their own enjoyment of their research topic. There was almost no work all year except for this very VERY large writing assignment right at the end."
