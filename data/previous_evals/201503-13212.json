    "There wasn't a syllabus for this course, nor were any materials provided. We were asked to find contract examples on our own. While I respect this approach as it engenders resourcefulness, the lack of a syllabus or materials did not help to clarify course objectives or what to expect week to week. It was often unclear what the instructor wanted the class to add to the contract each week. Speaking for myself, I found myself placing the course lower in priority as compared to my other classes due to the lack of clarity and organization. I'm not entirely sure if this was a direct cause and effect, but it certainly contributed to it. Ultimately, the course seemed to lack substance due to the lack of prepared reading materials, thought beyond that of the instructor, and variety in course sessions."

    "It is hard to know how much will be retained considering the slap-dash nature of the instruction. I know how to write my own contract, but don't necessarily know what Harry believes are essential things to think about in every contract. The course is perhaps too myopic."

    "My main suggestion is that this course be reduced to a 2 session workshop. It does not need to fill the space of an entire course, and the spot in the curriculum could be opened up for something else that would fill a whole semester and is on the wish list of the students. I think that it was very valuable to meet Harry and to think about how to go about negotiating for myself. But the limited scope begs for the course to be a workshop. I urge the department to consider this change going forward."
