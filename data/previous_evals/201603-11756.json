   "comments": [
    "A broad, overarching sense of a large period of theater history spanning a surprising number of geographical regions. It really exercised my reading-management skills.",
    "I learned a lot about the history of theatre from Ancient Greece till a century after Shakespeare. I also learned about writing essays about theatre, which I had never had the chance to do in high school (when we just had literary analysis). We also did some work with scene study and learned a lot of theatre theory.",
    "This class is a great survey in theatre history and frankly a good \"excuse\" to read a lot of classic plays that as a \"theatre person\" I felt I should read but wouldn't necessarily go to myself. The repertory paper is an interesting way to inhabit the shoes of a theatre's artistic director and think about the big picture of a theatrical season -- questions that, as students, we wouldn't typically be able to explore.",
    "I developed a clear understanding of the history of (primarily western) theatrical traditions from antiquity until the Restoration. I learned how to analyze plays using specific scenes, and also how to develop broader concepts of trends\/changes\/etc. in theater over time.",
    "I feel as though I now have a solid grounding in theory that has shaped theater as I know it today. I feel like I can see where the texts we studied apply to modern-day theory, and I'm excited to explore that in more depth next semester!",
    "I learned about various theater movements and the way they differed and connected to form a distinctive early theater history. We read a lot of plays and a number of theory readings, all of which vastly increased my understanding of Professor Roach's lectures-- which were engaging, clever, and insightful themselves.",
    "I have developed an understanding of classical theatrical cannon as well learning various theatre theory and its role in history.",
    "I now have a far greater knowledge of the history of play writing and the societies that surrounded various moments in theater history.",
    "Knowledge of the history of theatre Ability to compare and contrast and deeply analyse and close-read plays."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The course and the topics were really interesting. Because of the limited time and the huge time span we had to cover, some of the plays and theories could not be discussed in depth.",
    "STRENGTHS all plays in one textbook good range of material engaging lecture WEAKNESSES not enough theory too much reading",
    "The scene studies were really great, I'm really glad we did those, and the repertory paper was fantastic. I feel like the class could have more of a focus on non-Western theatrical traditions, and also a greater focus on the plays as opposed to the theory.",
    "The lectures can get a bit boring at times. Prof Roach is incredibly knowledgable, funny, kind, and takes care to really get to know each of his students -- but lectures could really benefit with more organization! He often gets way off topic - in ways that can be really entertaining and humorous - but it can be easy to miss important details that way. It would have been really helpful for me personally to have more visual representation in his lectures also, as he rarely uses powerpoints and doesn't write on the board. Also, there is an enormous amount of reading - one play per class meeting. While this is fine for some of the shorter Greek plays, once we get into Hamlet etc. it's way too much and meaningful discussion (and reading) of the plays is sacrificed simply to get through the material.",
    "Strengths: Good foundation for future study of theater. Weaknesses: The writing assignments did not seem to allow for an exploration of close reading and how to most effectively use close reading in an essay.",
    "I believe it is a fundamentally interest-based course; that is, those who attend the class are invested in it, not just taking it for a credit. To that end, and to cater to the more practically-minded students present, I believe it would make sense to have a bit more acting in the course- more scene studies or similar.",
    "The course exposes a student to a wide range of readings\/plays which promote an understanding of the movements and eras in a way that could not be achieved otherwise. The lectures are as engaging as possible considering the early history of theater is relatively dry, and Joe Roach is hilarious. The only real complaint is that there is an expectation to read many plays in a short amount of time (23 over the course of the semester, many of them around the length of Hamlet) and there is not ample time to discuss all of them in according depth.",
    "The strengths of the course are its ability to cover such a vast time period well, and its use of primary sources in reading so many texts. A weakness of the course is the connection of the plays we read to the theory we read; the theory often feels distant.",
    "Perhaps covering a little more theatre outside of Western Theatre."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "I highly recommend this course to anyone at all interested in the Theater Studies major--it will not disappoint. The plays are fascinating, if sometimes a lot to read, particularly closer to the end of the semester. If you take this class, it will change the way you watch and do theater for the better. You become more aware of the historical and philosophical\/theoretical context of plays, filling in a lot of knowledge gaps I had from my theater education pre-Yale.",
    "I would recommend this course to students who want a broad survey of theater and plays from antiquity to the restoration. We don't spend a lot of time close reading the plays. But I feel like I am better prepared to discuss specific plays in the future because I know more context. The reading and writing load is very manageable.",
    "I wouldn't recommend this course to a student unless they were planning to be involved in the theater department. The class is partially useful just for the connections you make with faculty and if you are not trying to fulfill a requirement or have a specific reason to get a ton of plays under your belt, you would just be taking a super reading-heavy literature course with a really difficult final.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course, especially with Professor Roach. It was a great intro to theatre, and, though it wasn't perfect (a bit heavy on the theory, and not nearly enough non-western theatre or theatre by women), it was still wonderful to read so many plays. You definitely do get more out of it, though, if you do the reading. Professor Roach also incorporates scene studies, which are a great way to do actual acting.",
    "As is, I wouldn't recommend this course unless you are a theatre major and need to get it out of the way. It's definitely not a bad class -- but unless you are really invested in staying in the theatre department, it's a lot to take on. It's also an enormous amount of reading.",
    "Yes! If you want to do Theater Studies, you need to take this course. But it's also great for developing a baseline knowledge of theater history that will help you throughout your Yale career.",
    "Certainly!",
    "Honestly, if you're not doing the THST major you probably don't have to take this course, unless you're really interested in early theater history specifically. Personally, THST 111 had a greater influence on my understanding of the art and its developments and was more interesting, but there are definitely things to be taken from this course if you really commit to it.",
    "This material in this course is very entertaining and Professor Roach makes it engaging",
    "Yes I would. It is a very clear and well done foundation for the history of theater.",
    "Yes - Joseph Roach is a wonderful teacher and the subject matter is very interesting!"
