    "Good class, but frankly you are not going to go to class if you are a normal person, 9:25am is just too much of a pain and you can pull an A- or an A off if you study a couple of days before because the material is easy. The psets are great cuz they force you to keep up with the material",
    "Teaches the fundamentals of Differential Equations with a good mix of proofs and application. The professor really knows what he's talking about which is nice to have. Definitely take this class.",
    "This is a really difficult course. If you are not interested in being a pure math major, I would recommend taking the ENAS version of the class, which is less proof-based and more applications. For me, the class was too theoretical and hard to understand. That being said, if I worked hard, it wasn't impossible.",
    "This course has many practical applications. However, the approach is not one of theoretical interest, and it is taught very much in the manner of memorizing equations and applying them to tricky functions. So, if you are taking this course as a theoretically interesting subject in mathematics, don't bother.",
    "If you enjoy mathematics I would recommend it over the engineering one. The material isn't too difficult conceptually but can often be computationally intensive. Problem sets require a lot of calculus and algebraic computation. The exams were really long for the 50 minutes we had for each.",
    "This math class was lame. I wasn't able to take ENAS 194 so I was hoping that I could get a good diff eq education in this class instead. We did get through quite a bit of material, but it was a bunch of proofs that have very little relevance to engineering. We went through Laplace transforms in a single optional marathon session near the end of the semester. We never covered Fourier series. At least the professor had well-organized notes most of the time, so this class was better than Math 225 at least. You wanna learn diff eq? Here: http:\/\/tutorial.math.lamar.edu\/Classes\/DE\/DE.aspx",
    "I would recommend this to science students needing a fundamental knowledge of differential equations.",
    "Yes, I recommend this course for all students interested in pursuing math at Yale. It includes basic information needed for proofs needed later on in the math major, but it is not too complicated for non-math majors.",
    "yes, take math 246. It is a lot more chill than the enas version, and there is no final if you have Moncrief. The only downside to the easiness of 246 is that you might get a slightly lower grade than you would in a typical math class because the curve is super tough.",
    "I would not recommend this course.",
    "From what I've gathered, this course's material varies with who teaches it. For us, with Prof. Moncrief, it was a standard course in computing solutions to ODEs, and was similar to a first-year calculus course, or something you'd get in high school. Recommended if you want practice solving ODEs and\/or an easier class. If you're really into math, and have taken proof-based classes, skip this unless you have special reasons for taking it.",
    "Take it with Moncrief. He makes the material as easy as it can be and is always willing to help"
