   "comments": [
    "If you like German you will like this class.",
    "Definitely worth it to take L3 just to review everything you've learned in L1 and L2.",
    "Definitely recommend. Learned a lot this year.",
    "Basically, it's an intermediate language class, and it is what it is. There's a lot of busy work. Some of the assignments feel kind of silly. It's really frustrating how much of the stress associated with class has to do with just meeting its deadlines and little things like that, as opposed to the actual work you're producing. But it's not a bad class: you'll learn; it's manageable; definitely if you have Jason, you'll have fun. Don't take it just because, but if you want to learn german, you will. As far as picking a section goes, I can't imagine that it could have been better taught than it was by Jason.",
    "German 130 incorporates speaking, writing, listening, and reading skills very effectively through the curriculum. It builds upon the skills learned in L1 and L2, and encourages a higher level of thinking. It especially builds on one's speaking skills through more advanced grammar and more opportunities to use this in conversation.The workload is not overwhelming, and at the end of the semester, you can really see an improvement in especially your speaking and grammar skills.",
    "Lots of grammar exercises, pretty formulaic class time, regular but reasonable work. Not the best course in terms of design\/instruction, but your German will get better. I'd recommend it if you really want to learn German and don't think you're likely to pick it up after college!",
    "I would not, or at the very least, I would suggest a student shop different TAs to find a good match. Unfortunately for some students, only one section may fit.",
    "It was a lot better than previous German classes, since you can finally have some interesting discussions in class rather than learning basic vocabulary.",
    "Yes I will recommend the course since it was very well structured and above and beyond my expectation."
