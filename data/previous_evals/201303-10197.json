    "The class is really fun and it's so awesome being able to study horror films from an academic viewpoint. Great discussions and really interesting readings that you'll want to do. Absolutely recommended!",
    "Yes I would. Be prepared to work but it flies by and the film selections are great.",
    "Liked it very much. Movie list is all American horror classics, some crazier and scarier than others. Not super into horror movies myself, but the implications of the genre are fascinating and I do not regret taking this class in the slightest. Horror films are way more psychologically and socially important than I imagined, and not for the reasons you're probably thinking. I'll be watching all movies a little differently from now on. Brigitte Peucker is just the right professor for the class and clearly is an expert on the topic.",
    "Watch great movies, analyze them in really interesting ways, write 2-3 papers that aren't too difficult. This is easily one of my favorite classes at Yale. Great material, brilliant professor. I absolutely cannot recommend this enough.",
    "A fun romp through classic horror cinema. Very enjoyable.",
    "Yes. take it. It was a great class.",
    "Brigitte is awesome. If you like horror movies but want to learn more, take this. You watch classic horror movies and read really cool relevant readings. You have to write an 8-page paper, a 2-pAger, and a 10-15 page final. Weekly screenings.",
    "If you're interested in seeing classic American horror films, then I recommend the class. But otherwise, I have some hesitations - I couldn't help but feel like I was making things up as I go regarding the analyses of these films.",
    "This class was phenomenal. The reading is great, the films are awesome, the lectures are interesting. Even if horror films scare you, take it.",
    "If you're even at all interested in horror, you should take this class. Not only do you learn a lot because Brigitte is amazing; but it's easy and super entertaining.",
    "The professor is very kind and knowledgeable and the material is great. Even if you're a big baby terrified of horror films (like me), you'll get something out of it. Especially if you're into how gender plays out in the films! Highly recommended. One of my favorite film classes (as a major).",
    "Yes!"
