    "One of the best lectures I've had. Professor Latham is super well-versed in the material and is great at providing important insight into the issues. Despite having little familiarity with law, I found myself able to keep up with what was being discussed. I would definitely recommend it to anyone who is remotely interested in the material or anyone who just needs a SO credit.",
    "take it if stephan latham is teaching or if you really like to the material. other wise, BOR-ING.",
    "Definitely recommended to get a taste for law and bioethical issues",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. Really interesting material, a fun lecture, and a very reasonable amount of work.",
    "this class is a good way to learn about the american legal system",
    "This class covers relevant and interesting issues, the workload is manageable, and Professor Latham is a great lecturer. Somehow, he speaks slowly and clearly and doesn't use slides, yet covers tons of info and explains it in an easy-to-understand way. You must go to lecture to be prepared for the exams, but you will want to do it, even though it's at 9AM: it's good.",
    "Yes, Latham is great. You learn a lot.",
    "YES! This is a must-take Yale class. Professor Latham is a straight up boss-he lectures from no notes or PPT's, which makes his lectures absolutely riveting, even at 9 am. Take this class if you're even remotely interested in bioethics, medicine, or law.",
    "It is a super interesting course that and is not that time consuming. You just have to go to lecture and do one short paper and a midterm and final. Great course. Take it.",
    "This is probably the best class I've taken at Yale. 9 AM wasn't an issue for me since I'm a morning person, but even if I wasn't I'd still take it. Professor Latham is THE best lecturer you will have at Yale. Take it, even if you have no interest in biology\/science. It's an important class for simply understanding modern issues in healthcare, which we all consume. You will leave understanding so much more about healthcare in the US, particularly Obamacare!",
    "Great class, took it after Issues in Bioethics. Allowed me to learn same topics but from a legal perspective. Pretty straightfoward in terms of grading.",
    "Keep in mind that this is a law course.",
    "This is an amazing class that you should definitely take before you leave Yale, no matter what you are studying here. The issues we discussed in class were relevant and eye-opening. Latham is an excellent lecturer who made 9am class easy to get to and sit through. Take it!!",
    "Take it! It's great!",
    "Take this class! The course material is really interesting and relevant, regardless of what your major is. The course load is very doable (midterm, paper, final) and as long as you attend lectures, it isn't really necessary to do all of the reading.",
    "If you're interested in bioethics, take this class. If you're interested in law, take this class. If you're just looking for a good SO credit, take this class. Great lectures, workload is definitely manageable, and the tests are fair. Just have a midterm, a 5-page paper, and a final. Also, the material is very relevant, so it's great knowledge to have.",
    "I really did not like the class. I'm an MCDB major who was drawn to the class by previous course evaluations, but the class itself was underwhelming. The lectures were, on average, not very exciting, especially considering it was a 9am class. The readings are largely useless, and there are no lecture slides\/notes, so you're forced to show up to class. My section was not very well organized, and overall, the material itself was not too stimulating or exciting. That said, it's almost no work and a pretty easy A, so it could just be a nice filler class.",
    "This class discusses a variety of bioethical issues and the law behind them. Sometimes it delves into a more philosophic aspects as well.",
    "Take this class! Prof. Latham speaks, and you just want to listen to him. I didn't think I was interested in law at all, but I love this class. The subject matter is relevant to anyone.",
    "An average class. It was pretty easy and I did almost no work for it outside of lecture. The professor essentially just summarized all the reading in class. I found lecture kind of boring actually. I expected a more nuanced view of issues or a more in-depth look at the law. But it was an easy 5th class so I can't really complain. Just showing up basically guarantees a B+ or higher.",
    "This is an excellent overview of controversial topics in medicine and public health within a legal context. Professor Latham is engaging and an expert in the field who can explain complicated concepts well and draw interesting connections between ideas. Highly recommended for anyone interested in law, public health, ethics, or simply thinking critically about issues that crop up in the news all the time. Definitely a worthy 9 A.M. lecture.",
    "Bioethics and Law is a pretty nifty class. In terms of material, it presents a unique legal perspective on many important bioethics issues, ranging from the doctor-patient relationship to organ donation to reproductive rights \/ technologies to public health. For instance, you learn about developments in reproductive technologies along with the court cases that culminated in legalization of abortion. Professor Latham is an excellent lecturer (almost always arrived about 3 minutes late to class -- take that as you will), pacing back and forth on the stage and talking for the 75 minutes primarily without notes. He obviously is an important figure in the field and occasionally references is time at this health care body or that ethics committee. The workload is very light. You have a midterm (25%), 5-7 page paper (25%) and final (50%), as well as weekly reading in a law school-level bioethics case book which you could probably get by with not opening once in the semester because the lecturers basically cover all the material you need to know. That said, the tests are relatively tricky. The course (which was at 9 am this year...) draws a wide range of students, from pre-meds to law school people to poli sci athletes fresh from the showers after morning practice.",
    "Definitely take. This class helps you understand more fully things like Obamacare, abortion, stem cells, and lots of other interesting things that you hear in the news and in politics. Prof Latham does just stand up on the stage and talk for the entire hour and 15 minutes so be prepared to concentrate and take notes without any fancy powerpoint slides. Also, the grading can sometimes be harsh. Our TF explained that only \"extraordinary\"course work (e.g. the essay worth 25% of your grade, as well as the answers on the midterm 25% and final 50%) would get the full \"A\"; I ended up getting an A- on the paper even though I had worked on it really friggin hard and had had done everything expected of me. Exams are of the essay variety, so be prepared to do some hardcore memorization and synthesizing of your notes in preparation (my class notes ended up being 115 pages in preparation for the final).",
    "Yes. Even if you don't care about medicine, law, or ethics, but just want to experience a great teacher talk about a field he really, really gets. Oh, there's alsolike no work load, at all. Midterm and final studying is easy peasy, given that (assuming you attend class and take notes), Latham organizes his lectures such that the material really sinks in, and you only need to review. The paper mid-way through was no big deal either, and you get a ton out of the course even w\/o opening the book.",
    "I would, even if it doesn't specifically match your interests. It's well-taught, and the workload is absolutely manageable. There is no homework, only a short paper where you argue that a court case was wrongly decided, a midterm, and a final.",
    "yes",
    "Great class. I took it Cr\/D\/F, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a class you can definitely succeed in if you regularly go to lecture and take good notes. Latham is a great lecturer and taking good notes didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t prove to be very difficult, even at 9 AM. The law book assigned seemed unnecessary, in the long run.",
    "PLSC 257 was a low-key and highly interesting survey of classic and current topics in bioethics, such as informed consent, the right to refuse medical treatment, research on human subjects, abortion, etc. Latham was a great and engaging lecturer who always had interesting and insightful things to say. If you are interested in the subject, need a social science credit, or are looking for an interesting but not time-intensive class, then look no further.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. Court cases and material are extremely interesting even for someone who hasn't taken a previous law class.",
    "Bioethics and law was a very interesting course. Even though it's at 9am, I highly suggest you go to every lecture. Professor Latham is a wonderful and engaging speaker and many of the test questions come out of lecture material. The reading was very long and tedious and it isn't necessary that you read it too thoroughly. As long as you can use the cases to back up your arguments, you'llbe fine.",
    "I loved Bioethics and Law and thought that it was a really interesting course. As someone who is interested in going to law school, I felt as though I was able to have a close experience in this course by engaging with the actual texts of the cases. The sections provided the best times for students to be able to talk about the hot topics and express our opinions on the matter. Professor Latham is a great lecturer and made it worth waking up at 9am twice a week to attend the lectures. Overall, it was a great course and I would highly recommend it to other students who are interested in bioethics and its intersections with the law.",
    "Bioethics and Law was a very straightforward course that was graded on only three assignments: a midterm, a 5-7 page paper, and a final exam. The workload was extremely manageable and the lectures were quite engaging. I'd definitely recommend this course.",
    "This is great class for non-PLSC majors to venture into a bit of law. We are all pretty familiar with some of the material covered in this lecture, but the debate takes great turns and often leads to great conversations and discussions heard in lecture. I would definitely take this class as long as you feel comfortable with the grade distribution.",
    "Really interesting class that covers a lot of cool topics: physician-assisted suicide, in vitro fertilization, abortion, etc. It's much more legal-based than philosophy-based, which I definitely liked - its a more concrete way of learning about these topics. Professor Latham is a great lecturer, it was worth getting up at 9am for (though take it with friends so that you'll be able to get notes when you inevitably miss a lecture). A must-take for anyone interested in either law or medicine.",
    "Yes, an interesting class without too heavy a course load. Very interesting material. Good even if you have no prior experience with bioethics or law.",
    "YES -- one of my favorite classes at yale. You go over the law's relation to topics like abortion, cloning, organ donation, obamacare, stem-cell research, medical malpractice, etc.If this seems interesting to you, you'll enjoy the course. (The first couple lectures of reading week may seem dry because he's giving a background\/overview but once that's over it gets really good. )9am -- yea it's at 9am, and yea it's the only class i've ever taken at 9am, but surprisingly i was able to get up and so will u too.Tests\/Papers -- A paper (argue a case was wrongly decided) + midterm and final (consists of a few essay questions), which are both fair, but you need to look into the details and do the readings if u want that ever-elusive A, which is not guaranteed.Professor Latham -- great lecturer...it feels as though he's having a conversation with the entire class (no powerpoints\/doesn't read off notes). The class is very structure though, so he doesn't go off random tangents and is very organized.Readings -- cases are very interesting, average workload.",
    "interesting class. harder. don't really have to do the reading though. hard to wake up in the morning for it.",
    "I promised myself never to take a 9 am class again, but I had to break that promise to take Bioethics and Law because it's a gem of a course. Pre-med and pre-law students in the same room? Yes please. Professor Latham is perhaps the only professor at Yale able to cover a ton of material in one lecture while not making his students rush to catch up. I write my notes and felt I could have written almost every word if I wanted to. Only thing about this course is that Latham obviously leans left, which is somewhat ironic because everyone knows that liberals promote unethical side of bioethics issues. A whole section where I'm the only person who can give a reason why abortion is immoral? Give me a break. Pathetic, really.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. The material is interesting, and Professor Latham was an awesome lecturer. Definitely worth getting up at 9am for.",
    "Absolutely take this course. The dense readings are very well worth this class. This is by far the most interesting class I've taken at Yale.",
    "Class is usually early so only take it if you know you will be able to make it every time--attending lecture is probably the most essential component of doing well. Reading isn't super necessary. Latham is awesome. Subject matter is great. Challenging, but by all means doable. Not a gut. IF DANNY IS TFing MAKE SURE YOU GET INTO HIS SECTION.",
    "You read a large bioethics textbook (which can be supremely boring - skip the discussion areas and just read the cases) and write a paper and take 2 tests, which are pretty straightforward if you go to lecture and read the cases. No specifics are asked of you. You will learn a lot about various bioethics issues of today, but I didn't find the lectures very stimulating, esp. if it's at 9am.",
    "I really loved this course. Professor Latham is an excellent lecturer, and you touch upon many interesting topics in the class. Even though the class is at 9 am, it's worth getting up for. You get everything you need out of the lectures. You basically don't have to do the readings, though they do help. The workload is light, and the lectures are really enjoyable. Take this class!",
    "Yes I would recommend it for someone looking for a fourth or fifth credit",
    "I recommend it, you won't regret waking up at 9 am",
    "Definitely take it!",
    "Great glass. Definitely worth waking up early for.",
    "If you're interested in law, yes. You use a casebook and get to learn about many fascinating cases involving bioethics. Workload consists of a short paper (5-7 pages), a midterm exam, and a final exam.",
    "Take this class! Even if it's at 9am, you'll want to go to this class. Professor Latham is a great lecturer, and the topics were really interesting and important.",
    "YES YES YES",
    "Could have been better than it was, but some of the topics were interesting and it wasn't much work.",
    "This is probably the best lecture (if not the best course overall) that I've ever taken at Yale. And the bonus is that you never have to read. Professor Latham is great, he's an amazing lecturer and keeps the lecture going every single class throughout the entire semester. I never got bored once. He's a captivating, compelling speaker and the topics he talks about are so controversial and yet so interesting that you can't get enough of this class. Only one midterm and one paper and a final, so not very hard class. Questions on the midterm and final are very broad, and you don't have to read to answer them correctly (just take notes in class and ask the TF for last year's final). If you do the reading though, it is also very interesting. In short, an absolutely fantastic class. It's at 9am though, which wasn't very good but the benefit of taking the class hugely outweighs the time it starts.",
    "Great class, interesting material with only a midterm, paper, and final.",
    "Amazing introduction to the complexities of the field of bioethics, taught by an expert who makes it all accessible and interesting. Readings are tough but Prof Latham breaks it down very well for you. Exams are interesting, too. Perfect amount of work.",
    "This was such an interesting and fun class. It was a lecture class and the discussions were a great time to fully grasp the concepts. I loved the topics we reviewed during the term, they apply so much in real life and it is honestly knowledge that is great to just know, even if you're not planning on going into Public health or political science. This was my absolute favorite class this term.Don't fall behind in the readings because it will hit you hard before the final but keep up with the cases and such. They are really interesting and so it's not a hassle at all but once you start, you want to keep learning. Take this class!Professor Latham is incredible. He is such a great speaker who doesn't need presentation slides or notes to talk for an hour and 15 minutes. It's all in his brain and just the fact that he can speak for that long without any reference at all and especially at 9am is incredible. He speaks clearly and concisely and attending the lecture is a must to grasp all the topics because Latham does a very good job at simplifying the reading in laymen's terms. Then when you do the reading later, you can fully comprehend everything because you already know the background.",
    "I would recommend it -- even if you aren't interested on the surface, the class will engage you and introduce you to a realm of law and politics you didn't know about. It is very applicable to modern day life.",
    "As long as you can wake up for class, it's a great lecture. Fascinating subject matter, a great professor, and dedicated TAs. Plus, you really don't need to do all of the reading--very little of it is ever covered in lecture, and the assessments are so open-ended that you never have to tease out specific facts from the reading if you don't want to. The lectures are invaluable; you'll find that you love them all. The readings can get boring.",
    "Take it if you're even remotely interested in these issues",
    "I would highly recommend this class. If you keep up with the readings and attend class regularly, you will learn a lot about interesting ethical issues in the legal system. Anyone interested in medicine, law, or public policy will thoroughly enjoy this class.",
    "Probably the best course I've taken at Yale so far. Each lecture was extremely interesting and relevant, and Professor Latham is an amazing lecturer. The workload is light: just a mid-term, a final, and a short paper. Definitely a must-take. It's totally worth waking up early to attend this class!",
    "YES",
    "Definitely take this course. I loved it! It was my favorite course of the semester and one of the best I have taken so far at Yale. Professor Latham is such a great professor and you really learn a lot about interesting topics that you may not have known a lot about before.",
    "This is a class on bioethics issues and their specific court cases. We also learned about the healthcare system, very useful information. I would recommend it because the information is so relevant and the class is very manageable!",
    "Good course, interesting topics not great readings.",
    "Bioethics and Law is a very great class! I took it credit\/d just because I wanted to attend Professor Latham's brilliant lectures, and I'm glad I did!",
    "Great class. Great lecture with Latham, would call this the perfect gut if it wasn't at 9 am. Still worth going to, and necessary to go to class for the exams. Super easy exams, easy essay. Very laid back class, and it's just a very interesting topic as well, taught by a very knowledgable and relatable professor. Definitely worth taking if you're even a bit interested in bioethics.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. As a freshman, this class was very useful in helping me think about my possible majors. The workload is not very heavy, but I learned so much useful information. The best class I've taken so far.",
    "Yes, take the class!! But try your best to do most of the readings because you'll get so much more out of the course, the sections, and will leave the class understanding things better and having stressed out less during midterm and final season.",
    "Take it!",
    "Bioethics in Law is a great course for anyone looking to understand controversies in Bioethics from a legal perspective. The course is not particularly hard as long as you take good notes in lecture (there are no slides or handouts) - tests are pretty much completely from lecture.",
    "I would certainly recommend this class - remember that the final is worth 50% of your grade.",
    "Professor Latham is a great lecturer, and all of the topics in the course are really interesting and extremely relevant to everyone (healthcare insurance, what your options are if you end up in a vegetative state or lose consciousness, what a doctor's duties to his\/her patients are, where the right to abortion comes from, what the stem cell research debate is all about, etc).The only frustrating aspect of the course is that all of the reading is from the casebook. Professor Latham lays out a ton of background and analysis in class which is extremely helpful and clear. The analysis in the casebook, on the other hand, is dry and frustrating to read, gives too much detail on specific background points so that it is hard to know what is important to get out of the reading apart from the cases themselves. The cases are pretty interesting to read and not too hard to understand. The real problem with the reading is that Professor Latham assigns a whole chapter of the casebook to cover 1-2 weeks of lecture, and there isn't any clear schedule of which cases he'll cover in which lecture.There is also an imbalance between the emphasis placed on background and analysis of general cases in lecture and the emphasis on remembering specific cases and legal details in section. This is partly the TA's fault (avoid Janine \"Alix\" Rogers), but it would be better if Professor Latham made it clear that there either is or is not an expectation to memorize specific cases and legal details to cite on the exams. From lecture and Professor Latham's comments and teaching emphasis, it seemed like he wasn't interested in students memorizing specific cases; from the grading of the midterm, it was clear that the TAs expected specific cases to be cited for every short answer.",
    "Only if you really like the material. Otherwise it'll be boring as all hell. Very easy.",
    "I loved this class so much! It was my favorite from this semester. Even though the lecture is at 9 am, every single one is worth going to. The lecture material is interesting, and Latham is a great lecturer. I'd recommend this to anyone if the title interests you. A great lecture class.",
    "It is a great overview of bioethics topics in a manageable class time.",
    "Fun and interesting course. 9am time is tough but manageable. Take it. you learn about so many new issues and arguments. Also, Professor Latham is one of the best lecturers at Yale.",
    "Interesting course on a subject matter you probably would never learn about other wise. I would recommend it.",
    "Take it!",
    "This is a great course for anyone even slightly interested in bioethics. It does not matter if you have had a background with case law, but an interest in law helps. You get the most out of the course by doing the readings--I'm glad I did. The material is dense, but I found that I looked forward to doing the readings each week. I would absolutely recommend this course! It's definitely one of my favorites!",
    "This is, no competition, the best class I've ever taken at Yale. I loved it. It was interesting content and professor Latham was such an interesting speaker. I definitely recommend it to any and all students. Don't be deterred by the time of the class.",
    "Fascinating subject matter. Worth erring up at 9 am!",
    "Yes absolutely if you have an interest in US healthcare.",
    "It teaches a lot about the healthcare system, which is applicable to anyone who might go to the doctor, so it is a useful course. It covers some somber topics though.",
    "yes",
    "Good course to take if you are interested in both p law and medicine.",
    "B&L is a great course with interesting material (if you like bioethics) and an impressive professor. Stephen Latham is a great lecturer and classes are fun to go to despite being at 9AM. If you're interested in Bioethics or Law and can wake up at 9AM then take this course.",
    "Very manageable and pretty interesting",
    "Take it if you have any interest in law or medicine.",
    "Definitely. Super interesting material with great lectures, 9AM or not.",
    "Take it",
    "One of the best courses I have taken at Yale. Definitely worth getting up at 9am for",
    "Overall, this is an excellent class, but especially so for premeds, as it perfectly describes many of the issues facing doctors and researchers. While is is a LOT of reading and writing, most of the book readings and links Prof. Latham posts are pretty interesting.My only concern with this course is that it you can clearly see the liberal slant on the discussions about access to healthcare and the ACA. However, I will qualify that by stating that Prof. Latham is otherwise very clear on the line between the facts and his personal feelings.On that topic, Prof. Latham is a wonderful professor. Not only does he speak clearly, he is well-versed his his field. Furthermore, outside of class he is very accommodating and helpful.I would heartily recommend this class to any fellow premends, or to anyone interested in medical law.",
    "Yes, this is stuff you should know.",
    "Absolutely fantastic class. In every way, one of the highlights of Yale academics. Professor Latham is brilliant, eloquent, extremely knowledgeable, and one of the best lecturers I have ever heard. The material is fascinating, engaging, and an absolute pleasure to learn. Furthermore, the legal and philosophical issues raised are fascinating to think, write, and debate about.Professor Latham's lectures were phenomenal without exception. He doesn't use power points, yet easily keeps students' attention on the strength of his speaking alone. Even at one hour and fifteen minutes, each lecture felt just the perfect length, rather than too long.The course primarily focuses on American legal jurisprudence regarding bioethics, starting with the oldest bioethics cases (such as establishing the right of a state to make vaccinations mandatory or the right of a patient to not have medical treatment given to them without their consent), covering almost every seminal bioethics case throughout American legal history (the famous ones like Roe v. Wade and Griswold v. Connecticut, but also many other equally important but less well known cases), and up to cases that are still being decided by Supreme Court today. The course covered issues including informed consent and the right to refuse medical treatment, the ethics of medical research, reproductive rights, organ donation, public health laws and rights, gene patenting, issues of justice and access to medicine (such as Health Insurance and the Affordable Care Act), and many others. Each was fascinating, and tremendously worthwhile.The textbook for the course is a law school case book that has very well edited versions of many seminal bioethics cases. The book gives plenty of context and makes the cases both easy and enjoyable to read. The book supplements the lectures well, diving in to more specific details than the lectures do, but the lectures also supplement the book well--Professor Latham adds very helpful context and insight to cases and issues the book coversOverall, you'll learn a tremendous amount about the important topics in bioethics and law, and also a good deal of information on the American legal system.Section is a substantial component of the class, and I very much enjoyed mine. My TA knew the material backwards and forwards, and often times had her own interesting additions and comments. Each section was a helpful time to clarify questions, discuss the lectures and the reading, and debate about the legal and ethical issues raised by the topics we were studying.The short paper gave every student a chance to explore any bioethics issue they wished, and was very enjoyable to write. A popular choice was to argue that one of the bioethics court cases was wrongly decided by the judges, but you can take the essay in just about any direction you want.The midterm and final each consisted of straightforward essay questions about the material, and were a pleasure to study for and take. If you know the material well and can make convincing arguments defending your views about bioethics issues, you'll do very well.I cannot recommend this course enough. Bioethics is a fantastic discipline, and this particular class is fabulous in every way. In a course where every aspect is so strong, it is difficult to pick the strongest, but I would have to say it was Professor Latham's teaching. If you shop even one lecture, you'll almost certainly be hooked. And if you're interested in law, medicine, public policy, or philosophy, or you simply want to learn more about a tremendously important and incredibly fascinating subject from one of Yale's best teachers, take this class.",
    "An overview of the legal issues regarding bioethical topics such as right to die, physician assisted suicide, informed consent, cloning, assisted reproduction, abortion, duty to treat, etc. Includes close study of several cases for each topic area. I would DEFINITELY recommend this course. Absolutely fascinating. Really surprisingly useful for pre-meds!",
    "YES!!! Such a light workload for immense payoff. These are some of the most important issues of our adult lives and the future.",
    "Professor Latham is phenomenal. Bioethics is a very relevant field, but even if you are marginally interested in law, healthcare, medicine, or ethics, TAKE this class just to have Professor Latham as your teacher. The course information is delivered through the lens of a law course, but the workload is very manageable as a fifth course. This is one of those classes that is truly rewarding- I am reconsidering my career plans and also bring up material frequently in dinner conversations. It's the whole package- take it!",
    "TAKE IT!!!!! The prrofessor is incredible an the topic is of concern to everyone.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course. The work load is completely manageable and the material is really interesting.",
    "Great class, interesting material, take it. Midterm, short paper, final. Don't underestimate the fact that this class is at 9am though. Even though waking up for class at 9 isn't hard, there were many days that most people, including myself, were zoning out or asleep. Just keep this in mind"
