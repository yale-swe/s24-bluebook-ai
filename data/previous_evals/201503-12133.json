   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this class to any student with any interest in US-China relations and gaining a better background regarding the current policies and economic trends in China.",
    "Very interesting and relevant course for everything that is going on in the marcoeconomy today. China is and will be a very important player in the global economy and everyone should have some working knowledge of the Chinese economy. I left the class with feeling that I have a much clearer idea of the Chinese economy and society. Not too much work for an econ credit. The midterm was very fair and the paper actually teaches you a lot.",
    "For any student, with or without substantial background on China, this course is a must take if you want to go into the international realm post-graduation. I'm sure some people might disagree with me, but China is such a growing influence on the world (both positively and negatively), and I think it's important to be armed with the knowledge behind how China's position in the world will affect our lives in the US and beyond. It's a great course that doesn't require a lot of technical knowledge, and lets anyone grasp some important current events issues as well. I would definitely recommend.",
    "I wouldn't recommend this course. Grading and assessments are way too vague. That said, if you're looking for a decent grade with little work, this is actually a good class for you. You could learn like 95% of the material by reading professor Roach's book.",
    "Exciting time to be studying China. Roach does a great job of synthesizing current events into his lectures. The economics portion is a bit dry, but even without much of an economics background you should still be able to get everything you need out of lecture.",
    "The class is very repetitive and easy. The readings are super interesting but sadly unnecessary. The class does not go into as much detail as one would hope. A survey course that will give you a good perspective on The Next China.",
    "A really great econ class that gets a bit repetitive. Pretty easy with low work requirements, but Roach is catching on to the gravy train and has started taking steps to make the class slightly harder. But would still recommend as a great econ elective.",
    "Solid choice for an ECON credit. Not especially econ heavy as in formulas and math, and the second half of the semester is more culturally oriented. Having taken a class in trade could be helpful. Overall, would suggest.",
    "Definitely would recommend this class to Econ majors.",
    "A class which looks at the current themes relating to the Chinese economic development. If you have no time to just be reading the Financial Times and want information presented better and elaborated on, then take this class. Workload isn't too bad, you can get away not doing some of the readings but make sure you're familiar with it because it would matter for section participation. One midterm, one final and one 15-page paper. Not too bad, really.",
    "If you want to learn about China's challenges and history then definitely take this class. The workload is so light but you learn so much. I was worried going in about my lack of economic background but it turned out to be totally fine and I learned so much practical economic concepts. I'm really glad I took this class",
    "This class was one of my favorites that I've taken at Yale so far. I find it so fascinating because of how practical it is. I've taken other econ classes in the past, such as Intermediate micro, and they've honestly been so abstract (and poorly taught) that I didn't enjoy them at all. This class has changed that impression of mine. Roach is a great lecturer who is very approachable. He is always willing to talk to students and answer your questions. The class is very fair in terms of the amount of work it has and the concepts you cover. I found it really cool how this class ties in public policy and economics together. It's a really fascinating topic and Roach has created a very comprehensive and well-thought out curriculum to explore it. In terms of work, you have to give one in-section presentation with a partner where you teach a topic for 25 minutes, you have to do readings every week, and you have to write a 15 page paper. There is also a midterm (pick 3 questions out of 5) and a final (pick 4 questions out of 6). I think this class was pretty great, so I definitely recommend. Also, one more thing, DON'T MISS LECTURE. GO TO LECTURE AND WRITE DOWN EVERYTHING HE SAYS. It makes reviewing for the final so much easier, since the slides have a lot of graphs.",
    "Might as well.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this to students from any and all majors interested in what is going in the world right now. Events in China are ongoing and extremely relevant to anything going on anywhere else, so this class is a great opportunity for you to educate yourself. Classic interesting big-lecture type class. The material is well-organized and the TAs were great. Given how this class seemed to work in previous semester (exam with notes, take-home final etc), this semester it seemed a little bit more rough than its reputation would predict. The work wasn't overwhelming but the midterm and final definitely required a significant amount of studying and effort and the paper took up a lot of time, so don't assume this will be your 5th gut class.",
    "Take it if you're interested in China and its modern history! Lectures can be a tiny bit dry but the subject material is truly fascinating. Professor Roach is so smart and a leading figure in the field. His enthusiasm for China is contagious. The workload isn't bad at all - writing midterm, 15 page paper, a pretty chill presentation in section, and a writing final. You will definitely learn a lot in this class, much of which is very relevant in current events!",
    "Take it take it take it!",
    "Take it. It's easy and incredibly informative.",
    "ok class. professor roach is like THE expert in the field but hes not the best lecturer. we basically learned how china has to switch to a consumer model every class which, believe it or not, got a little bit repetitive. some good info and i did learn a lot, but it got a little boring. also every section people have to give a 25 minute presentation on one of the assigned china topics which made section pretty much unbearable.",
    "Great class, interesting if you like econ\/China, relatively low work (though less of a gut than in previous years due to closed-book tests), and less repetitive than people say.",
    "Overall look at China's economic positives and negatives. Roach is a major player in how China should approach the future in China. Great person to learn from.",
    "Great class - I went in knowing nothing about China, which was very intimidating for the first couple weeks. By the end of the class I felt like I had a solid grasp on all of the key concepts. I really did learn a ton through this class. It was quite an enjoyable experience. Decent workload that depends on how much of the reading you do throughout the week. I learned a lot through writing the paper.",
    "Majoring in Economics and East Asian Studies (with a concentration in China) -- this course was really right up my alley. However, I think given the important role China will play in the coming years, understanding the country's economy is important for any student today. Professor Roach brings great knowledge and insight to the course's material. I would highly recommend this course to anyone looking to better understand China's economy and how it will affect the US in the coming years.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to a fellow STEM major looking to satisfy a social science credit and also learn more about China's economic structure and international relations. As a person of Chinese descent who also has very little econ background, I found this class both highly engaging and understandable. Very little work, and you gain an expansive knowledge coming out of the class.",
    "This course considers economics, history, politics, and environmental studies in parallel and complementary ways. The bulk of the course is decidely economics and history of China's development from 1949 onward, but the latter two became more essential to our understanding of China's development trajectory was the course progressed. I highly recommend this course.",
    "I would recommend it, but I would also say that you could get a lot out of shopping it, if you're not 100 percent sure that it's the class you want to take.",
    "Fantastic class! I recommend this to anyone. Professor Roach is incredibly knowledgable, and the material is fascinating! TAKE IT!",
    "Take it for a relatively chill econ credit, or if you don't know anything about China. If you are already knowledgeable about China, you may not learn that much.",
    "Overall, I would recommend this course to a fellow student. Although the class is very much based on Professor Roach's opinions, he is so knowledgable and an engaging lecturer. It was a topic that I didn't know much about and I enjoyed learning about it. With a midterm, discussion participation, a 15 page paper, and a final making up the final grade, the workload is not too bad. The paper is on a topic of your choice, which makes it manageable to write. There is a 25 minute presentation in section with a partner, but powerpoint makes that task super simple. Professor Roach posts all of the lecture slides which is nice come time to study for the midterm and final. There is really no need to do the readings because the exams come straight from the lecture slides.",
    "I would recommend this class. Its info is pertinent to today and the course does a great job of adapting to this. The class itself is not too difficult too. Great class.",
    "A decent course about China, but not necessarily the one I'd recommend to someone who wants an intro to Chinese history or even Chinese economics. Prof. Roach has one theory about China and he runs with it throughout the entire course China is changing and it will impact the economy and the politics of the country. Good for an Econ credit or as an intro to China",
    "If you know nothing about China, this class is a good choice. If you already have personal exposure to China or follow financial and political news coverage you are going to be terribly bored by Stephen Roach's lectures and could go the full semester without learning anything new. But then the exams should be fairly straightforward for you, and you could take this as an easy econ course.",
    "The Next China is a solid introduction to many issues related to China's economy, particularly in relation to the US. Take it to get a better understanding of the next biggest economy.",
    "Especially given recent news about the Chinese economy, this course is extremely relevant, and I would recommend it to anyone wanting to better understand China and its economy.",
    "ECON 338 is an introduction to the political and economic struggles of China. The course has a forward-looking focus. It centers on the question of what China will look like in the future. Definitely take the course if you are interested in China at all!",
    "My favorite class at yale!",
    "Where you learn about Old China and how it is transitioning to a new model while learning all about the political economic and social indicators pushing this change forward.",
    "An engaging course about the economy of China as it stands right now. I would recommend this course to any student, regardless of their background in economics or China.",
    "Introduction into China's economic development through the lens of political and policy changes. Great if you want to understand China's current challenges and policy initiatives to overcome them. Not a lot of work, but you do gain a lot of material. Worth the time for anyone interested in China economically. Professor Roach is a fantastic person to talk to inside and outside the classroom.",
    "Good class and very interesting but becomes super repetitive after a while because the theme of the class remains the same basically throughout the semester. Coursework is very chill but the final is no longer take-home which was kind of a bummer. Just a midterm, final, and paper make up the grade mainly",
    "Take it, it's a great course. Prof. Roach is a very good lecturer too. You learn what you need to know about China. Do the readings, they are really well chosen and you will learn much more if you do them.",
    "Not a gut so don't take it as one.",
    "If you're an econ major, definitely take it. If not, I would recommend it for anyone interested in China, obviously, and anyone interested in geopolitics. Work load is reasonable",
    "definitely harder than in previous years but a very interesting course if you don't know much about china. lots of readings, but you can get by without doing all of them. midterm, final, paper, presentation.",
    "Take this class. Very interesting and very easy. Professor Roach is one of those professors only Yale would have and you should definitely take advantage of it. The topic is relevant and the work is minimal. The most major assignment is the section presentation. Lectures are interesting and readings mostly supplementary.",
    "I would recommend taking this course if you think China might be important to know about in the future (take it).",
    "Very broad look at China's economic landscape that hammers home the same main points in each lecture. The material will feel repetitive at times, but it is an enjoyable class to take.",
    "Next China was a decent Econ course, but I've definitely taken much better courses at Yale. I thought the lectures were often dry, and the readings almost irrelevant -- they were barely discussed or referred to. I think I would have learnt just as much by simply reading Prof. Roach's op-eds and a couple of chapters from the book. I think this used to be a gut, but isn't really one anymore. I'd avoid it.",
    "Light workload where most assigned readings are not necessary to do well in the class, but are there if you are interested and have time. Lectures are okay with some being very dry and others quite insightful. You get out of this class what you choose to put in.",
    "Take this class. Really interesting and not a lot of work.",
    "I would recommend this course to everyone interested in China, despite how much they already know about China. I am from China but still find the content useful.",
