   "comments": [
    "Dean Hicks is going so this isn't so relevant.Good class. I felt like discussions were fragmented compared to other classes I've had where discussion flows really beautifully.",
    "Definitely take it. I mean, you can't, because Dean Hicks is leaving. But if it were possible, you should.",
    "Dean Hicks is the man. I still don't like Hawthorne, but I enjoyed every minute of that class.",
    "A seminar covering almost all of Hawthorne's works (all of the major ones). A great class, although without Hicks it is a toss-up.",
    "Yes, if you like Hawthorne. It's lots of Hawthorne though.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to any English major.",
    "This class would not be the same without Dean Hicks teaching it. That being said, he will no longer be at Yale starting next fall. =( So if this class is offered again, make sure you really like Hawthorne! Some of his later romances are a doozy.",
    "I absolutely recommend this class. You go so far beyond the Scarlet Letter into some of the best short stories I have ever studied as well as three of Hawthorne's other novels. The reading load is manageable, the course discussion is almost always fascinating, and Dean Hicks is one of the best professors I've ever had at Yale. Be prepared to spend a lot of time on your writing and to think very, very deeply every class period - this is by no means an easy class - but it's worth it.",
    "You read only works by Nathaniel Hawthorne; especially novels. It's a great way to learn about a single significant American author's work.",
    "Absolutely. Hawthorne is a great author, and the workload is fantastic. Without Dean Hicks, however, it won't be the same.",
    "Yes, get to know a great American author. There's more than The Scarlet Letter!",
    "It was a great course and gives you a nice in-depth look at Hawthorne. Also, Dean Hicks is a delight and it's a full experience of a class!",
    "I'd recommend it to an English major (especially one looking for an American lit course). If you're not an English major, you might not find it worthwhile to slog through some of the slower reading, or to spend a whole semester on one author with one unique style.Most people have only read the Scarlet Letter, and only in high school. It's definitely worth reading Hawthorne's other works, especially since if you read them all you get a sense of the arc of his literary thought and the continuity of themes in his work. I didn't particularly enjoy Hawthorne in high school and I enjoyed it here. Even if parts of the novels can be dense or boring, there are some moments that (especially upon rereading and in writing the paper) make it worthwhile.You have to do the reading, because it's a nearly two-hour seminar (and, this year, in the relatively early morning) and you can't stay focused for that long if you don't know what everyone's talking about."
