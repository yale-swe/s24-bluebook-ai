    "This class was ok, but more work and less reward than I had expected. There are 7 papers (3-5 pages each) and 7 books to read plus films to watch, so it's no insignificant amount of work. The syllabus was kind of weirdly designed, so that we had very little time to write our first papers and lots of time to write our later ones. The course was also not quite what I was expecting -- I wanted a general introduction to Muslim societies, and this turned out to be a lot more specific than that because the books we read were pretty narrowly focused. I definitely learned a lot about the region, but not the general history\/politics that I was looking for.Still, this class was pretty cool sometimes; Professor Erami showed us cool youtube videos and films from the countries. I wish that the class had been more like a seminar, because there was so much to discuss.I'm not sure if I'd recommend the class to someone else if it stayed the same, but if the syllabus changes, then it could be pretty cool.",
    "The books are excellent, and the material is fascinating and very important for Yale's overall set of knowledge granted on campus. However, the class itself was in a weird funk between being a seminar and a lecture. The optional section for non-WR students was confusing from the very beginning, and didn't become less confusing toward the end; I just stopped attending. Too many open-floor discussions \/ \"do you know's,\" and too few seamless lecture moments. Make sure Prof. Erami is clear about her expectations regarding section from the first day.",
    "At the end of the day, I'm glad I took this course. I learned a great deal about Muslim societies that I did not already know, and probably was not going to learn outside of this course. I am not an anthropology major, and the readings in this course helped to affirm that life decisions. I just did not connect to the way some of the books in this class present information. This is not a critique of the course so much as information to allow you to understand what you are signing up for. Lectures were not relevant to the grading. You are graded on 3-5 page papers on books you read in the course. You have a paper due every other week, so if you prefer continuous work over the course of a semester as opposed to hell weeks, this is a good course for you. The TAs and instructors are also very kind and willing to meet with students, so that's a plus.",
    "Muslim societies is a lot of reading and a lot of writing. It is basically a book a week and a paper the following week. Although there isn't a final, you need to stay on top of all the papers to not be swamped over reading period. The material is fascinating and incredibly eye opening. It definitely taught me to think differently about the world. The professor is well-versed and a joy to be with.",
    "I would recommend this class more for a writing credit than an anthropology class. That being said, I would definitely consider it if you are at all interested in the Middle East, anthropology, social theory, political science, Islam, etc. The readings are great in this course: I just wished the readings correlated to the lectures better. We also had some really cool films that we watched for class, which made the work seem less stressful. In addition, the guest lectures in class were wonderful. If you are interested in the areas of study I mentioned earlier, I would definitely take this course!",
    "do not take this class unless you are an anthropology major and think you need it as a credit, it is not a very comprehensive survey of the middle east, though you learn a little bit about each country the view is somewhat skewed\/biased and based solely on a single ethnography (most of which are poorly written). also, it involves a lot of writing whether you take it with a WR or not so if you're not good at writing essays quickly then you will suffer."
