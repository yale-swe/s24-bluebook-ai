    "Well - but wanted more clarity from the instructor as to which directions are more beneficial to take in addition the critical and analytical lense that the class provides.",
    "While we discussed interesting concepts, I did not feel like I walked away from the class with the types of clear ideas and points of knowledge regarding this topic I'd hoped to take with me into my career. Our discussions remained quite broad and vague throughout the semester, and we often reviewed what is not working, but never looked deeply into or were told definitely what may very well work. Without these aspects to our discussions, I don't feel a strong sense of clarity about how to go about addressing and tackling these challenges going forward in the way I'd hoped I would after taking the course.",
    "I believed that the class would include more information about best practices and not focus solely on a general understanding of the current system.",
    "Prior knowledge needed",
    "They definitely aligned to an extent, but I was hoping to get a lot more out this class."

   "comments": [
    "S: Really good at presenting. Clear and to the point W: Engage more in class discussions",
    "Strengths: field trips, and discussions with industry professionals; group discussions Weaknesses: debates (not enough time to prepare); reading reflections - questions were either too general or too specific",
    "Strengths: field trips were quite interesting and useful and I highly encourage this to be a continued facet of the course in the future. Weaknesses: Reid put the impetus on the students to lead discussions for more than half of the course, and this greatly took away from our opportunity to gain full and clear access to his wealth of knowledge on these topics, had he led the discussions more directly. Further, our debates were disorganized activities that did not encourage clear learning about the topics discussed. Lastly, we were inundated with far too much reading each week, which precluded us from being able to truly home in on the various topics discussed in the course. Less reading with greater specificity on topics and concepts would've enabled us to leave with a clearer understanding of the various topics.",
    "I really appreciated the discussion portion of the class. However, I do not believe we greatly benefited from having our peers lead the class. I think while it was a good attempt to have students teach the material to each other, it did not provide us the depth or nuance I was hoping to gain from the class.",
    "Strength are a lot of discussions and great facility visits"

   "question_text": "What advice would you give to a student considering taking this class?",
   "comments": [
    "It is very discussion intensive Dont expect clear answers or a recipe that teaches how to manage waste.",
    "If you are interested in understanding the intersection between waste management and circular economy and are interested in learning more in-depth about the challenges and opportunities in these two areas, you should take this class. In addition, you are able to practically apply the information you learn by visiting an MRF, an anaerobic digester, and a WTE facility. Although a lot of the course focuses on industrial processes, there is a discussion about the various industries including the electronics industry, fashion industry, and food industry.",
    "Discuss early on with Reid what topics are most important and would be most useful to you, as you work with him to create a course that incorporates these themes in clear and specific ways.",
    "It's good for a practical understanding of the space. It does not cover international issues or provide an in depth analysis of \"best\" practices for the field.",
    "Very based on discussions and your prior knowledge"
