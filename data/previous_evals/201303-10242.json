   "comments": [
    "Great for those who have taken high school calc and are looking for a chill math class. It has very interesting applications of calc to biology, so it's especially great if you're pre-med or just interested in bio! I can't stress enough how wonderful Michael Frame is. He has so much empathy for his students, and he cares so much about his subject, and teaching in general. He explains things very clearly in class, and he holds long office hours during which he'll walk you through tough pset problems or confusing concepts. I shopped this class on a whim, but I'm so glad I ended up taking it. Exams are open notes which is pretty much unheard of. Also, Frame always takes a break in the middle of lecture to tell these really cheesy jokes, which are only funny because he's saying them. (He thinks that 1h15min is too long to keep focus on math, and jokes are necessary).",
    "Definitely take MATH 116 over MATH 115 if you're planning on taking one of the two anyway (assuming 116 is still available in the future, which may not be the case considering Professor Frame may be done after this semester\/this year). I would definitely recommend the course to another student, although it probably wouldn't be of interest to anyone who doesn't need it to fill a requirement. Although as far as math classes go, it's the best. Also, the exams are open-note, so it's really to your advantage to take this course.",
    "Mathematics 116 is an amazing course. The material is interesting, the exams are open note, which means that they test your understanding of a concept and not your ability to memorize formulas, and most importantly, Professor Frame is fantastic! I would recommend this course to anyone who is interested in math or someone who wants to learn from a Professor whose passion is sharing his knowledge with students.",
    "Must take class just because of the Professor. A memorable experience even though the course material itself is pretty tough. \"If you all grew up to enjoy your work even just a tenth of how much I enjoy mine.. boy, you're in for a great life\" -- Michael Frame.",
    "Much better alternative to Math 115!",
    "If you're thinking about taking 115 but might not take 120, this is the class for you! Even if you are thinking about taking 120 later, you should probably take this class instead of 115. It's actually fun. You have to come to class at 9 am and be awake so you know what's going on, but you're rewarded by Professor Frame's jokes and by understanding math you've never seen before. I am not naturally good at math, but Professor Frame is such a good teacher that even those of us who aren't math geniuses get to see that math can be pretty.",
    "This class might never be offered again, but if Frame ever teaches a class again, you must take it! He is a delight as a teacher--kind, super helpful when answering questions, grades beyond fairly, and believes that students shouldn't have to memorize formulas you can look up on the internet (AKA midterm and final were open-note). The material was sometimes interesting, sometimes a little detached, but overall an excellent substitute for 115. Problem sets were very doable. The midterm was simple, but the final was definitely challenging.",
    "Take this class! Professor Frame is amazing and he does everything he can to make you understand the material. He lets you use notes on exams and posts practice questions with answers for each pset because he actually wants you to understand the concepts. There is no need to memorize formulas or theorems, it is more about learning how to approach the problems conceptually. It teaches you a really interesting way of teaching.",
    "If you like real life applications, take this instead of Math 115. It is amazing, and makes more sense.",
    "There were two aspects to this class: the assignments and assessments, and the concepts behind them. The former are doable, but the latter can get heady a lot of the time. Overall, though, the class was thought provoking and enjoyable. The professor is delightful. Take it.",
    "This is a nifty class that presents calculus with a biological science backdrop (mostly evolutionary biology). Take it if you want a low-stress single-variable calc class. As long as you pay attention in lecture, you really should have no reason to not do well. It is a 9am class but it's a class I looked forward to attending every morning (and I'm not a morning person). The p-sets are very doable, the typed-up course notes provide excellent review, and the midterm and final are open note. Also, Prof. Frame is, simply put, awesome.",
    "Math 116 is the best math option for a student in the Biological sciences.",
    "Math 116 01 was a good course, it was very interesting, but also quite difficult. The professor was very accessible and great, but the subject matter was tough.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class instead of Math 115. Professor Frame really cares about his students, and his lectures are very clear. The concepts are sometimes a little difficult to grasp in lecture however, so I would highly recommend going to office hours\/peer tutoring. The midterm and final are open note, but don't let that think it will be easy. These tests still require a lot of preparation and your notes are only helpful up to a point.",
    "Absolutely. You will not regret it. Math 116 is one of the best courses I have taken at Yale. The material is very cool, the class is very well organized, and Prof. Frame is the best teacher you will ever encounter. Take it!",
    "While this course is more applied than what I hear 115 is like, it is still pretty abstract. We learn how to model different populations but we never actually apply that model and think about what it means. I would still recommend this course over 115, though.",
    "115 for pre-meds",
    "Fun and interesting, at the same time, learning more about alternative viewpoints of math. Yes, because one would learn the essentials about Mathematics plus make sense of how various other subjects are interlinked with Mathematics, especially Biology.",
    "Take this class if you are pre-med and need to take calculus! Open-note tests, fair homeworks, a thoughtful and helpful professor, and interesting course material. I would definitely recommend it.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student.",
    "I would recommend this class to another student if they needed to take a calculus class but have already taken calc BC in high school and therefore don't want to take regular calc, but also aren't interested in taking multivariable.",
    "Yes, this class was excellent and I would definitely recommend it.",
    "Good alternative to MATH 115, but don't take it if you are at all shaky on algebra skills. Also, be prepared to go into office hours a lot, as I usually didn't understand the homework right away. As of now, I do not know where I stand in the class as we are given number grades but no grade distributions...",
    "Amazing class. Professor is both inspiring and extremely good at teaching what might otherwise be a complicated and unenjoyable class. Take it from me, I used to hate math, but this professor made everything fun and easy. Tests are open note too. All in all, It's really just a great course. Take it. It's awesome.",
    "A great class I would definitely recommend, Professor Frame is amazing and the subject is both interesting and not too difficult. Take it if you can!",
    "I highly recommend this class! The math you learn is not necessarily applicable, but it was a great way to fulfill the math pre-med requirement. Professor Frame is the sweetest and the most helpful professor you will have. He is really passionate about teaching. Even with cancer and other medical issues, he maintains his excitement in class and continues to teach!",
    "Math 116 is the best way to learn Single Variable Calculus of the 115-116 type. Unless you really love theoretical math and proofs, or you are a monster and hate the Bioscience (AKA LIFE), take this course. The workload is just enough to keep you on top of concepts, and the lectures are actually kind of fun. Fun math lectures, did you hear that? Every Yalie should experience Professor Michael Frame at least once. If you don't like math, 116 is the most painless and enjoyable way to learn some actually useful techniques and concepts. If you do like math, 116 gives you a base to start thinking with applications and reminds you what the point of learning Math is anyway. TAKE THIS COURSE.",
    "RECOMMEND YES",
    "If any student is interested in math, biology, or chaos theory, this course gets a recommendation. This course is definitely more interesting than Math 115.",
    "Yes, take it! Professor Frame is awesome! Go to the peer tutor if you need help at all though!",
    "A great alternative to 115 for bio majors. Professor Frame is great, the workload is light, and the material is relevant to those interested in biological sciences."
