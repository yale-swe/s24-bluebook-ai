The course is \"structured\" so well, there is no excuse to not tackle the homework material each week as suggested.",

    "Ben knew exactly how long each lecture was going to take, and when he knew a given lecture was going to be shorter, he would take that time at the top of class to discuss the rest of our experience here.",
    "Very generalized in going though each section in the book, but leaving room to still discover on the homework. Somethings were made more difficult this way and luckily our TA was always available to fill in those gaps. But if the TA were less available I feel like I may have missed some things.",
    "It was like clockwork. Class rarely ran long and was often due to questions and other investigations instigated by the class, only once by Ben.",
    "The instructor was always prepared for each session, but I did not always feel that we covered concepts in a way that either related to the homework, or related to the broader field of physics.",
    "Classes where we talked about real world applications were the most rewarding and helped to realize how what we were learning actually works.",
    "On some days with simple topics, the class seemed to be 5 to 15 minutes too long. On more complicated topics, it was just right however."

    "I didn't use it, but having the Structures hole as an option should never go away.",
    "The importance of and depth of the course material warrants the amount of work.",
    "It is a lot of work, but there is a lot to cover, and I feel much more fit to defend a structural design decision than ever before.",
    "More work than most classes, but expected and appropriate to the course.",
    "The workload is tough, but appropriate for the material. I also appreciate the two-week deadlines for homework.",
    "The amount of work was reasonable. Wish if the problems in the text book were more diverse and was organized better. It would've been helpful if it was noticed when the previous homework was needed to solve for the next assignment. ie. chapter 3.3 and 3.4.",
    "It's A LOT of hours hunched over the book. I suppose it's necessary, but it's something I'm not fond of. That's a personal problem though.... haha"

    "The tests are like going through a wringer but definitely require you to understand the material thoroughly.",
    "The exams usually did not contain material that was not taught in class, and stayed on-topic.",
    "Wish if it was more generous in grading about labeling...? Or a courtesy applied for the first test at least then warned in class when the test gets returned? It was a little bit harsh to lose 15 or more points on missing labeling R1 and R2 on the first test."

    "I didnt get to use the knowledge in my prod assignment yet but I am sure I will get to use it at some point",
    "Nobody needs to get injured or killed because a techinal director didn't take the time to run the structures of a beam or column. I can see that budgeting and structual design go hand in hand, which is crucial knowledge for a technical director or ATD in the beginning stages of production work.",
    "Not every production requires structural analysis, but when they do I feel more than prepared to use the material covered so far in real-world applications.",
    "I have not had to run structures on a production assignment yet.",
