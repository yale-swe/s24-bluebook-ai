    "I learned about inflammation and homeostasis. I gained knowledge of different causes of inflammation, the physiological purposes of inflammation, and the pathological consequences of inflammation. I learned the similarities and differences between inflammation and homeostasis by looking at the circuit view of systems and also the stock and flow models of the systems.",
    "This course helped me to get a grasp on the mechanisms and processes involved in inflammation. Dr. Medzhitov is a fantastic lecturer, and is very good at making complex biological concepts seem rather straightforward- he is a master of metaphors and many could learn from him when it comes to scientific communication.",
    "This course was engaging, fun, and creative. The course lectures were very in-depth and the assigned reading material was also insightful."
