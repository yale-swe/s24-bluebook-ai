   "comments": [
    "This class is not too demanding, is very interesting, and offers several unique skill sets such as learning to use modelling programs to better understand the future of the HIV epidemic.",
    "This has been one of the best classes I've taken so far. If you truly are interested in learning more about all of the different issues and arguments about HIV\/AIDS today, take this class because you learn so much from the readings and Professor Nattrass. Assignments aren't too difficult, and there are a lot of readings, but it's rewarding because all of it helps you to better understand and grasp the complexities confronting AIDS activists and legislators today.",
    "The Political Economy of AIDS in Africa deals very little with political economy, but is nonetheless an excellent overview of AIDS in the hyperepidemic African countries, particularly South Africa. If this sounds intriguing and you're up for a few big papers, go for it. And do the reading--there's little grade-related incentive, but absolutely worth it.",
    "i would definitely recommend this class if you have an interest. Prof. Nattrass is great, and you get a lot of flexibility to focus on the topics you're really interested in. You'll get as much out of this class as you put in. The final paper was definitely a lot of work, but it's worth it if you put in the time\/energy because you can really learn about epidemiological modeling in a way that I think few other courses offer.",
    "I think I would recommend this course. I found the topic very interesting and it's very laid back. There was more of an emphasis on quantitative modeling than I would have liked, but overall I think I enjoyed the class.",
    "If you are interested in AIDS in Africa, take this course. Prof. Nattrass is a leader in her field and incredibly interesting.",
    "Take it if you want to learn how the advocacy of ARVs in South Africa has progressed.",
    "This is an excellent course. It is a little more number heavy than most poli sci courses, but this was a welcome change. There wasn't as much on \"political economy\" as I would have expected though.",
    "A great course to take if you would like to learn more about all aspects of HIV\/AIDS including modeling, treatment, prevention, government leadership, funding etc.",
    "Take this class! If you are interested in Global Health, or have done work abroad this is a great class. Nattrass is a great seminar leader - you will find her a refreshing professor. She is less interested in how people speak, or how she expresses something, but is genuinely interested in people's ideas. You will learn a lot doing the papers, also. THe readings are really interested - especially the book review that we did.",
    "Great class if you are interested in AIDS epidemic or African health studies. The class puts an unusual focus on modeling, which is difficut but a great skill to have if you are interested in pursuing epidemiology or public health academically. The class is not overly stressfull in terms of workload and the seminars are alwasys engaging.",
    "Take it."
