   "comments": [
    "The first half of the course is about protein structure, crystallography, and structure-based drug design. It is very hands-on, with several class meetings dedicated to learning how to use Swiss PDB to look at protein crystal structures.The second half the course is about how potential new drugs are tested, approved, monitored, brought to market, etc. It is entirely lecture based.Assignments consist of a short presentation after the first half of the course, and a final paper at the end of the course.",
    "I would certainly recommend this class.",
    "A good overview of the steps between identifying a target to design and approval of a therapeutic agent.I would recommend this class as I found it very interesting.",
    "I would describe this course as a useful course that exposes you to many different aspects and job possibilities relevant to investigative medicine.",
    "Really worthwhile course. Useful and intellectually scintillating.",
    "This is a very chill class that exposes you to the basics of molecular drug design and human trials. The class remains interesting throughout the semester and the workload is more about attendance and learning from people who have a lot of experience in their fields than about little assignments."

    "I learned how to use Swiss PDB, which was very helpful. I think pymol might have been more practical, but I think I could use Swiss PDB for any future protein-structure work I might do, or if not, I think I learned enough from experimenting with Swiss PDB that I could figure out the basics in pymol.I also learned a little more about the process of drug testing and approval, which will be very useful in the long run, since I would eventually like to apply my research by looking for potential new therapeutics.",
    "I had never had an opportunity to learn about FDA regulations surrounding drugs and similar topics before, so this was a great overview and introduction to the topic.",
    "I am working on an entrepreneurial project in which we are trying to design a therapeutic for a skin disease. Thisclass was very relevant and helpful for me for this reason. I really benefitted from learning the structure software, and really benefitted from being present at an HIC meeting.",
    "This was my first class investigative medicine class and I felt that it really gave me a solid overview of how things like the FDA works. I am an undergraduate, so this does not affect my dissertation. However, I can see this becoming helpful in my research in the future. My lab currently isn't biochemical enough to use the modeling programs, but it was fun to play around with some of the proteins we use."
