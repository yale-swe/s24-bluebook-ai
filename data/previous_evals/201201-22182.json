    "Pretty much what it says on the tin. An insanely difficult class, so I wouldn't recommend it to anyone who doesn't have to take it and doesn't love math.",
    "Hard and interesting math class.",
    "This class is INCREDIBLY difficult and I would only recommend it if, like it was for me, it's a requirement for your major (i.e. you're an engineering major of some sorts). The exams are ridiculously hard, and even though they're curved, it's still a punch in the gut every time you walk out knowing you got less than half the exam correct. The problem sets take an ungodly number of hours and you're pretty much guaranteed not to know how to do some of it, so you'll probably need to spend lots of time in a tutor's office hours if you want to get good grades on them (and after those exams, you are DEFINITELY going to want good homework grades).",
    "Diff EQ is not a 'fun' class and I can't imagine a reason to take it other than for a pre-rec, however, this is taught so well that I found the class as a whole very enjoyable. The problem sets take a while and are very difficult but working in groups make them manageable and sometimes even fun. Overall the material isn't that difficult, but it is a new technique followed by hours of really gross algebra.",
    "A decent class in getting you better at being able to learn math just because it is fairly high level. Problem sets can be tedious. Class is way to theory based as are most Yale math classes.A requirement.",
    "This is a really hard course. I honestly wouldn't recommend it to someone who wasn't interested in engineering or applied sciences. That said, it's a very valuable course that explainshow the world works in a lot of fundamental ways. Learning how to model with differential equations, then solve them, is a really valuable skill and I'm glad I took this course, despite the fact that it was far and away the hardest class I've taken in my life.",
    "Take it if you need to; you'll learn a lot of fundamental stuff that you'll encounter later on if you're in engineering or physics.",
    "This is not one of those math classes that will fill you with awe over the beauty of the concepts (or at least not until the very end of the course). This class is about learning and practicing method after method after method for solving differential equations. Take this course if you want to know these techniques and if you aren't afraid of being overworked.",
    "Yes, well taught course and very organized.",
    "Differential Equations sometimes really suck. That said, the best way to get through this class is with the Ahn\/Herdiech team. Ahn is a solid lecturer. Matt mentioned this might be his last time TFing, which is a real bummer if it's true.",
    "This class is really difficult, and don't take it if you don't have to!",
    "This class is hard just like any other math class. The tests are really hard and have a lot of conceptual stuff. Don't take it if you don't have to.",
    "Its a solid class, not too hard and fairly interesting. Charles Ahn is a great guy and a good lecturer so take it with him if you can.",
    "If you have to take this as a prerequisite for your major, take it with Professor Ahn. He's really nice and teaches the material in the most engaging way possible. Even if you've had Diff. Eq before, it will be a difficult course at times, but again, as long as you get Ahn, the course is great.",
    "Take this class with Charles Ahn! I've heard horrible things about DiffEq from people who had other professors, but Ahn made this class very understandable and will go as slow as you need and is very open to questions.",
    "The lectures are very easy to follow and understand if you pay attention. The problem sets take a really long time to do, and you probably won't absorb any information if you don't do them, but the material is super interesting and relevant, especially if you're interested in physics.",
    "It's a hard class. It cover's a lot of material and be prepared to spend many hours on the problem sets. Going to the TA's review sessions helped me get through the class.",
    "ENAS 194 is a good course on diff eq, and the textbook is good too. Diff Eq is a cool branch of math if you're into that kind of stuff. The problem sets are pretty easy, but the tests are HARD. Do not go into them unprepared. But, if you fully grasp the material you should be fine, just don't leave any questions unanswered before walking into a test or it could come back to bite you.",
    "Don't take it unless required",
    "This class is great. It's really interesting (especially if you're into engineering). Seriously take this class.",
    "tough class and lots of work. would not recommended it for someone that did not need it for their major.",
    "Differential equations and how to solve them.Professor Ahn likes to set questions that make you think, so you have to be well prepared on the material to know how to apply it.",
    "Interesting lectures, good readings, reasonable exams, fairly high workload",
    "I would recommend it as a serious math class that will get someone proficient at basic differential equations techniques. It is very well geared towards science\/engineering students. I would warn people that the exams are difficult.",
    "Ehh my sole advice to students considering taking this class would be to avoid (at all costs) taking it with Professor DObbins. Take it with Ahn -- he's SOO much better. Make friends in the class to check your answers\/commiserate with. It's a hard class, but you have to take it.",
    "I would recommend this class it is interesting and not too difficult. The midterms are definitely hard and the problems set take time; but you definitely learn a lot.",
    "I think this was a great introduction to Differential Equations. The material was presented in an effective way and the problem sets were incredibly challenging but helpful. It's a difficult course that takes a lot of time, but you are learning a lot!",
    "Even if you don't have to, you really ought to consider taking this class. Professor Ahn is an excellent professor with exceptional teaching abilities, and I learned so much about math and its applications. He is a very approachable person, and he understands how to best teach the material in interesting ways. Go to the weekly review sessions if they are offered; they help tremendously. The weekly problem sets take many, many hours. They can be pretty frustrating at times, but they will help prepare for the two midterms and the final. The tests are challenging but fair.",
    "This is a good class, especially with Charles Ahn teaching it - he was a very clear lecturer. It just covers a huge amount of material very quickly, and I sometimes felt like the material took a while to sink in - I'd struggle on a pset but then understand the concept better when I went to study for an exam. So, some parts of the course are sort of a struggle, but looking back on it now, it's a good feeling because I know I learned a ton. The psets are long and the exams are hard, so it's a lot of work, but if you want to take a higher level math class, this is a good one to choose.",
    "Difficult material but Prof. Ahn is a good teacher and his tests are fair.",
    "This is a class for people who want to work hard and are interested in understanding the fundamentals behind a great deal of science. I would recommend this class if you want a good understanding of dif eq.",
    "A comprehensive study of ODE's and PDE's. It's a very challenging course but very useful for engineers and scientists.",
    "This class is good when taken with Professor Ahn. It teaches the primary methods of differential equation solving. It doesn't spend time delving into the theory of the methods, though, so one might consider taking the math department's version of the course.Overall, the methods are pretty straightforward and of the plug-and-chug nature. As such, Professor Ahn added \"challenge\" questions at the ends of the two midterms. These questions weren't really difficult in the sense of testing one's ability to extend his knowledge of differential equations; they really just involved messing around with calculus and algebra to demonstrate some relation. They weren't unmanageably difficult, but they also weren't really relevant to the course. One of the questions was also written incorrectly. It's good that the challenge questions were included to separate the class, but they should have actually been relevant to the material.",
    "If you are required to take DiffEq, this class may be a good option. Lectures focus on theory and help sessions on problem solving. Psets are very time consuming, and exams require insight beyond mere mastery of the concepts. However, the things you learn are extremely useful for many fields. I appreciated the focus on real-world applications. With work, it is definitely possible to do well in this class. Definitely attend the weekly help sessions!",
    "I would recommend this class. It is very useful to know how to describe anything with a differential equation. If you take the time to go to class and learn the processes it will not be very difficult. The grading is very fair and tons of partial credit is given.",
    "13 Homeworks taking appr. 5-12 hrs\/wk.2 Midterms (1st - 5\/10 in difficulty, 2nd - 7.5\/10)Final (7\/10, special emphasis on final few chapters not covered by either midterm)A very comprehensive class, you'll learn all the math you need for certain sciences. Ahn is a great teacher, I'd wait to take the class until he's teaching.",
    "I highly recommend this course to other students who are passionate about learning differential equations. It's time consuming, but you will learn so much thing at the end of the semester.",
    "My best advice: if you're going to take ENAS 194, do not take it with organic chemistry or any other work-intensive science class. It will be too much. This class is a ton of work, and for the amount of effort I put into it, it was not worth it. In fact, it's making me reconsider whether I want to be an engineering major. So think long and think hard before you choose to take this class. That said, Professor Ahn is pretty awesome, and he did introduce some important applications.",
    "This is a hard course. Probably the hardest course for any engineering major here at Yale. The midterms and final were hard. It does teach you diffeq well though.",
    "This class is great and introduces you to lots of techniques. It's also a great exercise for your brain. I'd suggest it even if you're not a math or science major (I'm not) just because it keeps your mind on its feet and it's a good continuation from multivariable. Professor Ahn is also a great teacher who explains the material super well and Matt (the TA) makes the material really clear in section and review sessions.",
    "If you need to take it, take it and prepare to put in a lot of time. Go to review sessions.",
    "It's super hard and takes a lot of work but if you actually read the textbook and study your notes you will be fine. Chances are you have to take this anyway because of your major. You will survive!",
    "Take it if you have to. Otherwise dont",
    "The class was very well taught. Professor Ahn went at a very good pace, and was always very clear in his lectures. The problem sets were fair and he had a great sense of humor and always gave applications to the material that made the material worth learning for an engineering student. I enjoyed the course!",
    "Decent enough class, take it with Prof. Ahn if it's required for your major. Tests are hard. Fairly standard intro math\/engineering course.",
    "Unlike me, if you're taking this class, you probably need it for your engineering or science major. And if you take it with Professor Ahn, don't worry, it won't be that bad. Professor Ahn is great at explaining the material and relating it to real-world examples. He's clear and isn't afraid to do multiple examples if necessary. The material can also be interesting too! Matt is also an amazing TA with great review sessions, but I've heard that he won't be helping with the class any longer, unfortunately.Problem sets are, as you would expect, long (probably around 7-10 hours per week). Midterms and finals are hard but the curve this year was generous (about 40% got A or A-, and 80% got a B- or higher).",
    "ENAS 194 is a tough yet rewarding class. Professor Ahn is definitely the one take it with over the teacher who teaches it in the fall. The class is very time consuming but you will feel like you are actually learning something from the problem sets. Definitely go to the review sessions that Matt holds every week. His help was extremely valuable!",
    "ENAS 194 is a challenging but manageable class if given sufficient attention. It is definitely a class for engineering majors and really shouldn't be taken unless it is a requirement, but that is not to say that it isn't useful. It just wouldn't make sense to take if you weren't pursuing an engineering degree.",
    "Take it if you want to get a good ground on differential equations. It covers a lot of topics and prepares you quite thoroughly for higher course mathematics. But rememeber that this course is, as a usual engineering class is, calculation-based rather than proof-based. For those who prefer pure math, the general process of the class might seem to lack something profound.",
    "Yea, definitely recommend it. The sections are EXTREMELY helpful. Problem sets are pretty difficult, but manageable. Try to start them before the last night",
    "Its a good math class, not hard, just work, just as math is.",
    "ENAS 194 is the first decent math class I've taken at Yale. I've had enough of irresponsible professors and incompetent TAs, but this class really impressed me. If you're taking this class, I assume you need it for your major. Then take it with Prof. Ahn. He is extremely organized and easy to follow. His lectures are clear, and not a word-for-word repetition of the textbook. The material we covered in class was actually useful and applicable to my other science classes. Prof. Ahn kept a good pace throughout the semester and assigned problem sets that prepared us well for the exams. The exams were also fair, a good balance between easy questions and challenging ones. The problem sets were somewhat time-consuming, but if you understand everything in the homework, there's no way you can do badly on an exam. Matt is also a great TA. Go to section with him. They help too.",
    "This class is not as hard as many would like you to believe. If you want to major in engineering, do not let this class stop you from doing it. Even if you are not engineering major, but wants to learn about Diff-EQ, this is still a significantly better class than its MATH 246\/247 counterpart.",
    "Diff eq is a difficult but rewarding course. The homework takes a while to complete (ranging from 3 to 12 hours), and this really helps drill the material. The exams are very fair. The midterms are usually 6 questions, 5 very straightforward ones and a 'challenge' type question. The final was not bad, there were 9 questions, and none of them were the 'challenge' type from the midterms. The curve is amazing, in case grading is a top priority for you. Overall, I would definitely recommend this (though you'd only be debating if it's not required for your major). The workload feels rough, but the amount you learn is astounding.",
    "I liked this class. Didn't move through material too quickly. Problem sets became very long and tedious during the section on series solutions. Professor Ahn is the best, a much better lecturer than Professor Dobbins (who guest lectured for us a couple times) and he rarely skips steps when working problems on the board. Also, Matt is the best TA. Period.",
    "ENAS 194 is a really, dare I say it, fun, math class. There isn't a ton of theory, which I personally REALLY enjoyed. The application problems are pretty neat, and if you're taking PHYS 201 at the same time, some of the concepts overlap, which is a neat way to see how the math is more applied, and how the physics is derived, ect.Problem sets can be long and frustrating at times, especially some of the more abstract questions towards the end that often require proving theories\/ideas we haven't really covered in class. Most of the answers can be found in the books, and the weekly review session from Matt are awesome. Its apparently his last year TAing, so I don't know how next years review sessions will be like.I would note that the quality of this class is probably very dependent on the professor. Prof. Ahn was a great professor, so I would def. recommend taking it with him. As for other professors, double check the course reviews. I heard Fall semester's 194 class was terrible.",
    "Differential equations are a must for any aspiring engineer or scientist. This class taught me more than most classes at Yale. A lot of material is occurred but every bit of it is useful. It is time consuming but if you have a good group to solve problem sets with it can even be fun! One of three exams was very difficult and alittle discouraging but it was difficult for everyone. Professor Ahn led a great class and always tried to get you more interested in science. Highly recommend for any engineer\/scientist.",
    "This isn't a course with a lot of theory. If you are looking for a math course where you solve problems, this one's great. Other than that there's nothing much else to say besides go to the review sessions. They're basically like mini lectures where the TA's present the material in a way that's easier to understand. But overall, fun class. Because I like solving problems.",
    "Certainly not an easy class, but it won't break your back either. Probably the most useful math class I've taken, since I took it concurrently with physics, a subject rife with differential equations. I feel like I learned techniques in the class that I will never forget, and I am excited about that. Then again, I'm an engineering major, so those feelings might not apply to everyone else.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course, it is required and a great class",
    "this class kinda sucked. if you're a math whiz, its not gonna be that bad but otherwise it takes a lot of time to do the weekly psets. professor ahn is pretty good but its hard to be engaged at 9 in the morning. the tests can also be really hard. i would definitely not recommend this class unless its a prereq or you really want to learn the material",
    "It is a required course, so if you need to take it, then you have to. Otherwise, I would not recommend taking this course.",
    "This is an okay introduction to ordinary and partial difeq. The pacing of the course could be improved; we would move extremely quickly for a few weeks, and then would cover almost nothing in the day that we covered applications. This course would not be worth taking without the TA Matt's review session.",
    "It's tough, be ready to work. It takes a lot to understand how to do a problem, much more to understand why you're doing it.",
    "One of the better math classes at Yale. Interesting subject material, but some problem sets\/tests can have the tendency of blowing up in your face. Painful to wake up for at 9:00am, especially if someone else is subbing for Ahn, but I would recommend it.",
    "The course is basic differential equations, with all the emphasis on applications and none on understanding what you are doing. The lectures are as dry as a standard Yale math class, but Ahn speaks in clear, understandable English. The exams are fair and not too difficult - generally four problems mirroring the problem set, and one slightly more difficult proof based one. The problem sets themselves are straightforward but tedious, and generally far harder and more complicated than the exams. The class is far easier than the math department offering, both in work and in competition, so unless you really enjoy understanding the theory behind differential equations, this is a superior way to gain a basic understanding of the topic.",
    "Exactly what you expect from an introductory differential equations course \u0096 take it if you need for your major."
