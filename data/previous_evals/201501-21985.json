   "comments": [
    "I would absolutely recommend this class. Try and take it with an actual professor rather than a graduate student.",
    "English 127 is not a survey course but rather a comparative study of various works in American Lit. We would read the works and some criticism and discuss . I would recommend the course because it really helps with writing. English 127 is less prominent at Yale, so the pressure is lower to do well (for me, at least). You get a really personal experience and each prof makes the syllabus their own.",
    "An overview of American literature. I would recommend it, but not necessarily for Non-English majors.",
    "Yes, especially if you have not read much American Lit. in a while. I am not a huge fan of nonnarrative poetry, but a) it nonetheless provides much insight into the history of the United States (and often the world), and b) the novels and short stories that we read were masterpieces (Moby Dick, Nabokov's Pale Fire, the short stories of Flannery O'Connor and Sherwood Anderson). From what I have heard from other sections as well, there is a high expectation for the level of writing in this class (I have taken other English classes not limited to freshmen and found this to be the case), so be prepared for that, but do not discount the amazing works that are covered and the discussions you will have about them.",
    "Its good course and depends largely on your teacher. Palmer is solid. I took it because I thought there were some things that I just needed to read, and now I have read them.",
    "With Palmer Rampell, ENGL 127 was a great experience. The books were perhaps daunting to begin with (ever read Moby Dick? You will...) for a non-humanities person such as myself, but I was surprised by how much I enjoyed it. Class discussions were actually enjoyable and thoughtful (although I'm sure that depends on the group of people you take the class with) and were very well-led. The workload is primarily a whole lot of reading, which I found to be fun but which can definitely take up a good chunk of your time -- but on the flip side, there's not a huge amount of writing \/ other assignments required. If you get the chance to take this class with this professor, absolutely do it!!",
    "You take a chronological approach to American lit slightly outside of the canon. Poetry, fiction, graphic novel, nonfiction. There are three papers, you can do a revision. Totally manageable and the reading is great. Except Moby Dick."
