    "I thought Dea tried her best but the way the class is set up made it not only hard to learn but not relevant to anything the students in the class are interested in. Most of us are interested in the actual application and not the theory behind it. I still don't feel comfortable in the field.",
    "This course was challenging primarily because the explanations we received during lecture did not prepare us for homework. We were given the theory behind the formulas in class and did not clearly learn to apply them in R, which made homework incredibly challenging.",
    "While the instructor was enthusiastic, and did the best she could with the material, the course itself was far too theoretical to be very useful to anyone who wants to plan sampling or inventory in the field.",
    "I felt that this course revolved too much on the syntax of R code instead of understanding sampling methodology.",
    "I was very frustrated with this course overall and feel that it was not an effective use of my time. Going into the course, I was very excited to learn about the topic and felt it is an integral part of the career I am pursuing in forestry. I now feel frustrated, because honestly feel like if the information was taught more effectively, I would have a much better understanding of the subject matter. I am not where I would like to be professionally regarding the subject, and will probably have to teach myself. While I feel like I walked away from the course having met a few goals, overall I feel that it was taught very poorly. The presentations themselves provided information but no context, and slides full of nothing but font and algebra, making a conceptual understanding of the material very difficult for me. I felt that clarifying questions that students asked were often not answered effectively due to lack of knowledge from the professor, or misunderstandings about the question. While certainly not the professor's fault, there was an apparent language barrier that made asking questions and getting adequate responses very difficult. However, the midterm exam we received asked questions that I did not feel properly equipped to answer, and didn't know where to find the information. In a school with as high caliber of a reputation at Yale, I did not expect to have this kind of experience. Honestly, I think this is not inherently the professor's fault, but a more systemic problem in the course material."

    "A very useful, practical course with a good overview of techniques and the related statistical theory. Prof. Bittencourt Moreira gave",
    "I enjoyed the final project, which was field-based.",
    "The final project because it involved applying what we learned throughout the semester.",
    "The take-home problem sets were useful, in that we could apply equations from the text book or slides. Running these problems in R was probably the most useful part of the course. The final project where we conducted and analyzed a forest inventory was also very useful. I also found the textbook useful, and the slides useful for problem sets."

   "comments": [
    "Using more real world application would be helpful.",
    "This is a tough question. All semester I wrestled with the speed of the course. I rarely if ever gained anything from lectures other than a few key phrases to help navigate re-reading, study and homework, and I did attend all but one lecture. On the other hand, there is a need to cover the topics we covered, so a conundrum remains. The course would have benefited from a TF and\/or recitation sessions. Prof. Bittencourt Moreira gave generously of her time by e-mail and office visit, and this was a great aid to learning in the course. One-on-one, she is a great at explaining statistics and \"R\" (computer language). Also helpful were the work sessions she occasionally ran in class. Perhaps a problem to prepare before each class? Post the lecture notes and slides earlier, at least 24 hours before each class, and even that is cutting it close.",
    "The subject matter needs to be more relevant to student needs. There should be much more focus on how to properly design an inventory to collect real data out in the field.",
    "The course needs to be taught more effectively. I do not think that slide after slide of nothing but white and font, and equations, is an adequate teaching method. There need to be more in-class exercises where we work through problems and understand concepts. There also need to be more opportunities to apply the information we are learning. If we had a practical problem set, that required us to look at forest mensuration data and apply the equations, for each of the major sections (both in class and at home) I think I would have learned a lot more. I also think that with material such as this it is integral to actually get into the field and apply. Or, if not actually getting out into the field, then at least having concrete examples of when you would apply different things."
