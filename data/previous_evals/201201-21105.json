   "comments": [
    "This was a documents reading course, geared specifically toward the Sorobun documents of the Edo period. Although the topic may sound very specific and technical, it has useful implications for anyone who is interested in reading primary source materials in somewhat later periods as well. As for course assignments, it was nice not to have a long final paper, but the workload was very intensive at certain points during the semester, especially during the week of the three-day symposium.",
    "I would recommend History 890 01 to any doctoral student of Japan history (or related field), as well as a graduate student with an advanced background in Japanese language. Due to the language requirements and specialized training provided in this seminar, I would guess that course enrollment will never be extremely large, but for those students with interest and need, it will be one of the most important courses they take."

   "comments": [
    "This course was a very helpful introduction to the reading of Sorobun documents. The language\/reading\/translation skills provided a good foundation for me to build upon, as I go on to research primary source materials for my dissertation. It also allowed me the chance to obtain important contacts with Japanese scholars, which will be useful for future field research in Japan.",
    "This course was extremely important for building the skills I will need to both conduct research and write my dissertation. Many of the documents and themes were also specifically related to important collections held at Yale, and at times, even chosen to compliment my own research interests. It was a course that gave me both the sense of how privileged I am to study here at Yale, and how privileged I am to study under one of the very best scholars in the field."
