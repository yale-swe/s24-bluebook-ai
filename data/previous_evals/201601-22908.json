    "It is a fantastic, informative and important course taught by a funny, informed, passionate BAD ASS professor.",
    "This is a survey of Islamic political thought with regard to the state and to a lesser extent democracy. I would recommend it to anybody interested in Islamic societies.",
    "This course looks at Islamic political theorists from the 19th century into the 21st century, and the guiding question that forms the core of the course is about the relationship (and its history) between Islam and democracy. Pretty much anyone who studies a whole range of things - political theory, law, global affairs, political science, religious studies, Islamic studies - could significantly benefit from this course. Also, because Professor March is amazing, I would take anything he offers in the future, even if it's not this class.",
    "Only if they were interested in Islam and politics."
