   "question_text": "What knowledge, skills, and insights did you develop by taking this course?",
   "comments": [
    "Global 306 is the second half of the Social Enterprises course series. Bo works closely with students during their second semester to flesh out an original case study and teaching note. You learn quite a bit about case writing and pedagogy.",
    "Case writing skills, also incredible exercise in intense teamwork",
    "Not really any new insights compared to last semester.",
    "Case writing and team work",
    "I learned valuable skills about how social enterprises and nonprofits operate and function, especially in the context of the African continent. I learned to work with a team for an extended period of time and on various levels (academic, professional, personal, etc.). I gained cultural knowledge on the country of Malawi and Africa as a whole. My specific project concerned public health, so I gained a greater understanding of public health development projects too.",
    "I learned how to write a full-length case study (25 pages single spaced) based around my time in Tunis the summer before. Our team elected to put our case into a web format, so we learned how to create that as well, in addition to how to write a teaching note to accompany a case study. I've also just learned such an unbelievable amount about financial inclusion in the MENA region as well as key topics of consideration within the social enterprise sphere. I really appreciated having this class as a follow-up to my summer experience, as that forced me to reflect deeply on key takeaways and produce a final deliverable that I was proud of.",
    "This semester of the course was mostly geared towards working on our case study and other deliverables. We discussed how to apply the broad concepts from last semester to our specific clients from the summer. We worked to formulate a \"case study\" from our experiences and a \"teaching note\" that outlined how best to \"teach\" our case study in a classroom setting. Finally, we completed work for our summer host--though this seemed to vary by group because some had a lot of work over the summer and some had very little."

  {
   "question_id": "YC403",
   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths-- how approachable and supportive Bo is! Weaknesses-- a semester is a long time to work on our cases. We need most of that time to actually complete our cases but I would love a couple weeks of other instruction.",
    "Opportunity to finalize the case study based on summer's research\/internship.",
    "There was not very much direction in this course. The format made it hard to feel like we were ever making progress on our case. Each week we usually came back with a reworked case draft, but I often felt like we just wound up having the same conversations with Bo over and over. I could never tell how satisfied he was with our work, and it was nearly impossible to get a read on whether we were moving in the right direction. It is an excellent opportunity to work independently on your writing and teamwork skills, but I think clearer class objectives and more directed input from the professor would have been helpful.",
    "The summer opportunity was wonderful (and paid for through Yale fellowships!!). It was really valuable to develop such wonderful teamwork skills, and Bo facilitated very productive discussions. The fall semester's class had a little less organization than I would have liked.",
    "There could be a little bit more structure in terms of deadlines (i.e. not just setting a \"draft\" deadline but having specific components that are due on each day, or asking teams to submit a \"What I intend to do for the next draft\" immediately after receiving each round of feedback.",
    "The fact that all students get to work with a summer host is a huge benefit of the course. It was really nice to know what I was doing for my junior summer in January. Last semester was more structured and content-heavy than this one, which was mostly a workshop for our case studies. I appreciated having the class time to work on such a big project but I would've liked some more structure in how the workshops were run (i.e. asking us to work on specific elements of our case studies or peer review, etc.). I also liked that we had to turn in multiple drafts and received thoughtful feedback from Professor Hopkins on each one. There was also a lot of variation in how much work teams had left to do for their hosts, and I was unclear on how much I would be expected to do for my host after we completed our summer work. More communication and clarification on that up front would've been helpful."

   "comments": [
    "100% Bo's class is a great way to expand your knowledge on social enterprise structure and the difficulties in operating an institution.",
    "Absolutely. obviously, you have to take the first part in the spring semester but otherwise incredibly valuable experience.",
    "I don't know if people will read the reviews of this course before thinking about taking the spring term class, but if you do, please listen to this. The two people you are grouped with will become a fixture in your life for the next eleven months. For much of the spring term you are working together on projects, and then you spend two months in a foreign country with them, and then you spend the entire fall term working on an independent project with them. Think very carefully about whether this is a group of people you want to spend a year of your life with. If you get along its awesome, but if there's friction it'll be a long year.",
    "Yes, if you're interested in the summer opportunity! That is the largest reason I took the course, so I would not recommend the course to those not interested in this opportunity (which is mandatory for all students).",
    "Yes! It's also mandatory if you decided to take AFST\/GLBL 305.",
    "Yes! If you are interested in the field of social enterprises, or how business practices and market forces can be harnessed for social good, this is a fantastic way to learn about them! Both the class instruction and the summer experience were extremely valuable, and I think Professor Hopkins does a good job of trying to convey the complexities of the social enterprise world. I would recommend this if you are looking for a professional experience for the summer in a fascinating field and rich cultural context.",
    "Yes!!! This is such a rare opportunity -- a fully paid summer experience working for a social enterprise in a completely different environment. I learned so much through learning about social enterprises in the spring semester, working abroad in the summer, and writing a case in the fall. There is seriously no other class like this at Yale, it's truly a bucket list one. TAKE IT!!!!!!"
