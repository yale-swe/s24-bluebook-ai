    "I felt like a developed a much deeper understanding of different aspects of the broader food system (that I had little knowledge of before the class) like plastics, agricultural chemicals and the broad idea of relative risk in regulation conundrums.",
    "This course gives insight to the various issues that we often hear about but those issues eventually slide under the radar. This course made me think in a completely new way. Issues that I would have never thought had connections or patterns - there are tons.",
    "I appreciated the opportunity to discuss environmental issues not exclusively from a business perspective, but also from a very fundamental, ecological onelearning about the soil, how contaminants travel through the air, what the mechanisms behind monocultures actually are. It felt very meaningful to talk about these issues in such tangible, vivid detail.",
    "Insights about some of the biggest problem plaguing our food system. Opportunity to conduct research on a few topics of interest."

    "I think we could have spent less time discussing nuclear testing upfront (combined all content into the first class) and dug into the more quotidian issues around livestock, GMOs, food fraud sooner. I was also hoping to debate the pros\/cons of different legislation more rigorouslyI think that could be a great assignment at some point.",

    "Strengths: I actually quite liked the size of the class and I feel like I really gained from other's readings, experiences and perspectives Weaknesses: On the back that comment, I would've liked some smaller discussion or reading groups with peers to maybe discuss specific readings. Some were really interesting and would've liked to perhaps cover them more specifically during class time.",
    "Strengths: topical, engaging content Weaknesses: formatthe class meetings could probably be shorter, and might actually benefit from diving in half (1st half student presentations, 2nd half professor lecture\/response)",
    "Strengths- really loved discussion. Appreciated the opportunity to give and take from classmates in an intimate setting. Lecture days were less engaging. I really loved how the last class was structured where everyone was responsible for a different reading- discussion was especially rich that day. I thought the selection of topics throughout the course was very good. Just wish we had some real solutions!",
    "The course covers different topics and analyses each of them from different points of view (mainly science and policy). I really liked this approach."

   "comments": [
    "If you're willing to go to the lengths of reading a lot (of the scale of possibly 100+ pages a week), this is a really fulfilling class if you're interested in an academic study of the food system. If you're not, this class can be a bit of drag. I'm basing this on the fact that I had a much better time in this class in weeks where I felt well prepared and had a lot to contribute rather than weeks where I'd just skimmed the material.",
