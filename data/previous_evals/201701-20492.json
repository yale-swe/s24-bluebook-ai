   "comments": [
    "This class teaches Macroeconomics really well. Not too much work, nothing is too hard, and everything is taught well. Katerina is amazing at explaining and answering questions.",
    "I really have a greater understanding of macro trends in the world and can apply an economic ideology to problems I need to address.",
    "I learned more about the global economy and how everything is interrelated. I also learned a lot about the US' own economy and its influence on the world.",
    "I learned more about macroeconomic concepts such as the labor market, currency exchange, credit markets, etc.",
    "I learned a lot of how the market works in the bigger picture of the world (between countries, in country, etc.) versus just how one business works with a larger body in economics.",
    "I felt like all of the concepts from microeconomics that I knew well enough to represent in a graph but did not really understand were clarified in this course and were even very helpful to understanding macroeconomics. The whole course built on itself very well throughout the semester and by the end I felt like not only could I understand the latter concepts well because of the earlier ones, but the earlier ones made so much more sense. So overall I learned a lot about how economies interact with each other and so much about the government's role in the economy (which I admittedly knew nothing about before taking this class).",
    "Really solid understanding of macro.",
    "I loved this class because it was very connected to the real world- it made me understand why and how crises such as the 2007-2009 crisis occurred. It was great in the sense that it covered all the fundamental macro concepts but in a way that related theory to practice.",
    "I gained deeper insight into the interconnectivity and impact of economic institutions that govern much of our lives. Particularly useful was the study of the Great Recession and the factors that led to its buildup and eruption."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "While not necessarily a weakness, you should be weary that the curve for ECON 111 as opposed to ECON 116 is a lot worse. There's hardly a curve for the upper end of the distribution so you'll need to get an uncurved A for an A, while getting in the B range is a lot more feasible.",
    "Use a better textbook. Ours was very unorganized, kept on jumping around on topics and didn't present concepts well. I don't think we covered as much material as the lecture did, even though the seminar is supposed to be \"harder\" (and the curve ends up being harsher).",
    "The strengths of this course are very clear powerpoint slides and explanations, and interactive groupwork that the professor makes you do in class to practice the material. There are no major weaknesses to this course, except that the curve is tough.",
    "Better use of personal slides during class (slides were provided by a textbook company--I hope the teacher would be able to do so herself)",
    "This course was strong in creating a class relationship for its small size and kept me engaged, especially through group work and not just lecturing.",
    "I don't think there were many weaknesses and I discussed the strengths above.",
    "Katerina is an excellent lecturer. Problem sets could have been more challenging to really ensure students had a good grasp on the material. There were some topics, such as current accounts, that were not covered thoroughly in the problem sets. As a result, I thought I understood the concept when I actually didn't in practice. Also, if more comprehensive lecture notes were posted online, this would help students review the material not discussed in the textbook..",
    "The workload was manageable and the class discussions were interesting and engaging. The small class setting was wonderful and made people more engaged with the course. However, the curve was this class was very strict and although the exams were not difficult, the curve makes it hard to get good grades.",
    "The class was largely taught via powerpoint presentations which I found to be somewhat less engaging and effective for a seminar style class. Potentially more chalkboard examples and discussions would help vary the approach. When examples were used in class, they were generally helpful. One thing that would help the course as a whole would be to help students organize all the information covered to allow for better development of understanding and highlight the relationships not always readily apparent between concepts.",
    "Weaknesses, very boring lectures. Strengths, easy PSETS."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this course to anyone who is deciding whether to pursue a degree in economics or a related field. The course has a fairly large breadth in material so it'll give you access to a lot of concepts that would be built on in upper level courses.",
    "Overall good intro macroecon course. Lectures are mostly straight from the textbook, though are still good review and helpful for reinforcing the concepts. Having a small classroom size is very useful for pay attention and allows you to actually ask questions and also discuss topics\/work on problems with other students. Professor Simmons also goes onto interesting side tangents sometimes. Workload is on the lighter side, especially because psets are relatively short and you can get help from the Teaching Fellow. However, the curve is a bit rough - I estimate people will need like above a 96% to get an A. Especially because test are on the easier side, there isn't a lot of room for error.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course -- you learn really well and with minimal work. Teaching is fantastic and overall education of macroeconomic logic is strong.",
    "Yes-- a basic understanding a macro economics is needed in the world move.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student if they are strongly considering economics as a major. Not being an economics major, the course was nice but it definitely becomes competitive, so if you're more of the relaxed learner, you may want to try the lecture. However, the instructor in the seminar (Katerina Simons) is incredible and I felt like I knew a lot more about how the economy works after every class I had. I personally loved the seminar a ton, but wish it didn't feel so competitive at times.",
    "Absolutely - I learned so much and class was very engaging.",
    "Yes! Definitely better than the lecture. Learned a great deal.",
    "Yes",
    "Yes - if you are there to learn and not necessarily there for the grade.",
    "I would recommend this course to other students, as the seminar format is still better than the lecture in terms of ensuring motivation throughout the semester and engagement with the material. Especially if you're going to pursue economics further, making sure you are on top of the intro material is important.",
    "Only if you have to take it."
