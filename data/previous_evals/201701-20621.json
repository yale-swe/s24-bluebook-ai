    "No, if you don't have to take L4 then don't. It's just not worth it.",
    "You don't learn much more than what you did in L3, would recommend just finishing the textbook yourself and saving yourself the time of attending a class that provides no feedback on countless assignments nor for in-class activities. If you do take the course, expect to invest a lot of time in work that does not receive corrections. Perhaps it was just this professor in particular that preferred to rush from activity to activity without providing comprehensive lessons on them, but I think the structure of the course was partially to blame."
