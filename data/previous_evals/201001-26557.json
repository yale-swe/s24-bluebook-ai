   "comments": [
    "This class is great for students of political science or international relations, because it demonstrates the thousands of years of thought that went into making our current global system the way it is. I would recommend it with the caveat that a student should make sufficient time to study and prepare for this course.",
    "Recommend if you'd like a good overview of intellectual history.",
    "Yes. You will learn a lot about your world and, true to advertisement, you will see the world in a different, albeit slightly different, way.",
    "Very much recommended. Before IR students embark on their careers, they should have some basic knowledge of the events, thinkers, writers and ideas on which our world order is based. Most schools\/programs\/universities don't cover this very much any more. Hill does it masterfully.",
    "It's basically the best ever introduction to all of the great books and great thinkers of the world. The reading is insane, but not necessary for Professor Hill's excellent lectures. Coming to every class and taking good notes ARE crucial however, but it's easy when you have Charles Hill as your speaker every week.",
    "I was summarize the class as a description and analysis of the great intellectual thinkers in International Relations. I would definitely recommend it to other students because I enjoyed the classes and feel that I learned a great deal of important information.",
    "Definitely take it if you're interested in political philosophy, IR, the classics, or anything related to these. This is the best class I've taken so far--it ties together so many disparate works, and gets you to think on another level.",
    "Yes, absolutely.",
    "I would highly recommend the course; the literature covered is in my opinion fundamental to any graduate program in International Relations. Furthermore, the fact that the teacher is eminently knowledgeable in his subject makes seminar sessions particularly enjoyable.",
    "Yes--no other course I have taken as an undergrad or graduate student has so carefully conveyed the importance of these works, both individually and as part of a grand narrative. This course emphasized the big picture, without sacrificing nuance--essential for anyone with in interest in contemporary international affairs.",
    "I would recommend this course. It was quite abstract but was helpful in drawing together important intellectual threads over time.",
    "A study of the history of history, in a sense. Of where our ideas about world order come from, how they've changed, and the dilemmas they encounter over time--from antiquity to modern times."

   "comments": [
    "Again, I think this course shows the intellectual history of international relations, which is very interesting. It demonstrates where the ideas that we cling to so fiercely today come from.",
    "As told before, great to read all the classics.",
    "There's a reason why each lecture and reading are included in the course.",
    "The class helps you how to think about the problems facing the planet. They might as well call it \"How to save the world, by Professor Charles Hill.\" It's awesome.",
    "It provided me with knowledge regarding the authors who have had the biggest impact on my field. It also provided me with an understanding of the intellectual history of many of the elements I have studied in other classes.",
    "This class will be used to write my senior thesis. It is the only class so far that I've enjoyed in the International Studies department.",
    "It provides an essential overview.",
    "Extensively--the narrative developed in this course provides the basis and foundations of contemporary international relations.",
    "This course helped me grasp different strategies of world order and issues of statecraft.",
    "This course was helpful not just toward degree requirements, but pushing me to think on my own and apply that sort of rigorous thinking to all of my endeavors in life--studies, work, research, etc."
