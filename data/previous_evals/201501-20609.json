    "Throughout the semester I recommended that all my friends sit in on his class! Every week I came out of the class overwhelmed with excitement and new perspectives. I wanted my peers to share in the fun.",
    "An opportunity to explore a whole range of different ideas about non anthropocentric semiotic frameworks, and an opportunity to develop conceptual languages to 'map' the explanatory schemes of different important thinkers over each other.",
    "Depends on what you want to do with your life, your leanings and inclinations -- although this could, in some senses be a core course, because it is the next leap forward in terms of intellectual history. This is a philosophy, but a precise, non-fuzzy kind.",
    "I would defiantly recommend this course for anyone who is interested in understanding the origins and undergirding principles of contemporary ethnographic and social theory. I also think a course like this should be required for archiologists."

    "This will help my research exponentially. This course will lead me into new directions and approaches for assessing my data, and I am excited to apply these skills in my future research.",
    "Helps me think about intellectual history, ways of knowing, and where we're heading. Also Amazed at how everything is connected --- Spinoza,Deleuze, Niet, and tehrmodynamics, I did not think.",
    "This course gave me the opportunity to return to canonical texts by Aristotle, Heidegger, Marx and others and to read them in a new light and with more attention. Moreover, Paul was able to bring to light certain aspects of these texts that I would have otherwise taken for granted."
