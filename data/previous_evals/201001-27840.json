    "The Colloquium was wonderfully organized and was a fantastic opportunity for us to present our work. Great job!",
    "Question 1 does not apply to this class. There were no textbooks. I reviewed literature, but it was not part of a curriculum.",
    "The Colloquium is a useful capstone experience for students in research tracks, particularly for those students who have not benefited from other opportunities to present their work in weekly lab meetings or at conferences.",
    "Loved it!",
    "Just wanted to express my surprise that no social ecology research presentations were given awards at the Colloquium, despite their excellent quality. Perhaps this reflects the continuing bias of FES for natural sciences?",
    "The research colloquium was put together well. It was a great chance for students to practice presentation skills and share work with one another.",
    "10 - I assume this review is for my project course with my advisor Florencia Montagnini to prepare my work for the thesis document and the colloquium. If so, having this credit was important to push me to keep working on my project and get the valuable feedback from my professor.",
    "I thought that the Research Colloquim was very well organized this year, significantly more advertised and the students work was vastly better than the previous years I have seen the event.",
    "The Colloquium is a nice arena to share interdisciplinary student research. It would be difficult to do with the amount of students and time available, but I think it would serve the Colloquium and MESc degree program well to make the presentations similar to a defense. The time allotted is inadequate, although acknowledged constraints do exist.",
    "I'm guessing this course refers to the masters student research colloquium? None of the questions are relevant.",
    "Students should have received feedback on their presentations- i think a lot of the potential value was lost because there was no constructive feedback. Also, the judging process seemed very arbitrary. It would have been nice to have more insight into this process, especially since they were shifting around all day. altogether though it was great to have a forum for students to share their research with each other. it would have been nice for the posters to have been up longer (like a week!)",
    "The student colloquium is very useful for students seeking practice in oral presentations."

    "Presenting our projects",
    "I am convinced that Michelle Bell is the best advisor at FES. She doesn't take her students out for beers, but she helps us figure out what we need to know to succeed in our research and in life beyond Yale. That's way more important to me. She is a stellar researcher and is eager to mentor her students with thorough care and feedback. Every time we met she'd ask me how my job search was going. It was a good incentive to keep up on that front throughout the semester. Bell provided me with a list of resources for job hunting. She follows through with all promises to dig up information or look into different things. She is reliable, respectful, encouraging and appropriately demanding. Bell is accessible and accountable even on sabbatical. We met regularly throughout the semester and she was quick to respond to email inquiries and to review drafts.",
    "It was very useful to have the opportunity to present research to a larger community unfamiliar with my field\/research.",
    "Having an early deadline than the thesis deadline to submit a synthesis of our work. The idea of sharing our work with the larger FES community, and the attendance by some of our professors.",
    "This was a great opportunity for arranging my research results and present in front of a great audience. It helped me to get more clarity.",
    "Getting to see everyone's research.",
    "A great way to showcase my master's research to the F&ES community.",
    "Great setup. Really enjoyed seeing what everyone did.",
    "Prof. Montagnini went through my documents in detail and provided the constructive feedback needed to improve my presentation and manuscript. She was not judgemental, nor did she make me feel nervous. Instead we had nice conversations and I felt inspired afterward to improve my work.",
    "It was great to learn what my peers were doing and to showcase my own work. It also helped me to get my research more organized in such a way that other people could understand it.",
    "Fun to hear about other students' research.",
    "The day event was really interesting for seeing everyone's research.",
    "Posters paid for to print."

    "It would be nice to have a little more social interaction from time to time to get to know Bell and the rest of her students, bring the fellow advisees together in a less formal setting than monthly presentations.",
    "The Colloquium organizers would have benefited from input from students in previous years.",
    "I would love to work with interested people to make the Symposium more effective (once I've submitted my thesis). You can email me at: Meredith.Trainor@gmail.com if this is of interest.It was very frustrating to do an MESc Colloquium and have so few people attend. Either research is important here, or it isn't, and I think we as a school need to get straight on which of those options it is. Attendance by both other Master's students (especially MEMs) and doctoral students was very poor, but more importantly, a paltry number of professors and scientific support staff were in attendance. Isn't this the same research work that we all break our backs to complete while still balancing full courseloads? FES seems to be at a critical point for self-reflection and establishing its identity. Either our research is important, is a priority for the school, and is a major contribution to the identity of our master's program offerings, or we should just do MEMs and MFs. The turnout was super disappointing.On poster presentations - although I think the idea of cutting off the poster\/presentation option based on whether an individual made the 5pm abstract submission deadline or not is fair, I wish there was advanced notification that this was how the decision would be made. That aside, I'm not complaining about that - it was fair enough.I don't see a point to having poster presentations, other than saving time. Many other students and I felt that if time is the problem, we should split up the presentations across two days like a real conference, rather than fill one mega-packed day with activities and then have scant attendance. As to posters - they're not hard to do, and most students will have done at least one poster presentation in the past before matriculating at FES. Posters don't add anything to our knowledge base or our professional skills - poster presenters are hardly interacted with at professional conferences anyway, and attendance at poster sessions is always shoddy. While I didn't mind doing a poster, I don't think it added anything (at all) to my academic training at FES. Doing a talk would have been much more beneficial, and would have prepared me better for what little academic work lays ahead in my career before I return to the nonprofit world.I would suggest making the Colloquium two days, and enforcing cancellation of all other events\/classes and preventing scheduling of club meetings to have better attendance. I don't think you should make nonscience students attend, but you should certainly make the climate conducive to it. The lack of conversation and interaction between students regarding their research topics and actual fieldwork is one of the biggest failings at FES, in my opinion.",
    "More people need to be able to do presentations - preferably everyone. Maybe we could have two presentations going on at once.",
    "I think it requires mandatory attendance of all FES students. The audience for the colloquium was really disappointing. The presentations require more time for Q&A.",
    "It seems like that few take it seriously.The topical session of the master colloquium is very unclear and ridiculous. The audience or the judge might know nothing about the presenter's method and topics",
    "Timing. I didn't see many first years attending the colloquium.",
    "Really enjoyed it as is!",
    "It's not a complaint as much as a suggestion. I took this credit in addition to Mark Ashton's analysis of silvicultural problems. Taking them both at the same time improved my ability to be successful in each class.",
    "I would like to write something critical here but can't think of anything to say.",
    "I wish I hadn't volunteered to help with it. It took way too much time when I should have been preparing my presentation and working on my thesis.Jim Saiers needs to introduce himself more often bc not everyone knows who he is. (I didn't figure it out until this April.)"

    "Make sure to take this credit if working with Prof. Montagnini. It's worth it.",
    "My advice would be to take classes that really interest you your first semester and read as much as you possibly can andask your professors and colleagues about their research and what they thing the hot topics are in the field. Second semester write a great research project proposal and then spend your second year doing it. The presentation itself does not take too much time to make, but there is lots and lots of time that was put into preparing its contents. Also, go over your presentation with your advisor and some of your friends that both do and do not know alot about your topic beforehand.",
