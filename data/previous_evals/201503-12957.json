    "Very good class for classical ear training and sight-singing. If you are not headed toward a classical approach to music it may not be the best.",
    "Music 218 is a music class for students who want to improve their sight-singing and dictation abilities. The course focuses on rhythm, harmony and melody in both dictation and sight-singing formats. There is an additional \"piano lab\" component, in which students learn basic chord progressions and how to read figured bass.",
    "I think it provides an elementary understanding of music that corresponds especially with the music 210 theory. I would recommend it.",
    "Elementary Musicianship I was awesome, and I would definitely recommend it!",
    "I good way to improve sight reading and listening skills. I would recommend it, but only for those who might use the skill frequently. While the class is very low commitment, I would not call it a gut.",
    "Take this class if you want to improve your sight singing and music dictation\/listening. The coursework consists mostly of various exercises, which can get a bit tedious but is really helpful in improving your ear.",
    "MUSI 218 is a supplemental course for new music majors and for those interested in improving their sight singing, dictation and keyboarding skills. This course assumes a basic knowledge of music theory provided by MUSI 210. Homework for this class is very relaxed, only asking to prepare a sight singing exercise or two per class to be performed for a grade. In addition you will have a keyboarding classed based on your level of training and learn basic dictation of rhythms, melody and harmony. Know though that dictations and keyboarding is expected to be learned on ones own and there is no specific homework for it. It's a pretty good class for those who are interested in the subject, but it ends up being self selecting. It's not necessarily an automatic \"A\" as it may have been in the past under other instructors."
