    "While other English 115 courses are good, I would not recommend taking this section. It's just a drag on your schedule because you're really not going to gain anything by reading these books or by attending class. It's that useless.",
    "ENGL 115 was a very interesting, academically stimulating class that's great for anyone who wants to get a taste of writing and close reading at Yale. I would recommend it to anyone, because the readings are fun, it's not a huge amount of work, and it's incredibly rewarding.",
    "I would highly recommend it, if you need an english credit or if you just want a great class - the readings are awesome and some are quite grizzly. The conversations are great if you participate and do the readings and the papers also help get deeper into the topics discussed in class. The \"monstrous\" is a confusing and intricate idea that Mr. Carr attacks very well.",
    "Great class to take as a freshman -- it pushes you to step up your analytical writing skills from what was likely demanded of you in high school. Fantastic syllabus that includes both texts well established within the Western canon (eg. Frankenstein, Macbeth) and less obvious choices (eg. Eichmann in Jerusalem).",
    "There are a few papers, but not an overwhelming number; most of the time is spent reading, which I enjoyed. The readings are very diverse, and though some are more interesting than others, I was fairly happy with most of them. Papers are open ended, which can make picking a topic very difficult, but help is widely available. Expect to have done the reading and be able to contribute to class discussions, though there isn't enormous pressure to do so every second. I would recommend this course to both humanities and non-humanities people -- the content is interesting and discussions go beyond a surface-level understanding of the content, but discussions are not intimidating.",
    "I think the goal of the class was to define monstrosity by looking at how the representations of it have changed in literature over the course of time. Yes I would highly recommend it, I thought it was fascinating.",
    "I would say whether you take the class should be based upon: 1. if you like the readings on the syllabus 2. if the professor seems good 3. if the people in your section seem fun\/like they could have productive discussions with you. Look for these factors during shopping period--if one of them seems off, think about maybe switching.",
    "Take this course! It is a fun and interesting way to improve your writing skills. All of the texts are different and enjoyable. You will get to read things ranging from classic monster books to cli-fi to philosophy novels on evil. Professor Carr is a wonderful, warm, and engaging teacher who will make you look forward to section each week."
