    "Take French here if you plan on going to a french speaking country. The program is strong.",
    "If anything comes out of this course it is that your french, in some areas, is perfected and one is capable of really being inthralled in the language. The books that you read are also interesting.",
    "A lot ofFrench, but manageable as long as you stay on top of your work.",
    "Better than L1\/L2 French. The tests are only every other week and they're in class instead of during the evenings. Most of the books and films are enjoyable. Professor Vysosias made sure that we covered all the relevant material in class.",
    "Fren 130 is definitely an increase in work from L2, but it is an excellent class. I recommend Mme. Vysosias. (I've heard Koizim is great as well.)"
