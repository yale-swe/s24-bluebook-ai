    "good seminar. Reasonable reading.",
    "Yes I would recommend it",
    "I would recommend this course as a fifth class. The reading is EXTREMELY light. There is only one article to read per week and it's usually only about 20 pages. Professor Decanio is very easygoing and often lets the class out early. The material is interesting as are the readings, but discussions can become circular and Decanio's attempts to force the class to draw certain conclusions are sometimes lost on the students. Other than reading (which you can kind of get away with not doing if you are familiar with politics, although it's not a bit deal because it's so minimal) the only assignment is a 20 page paper (or one 7 pager and one 13 pager). The class is pretty stress free until the paper comes along. You are not given much direction on what to write which can be good or bad depending on your style and knowledge base. Decanio is not great about checking emails but he is more than willing to meet with you if you talk to him after class.",
    "Great seminar. Gets you familiar with the relevant scholarship and encourages you to delve deep into the issues.",
    "A total waste of time. If you want no work, and to learn absolutely nothing, take it.",
    "This is a decent seminar taught by a very young new prof. Content is not as interesting as it could be given the wealth of literature on the subject. Reading load is VERY light.",
    "If you need a seminar course, this is a pretty good one! Not too much work until the final paper and the material is interesting, but it is repetitive. Professor DeCanio is really chill and the class is laid back. There is a final twenty-page paper which requires you to do some work but Professor DeCanio really tries to help you with it.",
    "Skim over the readings so you can contribute during discussion, write one great 20-page paper, and you're all set."
