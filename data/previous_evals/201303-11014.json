    "You probably know from all the other reviews what this class is about. Your life will revolve around 420 every week for the entire semester. Problem sets are extremely long and the relevant material is taught by the TA in a review session two days before the psets are due. We were almost a week behind in lectures all semester but Prof. Stone made no attempt to resolve this. Perhaps my biggest complaint, which is reflective of the entire semester, is the amount of work during reading week and finals. There was an extra long pset (more than 20 hours) due two days into finals period with the material only taught on the last day of reading week. There were also 3 review sessions during reading week and finals in which new material was presented. That is not fair to the students an Prof. Stone must understand this. Your other classes will suffer because of the amount of work from 420.",
    "If you don't need this class for your major, you better have a lot of free time on your hands. If you take it with Stone, you'll learn a lot but your social life will also suffer because of the amount of time that you'll spend working with classmates or trying to understand the material. The problem sets ranged in length from 5-8 questions, and each question was generally 1-4 pages long (so problem sets were generally 10-20 pages long). Unfortunately Stone covered a lot of the material on the problem set on the day that it was due. Going to office hours with Alex cut down the time needed for them dramatically. The midterm had a median of 53% and an average of 60%; quite a few people in the class did very well even though many also scored<50%. The math required for this class isn't very advanced, but it's a conceptually challenging course. That said, it's very interesting, and Stone makes sure to explain the concepts well. The TA's office hours were lifesavers, and I would not recommend missing any of them. I honestly think that this course should be split over two semesters: having a problem set due during finals was torture and it would have been beneficial to have longer to learn the material. I would take this class if you need it or if you're interested in statistical and thermal physics and have a lot of time on your hands.",
    "I would not recommend taking this class unless you need it for the intensive physics major. Lectures are hard to follow, the textbook is filled with errors and confusing notation, and the psets take 10-15 hours a week. Stone is also rather bad at budgeting time, with the result that we covered 4 chapters in the last week of class and reading period, and had a pset due during finals. If you do decide to take it, know this: the tests are difficult, but they're difficult for everyone--at least half our class got below 50% on the midterm, so if you feel like a test goes badly don't freak out too much, because there will be a huge curve.",
    "PHYS 420 was easily the hardest class I took at Yale. I thought ENAS 194 was hard, but PHYS 420 is a whole new level of hard and time consuming. PSETS are long and challenging and the exams are tough. It's only required of Intensive Physics Majors and Applied Physics majors but Statistical Mechanics and Thermodynamics are one of the fundamental pillars to modern Physics and it will make you appreciate the beauty of Physics even more!Honestly, this class made me dislike Physics for a period of time, but by the end of the course, I fell back in love with Physics...even deeper than before!Just be prepared for a lot of work and difficult concepts. If you can get through this class, you are in really good shape for Physics Graduate School.",

    "It's a hard class. The problem sets are long and difficult; if you don't go to section, you'll be in trouble. Lectures are disorganized, and the course pacing was terrible--we had to have an extra lecture and an extra problem set (covering four chapters' worth of material) during reading week to cover the end of the syllabus. Professor Stone is nice enough, but he's a confusing lecturer.",
    "Good but hard course. Stone is very helpful and a great lecturer, but be prepared: homework is very long and the last few weeks of the class cover a lot of material. However, the subject is very interesting, and the math is definitely doable.",
    "As you probably know, this course is a lot of work and is really challenging. Setting up the problems can be a nightmare, so go to the problem set sessions if you want to save yourself a lotof brain damage. That said, the headaches are really unavoidable if you're going to be taking PHYS 420. I have to point out how ridiculous the last couple weeks were, especially the final problem set. Covered 5 chapters and we were so far behind we had a class during reading period (meaning yes, the problem set was also due during reading period). So yeah. I'm happy it's over."
