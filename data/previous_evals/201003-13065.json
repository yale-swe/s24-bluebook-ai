    "This course will be what you make of it. It's a great opportunity to bond with the other students in the major and gain a strong concept of what their senior projects entail. Additionally, it will provide deadlines for your own project (though these pop up a bit and you're expected to work independently between the prospectus in October through the 20 page draft in Reading Week.)Professor Thomas is really flexible and will help you make the course what it needs to be. If the overwhelming sentiment is that something isn't working, share it and she will most likely work with you to fix it.",
    "You take this class because you have to take it. But if you take it seriously, and actually take the time to do a large chunk of your research in the fall, the process of presenting ideas to your peers can be quite helpful.",
    "It's mandatory for those in the major, so I have to recommend it- especially if you want to graduate."
