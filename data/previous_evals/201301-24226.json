   "comments": [
    "I believe that this course was too difficult for students who are not specializing in Health policy. This course would be more useful for out-of-field students if it focused more on the basic principles of healthcare finance and delivery, rather than trying to teach difficult economic concepts. A few more illustrative case studies through out the entire semester would also be better.",
    "This class was a great overview of some major topics in the structure of health care delivery and payment mechanisms. The beginning of each unit started out at a very basic level (definition of Medicare vs. Medicaid, basic theory of supply and demand, etc.) but quickly progressed to a level of detail that was helpful and interesting even to those with lots of background in health policy. Great review of recent scholarship and empirical research, with lots of class participation where students grapple with questions in a direct way.",
    "Could provide more structure and lectures in advance. Readings were not always related to the assignment asked. Syllabus constantly changed and articles in the syllabus were not necessarily the ones posted.",
    "It is an important course, but it was way above my head. I think an economics background should be a pre-requisite for the course. Some of the discussions were interesting, but a little too fast-paced. It was also a little frustrating because most of the topics did not interest me very much. But then again, that is the nature of our current health care system. The only topic I really got into was \"the economics of bad.\"",
    "Interesting course, terrible professor.",
    "it is intense. Participating discussion is challenging for me but I enjoyed my classmates' input. It trained logical thinking on health care related finance issue and topics are very updated.",
    "This was a great course. Having no background in policy, I definitely learned a lot. I think expectations for class discussion in a class of that size was a bit lofty and made it hard for people with little policy knowledge and background to contribute. I think more small group discussion would have been beneficial. Additionally, the expectation of the professor was that policy memos should improve throughout the semester. However, this was difficult and at times impossible to do because they were not graded and returned in a timely manner. As a result, students could not consult the one they had previously turned in to know what improvements were needed and frequently could not consult the last 2 or 3 turned in.",
    "This was a truly phenomenal class. I very much enjoyed the readings for this class as well as the actual class time. It was incredibly engaging and exceeded my expectations.",
    "excellent readings selection, i like the case studies, active participation",
    "This was a good course. I learned a lot. It was well organized around major and important topics in the finance of health care. The lectures were organized and focused and emphasized important, main points. Likewise, the articles were well chosen to emphasize important, main points.This course was a lot of work. There were a lot of readings. There were a lot of policy memos. The instructor sometimes acted as though writing the policy memos was not a big deal, when they were really a lot of work - especially when the material was very new and there were a lot of readings to do also. In addition, the instructor seemed critical if students didn't come up with strong, clear opinions about the material in the policy memo - when often it was enough just to understand and digest this new material and all the readings.",
    "good",
    "Great class! I think it should be part of the core curriculum!",
    "A good summary overview of the US healthcare system. The range of topics covered is relevant and helps for gaining an understanding of the changes that have occurred recently, as well as giving practice for how to communicate in the policy world. However, the number of short memos felt excessive at times, and it would have been better to have options about which ones to write on. Not everyone is interested in the same topics, and having a choice of topics to write about would encourage greater engagement in those topics.",
    "Excellent course. Well developed to give a good understanding of US healthcare spending and some of the alternatives to current practices. Good topic selection. Policy memos were good, though could have been better spaced throughout the semester to provide more continuous than clustered feedback.",
    "This course was so much fun! I learned more in this class than any of my other asses this semester. It was current, applicable, and useful. I feel I have the tools now to engage in conversations and work involving health care policy.",
    "This was a phenomenal course to introduce the workings of the US health care system, current events, and future directions -- all grounded in the field of health economics.",
    "This was my first health policy course and it exposed me to many of the complex topics that are commonly and vaguely presented in the media but not often very well understood outside of the field. This course taught me a ton content-wise and I am happy that I learned how to write policy memos through the course's bi-weekly assignments. However, since we were assigned around 6 memos, I would suggest that there is room to add variety to the assignments to increase overall learning (i.e. not all memos, could include other formats or items from the popular press). I really enjoyed the assigned readings and thought that they were well-selected. Since student discussion was highly emphasized and the topics covered were considerably complex\/dense, it might also be helpful to have smaller sections for this class outside of lecture led by the TAs and\/or professor.",
    "The course does a good job finding a cohesive theme in a lot of complex material. I wish it had been pitched at a higher level, especially as it's an elective course. Structuring it around deeper use of economic theory to look thoroughly at some central issues like cost-sharing, pay-for-performance, and hospital market concentration and really go through the available research to get a granular understanding of how and when these things work would have been really awesome. Still, the course managed to get decent penetration on a broad range of topics and held together better than other courses I've taken on similar issues.",
    "Good class, learned a lot of tangible information about health care system in the US from it.",
    "A great course.Very informative.A good beginning of case studies.",
    "The course materials were very well organized and expectations were clear.No weaknesses."

   "comments": [
    "Instructor: Zachary Noel Cooper \u00a0Dr Cooper was clearly very competent and well-versed in his knowledge on the subject, and was very passionate about what he studies.",
    "Instructor: Zachary Noel Cooper \u00a0Professor Cooper really knows his stuff, and makes an effort to present the health care system chunk by chunk. He boils down the key facts and issues in each topic and presents the tough questions and challenges that are being debated in politics andthe media.",
    "Instructor: Zachary Noel Cooper \u00a0Seminar style. However, could provide more structure to the course.",
    "Instructor: Zachary Noel Cooper \u00a0Professor Cooper is really nice! He is very charismatic, extremely passionate and excited about the topic, and loves to engage students. I like his use of multi-media in the class - especially the Stephen Colbert videos. He is also very approachable. He can be a little intense and has very high expectations, but he also has faith in his students. He is also open to feedback, which is nice. He is a great person. It would have been helpful if he had gone into detail about properly writing a policy memo in the beginning of the course, perhaps after the first one, rather than after the fifth one.",
    "Instructor: Zachary Noel Cooper \u00a0Poor lecturer. Extremely inflexible and does not respond to student feedback. Disappointing",
    "Instructor: Zachary Noel Cooper \u00a0He is unbelievable good lecturer and always pushing logical thinking and make your own argument. I can tell he is very serious in class design but small size of class discussion maybe more beneficial.",
    "Instructor: Zachary Noel Cooper \u00a0The professor was good. He was obviously knowledgeable, passionate, and experienced in the area and had a lot of information to share. He structured the material of the class well.",
    "Instructor: Zachary Noel Cooper \u00a0Professor Cooper is very responsive to questions, incredibly prompt in replies to questions or concerns, very open to discussing concepts in office hours and their implications, etc. Writing memos, though challenging at times, has afforded all of us the opportunity to learn how to synthesize material in a way that effectively conveys the major points of an issue to certain audiences. This will be an incredibly useful skill for all of us going forward, especially as we try to convey the gravity, the implications, the advantages and the disadvantages of different issues to these varied audiences who may not be well-versed in the nuances of particular issues in health care.",
    "Instructor: Zachary Noel Cooper \u00a0very approachable, spoke a little fast and cut off the ends of his sentences, course structure was very comprehensive in terms of topic areas, kept class engaged",
    "Instructor: Zachary Noel Cooper \u00a0Dr. Cooper is a very instructor good in many ways. He is clearly very knowledgeable in this subject area. His lectures were very organized and emphasized important, main points. He chose good articles that, again, emphasized important, main points. Dr. Cooper is also enthusiastic and energetic and he made the material interesting. I learned a lot in his class.He kept the lectures moving along well and he made the class interactive. However, sometimes the class interaction felt somewhat too \"controlled\", as it seemed as if for each question, Dr. Cooper was wanting a particular answer or a particular debate\/discussion to occur in class.I would recommend to Dr. Cooper to limit his descriptions of his life outside class - sometimes this appeared to be \"bragging\" about himself and was not appreciated by many class members (it was discussed among students).However, overall, Dr. Cooper is a very good teacher.",
    "Instructor: Zachary Noel Cooper \u00a0good",
    "Instructor: Zachary Noel Cooper \u00a0Professor Cooper did a great job. I enjoyed the mix of lectures and small group activities. The only thing that would make the class better would be more outside speakers.",
    "Instructor: Zachary Noel Cooper \u00a0I think will be an excellent teacher with one or two more semesters of experience. Very knowledgeable and interested in the course topics.",
    "Instructor: Zachary Noel Cooper \u00a0Engaging lecturer. Proactively engaged students and catered well to their learning objectives.",
    "Instructor: Zachary Noel Cooper \u00a0Seemed a little self-absorbed. Didn't always let the students contribute when they had things to say. Designed course to be interactive and discussion based but then often spent most of class lecturing to students. Pedantic grader. Improved as semester passed.",
    "Instructor: Zachary Noel Cooper \u00a0Professor Cooper was an incredible professor. We rarely come across professors who are south articulate teachers in the subjects they study. He's one of the best professors I've ever had.",
    "Instructor: Zachary Noel Cooper \u00a0Professor Cooper's lectures and case studies were incredibly well prepared and masterfully executed. He is a great instructor.",
    "Instructor: Zachary Noel Cooper \u00a0Professor Cooper is very knowledgeable about the course topics and was able to integrate his real-world experiences from England into the course content. I liked that he pushed us to think critically by emphasizing classroom discussion and small group learning. I also appreciated that he brought in a guest speakerto give us some real-world insight into the healthcare industry.",
    "Instructor: Zachary Noel Cooper \u00a0Professor Cooper is a fantastic and engaging lecturer. I wish he had allowed for more class participation, as the best moments in the class occurred when he would push back on people offering their own thoughts, forcing them to think deeper and drawing other students into the discussion. Most classes however were fairly lecture dominated. I also wish he'd talked about his own research more.",
    "Instructor: Zachary Noel Cooper \u00a0Tried hard to get students involved, and was open to discussion in class. Great job for first time teaching at Yale.",
    "Instructor: Zachary Noel Cooper \u00a0Knowledgable and enthusiastic. A fantastic first course for Dr Cooper, he deserves to be very proud.",
    "Instructor: Zachary Noel Cooper \u00a0Knowledgeable and supportive.",
    "Instructor: Zachary Noel Cooper \u00a0Professor Cooper was very prepared for each class. His notes and the readings were great resources for the final. I appreciated the occasional video clips during class too."

    "I'd recommend this course for anyone who wants a solid understanding of the way health care is delivered and paid for the in the United States. There's a fairly heavy load of reading and assignments for a once-weekly class, but you'll get a lot out of it.",
    "This is more of an economics class, not health care finance and delivery. Not very many policies discussed.",
    "As much as I like Professor Cooper, I do not think I would recommend the course unless you have a real interest in the subject. I would also recommend it to those with an economics background. It is really difficult for those without an economics background.",
    "Good material, ineffective professor. Take the other class that meets the policy requirement.",
    "A very good course that explains the economics behind the US health care system.",
    "I really appreciate that the class was run essentially as an idea laboratory. Interaction and discussion among students was encouraged and expected. We could bounce ideas off of one another and disagree and debate issues. I very much enjoyed the fact that we would be pushed to extend the analysis along a particular train of thought. It wasn't enough to say \"I agree\" or \"I disagree\" with x; instead, it was necessary to explain why one felt a particular way. I think that this sort of discussion and mulling over various ideas, possibilities and so forth is incredibly valuable and incredibly enriching.The integration of the HBS case studies into our curriculum and the case study format, I think, was particularly useful. Being able to talk with Simon Stevens from UHC was a great opportunity.",
    "Great overview of the American health care system. It's not econ heavy at all. You will leave feeling prepared to talk about the complexities of our health care system.",
    "I would recommend this class. It explains some of the main issues in the finance of health care. It is well organized. The lectures are well organized and present important, main topics in health care finance. The readings are well chosen and also discuss main, important topics in health care finance. The instructor was very good - knowledgeable, organized, focused, energetic and enthusiastic. It was a good course and I learned a lot. This course is a lot of work and not to be taken lightly.",
    "yes",
    "I would recommend it to another student. I would tell them that the selected readings are critical for any HMP or HPA student. And that the professor and class room discussion are very interesting.",
    "Excellent course that looks at US healthcare spending from a number of angles as well as alternative models of paying for healthcare.",
    "I would recommend it. Covers a lot of ground. Prof tries hard to make things interesting. Not perfect.",
    "Take it!!! It was so interesting and a lot of fun. A class I truly looked forward to attending every week.",
    "Overall, I am taking away a lot of new knowledge from this course that I think will be incredibly helpful in my future clinical\/public health career. While the memos were time consuming, they did force me to really think about the topics and synthesize a lot of literature into salient points. I would recommend the course to others who may be interested.",
    "This is one of the better courses on this topic, along with Howie's course. Unfortunately, this course overlaps fairly substantially with that one and also with micro, so a lot of it will be old reading and familiar territory. The policy memos are really interesting to write, although I wish we got better and more indivdualized feedback on them, and the final is actually a lot of fun.",
