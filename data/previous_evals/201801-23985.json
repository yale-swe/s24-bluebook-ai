   "comments": [
    "I believe that the material in this course is important for our learning and development. However, I did not feel the material was conveyed in a way in which I could easily understand or take away key items from.",
    "Labs are the most valuable time spent on the course because it allows students to apply the lecture concepts. Weaknesses: since the concepts are more involved it would have been nice to have TAs that would not mind spending a bit more time with students going over the material but the TAs were not always available or willing to explain further to students.",
    "Great overview of econometric methods, I wish the final project was more organized.",
    "great class",
    "Lab hw assignments were definitely time-consuming so if you were confused on SAS or coding you were at a major disadvantage.",
    "This course is OK, but could be great. Here are things that should change: 1. The exams should NOT be open note. I was able to write down all of the content from the lecture slides on a piece of paper and then did excellently on the exam but did not really learn anything at all. Having students memorize concepts would help them retain their learning. 2. The group project did not really function well. Splitting up tasks and having 1 student do the stats analysis and another student present means that not everyone in the group is able to learn from each part. For example, I have 0 understanding of the statistics we did, as my job was to write the literature review. This was frustrating, especially as a woman, to have the men in my group take on the stats coding and push the women off to the \"softer\" parts of the assignment. Would prefer if all group members had to take responsibility for all parts of the assignment. And, would like there to be a group member evaluation component where each person writes a review of the other members -- we had a couple people do nothing for the project but will still get a good grade. 3. There should be less of a focus on \"examples\" in lecture and more content provided. I didn't learn a ton from the extensive examples and would have preferred more learning. 4. The time of the course should be changed -- it's hard to learn when you're hungry b\/c the class is in the middle of dinner.",
    "Great",
    "I learned a lot from this course. However, it seemed disorganized at the end and expectations were not clear for the final project.",
    "It was really difficult to understand the aims and organization of the course. We dwelled on some topics way too long and others not enough. I think I would have learned more had I just skipped the lectures and bought a good book and read it at home. This class desperately needs a strategic overhaul.",
    "Computer labs supplemented course material well to help build knowledge and understanding. Lecture slides were also extremely helpful in learning and preparation for quizzes.",
    "Strengths: lab assignments, lab sessions, overall well taught, clear. I wish the TAs would actually go over the lab powerpoint during lab so as it answer any questions we may have about the slides\/overall understanding of the topic. Weaknesses: I found it very hard to follow the professor's explanations in class, his points were not clear and some concepts were not well explained. The slides were hard to follow in retrospect and taking notes was hard since everything was PDF (I would suggest making PPT slides so students can take notes more easily as you go along). The suggest book for the course was even more complicated to follow. It may be because this subject matter is taught with an economic lens\/health policy lens and for those of us who have statistical experience mainly from math, biology, chemistry, etc - it is hard to follow. The group project at the end was a VERY frustrating experience. Of course ultimately, a lot of that depends on group members and group dynamic, but part of it has to do with the chosen project. I think my group overcomplicated matters, but it would have been nice to get more instruction and professor\/TA opinion in choosing a feasible project with a feasible database. We did explain our idea to the professor who OK'ed it only to find out later that our project was almost impossible. This seemed like a preventable issue. I do have a lot more knowledge on linear and logistic regression, but I can't help but feel that I could have learned much more had the lectures been better presented, and the group project ran more smoothly.",
    "great course material, but not well delivered during lab.",
    "Course is very valuable and helps us understand the basics of research design and familiarize ourselves with Stata \/ sas. Combination of professor who was on the low-engagement side and a 5-7 pm timeslot made class enthusiasm low though. Don't let people waive out of this! I have heard people talk about gaming the system to never take it and avoid it and I don't think that's right. This is a valuable course that everyone should take!",
    "It would have been helpful to have more guidance on how to complete the labs and homework assignments in lecture. The lectures covered necessary concepts, but the TAs quickly skimmed through the lab presentations which left many students confused. The labs built on one another, so this should have been emphasized in the first few sections so that we could correct our mistakes as we went along. I would have liked to have formed my own group for the final paper\/presentation\/project, rather than have an assigned group. Attendance at lectures was extremely low because many students did not find value in attending. Students felt that it was easier and more time-efficient to read the slides on their own. The content and research methodology is extremely interesting, and I wish that I could have felt this excitement more while taking the course.",
    "necessary but not done in a very relevant way to the students in the class",
    "Should spend more time explaining lab and making understanding the implication of the results from the lab assignments a priority.",
    "Strength: great subject matter, good resources Weakness: By their own volition, students can get by without learning a whole lot about research methods. Consequently, the class can be sharply divided by those who are interested in research methods and those who are not.",
    "HPM 583 is one of the most helpful courses in our curriculum. This course contains concepts of metrics from basic level to advanced level, and introduces them in a very well designed structure. The lecturer is very sensitive to students' response and feedback. I also like the SAS programming skills and the final project.",
    "Strengths: This course covers a wide range of topics. The course's final weeks, which focused on analysis 'tools' like IV and RDD, were particularly interesting and, for those interested in research, helpful. The professor was friendly and responsive. Weaknesses: The professor did a poor job of motivating or framing the course. While the importance of the material was immediately evident for those interested in research, for many others, especially the HCM students, the value of this information was not clear. Lecture would often run over time, requiring Professor Chen to finish one lecture during the next week's session: This disrupted the flow of the class.",
    "Definitely a great class to take if interested in health policy and related research methods; Lab sessions were also very useful in terms of grasping the most important concepts that Prof. Chen wanted us to understand.",
    "I wanted to take away more than I got from this course. I felt there was no actual SAS instruction and just brute force was the only way to learn anything",
    "Strength: This course is essential for understanding different research methods. I was definitely able to use the knowledge and skills gained in other classes. Weakness: Group project. It would be great if we could do peer evaluations for the project. Some students in my group completely dropped the ball and did not contribute fully to their part. For example, the Friday before our presentations the people in charge of data analysis had still not started, so I, the writer, spent 7 hours in the lab on Friday trying to do the data analysis. It also seems like those who do the data analysis do the most because those doing the presentation and writing have to understand the data analysis, so even though I took notes, took picture of the code and SAS output, and did a write-up, my group members still requested my help and input every step of the way.",
    "Most employers do not ask for SAS and don't value it as much as they might R or similar program The professor was great, but the material itself is not useful and I think we could make YSPH much stronger if students are learning to use a program that most employers across the board will find useful",
    "Material was not presented in a very interesting way",
    "I really liked learning tangible modeling and analysis skills, which I think will be very transferable to work after graduation. While the homeworks and lab sessions were helpful for cementing these skills, I do not think the group project was that valuable. The suggested division of work meant that only a few people actually did the coding and analysis, which meant that most group members did not actually gain anything from the project. Also, my group project experience was unnecessarily stressful, with one of my randomly assigned group members taking over the coding in the end and not really explaining any of his work, leaving the rest of us to try to figure out what he meant in order to complete the write up. I think having more extensive modeling homeworks, potentially even ones where we choose our own data set, would be a much more valuable learning experience.",
    "Strengths: Allows learning of SAS Weaknesses: Coding requirement and grading was too rigid",
    "great class! essential for understanding how to carry out future research.",
    "Quizzes were representative of the material taught. Final was a good project to apply the skills learned throughout the semester.",
    "I think this course is very valuable, but I just didn't feel like I learned enough. I think the lectures were dull and not engaging. It would be Ideal to have this course in a smaller classroom and at an earlier time. The material is pretty dry, so having the class from 5-7 made it really challenging to engage and participate.",
    "Okay",
    "Strength: necessary exposure to econometric research methods Weakness: course material feels very dated and uses a program (SAS) that most employers and students now find irrelevant.",
    "STRENGTHS -- The group project was a good way to interact with and learn from classmates. -- The curriculum was very well designed, with a lot of practical skills that can be directly applied in many fields. WEAKNESSES -- The homework assignments were often very intensive, making it difficult sometimes to dig deep and retain the skills gained from completing an assignment when it was a race to finish line.",
    "Overall, strength was getting to be creative in exploring what we learned in class. Weaknesses: teaching was not super engaging. Sometimes I felt like some of the TFs were more concerned about us getting the answer and not helping us through the process when we asked for help.",
    "The course did a great job of familiarizing students with important statistical methods and practices in research. It would be interesting to be given a scenario from a more practice-based example (i.e. population health statistics for a hospital)"

    "Instructor: Xi Chen \u00a0great professor, always ready to help!",
    "Instructor: Xi Chen \u00a0Professor Chen is really kind and he genuinely wants his students to learn. He is a bit difficult to understand but his slides are very succinct and clear.",
    "Instructor: Xi Chen \u00a0Language ability impairs his effectiveness in communication, both in lecture and one-on-one with students. This is frustrating, especially as a woman in a STEM class, to feel like I am not able to talk easily with my professor. I'd appreciate a new professor for this class who is more relatable and easy to approach, especially considering all of the women in the course. Clearly, Prof Chen means well, but the current format of the lectures impedes my ability to learn. Usually, I'd just become more confused when attending lecture and then would have to learn the material myself or from TAs.",
    "Instructor: Xi Chen \u00a0Great",
    "Instructor: Xi Chen \u00a0Professor Chen is a nice guy and probably knows the subject area well, but I'm not certain that he wants to be a teacher. There does not seem to be much effort to figure out what he wants to teach, how to impart it, and how to assess whether his points are making it through to students.",
    "Instructor: Xi Chen \u00a0Not great",
    "Instructor: Xi Chen \u00a0Great professor! Clearly is very knowledgable and cares a lot about students and their grasp of course knowledge.",
    "Instructor: Xi Chen \u00a0Professor Chen is excellent with one on one explanations - but I found his in class teaching very confusing. Almost like complicating matters too much. For instance, I found his explanation on randomized controlled trials very convoluted, and going only by his words this concept would have been lost on me. I have had much instruction on this concept before, so fortunately I was able to follow. I think it would also be useful for him to sit down with students when asked a question about a group project in order to truly understand the question - my group had a question that was answered in a hurry and the answer was wrong. Unfortunately this setup our project for a frustrating time for the remainder of the class, and it could have been prevented had he told us that our approach was not sound.",
    "Instructor: Xi Chen \u00a0Very patient and is very helpful.",
    "Instructor: Xi Chen \u00a0Professor was great in office hours and clearly really knowledgeable about the topic, but spent too much time just reading off the slides. The classroom energy was low, which was unfortunate because I do think this is an interesting course Also wish he had better supported the class when trying to find a dataset for the final project",
    "Instructor: Xi Chen \u00a0Professor Chen was extremely helpful when approached via email, during office hours, or before\/after class. His lecture style was hard to follow though - the 2 hour time chunk on Monday evenings coupled with Professor Chen simply reading off slides led to the class not being very engaging.",
    "Instructor: Xi Chen \u00a0really wants to be helpful but sometimes the information does not come across well",
    "Instructor: Xi Chen \u00a0Very responsive to students seeking help with the class.",
    "Instructor: Xi Chen \u00a0Great",
    "Instructor: Xi Chen \u00a0Professor Chen is one of the most excellent instructor in YSPH. Nice grading of our exam based on well designed course structure, acceptable workload and really helpful skills of economic metrics and public health skills",
    "Instructor: Xi Chen \u00a0Strengths: Professor Chen is, once more, extremely friendly and approachable. When something from lecture was unclear, Professor Chen was always helpful in explaining or providing more information. Mostly, Professor Chen clearly cares about the subject and about his students. Weaknesses\/Areas to Improve: Professor Chen would benefit from structuring his lectures so as to finish with time for questions during the allotted class time.",
    "Instructor: Xi Chen \u00a0Prof. Chen was extremely responsive and helpful; always willing to take any questions and answer them in great detail. Lectures were well-organized but could be a little difficult to understand at first for someone who had not had a lot of exposure to modeling.",

    "Instructor: Xi Chen \u00a0Strengths: Dr. Chen is passionate about his subject area and is very willing to meet with students to make sure they understand the concepts Weaknesses: Dr. Chen is sometimes so intelligent that concepts come off as very complex at first brush. This is addressed with his openness and willingness to engage students who have questions.",
    "Instructor: Xi Chen \u00a0While a very nice and intelligent professor, he was not engaging as a lecturer. He didn't really have the attention of the students and often was content with students talking over him, which made it hard for the students that were trying to participate to hear what was going on. Again, I think Dr. Chen would benefit from a smaller classroom, at an earlier time, while encouraging more classroom participation.",
