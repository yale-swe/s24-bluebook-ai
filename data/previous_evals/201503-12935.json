    "PLSC 801 is a very nice tour through the field of political behavior, starting with the classics you'll see cited over and over and finishing with recent and influential work. You'll learn about both content and methods, and the assignments will give you an opportunity to explore your related research interests.",
    "An overview of the literature in American Political Behavior, from the early seminal articles to modern cutting edge research.",
    "Strongly recommend this seminar to any student interested in political behaviour.",
    "PLSC 801 focuses on the main issues in the American political behavior field. We discuss the theoretical and psychological conceptions of why people vote, what they think about when they are responding to surveys, and the effects of partisanship. Aside from the theoretical considerations, there is a focus on broadly understanding the quantitative methodology in the political behavior literature in the course. I would highly recommend this course to anyone studying political science or anyone interested in political behavior."

   "comments": [
    "The course greatly expanded my knowledge of the political behavior subfield. The final project was especially helpful for getting my research agenda off the ground. I was able to identify important readings for a number of my interests, both within and outside political behavior, and am now developing a research proposal based on the topic I chose for the project.",
    "This course was absolutely essential to my development as a political scientist. It will contribute greatly to my (future) research and dissertation."
