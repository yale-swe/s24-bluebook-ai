    "The discussions in this class offer the most value to the students. I understand why the course will be moving toward an online system, but I definitely loved the discussions.",
    "challenging me to think differently about conservation issues",
    "I really enjoyed the emphasis on the community of the course and the space that it gave us to talk about our personal experiences with the issues of the course. The openness of the final project was really wonderful--it made me think about what I wanted to do with my life and what I value.",
    "The course gave students the opportunity to ask big picture questions about the universe, the environment and themselves.I think the class size was far larger than optimal for discussion, but the professors did an excellent job of facilitating given this challenge.The course attracted students with diverse backgrounds and discussion provided an excellent opportunity to hear a range of perspectives from other students.",
    "interdisciplinary",
    "This course renewed my energy and optimism about the trajectory of our planet. It reminded me that other parts of the globe still value the environment from an intuitive, intrinsic perpective - one that doesn't rely on logic and cost-benefit anaylsis to make decisions. Our class discussions were so inspiring and enlightening, and it seemed like every student cohort - the foresters, divinity, SOM, and undergraduate students - could participate in varying degrees as the course progressed while learning equally from each other's expertise. Going to class was a joy. This was more than a class. It was a community.",
    "Professor Tucker and Professor Grim have a contagious enthusiasm for the course material, and life in general. They are excellent facilitators of class discussion. They offer unique and rich perspectives to FES that are not represented in other courses, the final project allows students to pursue their own passions and interests in creative ways."

    "Half the readings would do the job.",
    "The Confucianism parts of the course are extremely confusing. I had very little idea of what was going on most of the time during those two weeks.",
    "it was difficult to create and implement a project based on what we were currently learning or hadn't learn yet. I would recommend allowing projects that were based on something earlier in the semester or read Journey of the Universe in the beginning of the semester and use that as a reference to evaluate the remaining readings.",
    "Either define the religion jargon or don't use it. Discussions about specific theories or passages from religious texts were completely lost on me",
    "There were a lot of readings--it was hard to finish them all every week. Also, the selection of religions discussed felt a little random.",
    "A smaller class size would be great, however I don't think it is worth limiting the class size because there is not another course at FES like it.I think a field trip or two would be very cool.",
    "no comment",
    "It might be helpful to provide a little more upfront guidance for our Journey of the Universe projects. If the professors explicitly stated upfront that this project is purposely open-ended and relatively unstructured, then students might feel a little less apprehensive and confused about the project expectations. This might start the creative process a little sooner as students encounter the universe story. In fact, it might be important for students to know that project inspiration may take several weeks to emerge as the universe story unfolds after spring break.",
    "Some concepts and terms could be explained more thoroughly in future classes. For students like myself without a background in religion, some of these concepts were unclear."

    "It just felt right. I intuitively knew this course would affect me in a profound way.",

    "yes",
    "When we talked about religions, I got a little bit lost in the theoretical discussions of the religions. It felt a little bit too academic, and I came out of it knowing a little less than I expected to about the religions. But the portion about Journey more than met my expectations. I never expected that to affect me so much.",
    "Yes, most emphatically yes. I became more adept at expressing myself succintly, using new types of language to express environmental values and morals, and gained confidence in the importance of these elements within F&ES and outside of the school",
    "Yes. I appreciate that I had the opportunity to connect with other students over these issues.",
    "yea it did",
    "Yes, but students should know that this isn't a \"skill\" course. It goes well beyond that.",
    "Yes. I had hoped to explore the ecological foundations of various religions, ESP Christianity, and this course provided an avenue to do so. While I had not expected to learn about the universe story, I found this portion of the class very inspiring."
