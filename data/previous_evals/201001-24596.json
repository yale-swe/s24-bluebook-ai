    "Good science credit.",
    "I would summarize this course as incredibly dull. I felt that the material and its presentation were more suited to a class of middle school students than to a class of Yale College students. As currently taught, the course demanded little effort, and received little in return.",
    "Professors are pleasant. Work not too hard. Topics interesting but also depressing.",
    "I would recommend it; it's a great class.",
    "If you know nothing about sustainability you will probably get something out of the class- if you have taken a couple of sustainability courses you will find that it will be very repetitive. As a science credit goes, it isa good choice though.",
    "Great course. Minimal work (~3 psets, midterm, final paper), great professors (Jay and Dave are quite the duo).",
    "I thought it was very comprehensive in scope but I was hoping it would get into a little more detail and felt it was very geared towards non-science majors and was afraid to get into anything too quantitative.",
    "Yes i would definitely recommend it! Its the perfect science credit: interesting, not hard, few problem sets and a final paper instead of an exam. You will actually be able to use the knowledge you learn.",
    "Take this class.It is extremely interesting, reasonably easy, and altogether worth it.",
    "Very interesting material that is certainly important to know, especially nowadays. The final project is actually pretty interesting, so don't shy away from the course because of the large paper.",
    "Biggest joke class ever.Next to no work necessary on anything.",
    "This class really had a minimum workload, and the subject matter was pretty interesting. The walk to class is really long though.",
    "Very little work...take it if you need a science credit.",
    "This class provides an interesting overview of sustainability issues -- regarding everything from oil and coal to mining for lithium and beyond. It's a good course if you're interested in these issues--even if you're not much of a science person. The information is definitely accessible enough for anyone, and the workload is light.",
    "If you need an SC, take it. Not a lot of work.",
    "Great science class. While the amount of work is not overwhelming, it's not a gut. The topics covered are interesting and informative. I feel like I learned something from this class, which doesn't always happen. You also don't need to know a lot of science to take it, just basic math and a bit of chemistry for one of the problem set. The midterm did not include numerical problems.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. The material is definitely interesting and and practical to know. It is a bit technical in terms of the science, but it is not too difficult to understand.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. Natural Resources and Sustainability provides an in-depth look at current information including the state of our climate and energy consumption, and looks at the different contributing factors and resources, particularly alternative sources. It is an engaging and relevant class, important for everyone as it allows for a more realistic and thorough understanding of topics so important to our environment and also so fundamental to so many aspects of our lives\u0097certainly a foundation of information that informs most political decisions in one way or another. This is a great way to fulfill the science requirement for both science majors and humanities majors who have never taken a science class. It is accessible and widely relevant. As someone majoring in a humanities field, this class actually made me grateful that Yale has a science requirement because it led me to find and take this class. The workload is very reasonable, and you get so much out of the class\u0097so much more valuable a way to spend your time than some of the other options for science classes that from what I hear may leave you questioning the value and relevancy of what you've learned. And the professors are really nice and entertaining. Take the class!",
    "A good overview of the scientific and environmental aspects of natural resource use. Learn about how metal deposits form, where to drill for oil, wind and solar energy availability, the materials used in and impacts of building construction, and so on. If these sound cool to you, this course tells you a bit about all that and more for an extremely reasonable amount of work. The material is fascinating and the content potentially huge, but the actual requirements of the class are not too severe, so you can learn all this cool stuff in a relaxed environment. The lecturers are pretty funny, too. On the whole, a good choice, unless you're especially interested only in one particular aspect of natural resources, in which case go for a more specialised class instead.",
    "This was a good, comprehensive course on the state of the world's resources and the future of them as well.",
    "Basic information on various natural resources, and the topics that concern them - like energy and infrastructure. Very little science&math background required.",
    "yes",
    "This is an interesting class that gives you an introduction to the environmental problems pertaining to energy use. by the end of the course you have a general understanding of the different energy sources, and their advantages and disadvantages. It also gives you a lotof freedom towards the end as there is no final, but rather a short presentation and final paper {topic of your choice}..",
    "This class is a gold mine. After the first week the supplemental readings disappeared. The textbook barely has to be read. There were only four problem sets, and they each take about an hour or two max. There is no lab. All of the questions for the midterm were released in advance. There was no final. The paper is manageable (10-20 pages), and the presentation of the paper was only 3 minutes long.",
    "It is fairly boring, but the subject matter is so relevant that it is worth taking. It's also fairly easy, but you will need to put in the work for the midterm and not rush the problem sets. I came away having learned what I had hoped to.",
    "Definitely take it. Interesting, fun, isn't hard, science credit. You learn about how oil forms, wind energy, tour the Yale power plant, mining, different solar techniques, smart grids. Basically the class has all the interesting things you've wanted to learn more about. Did I mention it's not hard and a science credit?",
    "A good overview of exactly the materials it strives to cover, with the opportunity to find more depth in whatever you write your final paper about, but nothing more. I would with some trepidation call it a gut, though I hope it won't remain that way. There's a lot to be studied and I think the professors are still finding the right balance of work, but it's a work in progress that is worth checking out.",
    "I would recommend the class as a general overview to the linkages between environmental and Geological issue.",
    "I would recommend this class. It's a science credit that's not bogus, and much ofthe course is pertinent and interesting. People our age should know about the different energy options we have and how we can better conserve the finite resources of our planet--this class definitely gets into that. Towards the second half of the semester, material begins to feel less relevant. On the whole, the problem sets are manageable, the midterm is not difficult, and the final paper can be enjoyable to write (10-20 pages) if you pick a topic that interests you. No final exam."
