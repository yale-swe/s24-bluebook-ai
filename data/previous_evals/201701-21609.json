   "comments": [
    "Learned a lot about extreme right-wing movements, organizations, and leaders all around the globe - how they think, organize, react, and mobilize support.",
    "A great understanding of the radical right and there impact on today's society. Also good research and writing schools",
    "This seminar gave me a broad, yet targeted, understanding of contemporary radical right and extremist movements throughout the US and Europe. I developed my ability to compare and contrast movements in different regions, which is a very applicable skill in the field of political science. Additionally, the strict word count limits on the papers forced me to improve my ability to write clearly and concisely.",
    "I learned about the history of the extreme right in both the United States and European countries and how that history lead into the current political movements of today. I also learned how to define the radical right and what demographics are most likely to support radical right ideas \/ what conditions favor radical right parities.",
    "Expanded my knowledge of far right politics both across time and geography. The course allowed me to connect my previous knowledge of fascist movements to contemporary extreme right. It also allowed me to expand my knowledge in mostly European countries to the United States.",
    "I learned more about radical right movements in other countries. I appreciated the international perspective of this course.",
    "Paris's classes have been the most intellectually engaging seminars I have taken at Yale. He brings a very scientific approach to the classroom and won't allow a shaky argument fly. I think his commitment to intellectual honesty is something that should be better appreciated on campus."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Great readings and good quantities. Would have liked to spend more time on the subject of the last class. Also sometimes the case studies ran together a little bit especially about Europe. Small issues overall amazing course would highly recommend",
    "The strength of this course is its scope across the US and Europe over the past century, which enables students to develop a broad understanding of extreme and radical right movement causes and affects. The readings and lecture segments of the seminar assisted in this learning. I appreciated having several writing assignments. However, I felt that there were not clear expectations for the content on the reading responses, and, for many students, they were graded very harshly although they had written a strong response to the readings. This communication about expectations could be improved.",
    "This course could be improved by focusing on a few topics more in-depth. I liked that we got such a good overview, but the topic is so large it could have been nice to zoom-in on a few aspects so to speak.",
    "Including a wider array of right wing groups from other parts of the world can help. Discussing more borderline cases can sharpen definitional critique.",
    "An incredibly comprehensive introduction and examination of far right movements in the US and Europe, both in a historic and contemporary sense",
    "This course does a good job of providing the international perspective on radical right movements. It also includes some interesting readings from a historical\/sociological perspective. The three response papers in this class are graded very harshly. This is frustrating since they must be completed before you get a chance to discuss the readings with the class. If they were due afterwards, it would be much easier to have a better understanding of the readings while writing, since sometimes they could be very dense or confusing. This might detract from the segment of class time devoted to sharing snippets of people's essays, but I've noticed that no one pays much attention during that time anyways, since they're just focusing on what they're going to say when their quote comes up. Also, the professor provides very little guidance as to how to succeed on the papers (until after you've already written them, and your grade is given). This is especially frustrating since he can be very critical of students' work, as well as their comments in class.",
    "Due to the nature of the seminar, it's only as strong as the students that do the readings. Sometimes students don't do this, putting more of a burden on Paris to create levels of engagement."

   "comments": [
    "Highly recommend! Even though some readings may expose you to extremely prejudiced viewpoints, it's extremely pertinent to the current political climate of the United States and therefore incredibly valuable. Professor Aslanidis does a terrific job of engaging with the texts and encouraging healthy discourse about the topics.",
    "Yes!",
    "I would recommend this class to students who are interested in learning about extreme and radical right movement trends across the US and western Europe, and who may or may not have had prior experience with the topic. The course readings and discussions fluctuate between very interesting and quite boring, but that is to be expected with any seminar. The 3 \"reading responses\" are not the same as in other seminars. They are strictly graded and take a decent amount of effort, so be willing to put in the time. I think that I have learned a lot about the radical organizations that are active in the modern western world, and I don't think I would've been able to have this education in another class.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. It was very good for encouraging thought over how\/why political movements occur.",
    "Timely topic, very well-thought, extremely useful for anyone going into politics in the next 10 years.",
    "Absolutely if you have an interest in how extreme right parties can become electable or what tactics they use to rally support",
    "Absolutely--especially if you are not yet familiar with European politics.",
    "Probably not. I didn't like how little guidance we received in writing the reading responses, which were really treated and graded like formal papers (the name is misleading, especially for the first time around). Sometimes class felt very frustrating since it felt like every comment students gave was picked apart. That being said, some of the readings were very interesting, and Professor Aslanidis is still a good (albeit very critical) professor. I think part of the reason why I did not enjoy the class was because of the other students--sometimes you just get seminar environments where the room never really warms up. People in this class never really built off of each others' comments--mostly just qualified or negated them. I also noticed a few students who would just scroll through Facebook until they decided they wanted to talk, and then they would talk for like three minutes straight and force everyone else to listen to them. So I really think the particular mix of people in my class also had a big impact on my experience. That being said, very good professors can usually help to facilitate a more cooperative, friendly discussion environment, and I'm not sure that Professor Aslanidis did that.",
    "Excellent course, you get to delve into the radical right, which is even more sickening than you thought. You learn both about the history of movements in the states and about movements in Europe. The class is very structured, and depending on the day 20-40 minutes will be lecture. The lectures are useful tho, and Professor Aslanidis incorporates a lot of videos, pictures, and other media. In addition to three reading responses you will sometimes be asked to go look at primary sources from right-wing extremist groups and share them with class, which was really interesting and gave those who don't speak a lot to contribute to class discussion. Professor Aslanidis is also good at directing discussion, never allows it to get too off topic, and often interjects open questions that allow you to jump back in even if you lost track of what your classmates where saying. Grading structure is clear and grades are prompt although they can be harsh.",
    "The material covers a breadth of different areas: The origins of Nationalism, anti-Semitism, fascism. It also gets into more concrete examples of far right sentiments, with a particular look at the European parties. All of Professor Aslanidis's seminars are extremely topical and relevant.",
    "Absolutely. The course is incredibly interesting, but Prof. Aslanidis is also an incredibly nice professor and helped me immensely with my writing skills."
