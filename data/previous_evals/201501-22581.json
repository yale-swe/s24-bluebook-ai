   "comments": [
    "A great overview of Japan's foreign and domestic policy making, as well as Japan's role in the world economy. Plenty of different topics about Japan are discussed, I would recommend this seminar to anyone interested in learning more about Japan, and no prior knowledge about Japan is necessary to enjoy the course.",
    "Really interesting. Would reccommend.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class to another student. I came in knowing nothing about Japan and came out with a rich understanding of some of the social and political issues. Perhaps the best thing about the class is the professor. Professor Rosenbluth is one of the best, if not the best, professors I've had at Yale. She knows the material in and out and employs interactive activities to teach what would otherwise be dull material. The assignments are straightforward and Professor Rosenbluth is a fair grader. Take the class!",
    "It's an OK class",
    "A great overview into contemporary issues in Japanese politics, both domestically and internationally with particular emphasis on understanding the way institutions operate within the country. Really useful for anyone remotely interested in East Asian relations and the implications Japanese policies carry with regards to Asia at large.",
    "As someone who was uncertain about this class, I STRONGLY recommend it. It was really interesting, Professor Rosenbluth is a great seminar leader, and I definitely learned a lot about Japan but also many other cross-cutting information and skills."
