    "A great and useful alternative to learning MSA. Shady's a lot of fun and a great and knowledgeable teacher. Watch out though, as midterms and finals can be stressful, partially because Shady is disorganized and will upload them a week or two later than he says they will, but also because the listening is very difficult (often because of sound quality). Taking it after L4 would probably help with being more used to listening to Arabic and also for vocabulary.",
    "A good dialect class, the textbook is good.",
    "definitely, it's a great class",
    "It's a lot of fun! It was the kind of class I looked forward to every day because of its levity, and it is effective at switching you from Fusha to 'Amiya. Plus all the cultural insights. Homework is all listening and speaking, no reading and writing, and the textbook is great. If Shady continues to teach it, it's only going to improve.",
    "I would absolutely recommend the class for aspiring Arabic dialect speakers."
