    "I highly recommend the class. You will not only have to write lab reports and learn to analyse flame data, but also get a chance to lecture to the rest of the class about a topic. This involves doing research into that topic and also helps with teaching skills and cultivating them. A rewarding class where I learnt a good deal.",
