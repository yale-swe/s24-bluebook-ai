    "Learn a lot about the Chinese economy. Super informative class, teacher is the best!! So nice about everything and really laid back and funny. He makes the lectures really interesting too. A LOT of assignments though.",
    "I really enjoyed this class. The topics were interesting, learned a lot relating to China's current situation. Zhang laoshi is amazing and genuinely cares about his students so much. He is very understanding if you have to turn something in late or mess something up. We have a quiz on the reading every class (comprehension or writing vocab), but nothing difficult.",
    "A good course for the overview of the Chinese economy."
