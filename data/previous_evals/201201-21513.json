    "This is a difficult course that continues French 110. I would avoid taking it if possible (unless one likes the FiA videos) on account of the grueling schedule and test-based \"learning.\" If one is willing to put in 20+ hours of work per week, it might be more rewarding.",
    "It's a great class. Professor Ngame engages you and makes you good at French, and you enjoy a lot along the way! After a point, going to French class every day becomes your highlight of the day. The class conversations are great and if you do the daily work, it will really help you acquire an in-depth knowledge of French fast.",
    "If you want to learn how to speak French, take this class. It will be hard and you will hate how much work you have to do, but in the end you'll learn how to speak French.",
    "This is definitely more time consuming than the other languages offered at Yale, but if you really want to learn French, you should take this class.",
    "I would definitely recommend this. French in Action is hilarious but very effective at the same time, and all of the professors are awesome.",
    "French takes a lot of work and time commitment, but if you really want to get a working understanding of French in a very short time, it is definitely worth it.",
    "French 120 is an elementary-to-intermediate course in conversational and written French. It not only teaches a wide scope of vocabulary and grammar, but reinforces the material through repetition, constant review, and practical usage. It's an excellently built course, and I would recommend French 120 to any student seeking an understanding of French.",
    "this class is a lot of work but it pays off if you dedicate yourself to it",
    "Definitely take it with Ngame if possible. He is fantastic and I couldn't imagine it with anyone else!",
    "This class was great, and Professor Ngame is the most amazing professor ever!!! He was so helpful and always enthusiastic! Take French with him, he's truly awesome.",
    "An excellent introduction to the French language, that could perhaps benefit from more rigorous grammatical explanations to students. By the end, you will be able to have simple conversations . . . and that's saying something.",
    "I have learned an exponential amount of French from 120, building off the base knowledge of French 110. Although by no means fluent, I feel if dropped in the country I could survive because I know most of the basics of the language and also the culture. I would wholeheartedly recommend French 120."
