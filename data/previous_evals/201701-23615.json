    "I thought more critically about the links between the current political climate and its parallels in the Roman pastoral genre.",
    "I learned more about Latin commentary and traditional classics classes.",
    "This course was a really great way to get comfortable reading Latin more seriously. I definitely improved my intuition and got more comfortable using context and knowledge of authors' styles to make educated guesses about syntax and vocabulary.",
    "The topic of Roman Pastoralism was discussed in depth through translation and reading of Vergil's Eclogue and Livy's Ab Urbe Condita. Close attention was paid to themes in language. Connection were made between pastoralism in antiquity and American folk\/politics.",
    "I improved my translation skills, learned how to scan and overall began to think more critically about the content of my translations. This was the first Latin course I've taken and Yale, and I really enjoyed being able to connect the texts to other readings\/songs as well as think critically about them as works of literature."

   "comments": [
    "The in class discussion was very hit or miss. Sometimes it was so brilliant and fruitful, and other times it felt that fell flat. I know it's a hard balance to strike, but I felt that sometimes we were in class just translating for too much of the time and we would never do as much textual analysis. Though Prof. Weintritt was good about leading broad discussions or specific discussions about grammar, we never had the intersection of HOW the grammar affected the meaning. I wasn't a huge fan of eComma, though I understand Prof. Weintritt wanted to incorporate technology in the classroom. I feel that it sometimes led to an interesting discussion in class, but it otherwise was superfluous. I didn't find it helpful as a study tool when I tried looking back at comments for the midterm.",
    "The course itself was a bit slow because we spent so much time translating. The Livy in the second half of the course helped direct discussion and insight much better than the Vergil in first half of the course, which was a bit disjointed. I think a bit more time focusing on the connections between Vergil and Livy would a good way to tie themes together.",
    "I would have much preferred more lecturing on the part of the professor and less student discussion. I felt at some points as if time in the class was simply being used up. The mix of non-classics majors trying to get a language requirement and classics majors trying to engage more in depth with the material is difficult.",
    "The strengths of the course were its engagement with different kinds of texts: songs, academic readings, Latin, Greek, and videos. I loved reading and analyzing so many different sources. The weakness of the course were that it tried to do too much of each of these. I would have preferred more lengthy engagement with fewer sources.",
    "Nightly translations were a great way to maintain engagement with the course, as were eComma posts, although I always got stressed about them\/am not sure how much they actually helped with in-class discussions or understanding of the material."

   "comments": [
    "If you need to brush up on your Latin, would recommend. Not always the most interesting texts, but relevant to modernity.",
    "If they are interested in Latin and concepts of national nostalgia, then definitely. But I don't think this class would be engaging if you weren't looking to get those things out of it.",
    "If you are looking for a good intro to reading Latin at Yale, this would be a good option. It felt modern and relevant. I think the comparisons between \"Pax Romana\" and \"Pax Americana\" will stick in my mind for a long time. It really got me thinking in a new way about the significance of Classics for Americans.",
    "If you are looking for a quick one-term L5 credit, this is not the course. This is heavy course that requires a lot of work. That said, Professor Weintritt does make it worth it.",
    "I really enjoyed this course, and it gave a great transition from high school-level, writing down translations Latin to a bit more of an intense, college-level workload. The class was small, as most Latin classes are, which is good to keep in mind if you're looking for a small, discussion-based class."
