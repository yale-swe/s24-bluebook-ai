    "A research class that allows you to learn important methods as well.",
    "I would recommend it because I think doing research is a very valuable experience",
    "CHEM 490 is what you want to make of it. Choice of subfield, lab and project, as well as the amount of time you are willing to dedicate to research on a weekly basis will be the factors that decide your experience with the class.",
    "This is a weird \"class\". It was supposed to meet once a week, but they couldn't find a time that worked for all the students, so it didn't. The poster session at the end was very nice, but I think that was only for seniors and I took the class as a junior. Basically, go work in lab for 10+ hours per week, make sure your professor likes you and the work you're doing, and you're fine. I think it's pass\/fail, so there's not much you can do wrong.",
    "It's required (or an equivalent research for credit course) for the chemistry B.S. and B.S. Intensive. Find a good PI to do volunteer work for first during freshman, sophomore, or junior year, the earlier the better, and try to get a summer fellowship or paid position in the lab before taking this course. I did not and was a bit rushed in the end.",
    "Research for credit to work in a lab",
    "Same research class as last semester. Supposed to have weekly presentations but for some reason the scheduling didn't pan out. The end of semester poster presentation session was cool."
