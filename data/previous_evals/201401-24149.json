    "Overall I really enjoy the EMD seminar and its ability to share interesting research with us. Also, I appreciate that instructors responded to our food requests.One suggestion that I have is that we be provided a schedule of speakers for the semester. This was done first semester, and would have been nice second semester as well. The next issue is that there were regularly problems with signing in -- either the sign-in sheet was MIA or there were problems with the CIRA sign-in...The seminars at CIRA were much more interesting this semester and had better public speakers (Lauretta Grau stood out as particularly interesting and good at tailoring her talk to students). Both special seminars, Bryan Grenfell and Barry Bloom, had interesting talks. The one I found most interesting, however was probably Roly Gosling (malaria control). His topic was a little unusual and maybe even a little controversial, but I learned a lot and was very engaged!",
    "Good speakers, especially like when they are guest speakers from other institutions",
    "Half the speakers are incredibly boring. The other half are simply OK.",
    "Could we pretty please have fewer AIDS seminars? I do care about AIDS and feel it's important, but the AIDS seminars became somewhat repetitive and there is NEVER enough seating in CIRA. More often than not I was on the floor sitting down.",
    "Seminar included a great variety of faculty and guests presenters in various disciplines which provided different perspectives in public health and epidemiology research",
    "Great seminars. Wish it wasn't SO research\/science oriented. It would have been great to have big program planners and other topics.",
    "I liked the speakers but I felt like we had a lot of malaria people.",
    "Good speakers",
    "n\/a",
    "More female guest lecturers",
    "The course was good, providing an introduction to a wide variety of EMD topics. To improve it, I would check for overlaps between the introductory EMD courses and the invited speakers to avoid redundancy."

    "This is a required seminar that is not much work but definitely an interesting one. I would recommend jotting down a few notes to remember the seminar later on--especially names and affiliations of speakers--in case it aligns with your research interests down the road!",
    "Great introduction to different topics a nd research areas",
    "If this class was optional, I probably would only go to 3-4 of the lectures.",
    "A nice selection of EMD topics with a heavy focus on AIDS and everything about AIDS.",
    "Really inspiring talks!",
    "Seminar provides a diverse number of presentations from both faculty and guest lecturers that touch on various aspects of infectious disease research, global and local, focusing on different organisms.",
    "Yes, very interesting speakers.",
    "Yes because it is required. I liked most of the speakers and it was good to see what we can aspire to. However, many of them were scientists and not, in my opinion, very big-picture public health practice oriented. I wish there was a bit more of a mix. I think the CIRA talks were good for providing balance in this regard. Also I liked the pizza. No thanks on trying to be healthy with sandwiches and salad. Pizza all the way.",
    "n\/a",
    "Overall, I would recommend the course to anyone interested in any of the guest speaker topics, and for those looking to get an idea of the goings-on in infectious disease research."
