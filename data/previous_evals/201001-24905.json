   "comments": [
    "I was not a fan. Don't be seduced by the appear of the core idea and the reading list on the first day of class. It was not worth it.",
    "Yes, this is an amazing class. You will stretch your imagination to the limits but leave feeling satisfied.",
    "Take it. You need some intellectual candy to chew on. It is what you expected when you came to Yale.",
    "An excellent seminar mixing the best of literature, philosophy and rhetoric. The weekly readings are interesting and of reasonable length (anywhere from 20 to 60 pages). Deadlines for the two major papers were generous and flexible. Be careful, however, about counting on the syllabus to schedule your work. The professor will repeatedly alter the due dates of items (sometimes moving them sooner), and added multiple assignments to the class over the course of the semester (a short paper and a presentation, along with an optional draft of the final essay). All-in-all an excellent and engaging seminar conducted mostly as a lecture, but with great involvement from both graduate students and undergraduates.",
    "Yes!",
    "Campe is a great professor -- really smart but also laid back. The syllabus was a little disorganized but overall I would still recommend the course to students interested in rhetoric."
