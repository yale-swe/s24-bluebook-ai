    "Immuniobio is the best course ever. It is very well organized, and all the professors are good lecturers (a few of them were absolutely amazing!). This course is a great introduction to immunology, and it's taught by professors from one of the strongest immunology departments in the country. We started out with more things on the molecular level - signaling pathways, receptors, MHC presentation, antibodies, etc. - and then went over more cellular things - development of B and T cells, positive\/negative selection, innate immune system (NK cells, PRRs, complement, etc.) - and then did more applied stuff - allergies, tumor\/transplant immunology, autoimmunity, immunodeficiencies. If you are at all interested in how your body defends itself and how that can go awry, definitely take this course!",
    "I didn't like it nearly as much as I had expected to based on the course evaluations. It's a cell-bio-type class, focused very much on specific details and molecular minutia. The professors are great and really know their topic, but as a result they go very in depth into each subject - without covering any overarching themes or putting anything into context. While I learned the specifics of how a certain receptor worked, I didn't learn how it fit into the bigger picture of, say, fighting disease.",
    "Cell Bio on crack (I think I read that in a previous review. I second the sentiment!). It's a great class, you learn tons, but it's a lot of material covered in a short period of time.",
    "This is a packed but very interesting course. Make sure you actually really like the immune system though, because you will be learning A LOT about it.",
    "Definitely take this class! You learn soooo much from the most important people in the field. It's really incredible. Try to take it CR\/ D\/ Fail though if you can.",
    "A fantastic course covering the most interesting immune system. Classes are taught on the chalkboard so plan on writing a lot, but the professors are all knowledgeable and teach well. Manageable workload.",
    "I would recommend this class but not wholeheartedly. Most lectures were good and sections were very helpful, although the continuity between lectures was sometimes lacking. Exams were difficult and often didn't reflect the material presented. If you're up for a challenge and are passionate about immunology, take it; if not, shop it to see what you think.",
    "Very well organized and well taught class. Tough grading though.",
    "Not the best biology class I've taken, but still decent. Some lecturers were great and some were not so great. There were glowing reviews about the course last year which left me feeling a bit confused, but overall I feel like I did learn a lot about immunology. Be forewarned, the final is really specific, so you will have to do a lot memorization of tiny details. The class was also full of intense premeds and grad students. I'm glad I got an introduction to immunology however and feel that it will be useful for those going into medicine.",
    "Great class. Fascinating material that is the hot topic of biology right now, and it is taught by some of the big names in the field. It can get a little fractured at times with so many professors, but the TAs do a great job of tying together the main concepts in a digestible form. The one thing that's scary about this course is that there is only one midterm and a final, so you really have to make sure you perform well in those.",
    "MCDB 430 goes over everything related to immunobiology. It's excellently taught by nine professors from the med school (Yale has the top immunology department in the world). It's one of the best bio courses you'll take in the MCDB department. What you get out of the course depends on how much you put into it. You don't have to read the textbook to get by, but it's definitely helpful for supplementary material. A couple of take-home assignments, a midterm, and a final. They cover a lot of material, A LOT of material, so it'd be good if you kept on top of your work. Really good course. It complements microbiology nicely, if you're interested in looking at two different sides of the story of infection. The best part? Mucosal immunity!",
    "MCDB 430 is a really great, high-quality biology lecture class. The immunobiology department at the Yale School of Medicine is one of the best (if not the best) in the world, and the course is team-taught by up to 10 highly accomplished principal investigators in the department. My experience with team-taught classes has been pretty bad in the past, but having this course team-taught is actually a significant advantage, since each professor delivers only a handful of lectures on his or her specific topic of interest or topic of research, which means that the lectures are all both highly thorough and engaging. I was never bored during lecture, and it definitely helps that this class is taught entirely on the chalkboard; it\u0092s difficult to overstate the value of having the 50-minute lectures all organized, drawn out, and explained on the chalkboard instead of on terrible PowerPoint slides. The lectures are, for the most part, all very well-organized. The course packet provides an outline and additional notes on each lecture, and is a very valuable resource. The questions on the midterm and final are generally pretty fair, although both exams are very long for the allotted time. There are four take-home questions (limited to one page, typed) which together count for 20% of the grade, which is actually pretty nice. The textbook is incredibly detailed, but if you take good notes during lecture you don\u0092t have to do all the reading. Evening tutorials (i.e. section, but not required every week) were very helpful, though this also depends on your TA.",
    "It's a great class, especially if you're interested in immunology. The professors are all extremely knowledgeable because they are all experts in their field, and they're also all solid lecturers."
