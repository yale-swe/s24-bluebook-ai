   "comments": [
    "I would absolutely recommend this class to a fellow student. It's been a great learning experience. The class is very well organized so we learn at a slow, even pace, and end up coming out with so much knowledge than we began with.",
    "A good class if you have had extensive experience with spoken chinese and some experience with writing. A bit difficult and too fast paced if you truly have never learned any written chinese before.",
    "Chinese 112 is a very rewarding class. The pace of the class is very manageable, as is the workload. I came out of it feeling like I learned a lot.",
    "Most students in this class are conversationally fluent, but reading and writing skills vary a lot. For some students who had had Chinese school before, daily quizzes and reading were not hard, but if you don't have this background, 112 will be difficult. Liu laoshi is a good teacher, and she always made sure to address specific grammar errors that we would make as American Chinese speakers. Your Chinese will improve.",
    "Yes, if you're a heritage speaker, I highly recommend taking this class.",
    "It really depends on the individual's familiarity with Chinese. Since it is a heritage class it is assumed that the students know how to speak Chinese pretty fluently. There is a lack of listening comprehension in the course so choose wisely.",
    "I would recommend it to other students who already have some background in Chinese and want to learn more. It's a great class and the teacher is awesome!",
    "Chinese 112 02 is a level one mandarin language course for heritage speakers. I would recommend this course ONLY if you can already understand and speak Mandarin fluently. Literacy is not a prerequisite for the course. However, the course IS heavily centered around reading\/writing, so any preexisting reading\/writing skills are greatly beneficial. Chinese is a difficult language to pick up and this class is certainly no gut class! As it is a language, the class meets everyday, and you can count on daily homework assignments, quizzes, and oral presentations and cumulative tests to round out each week. It is a challenging but fulfilling course. The instructors go fast, but the exercises are constant, and it is difficult not to notice immediate improvement."
