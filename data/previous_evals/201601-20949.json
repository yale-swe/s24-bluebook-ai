    "Definitely would recommend- great class. Take if it you have any interest in astronomy or ancient societies. Good intro course, I came in with no background and was fine.",
    "This class is awesome for a science credit if you are non-STEM, however I recommend finding a \"buddy\" to work on Psets with because they can get a little tricky at times. The Psets are long and take time, however this class is incredibly fair (both the assignments and exams if you put in the work). You also get to learn some about some pretty interesting things you may never have the chance to learn about again. I definitely walked away feeling like I learned a lot.",
    "amazing course, amazing lecturer, and super interesting stuff. Honestly, probably the most fascinating course I've taken in my 4 years at Yale. I would HIGHLY recommend to anyone remotely interested in astronomy\/the study of how ancient civilizations studies astronomy.",
    "It's a good science credit: pretty interesting material and not so difficult. It's not an easy credit: 10 Psets and two exams and a paper. It can be a bit of work at times. Each pset can take about 2 hours to finish. But if you have interest in the topic and\/or need a science credit. It's a good class to take!",
    "Interesting class, but you will forget things pretty fast unless you really make the effort to understand them.",
    "A class on the history of astronomy, up to the invention of the telescope. 2 midterms, final paper, and weekly problem sets. There are two observing exercises that are easy and kinda interesting, as an opportunity to apply what you learned. Faison is a really good professor, and great at explaining the topics even if you have no background in math or astronomy. His review sessions and review sheets before exams are SUPER helpful, and his exams are very fair. I thought it was a fairly straightforward class, though the psets were definitely longer than they needed to be (usually took about 4 hours each week) and the pset grades depended on which TF was grading them that week. Lecture and section are both optional, but DEFINITELY GO. The TFs were very willing to go over material on the psets that week. I took it for a science credit (not a science or math person at al)l, and it was totally fine and pretty easy because while the first half is modern astronomy and some basic conceptual geometry (no background needed), the second half basically becomes a history class (especially with the final paper).",
    "ASTR 135 is all about naked-eye astronomy and how various ancient cultures viewed the sky. You spend the first half of the semester learning about astronomy from a geocentric perspective, including how the stars and planets appear to move around the Earth. The rest of the course is an overview of the Babylonian, Greek, 16th-century European, Chinese, Inca, and Maya cosmologies. It's a fun course without a significant workload, and you learn a lot about both stars and culture. I would recommend it!",
    "AMAZING! I went into this class just figuring it sounded interesting but left saying \"WOW ARCHAEOASTRONOMY IS AWESOME!\" The class goes through the basics of naked eye astronomy in the first third of the class, before moving on to history of astronomy. The problem sets are quick and easy, and the exams are even easier. Professor Faison is a droll and engaging lecturer. Highly recommended!",
    "Excellent introductory course to practical observational astronomy.",
    "While this class is very interesting and engaging, I would recommend only if you are willing to dedicate around 4 hours every week to your problem sets. Do not come into this class expecting an Anthro course. It is astronomy and you will be expected to do math.",
    "A super interesting class, recommend to all. Not a gut but not awful either, and so worth it!",
    "If you like history and have some inclination for math, then yes.",
    "Take this course if you are interested in ancient history and need an SC credit. It's definitely worth the work, and it is very interesting!",
    "Archaeastronomy is a very good course and is a good science credit for a humanities student. The class is sectioned into thirds where the first third of the class is devoted to naked-eye astronomy; the second, to Babylonian, Greek, and Roman astronomy and calendars; and the third, to Mesoamerica. The most emphasis, by far, was put of the first two sections. If you have little to no background in naked-eye astronomy, the first section will be challenging; this is because there is no text book on which to refer. There are problem sets due every Friday night, but you cant really start them until Thursday night after lecture because only then will you have the information to complete them make sure you take good lecture notes and set aside enough time to complete them. There are two in-class tests and one final paper on a topic of your choice. The tests are challenging, but manageable if you study, go to lecture, and take god lecture notes. Dr. Faison is a good lecturer and has a tremendous amount of enthusiasm for the subject which makes the class more enjoyable. Overall it is a great class and you walk away with a new appreciation for the night sky above you."
