    "I had very little sense of what it meant to do historical or archival research coming into the course, and now I feel like I have a much better idea. So I think the base aim of the course was accomplished.",
    "The course provided instruction on the use of historical and archival methods for political science research. A range of topics were covered, with interesting reading materials, to illustrate the strengths and weaknesses of this methodological approach.",
    "This course taught me how to do historical and archival research! I'd only had a bit of experience, but I definitely learned how to get in there and do it well.",
    "How to conduct qualitative archival research with methodological rigor and how to use this qualitative approach to establish causality."

   "comments": [
    "For the most part, I think the readings did a good job of covering different aspects of the course's material. The only thing I would have perhaps liked is to visit an archive\/do a physical walk through of how to do archival research. Though Melanie Maksin gave a good presentation, I struggled somewhat to imagine doing such work myself.",
    "The course was good but it could have been better. Greater instruction on how to conduct historical and archival research (i.e. the mechanics of it, what to expect, how to go about it, where to begin the design of this type of research) would have been immensely helpful. It would also have been good if there was reading content from around the world (there was a very heavy emphasis on Western Europe). The content covered was interesting and the professor came to class prepared, energetic, and enthusiastic. The allotted class time was too short but an adjustment was made to allow extra 20 minutes in agreement with students.",
    "The readings and discussion were excellent. A little disorganized, but I actually found that kind of refreshing. The readings were probably a bit on the heavy side though, maybe can be whittled down a smidge.",
    "The course was engaging and adaptive to where the conversation went. I have no suggestions for strengthening the course."
