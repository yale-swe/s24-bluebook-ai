   "comments": [
    "Professor Darden is excellent, but this course was less than great because he had clearly stopped caring. The class consists of going over theories in the first half and then going into deep detail about the case study of the Soviet Union in the second half. The theories are very interesting, but were poorly taught. They were explained but not really discussed in class. The Soviet Union part was overwhelmingly detailed (it became a course on why secession happened), and there wasn't enough explanation of its actual importance and relevance to feel like the work was justified. Overall, I would recommend this course if the Professor teaches it with more enthusiasm. As it stands, take this course with the expectation that you'll be frustrated by constant rescheduling, lack of communication, lessons that only make sense in retrospect, and discussions that seem to meander without direction.",
    "I would recommend it.",
    "Take this course if you are interested in moving beyond the typical notions of identity and seek to explore the theories of what causes people to identify a certain way, and when they choose to do so. You will work hard, but you will learn a lot."
