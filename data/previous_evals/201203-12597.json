    "Yes. Well taught (my section) and very interesting.",
    "Pretty standard multivariable calculus course. If you're comfortable with single-variable calculus this shouldn't be too difficult; the formulas are more complicated but ultimately it's the same stuff. Banerjee is a decent professor; not outstanding, but explains everything pretty well.",
    "If you take math 120, just know that though the problem sets and tests start out easy, both get much harder by the final. I liked the class, and based on what I have heard it is better than its engineering counterpart, ENAS 151.",
    "Professor Banerjee is very helpful and is eager to answer questions on tough topics. 2 midterms and a final, weekly homework sets."
