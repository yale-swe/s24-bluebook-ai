   "comments": [
    "Latin biography was a genre generally unfamiliar to me before the class, and reading a range of time periods and authors provided a comprehensive view of how biography changed.",
    "This course has taught me so much about rhetorical analysis and not only the role of Latin biography in the personal and cultural sphere of Ancient Rome, but also the ways biography was crafted and the goals it contained. It also improved my quick reading of Latin, and I believe it has certainly made me a better Latinist.",
    "This course increased my ability to translate latin prose with relative fluency, as well as familiarizing me with the lives of a number of Roman emperors.",
    "The class was a straightforward Latin L5 translation course. Prof. Johnston taught a lot about the genre of biography and its quirks.",
    "Critical thinking on Latin texts and the amount of truth we can really derive from. biographies, and more generally, works of history from antiquity.",
    "Learned more in-depth analysis of authors and their intentions",
    "I improved my ability to read and analyze Latin text, and to place authors as part of a greater tradition.",
    "Questions I'd never thought of about the tension between biography and history, the origin of biography as a genre, as well as some nitty-gritty engagement with the Latin. Suetonius and Historia Augusta were the highlight of the course--especially with the latter, a great introduction to late imperial literary culture and history of modern scholarship and interpretation of this genre-defying work.",
    "I definitely increased my skill of translating Latin, in particular of Suetonius."

   "comments": [
    "This course was well-divided by topic, and organized well to build upon previous topics in a constructive way. My section, however, spent most of the time only going over problem sets, instead of opening up to questions about the material.",
    "The course was primarily translation and",
    "Strength: Interesting, fun, not too much work, straight-forward grading. Weaknesses: None to speak of! If you aren't interested in Roman characters, might be a drag at times.",
    "Excellent course! Professor Johnston is a fantastic instructor.",
    "Hard to imagine a stronger course (without increasing the workload, which is demanding but doable)",
    "I was a little unsure where to put the emphasis: the Latin or the secondary discussion on the reading. On the one hand I really appreciated Prof Johnston's willingness to accommodate any question on any level of syntax, and this helped me with some of the minutiae (though I must confess that I did get sloppier as the term progressed). On the other hand some of the secondary reading were very compelling, especially the earlier ones about genre. Perhaps Prof Johnston could have been a little clearer how he wanted to structure the class.",
    "I dont think there are any weaknesses to the class, I absolutely loved it!"

    "Latin Biography is especially a good class to take for more exposure to historiography. It strikes a nice balance between literary analysis and historical context, and the syllabus includes some lesser-known works, especially toward the end of the imperial period, that are very interesting in their own right.",
    "I would certainly recommend this course to another Yale student. Although I understand that this sort of class is rather self-selecting in terms of student enrollment, it teaches you a great deal in a relatively stress-free way and everyone who can take it should at least consider taking it.",
    "I would recommend this course to any student of Latin.",
    "Definitely recommend, especially to a latin student interested in history.",
    "Yes!",
    "Yes, good for prose analysis",
    "This is a great Latin course for anybody who knows the language well and is interested in comparative study of many authors.",
    "Absolutely! Great class. Learn a lot, but manageable workload.",
    "Easily",
    "Your Yale Classics education is not complete without having taken a class with Johnston. He's an excellent historian and Latinist, and if you're interested in Roman historiography, or questions about genre, this is the course for you. Go to office hours a lot!",
    "Anyone interested in writers such as Tacitus and Suetonius should take this class!"
