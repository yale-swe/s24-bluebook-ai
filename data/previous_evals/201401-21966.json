    "Very useful course for those involved in chemistry research.",
    "A great chem elective- practical and you learn a lot of interesting matetial.",
    "It's okay. Take if you have to, but don't expect the most engaging class ever. Prof. Saunders is pretty chill though, and pretty helpful.",
    "Pretty good if you are interested in learning a bit of theoretical stuff about all types of spectroscopy, although if you are hoping for practical material on how to take spectra, maybe a different spectroscopy class.",
    "A really small class. One midterm and an oral final. Not a lot of work in general."
