   "comments": [
    "This course is similar in format to math 230, although it reaches more advanced results. The course focuses more on geometry and topology than math 230, and gives one computational tools to approach problems in these fields, centering on Stokes' theorem and those relating to differential forms and de Rham cohomology groups. I would recommend this to anyone taking math 230.",
    "This class is a challenge but will reward you with a lot of learning.",
    "If you are dedicated to math and are willing to trade your time for an invaluable educational experience, then this is the course for you. Of course, if you have taken 230, then there is no reason not to take 231 as well.",
    "Math 231 rigorously covered vector calc and linear algebra, in continuation of math 230. It has lots of proofs.Although it is a hard class (we did the third Hilbert problem in the homework, with some hand-holding), we learned a lot of interesting math. Rest assured, you don't have to be a wizard to succeed in this class, so long as you're prepared to put in the work: 10-15 hours a week.",
    "Math 231 is a bit of a wild ride. It is a very ambitious course, and it is good that Yale offers a challenging proof-based math course like 231, which is a tour of linear algebra, multivariable calculus, and introductory analysis, algebra, and topology. It is a good course to take if you are intending to major in math. It is not a good course to take if you are not majoring in math. Though the topics are interesting and critical, they can get lost in the jumble of other topics in the course, as the class moves quickly and, at least this year, explored many topics not in the textbook. This would be fine if the extra topics were throughly explained, but they were often not. The course is a massive amount of time, though it is was less time than 230, the first semester (this depends on the professor). It is a very challenging course, and at times a frustrating course. Frustrating because the material is at times incompletely taught in a rush to get to the next topic; frustrating because the grading this year was at times seemingly random; frustrating because it puts a large and constant stress of a problem set every week that will at times keep you up until 7 the next morning. It was a course that caused me the most pain and worry, but is kind of a necessary course to take if you want to major in math. I'm glad I'm done.",
    "It's really hard!!! But, if you are taking it, that means that you got through 230, so you know what you are getting yourself into. If you love love love proof based math, it's for you, if not...",
    "The spring semester is very different from the fall semester. Much of the material is just leading up to proving Stokes' Theorem. There are whole units on, for example, quotient spaces and exterior algebras that do little more than define terms and prove very basic properties, all because these are the tools you need to get to the crowning jewel of the course -- Stokes'. Because of this, I didn't enjoy this as much asthe fall. But there were still some great, challenging, interesting problems on the problem sets, and a fun diversion into cohomology groups and topology. If you took the fall semester and enjoyed it, you should probably take this semester too.",
    "You've probably done Math 230, so you know what you're in for. I hear my 230\/231 was very different from the norm; the fall was a great deal of analysis, our tests were opposite in intent, etc. But in its form now (which it will remain in, most likely, for at least the 2012-2013 season) it is an amazing class and I learned a lot. I came into the class with only BC and a class of half linear algebra half diff-eqs and was able to succeed, so don't let that be a barrier. Do not take 230 and drop 231; there is nothing, prereq-wise, that is satisfied by just 230 because of the continuity and structure of the class. Even if you took 230 and suffered in the fall (I know I did), you will now have the chance to exercise theskills that you learned and become a better mathematician and person.",
    "I would totally recommend 231 for anyone interested in a math or physics major. You definitely come out 10x smarter than when you came in.",
    "If you survived last semester, you should probably just take it again this semester. It gets kind of easier.",
    "If you liked Math 230, you may also like Math 231!",
    "You should take it, and you will want to take it, especially if Asaf is still teaching it. This course covers integration, most notably of forms on manifolds. The course sticks to elementary stuff, but it's all fascinating, especially the problem sets.",
    "I would highly recommend this class to anyone who completed math 230. Our professor was awesome, and working on the problem sets with friends was just a great experience.",
    "Math 231 is the continuation of Math 230, and if you took Math 230 and enjoyed it, or felt you were gaining a lot from it, I highly recommend Math 231. The homeworks were significantly more difficult and time consuming than any other class I had, but felt worth it, and were all in all not unmanageable or unreasonable (6-8 hours a week for an almost sufficient job, 10-14 for a good job). If it's the sort of thing you enjoy thinking about, I highly recommend it, you will be challenged, but in a very good way.",
    "It's a good continuation of 230. It focuses on integration, which can be a little more difficult than some of the material from Math 230.Bottom line: if you made it through 230, take 231. Just don't take your foot off the gas.",
    "I would recommend the course for Math and Science majors who are willing to take a proof-based course and spend a lot of time working on problem sets."
