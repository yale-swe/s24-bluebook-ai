    "A clear, comprehensive introduction to the topic. I would recommend it as an introductory course, but not as a seminar in which to engage with these works at a deep level.",
    "This is a course focusing on the critiques of power, including many important Western thinkers such as Nietzsche, Foucault, Butler and so on, exploring several significant questions such as that of race, gender, nation and so on. I will definitely recommend it to another student.",
    "I would recommend the course to my fellow students, but warn them, on one hand, not to expect a lot of literary references and on the other hand, to be prepared to be a passive listener than an active contributor given the well-preparedness of some students in the matter. Regarding Prof Smith - there is much to learn from him and his courses if one could only be firm enough to deal with the unfriendly, competitive environment in the English department classes."

   "comments": [
    "Provided me with a more solid basis for work I hope to do in the future.",
    "Majoring in Chinese literature, I have never taken a course of Western theories before. Taking this course is a somewhat eye-opening experience for me. I will surely borrow some of the theoretical concepts that I have learned from this course in my future dissertation.",
    "I attended this course out of a personal curiosity and because I do not work much with theory. In this sense, it did not really contribute to my own research, but it definitely opened some doors for me, clarifying a lot of concepts that I've heard students juggle in classes, especially in the English department."
