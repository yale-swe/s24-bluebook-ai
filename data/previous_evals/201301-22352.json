    "ARBC 140 is an amazing class that I recommend to anyone willing to put the effort, passion and time required to learn such a hard, but fascinating language.",
    "Arabic 140 is the fourth semester in the Arabic sequence at Yale. It is based on the Al-Kitaab part 2 book. I would highly recommend Arabic 140 to all students who are interested in learning this beautiful language.",
    "I recommend Arabic L4 to anyone who really wants to learn Arabic. However, the class is too tedious to recommend for people that are not fully devoted to learning the language.",
    "I found ARBC 140 to be a frustrating and difficult experience -- I would not recommend it unless major changes are made, and unless it is taught by someone other than Muhammad Aziz, who is very kind but who seems to have difficulty teaching effectively to lower-level learners. Classes, as a rule, felt desultory, unorganized, and unfocused; homework exercises were very repetitive and not particularly useful; and the course as a whole focused on vocabulary acquisition to the near-exclusion of new grammar and of practice in spoken language and written composition. My writing has actually gotten simpler, less adventurous, and less accurate -- unsurprising given that the only opportunities to practice compositions of any length were two very poorly defined \"essays\" announced with little warning at busy moments in the middle of the semester. After a wonderful semester in 130, L4 has been a disappointment: I feel I've made very little progress this spring, and I would advise fellow Arabic students to try to do this coursework elsewhere, or to wait until major changes are made to this class and to the way it's currently taught.",
    "I've never rated a course as \"poor\" before...that is before rating this course. It is a shame because Aziz is such a nice guy that you don't want to dislike this course but you absolutely have to. I am pretty sure that my Arabic - and the Arabic of the entire class - got worse this semester. It is simply unacceptable that in an L4 class, the ENTIRE class is permitted to goof around and speak in English throughout the entirety of the class. I question whether or not Aziz came in with a game plan for each class or if he just winged it on a day to day basis. If someone asked me to describe L4 with Aziz in one word I'd say \"frustrating.\"",
    "Yes, if you're willing to work hard."
