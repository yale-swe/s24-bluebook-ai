    "Good course, moves slowly at first and quickly at the end. Liked the class because ME department is so math and theory heavy, that having a useful, practical course in an engineering skill was a refreshing change of pace. I feel like I learned a skill that could actually be applied to real world problems - should happen more in an engineering major. Great professor. Explains and is useful during office hours and generally lax about things that no one should get uptight about (five minutes late on homework), etc. He seems to want to teach a skill, not be nit-picky about logistics, which is what teachers should be like. Good class for a bunch of ME majors who are probably tired of math classes disguised as engineering.",
    "You pretty much learn solid works really well, and get to use some cool tools and machines if you choose to for your final project",
    "If you've used Solidworks enough to know how to create semi-complex geometry, I highly recommend this as an elective. Solidworks is an enormously powerful tool for all kinds of engineers, and this class gives you great practice in using it.Alternatively, if you've never used Solidworks, but you're willing to put in a little extra time in the early parts of the semester to fool around with its features, you'll be totally fine. The class is only overwhelming if you aren't all that interested in learning.",
    "The engineering major at Yale often seems mercilessly theoretical, and this class offers a welcome change. Most assignment involve replicating or creating something in Solidworks, building skills that you will use later. Although Solidworks can be a finicky program, and occasionally you will find yourself frustrated, particularly when running analyses, but successfully finishing it is invariably fulfilling. Two of the assignment require writing basic programs in MATLAB, which can be slightly troubling if you are unfamiliar with MATLAB, but are equally fulfilling once finished. The midterm covers the history of computer graphics and CAE, which is speciously related to Solidworks yet nonetheless interesting, and there is no final (you give a presentation on your final project during the normal time slot). Take this class if you are a mechanical engineering major."
