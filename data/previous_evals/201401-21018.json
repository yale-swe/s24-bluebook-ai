    "If you've taken L3, and are debating whether to continue, I would recommend that you stick with it and take L4 (try to get Rosamaria or Sebastian Diaz). I learned SO much more in L4 than L3 and I really felt the improvement, even though at times the workload was a lot, especially towards the end of the semester. Though it was more demanding of a course than I expected, it was very worth my time and I feel prepared to try an L5 class and feel more comfortable conveying my thoughts in Spanish. I also learned so many new grammatical structures.",
    "Spanish 140 is a continuation of 130, just a tiny bit more difficult and with a tiny bit more material. I would recommend Spanish 140 to everyone!!",
    "I would definitely recommend SPAN 140. It is very similar to SPAN 130, but with a focus on some more advanced grammar topics. While it is definitely more work than a one-credit class, the workload is definitely reasonable for a 1.5-credit class.",
    "Spanish 140 will be more difficult than previous Spanish courses, but in the end, your ability to utilize the language will be well worth the effort.",
    "Span 140 is a course which will absolutely help you develop your proficiency in the spanish language. The work will be moderate over the semester, but will increase in quantity and difficulty as time progresses.",
    "It's a considerable amount of work, so keeping up daily is really important. However, it improves your Spanish a lot with quite a few new verb tenses and lots of speaking. It' worthwhile for those genuinely interested in improving their Spanish skills.",
    "You can definitely feel like you are beyond elementary Spanish as you read and discuss ideas relevant to the adult world, like the economy, politics and literature and you will pick up new vocabulary because you will use it in these discussions. Taking this class will certainly help you improve your speaking skills so you will sound more educated, though you may still have plenty of progress to make toward fluency after."
