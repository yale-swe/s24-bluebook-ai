    "This course taught me a lot about molecular biology techniques and what the things I learned about in intro bio courses look like in the lab. It also prepares students well for writing scientific papers.",
    "I learned a LOT! I learned how to do a ton of basic biology lab procedures and how to write research reports. I also learned a lot about biology itself which helped with coursework in other classes.",
    "I gained many skills in this course. I learned how to pipette, how to run a gel, how to prepare a PCR reaction, how to properly keep a lab notebook, and most importantly, how to write a research paper. This class was a great introduction into working in a lab.",
    "I learned the biology lab techniques of PCR, AGE, and purification. I learned how to maintain a lab notebook and write a manuscript."

   "comments": [
    "The primary weakness of this course was organization -- it was difficult to follow what was going on and information was kind of spread out across canvas. However, the Professor and TAs were very dedicated to a genuine learning experience, and while challenging I definitely learned a lot.",
    "The strengths of this course are that it just throws you straight into a biology lab to start learning. The weakness of this though is a lot of frustration and confusion at times as you learn things on the fly.",
    "I think this class is a great introduction into lab work. I think Professor Moreno is very approachable and helpful, as were the TFs. I think this class would've benefited from being a bit more structured. I would've appreciated having clearer instructions and more examples of good scientific writing.",
    "A strength is that it teaches you how to maintain a lab notebook and write a manuscript, which is important to learn if I want to do research in the future. It could be improved by having clearer communication between students, professor, and TAs. Concepts should be able to have been explained in lecture or practiced more thoroughly, and the plan of the class day should have been more clear before students come in. Many times there was miscommunication in what the professor wanted from us, and what the TAs understood we needed to do. There was never a clear lesson plan for the day which made the days more stressful and confusing than it needed to be. I also wish I had received more feedback during the class. The only time we received feedback outside of the manuscript rough drafts was during the final grading of them, which isn't helpful because then we can't improve (This is concerning the lab notebooks and lab performance (which we got no feedback on). The class could have been executed more clearly."

   "comments": [
    "This is a lab with a high workload (some weeks I spent 20+ hours on lab assignments) but that was really just one week and most weeks aren't too bad. It's nice because for the most part, all of the work you do is meaningful -- it involves preparing a manuscript format lab report of what you're doing. While this can be stressful since we're not really doing enough to write a manuscript about, it was not too bad with advice from TAs. Overall, if you want to learn real techniques and really get a feel for research, this is a good course.",
    "I would, if they were ready to do work!",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to another student. I think the class was very interesting and acquainted me with scientific research and writing.",
    "No I would not. Although I did learn a lot and grew as a scientist, it was one of the most stressful classes I've taken at Yale because you never know what's going on. It was truly four hours of stress, doing one technique, and waiting to be told what to do. I felt this class was unfair to people who had never worked in labs before or don't have scientist friends\/relatives because writing was difficult, and understanding the techniques was difficult without having prior experience. It was so stressful knowing that you had to get a technique right the first time or else you'd be a day behind everyone else."
