    "Spanish 140 is the followup for Spanish 130 and finishes the textbook with all of the grammar points and vocabulary. It is a very basic understanding of the language but requires a lot of work to maintain a good grade. Be ready fordaily Psets and quizzes\/tests\/compositions most Fridays. I would recommend the course to those who need to finish off their Language requirement, but this teacher in particular will make you work more than some of the other 140 teachers. If you feel like you can handle that, then go for it. If not, you might want to find another section.",
    "If you have to take it, then take it with Leon",
    "SPAN 140 is serious work. No kidding, it will take a lot out of you to keep up. There are almost-weekly evaluations in the form of quizzes, tests, compositions, and presentations, but fortunately nothing is too large a percentage of your grade. These evaluations are all fair, and after the first of each, you will get a feel for the expectations and be able to prepare accordingly. I will say though, while your grammar and reading abilities will greatly improve, your speaking ability will not. That was, sadly, not the focus of this class. If that is why you want to take this class (as I did), you should really just take your L3 knowledge and find a way to go abroad. There are tons of fellowships and programs out there, and I am certain that you will get a lot more out of them than this class, if you just want to learn how to converse in Spanish. Make sure you really want to take this class (as in READ the syllabus and evaluate for yourself the workload) before you commit. Again, it will be a LOT of daily and weekly work.",
    "L4 was way more work than L3 and teh grading was harder. We had a test, quiz, or composition every friday for the last like 4-5 weeks of the class.",
    "This course is full of busy work and drudgery. I believe it is completely possible for one to gain a large amount of understanding and knowledge from the course if the professor is passionate about making sure that students learn however a dispassionate professor can make coming to the class everyday a true struggle. If you don't have tot take the class for a language requirement, try to find a teacher with good reviews and then take it.",
    "It's a lot of work and you only spend about 15% of the time speaking spanish",
    "Even if you enjoyed Span 130, think twice before taking this class. The homework and the few projects take up a lot of your time outside class,and it's much more difficult to get a really good grade in Span 140 than in 130.Professor Leon is cold and impatient, and the atmosphere she creates in the classroom is one that makes you feel like junk for not knowing something well enough. I would say that most of my problems in this course were with the instructor and not with the course itself."
