    "It is a good course if you are interested in how enzymes work from a molecular level, in how structural data is obtained, or how to target an enzyme for regulation by a small molecule inhibitor. I would recommend this course to those interested in these areas since I found the lectures interesting and informative.",
    "I thought it was a very good class and would recommend it to other students. It provided a very useful overview of structural pharmacology, by teaching us about the various techniques used, basic research in the field, and its applications to medical problems.",
    "Yes, although classes vary depending on the lecturer.",
    "A course designed to introduce biophysical and structural biology techniques with the ultimate goal of explaining how these techniques can be used to develop drugs based on the structure of the drug target. I would only recommend the course if the student had a desire to enter in to this field or has previous knowledge. If not, the student may feel lost."

    "I know a lot more about how structures of proteins are determined, and how they can be targeted by small molecule inhibitors. I will probably not work on making structures in the future, but I will know how to interpret a structure better if I am working on a protein whose structure has been solved.",
    "This course helped deepen my knowledge of my discipline by teaching a lot of important concepts in structural pharmacology. It was also useful in that many of the topics covered will either be directly applicable to my research or will help to give me a more thorough understanding of papers in topics related to pharmacology.",
    "I did not know about structural biology methods before I came in the course, and now I feel I have a good backbone with which I could build off of if I chose to do so. With that said, I don't think it will help me so much for my research. I think individual lectures could be helpful (kinases, RTKs) were very helpful, but the others, no."
