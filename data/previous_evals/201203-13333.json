   "comments": [
    "Take it, it's a fantastic opportunity for those who have barely ever tried playwriting (like me), or those who simply want to work and enhance their tool.",
    "This is a cool class, and Sarah Ruhl is extremely endearing and low-key. It is a pretty unstructured class, and you don't learn a lot of concrete things about how to write or revise a play. You often get to share your work with the class, but the workshop structure is loose and not that helpful. Students often just say what moments stood out from your work,so you still don't know how to proceed moving forward. If you want to take a casual class where you read some plays and do some exercises, take this course. But if you want more rigorous training about how to craft a play, this probably isn't the right class.",
    "What an amazing class! Lots of writing exercises coupled with lots of reading means you get immersed in plays. We had plenty of guest speakers and a lot of really interesting discussion on different formats of plays.",
    "This class was an incredible treat. It featured class discussions with many famous visiting playwrights, a syllabus of inspiring work, and the chance to learn about playwriting from Sarah Ruhl, who is successful and currently working in the field. If you are interested in playwriting, professionally, or perhaps staging something you've written with undergraduates, then this would be the class for you. Writing classes, unfortunately, are always difficult to be admitted to, but if you are admitted to a playwriting class, take it! You will learn so much from the small workshop setting, and really grow as a writer.",
    "Perhaps my favorite class at Yale. Professor Ruhl is astonishing. She is smart, funny, understanding, and, above all, a truly warm individual. My writing improved by leaps and bounds in her class. She makes you feel like you could become a professional playwright and everything would be just fine, which is not an easy feat to accomplish. I will never forget her class.",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone interested in playwriting.",
    "YES. This class will make you a better writer, reader and listener. You will grow as a writer and an artist.",
    "One of the very best, if not simply the best, class I've taken at Yale. Such careful structuring of themes, reading, writing prompts, and conversation (often in non-obvious ways) payed off beautifully to create a vibrant forum for discussion and discourse. The class began to feel like a writing group and a genuine community (to an extent that is rare even among Yale writing courses). Be tenacious in asking for very specific feedback, and you will receive riches. Sarah Ruhl is as amazing a teacher and as lovely a person as you're hoping she will be. You'd actually be crazy not to take this class, especially once you already have an intro-level backing in structuring plays; this is definitely more useful as an intermediate\/advanced course than your very first intro to playwriting.",
    "I don't think it matters because I don't know if it'll be retaught--the answer would have been a yes."
