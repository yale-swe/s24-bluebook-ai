    "This class is a good overview of key debates and problems that happen in today's world because of the phenomenon of the multinational corporation, and the benefits and harm they cause in various countries. You'll get more out of it if you have at least a peripheral understanding of the world economic system and the history of the world economy since 1948, or especially if you know about some good cases of CSR or sovereignty issues in specific countries.",
    "The class focuses a lot on FDI, but because that's what I was expecting I found it really enjoyable. The country presentations are interesting and informative, and the class made me think a lot about big picture issues that I wouldn't have otherwise delved into.",
    "Unfortunately, no, I would not recommend it - at least if you've studied some international development, transnational corporations, or other such subject before. The readings are pretty boring theoretical frameworks which epitomize everything dull and useless about political science without teaching you anything at all. The professor is an awesome, awesome guy and has great stories and anecdotes but unfortunately he does not lead a good seminar - class meetings are story-laced rambles about very little, where discussion is occasionally included to accomplish I'm not sure what. I think I learned next to nothing in this class.There are student presentations for the middle 5-6 weeks of the semester; I don't know if this was just our class or what, but they were some of the worst presentations I have ever seen. No one took them seriously.It's too bad because I thought this would be a great class, and I also feel terrible saying not to take a class with LaPalombara. To be fair, it's almost worth doing it just to hang out with the professor at dinner at his house at the end of the term... and it's so little work, just 3 short papers and a final exam\/paper.",
    "I would recommend the class, but it is a lot of work. You do learn a lot and it is interesting material.",
    "I completely recommend this to students. It's popular and pretty difficult to get into if you are not EP&E or Political Science, but he does like a little diversity. The course covers the relationships between multi-national corporations and host governments when dealing primarily with foreign direct investments (FDI).",
    "I loved this class. A lot of the reading tends to repeat itself, and you'll find many themes repeated throughout the semester, but Prof. LaPalombara is great. he's super nice and knowledgeable, and his real world experience is incredible.",
    "I'd say take it. Not too much work. Interesting class discussions. The reading isn't always the most stimulating stuff in the world, but class is really fun.",
    "A good overview of a specific topic. Ideal for anyone interested in FDI or learning about global politics or business through a specific lens.",
    "Good course on a highly specific topic- FDI. You'll be able to tell very quickly if you're interested or not. The readings tended to be pretty long and dry, but Prof LaPalombara does a great job of choosing pieces that present important arguments. Definitely shop the class-- the prof is a superstar, and if you like the topic, it's a great class."
