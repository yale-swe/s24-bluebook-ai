    "Take this class if you're ok with spending long hours of the weekend on the problem sets. They start off hilariously easy and end up taking a good 10-20 hours each. The lectures are good but plan on spending some time on Stack Overflow etc finding more info. Piazza tool is marginally helpful; instructors rarely respond, particularly to important logistical questions. Not particularly well organised. The assignments are pretty fun.",
    "basically self learn the material and apply that to the psets. very rewarding. you actually learn a lot",
    "I guess you will take it if you have to take it (like when you want a QR credit or want to count it as one of your major requirements). It's a good course to learn quantitative reasoning, but be prepared to learn most of the materials by yourself.",
    "The material of this course is really interesting. It's mostly Java but you learn some important computer science logic regardless. However, lectures are absolutely awful (completely disorganized, dry and useless), and you'll find you just have to learn this stuff on your own, work on psets with other students and ask TFs for help. The material is interesting, but this course basically ruins it for you. Also, psets are hard compared to what is discussed in lectures.",
    "Very difficult. Not an intro class you will enjoy much.",
    "BFordz is the best. Hands down. That being said, I almost never payed attention in class, never went to section, and still never got less than a perfect on the psets. Start them early, actually do them, ask for help when you need. Google and StackOverflow are your friend. Put the effort in to actually code and not just skim the book and you'll do fine.",
    "Don't take it. Take CS50 instead. Waste of time.",
    "Pretty fun class b\/c CS is fun and 112 is fun, the psets are fun. However I barely went to lecture after the first 10 or so because they were super boring.",
    "I think the material covered in the class was very interesting, however I am hesitant to recommend the course to another student as I found that the actual lectures were very boring and not helpful, which required teaching yourself a lot of the material.",
    "I would recommend this to anyone who wants to learn the basics of programming. If you aren't interested in the subject, you won't enjoy the class. If you actually want to learn though, you will find this class very beneficial.",
    "If you think in a very logical mathematical way, don't take this course. If you don't think this way, don't take this course. Just don't. You can teach yourself java online. Seriously there are SO many tutorials and walkthroughs out there. Don't repeat my mistakes, this is an awful class. Maybe with Harvard's help, it might be a decent course, but otherwise, just no. Don't do it.",
    "I recommend CPSC 112, but not if it is taught by Bryan Ford. His lectures were quite dull and often difficult to follow. In addition, he missed probably 25% of the classes and the TF who lectured most often in his absence was pretty much totally incompetent (admitted that she was \"not all that familiar with Java\"). Overall, I think that the teaching of the course was far below the quality that one can reasonably expect from a school of Yale's caliber. That being said, I definitely learned some useful programming concepts (mostly from doing the problem sets).",
    "If you've never taken a computer science course before, CPSC112 will teach you a lot about programming. It will not only teach you about Java, but it will improve your logical thinking and reasoning skills on the whole. A large percentage of the class did not attend lecture regularly, and much of what was said in lecture could be learned from reading over the lecture slides. Expect some of the problem sets to be pretty time-consuming (especially when they begin to get more complex after the 2nd or 3rd one). The TA\/peer tutor office hours were a huge help for this course!",
    "The material is a good introduction to programming but the teaching is sub-par. Most of what I learned was from the book or the peer tutors. I would not recommend this class to a student that is not willing to learn the material from the book.",
    "Would recommend the course to another student. Don't take it if you have extensive programming knowledge (please, this course is for people who have little to no experience!). Psets are interesting, but lectures were not for me (Professor Ford is leaving though, so you'll have a different prof). Usually hear good things about other CS professors, though.",
    "I was very frustrated with this class, but I think that was more a result of the poor organization and professor (who isn't teaching this course next year, so don't worry about that). PSets for me were really hard, and they increase significantly in difficulty as the year goes on (don't be fooled by the first couple of psets you have. There will be psets later on that can take over 10 hrs, if you have never seriously coded before). Be prepared to do a lot of self-teaching and researching for code, and take advantage of office hours.",
    "I would say that it was a lot of work and often stressful, but that I greatly appreciate the skills I got from it. Before recommending it, however, I would ask that they look into other options.",
    "It is a good intro programming class that is pretty challenging. However, some of the logistics must be improved before I would recommend taking this class. I just wanted to get some experience coding, and this class fulfilled that goal. However, it was a struggle and I had to put a lot of time into the problem sets.",
    "I would say take it credit\/d and don't take it with Brian ford",
    "I think intro to compsci is an essential course for everyone because in this day and age, everyone should have at least an elementary understanding of computer science and programming. This course definitely prepares you for that. However, if you don't feel super confident, you may want to take it credit\/d\/fail.",
    "Terribly taught this semester, but hopefully you'll have a better course in the future.",
    "If you want to learn how to code in Java, this class will teach you how to code. However, the psets take an enormous amount of time and the class is quite difficult.",
    "It is a challenging course that requires a lot of time to work on the psets, but the work is rewarding. If you have the right professor this could be a great introduction to computer science.",
    "You have to take it for computer science, but if you have previous programming experience, you should probably skip this course.",
    "A class worth taking if you've never programmed and need some motivation to get you started (like me). Class itself isn't much to speak of but you can teach yourself from slides and psets. Go to office hours! If you are good at thinking logically the class is quite manageable even without any background (but psets will still take time).",
    "Pretty bad class. Psets don't go along with material presented in class or the textbook, and to complete them you often have to go to TAs who sometimes aren't really familiar with the psets. It's really not fun and turned me off to proganming.",
    "I would recommend this class. The problem sets are interesting and you mostly learn on your own playing with the software or in the TA sessions, which are available at most times during the week. While sometimes the problem sets were pretty time consuming, I would still take the class because they are fun to get done.",
    "Do it! Workload is not too high, you don't have to go to lecture if you don't want to, and 75% of the grade are your psets. Also, programming is dope!",
    "I would, but be wary of the workload! Keep up with the materials and the problem sets! Do a lot of practice as it is the only way that you will learn in this class.",
    "If you want to do a lot of coding I would. Sometimes I was frustrated with how long the psets took, as i felt like I hadn't really learned anything in class and was forced to do it myself through painstaking effort.",
    "If you have some programming experience, I would recommend the class. The class starts out ok, but the material is cumulative, so the class becomes really difficult after the first few weeks. The first three problem sets are ok, but a lot of problem sets after could take 10+ hours, so you might have to spend a lot of time in office hours. The exams were really difficult since you have to have some intuition in writing code to solve problems on the spot.",
    "Don't take this class. It is so hard. I took it Cr\/D\/F and it was still so stressful and a drag on my semester.",
    "If your goal is to gain basic proficiency at programming java, then this is a good course to take. By the end, you'll probably be a decent programmer (or at least for the basics). There is not too much work (there is some, but rarely loads) - maybe 5 hours a week on average, some more than others. Very little more theoretical computer science stuff is covered.",
    "Java. Take if you're considering more courses in CS. 101% sure CS50 will be more fun than this java course.",
    "Series of programming problem sets that become more and more time intensive. Interesting class!",
    "If you want to learn Java and get an introduction to how to code, this is the best option you have at Yale. Although, the course is by no means really engaging, and the bulk of the learning must be done outside of the classroom on your own due to poor teaching and course administration.",
    "Probably a useful set of skills for many people in many departments, but make sure you pace yourself. Go to office hours, don't start psets the night before they're due, and have fun with it.",
    "When I took this class with Bryan Ford (who, I've heard, teaches the upper level classes well), I didn't find the lectures to really be helpful or engaging and the slides weren't that useful. But for this class, most of the learning was actually done through the problems sets. They start of really easy but suddenly get more difficult and can take many hours to finish. You do get to learn how to think in an algorithmic manner even if it is at a basic level. When working on psets, I never felt burdened by the work and it's a great feeling getting your program to finally work. Take this class for the problem sets! (It's a weird thought, but learning is done through psets). The exams weren't bad and mostly involved writing short pieces of code by hand.",
    "Good for introduction, prepare to work hard and devote a lot of time to the course",
    "I truly hope that CS50 is an improvement, though I imagine it would be hard to get worse than this.",
    "CPSC 112 is a good course for learning the basics of programming in java and thinking like a programmer. The content is interesting, the P-Sets are long, and the lectures are terrible. It's decent class other than actually going to class though.",
    "I would recommend this course but you need to put in the work. The psets are very time consuming.",
    "If this class is still around, don't take it! You will be disappointed. The course was a logistical train-wreck; you're much better off buying the textbook and reading it on your own. Or try a free coding tutorial online. You will learn just as much with fewer wasted hours.",
    "CS112 is a very okay course. The lectures were far from helpful, but the Psets were great. These homework assignments count for close to 75% of your grade which was excellent. Tests were difficult but doable; although they barely mattered anyways. Easy to get a good grade, but overall I would recommend that you avoid it and either skip to 201 or take CS50 online.",
    "DO NOT TAKE WITH BRYAN FORD. This class was unbelievably poorly taught. It was clear the professor didn't care about the class in the slightest. The slides were used from last year with no modification, the professor didn't teach half the classes, and very little help was given. Overall, I was extremely disappointed.",
    "DON'T TAKE THIS COURSE UNLESS YOU ABSOLUTELY HAVE TO. I decided to take CPSC 112 instead of waiting to take CS50 next semester, and I regretted my decision every day. Yes, I learned Java, but I learned it in a highly disorganized environment. Honestly, this course just seemed really neglected (perhaps because CS50 is making its debut at Yale next year?), and thats a shame for an introductory course to a subject that many people are interested in. So take it if you must, but seriously consider checking out your other options first.",
    "I would recommend Intro to Programming to someone who has never programmed in their life. I took AP Computer Science in high school, which is also a course in Java programming, so just about his entire semester was review for me. It was an effective review, and I feel much more secure in my Java abilities now. But it was a review. Because of this, in general I found the course to be a bit too easy. The problem sets usually did have interesting problems though, and I was usually left satisfied with my work. Bottom line: it is a good course but for someone with a year of experience in basic Java programming, it was too easy.",
    "This class was poorly run and constantly stressful for many of the students enrolled. Numerous people dropped the course throughout the semester, up until the very last day of class. If you're wanting to learn Java, buy the book or use online tutorials because you'll learn more that way. If you're wanting this course for a QR or something, do not take it, it will ruin programming for you. It is a really good thing they're bringing a new introductory programming class to Yale next year, because this class was miserable.",
    "good. not well run this time around",
    "An excellent intro to Java. Bryan isn't going to be here next year, but I would recommend this class over cs50 because it gives you a true in depth understanding of Java.",
    "Take it if you want to put in 10+ hours of work per week.",
    "Good class for intro. TAs are way more helpful than the professor",
    "This class wasn't very enjoyable. First off, there's not a lot of organization between the people running this class. The TF's had an issue with grading where students got varying grades for certain errors. Also, lectures can be extremely boring and are mostly unnecessary, but skipping the wrong ones can hurt your performance drastically. The work can be very time consuming. I would wait for CS 50.",
    "For those who think they may be interested in programming, CPSC 112 is a great course to begin getting exposure to programming. If on is interested in future programming courses at Yale but has little to no prior experience with programming, CPSC 112 is a great introductory course.",
    "Bottom line: TAKE CS112 OR 201. DO NOT EVER TAKE IT OR A CLASS WITH BRYAN FORD. CS112\/201\/Programming is an essential skills for life. it is interesting and very challenging but worth it. You could also learn it on your own but that is better said than done at a place like Yale I personally need the discipline of a course that influences my grade. *These comments come from a student who did fairly well on the course but struggled immensely and empathizes with the hundreds of others who did the same. The problems mentioned are assuredly representative and verifiable Ive spoken to too many students about this. Problems with CS112 in Spring 2015: -Professor did not know how to teach intro students -Professor did not care about students or their well-being -Professor did not train or talk to TAs -Professor magically decided to introduce a final exam and change the syllabus in the middle of the semester -Professor pretended everyone understood what he was saying in class and rushed through everything -Professor missed many classes and handed them over to people who taught them worse than he did (which is formidable! With a few exceptions e.g. Danny). -Professor never answered his emails or addressed questions about grading, final exams, midterms, problem sets, course logisitics etc -Professor could not name a single student in class (it was 20 students by the end really the rest stayed at home and didnt attend lectures) -Professor was moving to Sweden it was his last semester at Yale University -Some TAs just never showed up to office hours. Sometimes, they cancelled at e.g. 3 40 when their office hours were set to begin at 3 30. Some skipped office hours on the final deadline day of the problem set, butchering many students grades. And no, in a horribly taught course like CS112, still doing the problem set until the very last day is totally legitimate! Do not blame the student. -TAs often just explained how to do problem sets and not the concepts they didnt know\/remember\/care WITH EXCEPTIONS (Danny, Sam, Jeremy etc) -Grading policy, midterms, final exams and everything about the course were mutable, mercurial and mysterious Observations good\/bad: -Exams are very very hard and ridiculously short in terms of allowed duration. The final pretty much took me 3.5 hours. Problem sets after the 3rd one take like 15-20 hours. They are complete black-boxes of unfamiliar material. -Yale needs to care more about its CS department. -The class has its usual people who come in with far more programming experience than others. That affects the curve. But dont be deterred by this this is exaggerated by many. -CS at the end can be reduced to things youve done or problems youve tackled in Mathematics and Physics. Look at CS112 in those terms if youre unsure whether to take it.",
    "A good course for beginners, but only if you want to work independently and teach the material mostly to yourself. Could be improved. Midterms and final exam and unreasonably difficult.",
    "I would recommend it as an introduction to programming and as an interesting class that teaches an important skill. But it is also a lot of work and often it feels that you don't have the necessary preparation to go about doing the problem sets. However, I did learn a lot from peer tutoring and from figuring out the problem sets with friends.",
    "The worst class I have taken at Yale. The PSETS are long with the material necessary to complete never being covered in class except for in concept and in simple examples. The teaching was terrible.",
    "Awesome to learn. You feel very accomplished and develop problem solving skills. Very time consuming problem sets. But doing them is where you learn the most.",
    "Yes it's a good class for QR.",
    "A great intro to java and a good way to get into computer science.",
    "The PSets for this course are a lot of work, but learning a little bit about computer science is incredibly useful, interesting, and (I believe) important in our technology-driven age. Take this course if you are willing to put in the effort! PSets are fun and you will learn a lot.",
    "Do not take this class if you don't have any experience in programming. It will ruin you. And half the class should be in upper level courses, but chose this one because they are scared. The curve will screw you.",
    "CPSC 112, in theory, is a very nice introduction to programming with computers, with aspects of basic computer science and web programming thrown in. In theory, it should be a great course with a large, yet manageable amount of work. In reality, CPSC 112 with Bryan Ford was a disaster, since he was such a terrible teacher. I would ONLY recommend this to another student if he does not teach it, but since he is leaving, he is making this decision for me. Since computers are in every field of study today, this class is a great way to learn the art, science, and language of programming, as long as Bryan Ford does not teach it.",
    "The spring 2015 iteration of this course was pretty disappointing. You really do learn from the psets, but they are not an extremely comprehensive overview of all of the concepts and the stuff taught in class is not particularly engaging or well-explained. Tread carefully with the lecturer if you need to go to class to learn, but otherwise it won't make a difference because you can learn everything you need to know from the textbook. By spring break, we had about 40 kids in each lecture (out of 200 or so).",
    "I would cautiously recommend this class. The lectures are very boring and it was a struggle to force myself to attend (the powerpoints were thorough, so this wasn't entirely necessary). However, the problem sets were interesting (though very time-consuming) and it is a good way to get your feet wet with programming.",
    "Yes, because it's a good skill to know. But depending on who is teaching, just know that you might have to teach a lot of the material to yourself. Also, signing up for a tutor is very useful! At the end of the day, though, you'll leave the class understanding programming concepts and some of the language used, which is a good start.",
    "Very good intro course",
    "This class is incredibly frustrating. The concepts aren't that hard but it is so poorly run that you will end up stressing about it anyways. For example, my second PSet wasn't graded, so I went to talk to the professor about rectifying the mistake, and the professor kept redirecting me to the TAs to solve the problem who kept redirecting me to the professor, and everyone kept saying they would solve the problem and then id never hear from them again, and now, 3 months later, my PSet still isn't graded!!! And final grades are out!",
    "Really good class, but the psets make it. Lecture was awful - needs to be more engaging. Still so worth taking though, even if you don't want to take further programming. Such a fun and interesting concept that teaches you to look at things in a new way.",
    "CPSC 112 is a great course if you're looking to learn Java. Make sure you start the problem sets early! If you run into a problem, you'll need plenty of time to fix it and troubleshoot.",
    "Great class if you put in the work and time. The problem sets were awesome-- cool practical applications that really used what we'd learned in class. Unfortunately, it wasn't really worth it to go to lectures-- Professor Ford just read off the slides, and it was easier to read them on your own in a quarter of the time. Definitely go to office hours for help! Definitely would take again, great class.",
    "No. Most disorganized class I've ever taken. Learning Java via youtube would be a much more efficient use of time.",
    "This class is an informative intro to Java programming - I learned a lot of concrete skills and can write effective programs now, so the course was technically successful. However, it's a huge lecture that's easy to get lost in and there wasn't much connection with the teaching staff. I'd recommend it if you want to learn to code but aren't very self-motivated and might get distracted teaching yourself. Also, unless you're a very untechnical person, take the class for a grade and not Cr\/D\/F. There are a lot of opportunities for extra credit and for a science course, the curve was very forgiving.",
    "This class will teach you basic programming. it is not a great course and with CS50 (technically called something else) I'm not sure how helpful this class will be. the problem sets are where the real learning and time come into play so take those seriously to get good rewards. they are not super hard if you can debug easily. I would suggest it if you want to learn to code but it is not the easiest course in terms of work load due to potentially long problem sets."
