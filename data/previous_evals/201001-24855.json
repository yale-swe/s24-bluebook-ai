    "A really fun course. A little too big, and it could benefit from a more structured syllabus, but the professor and the other students make it worth waking up every morning.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. It really gets you interested in the language and is helpful and practical.",
    "Yes.",
    "I came in with only very basic Korean, and I definitely feel more comfortable with writing and speaking. The class was a little too big this year, but there's not a whole lot the professor could have done about that. Speaking of which, Angela is great!",
    "I grew up speaking Korean but never really learned to read and write it.I am really glad I took this course, even if it was way too easy at times.",
    "Yes, absolutely. My Korean has improved so much, and i enjoyed going to class and learning.",
    "YES, take the class. You will learn a great deal and have fun at the same time.",
    "yes, its a good class",
    "I would definitely recommend taking this class. I learned so much Korean and it has really changed my daily life because I am a Korean American. One of my favorite classes taken at Yale thus far.",
    "If this class remains a heritage speakers' class and you are not a heritage speaker, beware of potential dissatisfaction. Of course, it's a ton of fun and is interesting enough, but you may not cover material that you wish to cover, and that can be disappointing and discouraging."
