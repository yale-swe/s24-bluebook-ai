    "Instructor: Ryan Michael Darr \u00a0Ryan was open, helpful and available. He provided good feedback on papers and stressed the students developing a synthetic view towards the material.",
    "Instructor: Ryan Michael Darr \u00a0Mr. Darr sought to eagerly engage students in conversation. He was open to questions and easily approached. Unknown if the intention of the section was purely meant to be student conversation, I may have found this time more useful if sections were used to make clear the difficulties in the lecture material or to keep reviewing materials from the start of the semester.",
    "Instructor: Ryan Michael Darr \u00a0The discussion groups were great. It was very helpful meeting with him and asking questions outside of class and discussion group and provided great constructive criticism on papers and ways to improve our writing.",
    "Instructor: Ryan Michael Darr \u00a0Very helpful counterpoint to Dr. Eitel. Effectively and gently explained things. Led section well. Paper grading very challenging and effective comments.",
    "Instructor: Ryan Michael Darr \u00a0I had not interaction with Ryan Darr, though he seemed excited and engaged.",
    "Instructor: Ryan Michael Darr \u00a0Ryan was fantastic.",
    "Instructor: Ryan Michael Darr \u00a0Ryan was considerable for international students, and encouraged them to participant in the sessions and class. Ryan also gave precise and elaborated comments on my paper so that I could understand what are my weakness or strength so that I could explore and broaden my ethical studies and writings.",
    "Instructor: Ryan Michael Darr \u00a0Great at leading section discussions. He made sure the students engaged with the work. His comments were always helpful, constructive, and elucidating.",
    "Instructor: Ryan Michael Darr \u00a0Ryan Darr was a wonderful TF and the class that he taught on Robert Adams was very well organized and helpful to me in my understanding of Adams' framework. Ryan Darr didn't teach my reading group, however, because Prof. Eitel taught the first year ethicists.",
    "Instructor: Ryan Michael Darr \u00a0great guy but not a great teacher. He needs help in understanding what his role is.",
    "Instructor: Ryan Michael Darr \u00a0Ryan Darr is the best teaching fellow I have ever had. He encouraged group discussion, and he recognized that I am shy and did not always feel like talking. I would love to have him as a teaching fellow again."
