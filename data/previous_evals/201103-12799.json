    "A good class with very interesting material, interesting reading, and a solid professor. Two hours a week is too much time for this class - it did not take that long to have an excellent discussion over the reading material, and by the last hour I found myself growing bored of the discussion.",
    "You read fascinating books, and the final research paper really pulls together your analysis. However, discussions can be a bit dull, and you either should invest a lot into this class so that you come with great insights and discussion points, or let it slide off your back.",
    "The material is interesting at first, but the discussion (at least in this iteration of the seminar) was really dull. It was obvious few people had done the reading and so the conversation inevitably devolved into talking about pretty insipid things. Professor Tannenbaum is really knowledgeable but she didn't ever cut off tangential discussion and sometimes took part in it herself. If the class is comprised of people who are actually going to do the readings and talk about them intelligently, then I would recommend taking the class. If not, save yourself the annoyance.",
    "Great class! Take it! Workload isn't terrible, a book a week, two papers and a final research paper. It's a really interesting subject and the class is great fun.",
    "This is a really interesting class. I would recommend it.",
    "Yes, but they should be incredibly interested in the subject and willing to do a lot of reading or writing.",
    "A lot of great reading on a variety of topics (not just Salem!) One of my favorite things about this class is that we were given the opportunity to write a narrative of actual events during a witch trial as opposed to just writing historical analysis all the time. Although this class is time consuming, it is a lot of fun and teaches you a lot about our own history as well as human nature."
