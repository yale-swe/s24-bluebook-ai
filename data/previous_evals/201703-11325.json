    "This course will test your reading of primary and secondary sources, as well as your ability to synthesize readings to present to the entire class. Additionally, you will develop your critical thinking skills. Of course, you will also learn more about a critical yet often overlooked part of Russian history."

    "Strengths: interesting content, very manageable workload. Weaknesses: hard to know where you stand in this course (especially at midtermhadn't received any grades back). In general, little feedback.",
    "I thought this was a great course.",
    "Fantastic subject material, absolutely enjoyable class sessions with a knowledgeable professor. I greatly enjoyed the class and can't really think of any ways to improve it. It covered quite a bit into modern politics, which I find less interesting, but that's a personal preference rather than a weakness.",
    "The course requires everyone to do the readings every week in order to successfully participate in weekly discussions. Readings are assigned in manageable amounts, allowing for fruitful discussions. The professor engages each student well."

   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this course to history majors, but the content is somewhat niche. Can be hard to keep up at times if you don't have a background in European history.",
    "I would recommend this course. You will gain as much from it as you put into it.",
    "Fantastic course, interesting material, very enjoyable conversations with a brilliant professor. It sounds like a brochure, but that's how I feel about the course. Because of the seminar setting and small class size (5 students), we were able to spend a good portion of each class following rabbit trails and exploring aspects of Russian or Steppe history beyond simply the flow of the readings. Prof. Bushkovitch is incredibly knowledgeable, and a bit of a closet savage; he tells you what he thinks, whether on your own points of information or on readings. It's a very refreshing trait, and I would absolutely recommend this course and this professor.",
    "Definite recommendation. Professor Bushkovitch is a fresh breath of realism and candor that is missing from other Yale faculty."
