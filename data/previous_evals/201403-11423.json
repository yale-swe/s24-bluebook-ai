    "Shimi is by far the professor showing the most interest in his students learning the material at FES. As a student in his classroom, you can always tell that classes are designed around your learning and not just a powerpoint quickly put together with concepts that you will need to additionally research to understand. Definitely a challenging class if you have not done orgo before, but well worth it for anyone with an interest in pollution issues. This class should be a requirement for folks in energy (because of the relevance of hydrocarbons pollution issues), in water, and in industrial ecology.",
    "The material covered in this course is very interesting to me, but what really made the class great was the instructor. I took another one of Shimi's courses last year (physical sciences) and I can say without a doubt that he does not disappoint. In all honesty, I've been pretty disappointed with my academic experience at FES overall, but Shimi has really been such an incredible instructor that he's still made my experience here worthwhile. This may sound strange, but considering the huge amount of money that I'm paying for grad school, I feel like Shimi's classes are a few of a very small number of classes I've taken that have been worth the money. I learn much more in just one of his classes than I do in all my other classes combined. I don't know if FES awards or recognizes good teachers, but it really should recognize Shimi's value to the school. I have yet to meet any other teachers here that put in the time and effort that he puts in for his courses. Granted, I understand that many professors have other obligations beyond teaching, but again, since I am paying a considerable amount of tuition, I would like to have a certain level of quality in my classroom experience that has only been met (and exceeded) by Shimi's courses. After taking this course, I feel like I have a whole new understanding of organic pollutants and even the basics of organic chemistry. One of my goals for grad school was to attain a greater understanding of the science behind environmental issues and this class definitely helped me to achieve that goal."

   "comments": [
    "Shimi is a great teacher, and explains difficult concepts in a really clear manner. Office hours and problem sessions are really helpful. Course content is really interesting and relates to a broad range of environmental topics.",
    "Going from no knowledge about organic pollution to having enough background to be able to find information that lets me somewhat predict the fate of an organic pollutant in nature (phase transfer, movement, and transformations\/degradation), and its toxicity in one semester. Amazing.",
    "The combination of fundamentals and case studies made this course extremely engaging- learned all the necessary background to understand the examples, which provided excellent motivation",
    "Comprehensive presentation of a very complex topic in an easily understood manner.",
    "I thought that the lectures were thorough and enjoyable, and both the instructor and the TA were always available to answer questions. They put a lot of time aside for office hours every week. I would definitely recommend this course to other people. Shimi has the ability to present complex material in a way that students can grasp. I learned so much in this course, and I enjoyed taking it!",
    "The course structure is optimized to get the most out of the subject matter covered. By starting with quantitative lessons and introductory concepts and ending with qualitative case studies and real-world applications, topics are thoroughly examined and applied.",
    "Structure and Synthesis of difficult material",
    "Shimi is an amazing teacher; his lectures are very well structured and engaging, and he's very accessible to students outside of class.",
    "It was incredibly well-organized and taught in a clear, methodical way. Our knowledge of organic pollutants was really built from the ground up and that helped me gain a better depth of understanding. The classroom environment was great too - it was really conducive to learning because the class size wasn't too big and I felt very comfortable asking questions and participating in class activities. Office hours were very helpful too. The TA (Kate Gehron) was awesome - super helpful and really knows the material well. And of course, as mentioned in detail in the previous question, it was taught by a wonderful instructor.",
    "The case studies made all the information come together."

    "It sometimes felt like there were 'tricks' to some of the problem set questions that wouldn't be evident without going to the problem sessions.",
    "Maybe the section on biodegradation? It could be interesting to have someone in biological sciences quickly talk about the microbes\/fungi that do the biodegradation. What they are, where they are, basics of what enzymes are?",
    "In general, science courses at FES toe the line between hard science, applied science, and \"need-to-know\" science for practitioners\/professionals. This course suffers from a similar problem. I don't know exactly how to remedy it. Perhaps a list of similar courses throughout Yale could be made available at the start of each semester. I imagine there are related courses in the ENVS or CHEM departments.",
    "I would appreciate more time devoted to organic chemistry (perhaps another week) and more on structures and functions of different pollutants groups and less on the cases at the end.",
    "Slide diagrams could use a little visual design",
    "I think that more time could have been spent on organic pesticides, dioxins, etc. The last few lectures of the course were really important, but felt rushed.",
    "It's really difficult for me to come up with negative comments about this course, but one suggestion that I might make is to focus a little less on details and more on big picture ideas. I spent a lot of time studying and memorizing very detailed pieces of information, and although I'm sure they are important, I don't think that I'll be able to retain them for very long after finishing the course.",

    "Very effective! Again, the TA (Kate Gehron) was great and I don't think I could have done well on the problem sets without attending the discussion sections. One major improvement that I think could be made is to either change locations or fix up the exterior of Marsh. This is more of a comment for facilities than for the instructor, but I felt like I was going to trip and fall each time I walked out of Marsh because there was no exterior lighting. It's seriously a major safety issue. It's bad enough that I know someone who got robbed near Marsh - I don't want to be or hear about someone breaking their necks trying to get down a couple of steps from the front door. Also, I strongly feel that the exams should be held in a different location too. It's incredibly noisy in Marsh and I felt distracted the whole time that I was taking the final exam. People kept walking up and down the stairs and having loud conversations."

    "Don't be intimidated by the science heavy look of this class. Shimi walks you through it and does it in a way that anyone could understand it. Just take it, it will be worth your time (and also you may never want to eat french fries again... wondering why? take the course!).",
    "If they are interested in the topic, I would suggest that they take it! It was one of my first courses taken at Yale (and the first course at a University in the USA) and although I was largely disappointed with the quality of instruction in my other course, this was an extreme exception and I believe it to be one of the best courses I have ever taken",
    "My biggest piece of advice would be to spend time on the problem sets--they really help you understand the material. Also, putting in time early on to understand the more basic concepts is really important--the material builds on itself for a large portion of the course.",
    "If you are interested in pursuing research or a career related to environmental pollutants, this course is absolutely for you. It is challenging but well worth the investment.",
    "Take this course",
    "Take it! You will learn so much, and Shimi's awesome. Don't be intimidated by the fact that it's organic chemistry - you can learn what you need to know during the course (so long as you have a general understanding of chemistry principles).",
