   "comments": [
    "I had no Hebrew experience before beginning this class, but I thoroughly enjoyed this class. It was intensive so it progressed quickly with a fair amount of homework each night. The homework always reinforced the day's lesson very well, allowing us to have a firm grasp of the concept. Ayala was phenomenal professor; she was always so nice, helpful, and understanding when something went wrong. She was very helpful in answering any questions, and she explained each lesson in a way that was easy for everyone to understand. I'm so glad I took this class; I can't wait until L5! Learning Hebrew is one of the most gratifying experiences of my life.",
    "This is a good course, but it seemed a little disorganized. There was not a syllabus, and students don't know what the assignments will be that day until they are announced in class. And the assignments aren't all announced at once at a regular time (i.e. when class begins or just before it ends), but they are sporadically assigned as the class goes on. This makes it hard to keep track of what to do and to plan ahead. The other part that was really hard about this class was that we used a book that even the professor agreed was a bad book. We loosely followed it, but this made studying for tests (especially vocabulary tests) difficult. Our vocab was spread throughout the book for each lesson and we also had other vocab that we were supposed to memorize that was informally introduced during class conversation and written on the board (only in Hebrew without the English translation). It was hard to keep up and stay organized even while keeping a sectioned binder.There is A LOT of homework each day. Sometimes Ayala will frankly tell you she's giving you a day off and you don't have to do as much, and then you groan because you have a journal entry to write, two worksheets, a recording to do, and vocabulary to memorize. You have a small presentation and later a final presentation, weekly \"yomans\" or diary entries to write, daily assignments, regular recordings, and a section to attend. You are also required to go to three Israeli-related events around campus and to attend the Hebrew-table at least 9 times. All of these requirements are fine if you're enthusiastic, but they're real time-drains if you aren't.Also, be warned that there are going to be a lot of people in your class who already know how to read and speak a lot of Hebrew. If you don't know any Hebrew, it will pain you to hear people in class regularly say, \"Can't we say _____?\" and Ayala reply, \"Yeah, but we haven't learned that yet. Wait till next semester.\"If you just thinking of taking this as a way to complete your language requirement, don't. That won't get you through it.",
    "This fantastic class made me excited to get up before 9am everyday. You learn a ton in a very fun environment. Although there is a lot of homework, it is usually a chance to be creative and a change of pace from readings or p-sets. Beyond being perhaps the friendliest professor I have ever encountered, Ayala really understands how students think and is very responsive to the needs of everyone in the class. After just one semester, I can actually speak and understand a productive amount of Hebrew. If it has ever crossed your mind to learn Hebrew, or you aren't sure what language to take, take this one!",
    "TAKE HEBREW!!! I absolutely LOVED this class, easily my favorite of the semester. Ayala is incredible, truly. It IS a lot of work (really, every night she gives out quite a bit) but it is completely worth it; the amount of Hebrew I know is stunning, after only one semester of exposure. Not super difficult if you keep up with vocab (there's a LOT). I whole-heartedly recommend this class. Very under-rated department, with amazing teaching.",
    "This class is amazing and you will not regret it. Not only do you learn a lot in a short time, but you learn about Israel's culture, and Ayala teaches you all about the history of words, to help you understand the rationale behind them. Definitely take Hebrew!",
    "excellent class. thorough. rigorous, though perhaps a bit too much.",
    "This course requires a lot of work, but it's entirely worth the work. You'll learn a lot! And Ayala is a fantastic professor.",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone who likes studying languages and is able to\/willing to commit serious time. It is a lot of work but is rewarding especially for those who are interested in Judaism, Israel, the Middle East, who have studied Arabic to some extend. It is a very specific type of language however and wont be a widely \"useful\" one practically speaking but if your interests revolve around anything like the politics of the Middle East, study of religion or scripture, or the country and people of Israel, it is invaluable.",
    "THIS IS THE BEST CLASS. Because it's off the beaten track where languages are concerned, everyone in the class is there because they want to be and because they are committed to learning Hebrew. Ayala is an absolutely fantastic professor and will make your classes lively and efficient. You will learn a ton of Hebrew, and have fun (!) along the way."
