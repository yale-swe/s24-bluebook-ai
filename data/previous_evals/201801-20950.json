    "This class gave me a much deeper understanding of genre, of how to read novels, and of how to analyze Victorian fiction in particular.",
    "This is by far the most intellectually challenging course I've taken at Yale. Not difficult but rathe stimulating-- conversation begins at the point where most lit classes end it. It's a great course for really digging deep into the texts and also taking into consideration the authors' peers and time periods, etc."

   "comments": [
    "This class is phenomenally structured, though at times I wished we had more biographical information alongside each work. It would have helped in reading Dickens and Eliot to know a bit more about their personal lives. Overall, however, I didn't find anything lacking in the syllabus, in the three main assignments in the class, or in the seminar discussion. The workload was appropriately heavy, and the discussions were always fruitful.",
    "Weakness is perhaps the (necessarily) rapid pace. I wasn't always able to finish texts, but this can be remedied by balancing better with less-heavy courses. Strength is of course Professor Markovits, the great texts that we read, and the high-level of thoughtfulness and interest by the students.",
    "The course was extremely well structured and organized, and the novels were paired together with a wonderful amount of insight and consideration. The pacing of the course was quick, but I don't think that could have been avoided, and it actually made me more engaged and motivated."

   "comments": [
    "Dickens and Eliot have so much to teach, as does Professor Markovits. I first read Middlemarch last summer, and for this class I read it again. This second time through has been enlightening. I am essentially a disciple of Middlemarch now--it is at the center of my being--my life makes sense because of the book. Sometimes I felt giddy in this class because I was learning and thinking so much.",
    "This is a superb class. Take it for Dickens, and Eliot, and the novel, and all the rest. Above all, take it for Professor Markovits! She is a wonder to have for a seminar leader. I don't think I properly understood how to read novels before I took this class.",
    "Absolutely, the subject matter is great, the professor is knowledgable, there are a lot of grad students who help to accelerate the discussion.",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend this course to anyone wanting to expand their familiarity with Dickens and Eliot novels, and especially to someone in the major desiring to pursue further study in Victorian literature."
