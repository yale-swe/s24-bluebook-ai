   "comments": [
    "I was challenged in this course to not only understand specific areas of cell biology and structure, but also to translate this information to dissecting complex scientific papers and experiments. I really feel more comfortable now reading science papers and thinking critically about biology research.",
    "I gained a basic knowledge of scientific methods and biological functions. I learned ow to effectively read a scientific paper.",
    "You learn basic biology concepts in the context of complicated real life applications. For some, this may present an exciting challenge but for others, it may be too difficult and require too much prior knowledge.",
    "Learned a lot about cells! The papers were helpful in teaching us the methods and reinforcing what we learned in class.",
    "I learned not only the facts of cellular biology but how this information was discovered and how to preform experiments like these groundbreaking ones and make discoveries myself.",
    "I think that the most important skill I gained was to learn to read and summarize papers, thanks to my TA. I gained very little from the material taught in class.",
    "The course did a great job of covering all the fundamentals of membrane physiology. As opposed to 101, this course actually delves into university-level material, which makes it more engaging on a number of levels.",
    "I learned a lot about being a scientist and being able to evaluate scientific data on my own, which was really neat. I gained a lot of confidence in my own skills.",
    "I was able to gain a greater understanding of how the cytoskeleton works, the ER and golgi body.",
    "Only take this if you need it as a pre req.",
    "Basic cellular knowledge.",
    "This class had more material than could ever be absorbed by anyone ever.",
    "Biology within the cell",
    "I learned a lot about cell organelles and functions.",
    "I learned that intro bio classes here at Yale are awful.",
    "I learned how to answer questions well without really knowing the concepts.",
    "Learning how to read scholarly scientific articles independently will definitely be very useful in my future courses\/research.",
    "This class was application of lecture material to p-sets and the midterm and final exam. Just knowing and understanding the material covered wasn't always enough to help you do well on these p-sets\/exams, which was often frustrating for me. The p-set\/exam questions are usually long, wordy paragraphs that pack huge amounts of information and ask you to synthesize everything all at once to come up with an \"application-type\" answer. For example, Professor Mooseker sometimes gave the premise of an experimental procedure testing some, let's say, mutation, and asked you to work off of the information to describe the mutation and its effects.",
    "I learnt how to apply the knowledge in class to solve practical biology problems in life.",
    "Learned so much during this course!",
    "The most important thing I learned in this class was that making audio recordings of lectures is super helpful when it comes time to studying for tests. I also found out through this course that I learn best from online lectures and asking questions to someone knowledgeable on the subject, such as a TA. In terms of biology, I learned a lot of cell biology in this course, specifically related to the cytoskeleton, endocytosis, intracellular and intercellular vesicular transport, the plasma membrane, types of proteins, and the secretory pathway. I also learned how to better read a scientific paper in this course. Yay!",
    "I learned about a lot of new biological concepts I hadn't studied in depth before, like membrane physiology, exocytosis, and endocytosis. I also developed skills of processing information on my own outside of class since the fast pace of class made it difficult to do so in the moment.",
    "I guess the electron microscope is cool.",
    "I really began to learn how to critically read scientific literature and draw conclusions that related to the other course material.",
    "I learned a lot about the topics presented in Bio 102, and how to read and interpret scientific papers.",
    "Cell biology, theoretically, although the lectures were completely ineffective and section was not any better. I feel like I learned close to nothing in this class -- which seems to be a common theme in the intro bio sequence.",
    "I feel that the number one thing I've taken away from this course is the experimental methods involved in cell biology research. Reading the journal articles each week were also helpful in solidifying the experimental methods and basic functions of some parts of the cell.",
    "Practical applications and background in cell biology. Very informative",
    "Knowledge that is more macro than Bio 101, and using those building blocks to learn about cell systems, including membranes, Endoplasmic reticulum, golgi complex, cytoskeleton, mitosis. We also learned a great deal about biological techniques.",
    "I learned about cellular biology and improved, I think, my ability to interpret scientific data. The class was built around testing hypotheses and interpreting results so I felt like I learned a lot more about scientific method than I ever have from such a big lecture course.",
    "Over the semester, I learned the functions and components of the eukaryotic cell as well as the biological\/microscopic methods for research and identification. Beginning with cell membrane physiology, BIOL 102 reviewed the Fluid Mosaic Model for the lipid bilayer, also introducing the key concepts on mobility and lateral movement of phospholipids and membrane proteins. The importance of antibody formation and identification and cell microscopy supported and accompanied the units, giving us students the knowledge behind the varied images that had been a part of our studies in the course. The microscopy toolkit initiated a series of skill-oriented lectures which served to introduce us to the real-world technicalities and methods in cell biology research. I learned the differences between magnification and resolution, as well as the benefits and weaknesses of certain microscopes. The next toolkit taught antibody-procuring procedures and their labeling significance on cell proteins, while the last toolkit explained the biochemical methods for protein\/organelle analysis. BIOL 102 obviously went beyond the typical or college-preparatory biology course with its in-depth detail and advanced introduction to the eukaryotic cell. An accompaniment to the course, BIOL 102D is the Cell Bio & Membrane Physiology once-a-week discussion section for students. I held these discussions with high regard since I could develop the skills to closely analyze research papers and their experimental figures and results. After reading each article, I could relate to the lecture portions of the course much easier due to the detail and explanations provided by the authors. Simon and Blobel, authors of A Protein-Conducting Channel in the Endoplasmic Reticulum explained the protein-channel framework of the endoplasmic reticulum, as well as the experimental effects of puromycin, effectively elucidating what I had learned in Lectures 7 and 8. This is just one example of the sections significance to students taking BIOL 102.",
    "The material of Biol 102 was very interesting. I learned much about cellular processes, the mechanisms by which proteins are transported are and out of the cell, the cytoskeleton, membrane physiology, immunology, and experimental design.",
    "I learned a lot of information about cell biology and experimental methods that are commonly used in biology. The way the course was taught helped my critical thinking and application skills a lot.",
    "What we studied in this class, mainly being the specific inner workings of cells, was never put into larger context. So I feel like what I got out of this class was understanding of the transport of secretory proteins, mitosis, protein channels, etc, but never felt like it related to anything majorly important because the significance of each system wasn't made clear. Of course I understand that all these systems are what allow the human body to function, but that blanket answer doesn't help anything when we study the steps of co-translational insertion.",
    "I learned about some cell biology systems - namely, membranes, membrane transport, the endomembrane system, endocytosis, cytoskeleton, and a bit on mitosis. We also learned about \"tool kits\" biologists sometimes use. I am not sure if I really developed any skills or insights; despite the professor's best intentions, the best way to do well in the course was to memorize all the material given. Applying the material certainly presented some challenge, but that was much easier compared to the memorization required in the course. Also, I thought the papers were a waste of time. I did not feel like a scientist when reading the papers; I just had to memorize those too, which was unfortunate.",
    "The course is pivotal to any science majors because it goes beyond simple memorization and commands a stronger understanding of biology. The course enforces the application of knowledge. Additionally, it draws on more scientific methods and analysis of research papers.",
    "Scientific analysis reading papers biological knowledge",
    "You learn how to read scientific papers and how to critique issues in them.",
    "I learned a lot about the scientific method, how to think critically about biological processes, how they occur, and how research is conducted in order to learn more about the field. I am really glad this course came earlier in the sequences as I think it will provide a very good basis for future biology courses.",
    "How to read scientific papers and engage with the data they were presenting. Also a lot about cell membranes and different biological techniques frequently used in scientific papers.",
    "I gained a deep understanding of the mechanisms of the cell and the relation of cell organelles to the function of the entire cell itself. I also learned about many laboratory techniques designed to prove characteristics of the cell.",
    "I felt like I picked up a lot of new biology concepts by the time I finished this module. Not only did I walk away with a greater understanding of basic cell biology and the specifics of membrane physiology but I also learned the lab procedures and methods used to test out hypotheses and create these models.",
    "I learned how to transform facts and figure into scientific inquiry. This course taught me how to think like a scientist.",
    "I learned a ton about the inner working of cells. From a broader viewpoint, I learned to connect different seemingly disparate mechanisms and facts, and so to see the bigger picture of cell biology.",
    "I gained a lot of information on biological processes. This course provided a very detailed explanation of transportation across cell membranes and within cells. Aside from actual content, I got a significant amount of experience reading scientific journals in discussion section each week. This helped me further my skills in dissecting and understanding academic papers.",
    "The course improved my problem solving and experimental design abilities, and introduced me to many basic lab techniques applicable in many cases.",
    "BIOL 102 taught me how to study by asking questions, understand experimental procedures, and understand processes in the cell.",
    "I learned many functions of cell biology in a mechanistic way rather than in a \"by the book\" sot of way, which feels like the knowledge is more memorable and applicable.",
    "I learned about the detailed inner workings of cell biology - how cellular membranes functions, how cells build proteins, how they grow\/divide.",
    "I learned a lot about biological systems and how to evaluate changes or problems in systems using my knowledge of other bodily functions.",
    "I learned how to read research papers.",
    "I learned a lot about experimental design in biology and some fundamental experimental procedures, such as immunofluorescence and immunolocalization, autoradiography, SDS page, and centrifugation. I also learned a lot more in-depth details about cell membranes and processes than I'd covered in AP Bio in high school.",
    "I learned a lot more about in depth details regarding concepts in cellular biology.",
    "new understanding of cell biology",
    "I learned how biologists carry out experimental procedures and analyze data to understand biological processes",
    "I learned how to teach myself the curriculum. I think this is a valuable and unfortunate skill to have developed this semester. Mooseker is an awful lecturer.",
    "Maybe this is the standard introduction to biology class, but I felt as if we were learning random parts of biology in high depth rather than following a specific pattern. I think my ability to read papers improved.",
    "I gained a comprehensive understanding of cell biology, including the secretory pathway and the cytoskeleton. I learned about the scientific techniques used in biology.",
    "I learned a lot more about the inner machinations of the cell, as well as the processes by which we learn more about cell organelles and their functions.",
    "I learned new methods of experimentally exploring cell biology, while learning the basic processes involved in a cell.",
    "I gained a good foundation in both cell biology topics and experimental techniques, as well as strategies for analyzing scientific literature.",
    "The course really helped prepare students by forcing them to think critically and like a scientist. This course went beyond evaluating memorization skills, as many biology classes do, but force students to apply their knowledge. Throughout this half of the semester, my ability to read scientific papers greatly improved, as we had to read one every week. This course covered a broad range of topics and went more in depth into many biological processes.",
    "I gained a preliminary understanding of cell biology and the structure and function of membranes and structural elements of cells.",
    "I learned a lot about experimental cell biology, and especially about how to think about solving problems in cell biology.",
    "Learning to understand the concepts rather than memorising facts",
    "Application - not just memorization approach to biology; how to critically read scientific papers",
    "Not much :\/ I guess I learned a little about reading academic papers and I learned about the organization of the cell. I learned a few experimental methods. Overall, I feel like most of it won't stick with me.",
    "I do not feel I have gained any applicable knowledge from this course!",
    "I have a thorough grasp of basic cell structures and the porcessces therein.",
    "I learnt about the different factors of cell membranes and their physiology. I also learnt how to dissect scholarly research papers and how to discuss them in a group setting.",
    "I learned a great deal of specific information about biological processes at the cellular level, as well as skills for interpreting laboratory data to draw conclusions about these processes and possible alterations to them.",
    "Was able to gain insight into the topics that will be used later on in further biology classes.",
    "I gained a thorough understanding of the membrane and roles of cells and cellular transport that helped build a foundation for later courses.",
    "Through this class, I learned how to think like a scientist, coming up with explanations that might explain malfunctions in biological processes. I learned how to read scientific papers, and be critical and skeptic of the information provided based on current day scientific knowledge. I learned how to read statistical data and deduce conclusions from. I learned tools and experimental methods that have been used to discover major biological information , and which is still in use today in the research world.",
    "I learned various scientific research techniques, how to analyze scientific papers, and how they are written. I also learned a fair amount concerning the functions of cells within the body.",
    "I learned very little from this class as most of it was over my head. I felt like the lectures were taught with a lot of detail when the overall picture was incredibly unclear so there was no way to understand the minutiae."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "There is a TON of information dumped on the students and it seems like the units just skip around trying to cover an immense amount of material in the shortest amount of time. It would really be helpful to perhaps cut down on some of the more extraneous material.",
    "This course does a good job of teaching scientific methods and papers but struggles to cover its material effectively in the time allotted. Often, we sacrificed understanding for time's sake and ended up not finishing the lecture anyway.",
    "An obvious weakness is its large class size. Despite having taken BIOL 101, I felt quite unprepared at the beginning of this course! There is a significant gap between the two courses. In BIOL 101, the professor assumed you knew nothing. In this module, it was like Mooseker assumed we already knew everything. Furthermore, the notes are not very organized. However, the papers we read for class were helpful, as were discussion sections.",
    "Overall the course material was very good, and i enjoyed learning it. However, lectures were sometimes difficult to pay attention to, especially after an hour of sitting silently and listening. So I think the course could be improved by putting a bit more excitement into the lectures or getting the students more involved on a daily basis.",
    "The strengths of this course are the TAs and discussion sections. I also thought the exam was fair and manageable. The main weaknesses are the format of the lectures and the professor's way of delivering information. Prof. Mooseker assumes prior knowledge of about every topic that he \"explained\" during lecture, and it is then the students' jobs to teach themselves the material that was so poorly presented. Lectures were disorganized, too fast paced and not engaging. I also think that learning laboratory techniques by heart (ex: centrifugation, mechanical lysis...) is rather pointless since students do not get to practice them in the lab. More interesting and relevant material could have been taught. I also think that practice exams should be given before the tests, and that the psets were definitely not good preparation for the exams. I do not think that the instructors were very accommodating or willing to listen to students' demands (ex: giving out practice tests).",
    "I really appreciated that we read scientific papers in this course. That's an incredibly valuable skill that I don't feel is taught much anywhere else. Apart from that, this class was the worst I've taken this semester. The ratio of effort spent on the problem set to understanding of the material after doing the problem set is very low. It's a huge amount of time spent, and I don't feel like I understood significantly more than I did from lecture. The lectures also feel really cluttered with a lot of complicated looking pictures that I feel could have been condensed a little better.",
    "The course does a great job of covering pretty much every branch of membrane physiology at least at a superficial level, which gives a better big-picture idea of how the cell behaves. Unfortunately, I feel as though there weren't enough opportunities to track your own progress or your own comfort level with the material, which may have lead to rude awakenings come the first midterm.",
    "I think I learned only about membranes this semester. More than half of the class was focused on membranes, which are important, but not the only important part of cell biology. I would have liked to focus on a variety of organelles instead. At some point, I stopped going to class because it was so boring.",
    "A really interesting class. Its definitely a transition from 101 in terms of lecture style. I think a combo of 101 and 102 lecture styles would be helpful a little more focus on key terms in the midst of lectures (rather than just at the beginning) and some more specificity on each slide about definitions would have been helpful.",
    "The course goes very in depth but does not have the opportunity to slow down to explain things to students who have questions. This can cause the course to fall behind and then rush through the other lectures to keep the course on schedule.",
    "Lectures were not helpful. You may as well not go. You'll have to teach yourself everything anyway. Enrichment, led by Dr. Takacs, was helpful for those who were lucky enough to get a spot.",
    "You learn a lot but it is a lot of information kind of thrown at you with no guiding principles.",
    "Strength: actually fun material, not that bad of a lecture Weakness: It's a huge class; not that engaging. Discussion sections were unhelpful.",
    "My biggest issue with this course was that there were a lot of terms that he expected us to know that we didn't learn in BIOL 101 and there were never any definitions. As a result, it was hard to follow along when he used almost exclusively acronyms and abbreviations for terms that we had never heard.",
    "This course tries to cover WAY too much information in half of a semester.",
    "I feel like this course is not very well planned and very confusing to really know what is necessary information vs. unnecessary. On top of this, I feel like a different teacher could've been a lot more helpful.",
    "The class is very poorly organized. The lectures are hard to follow and my section routinely ran way over time, because it was hard to cover the papers being read in the allotted 50 minutes. The problem sets are very difficult because the class doesn't make all that much sense.",
    "I think the lecture style could be improved by discussing things more clearly. I also think that concepts from class should be more directly discussed in section.",
    "The material was horrendous and obscure. I used to love biology and I was really good at it, but this class ruined that for me. There was way too much focus on experimental methods. No one ever understood what was going on during lecture. Grading on the exams was too picky.",
    "The course definitely covers more material than any student could reasonably manage.",
    "There literally was not enough time for all the planned content; lectures were often cut short, and as the second half of the semester went on lectures only fell farther and farther behind track. But students were still expected to understand some of the concepts that did not receive adequate attention in lectures. Some of the course content should just be removed.",
    "Professor Mooseker, despite meaning well, is terribly difficult to understand. He mumbles when he speaks, jumps from topic to topic thinking his students can follow his spastic train of thought just as easily as he himself can, and whizzes through powerpoint slides in lecture. He covers extremely complicated material but doesn't do so very well, which is a really bad combination. I often felt lost and discouraged in class because it was hard to understand Professor Mooseker and thus even harder to synthesize that sheer volume of new information.",
    "The strength is the skits the professor used to engage with students. The weakness is that it goes too much in depth into minor details and the slides go way too fast for student to comprehend.",
    "Strengths: piazza was a wonderful platform that was extremely helpful. I feel I learned a lot during this course. Weaknesses: The lectures were too long.",
    "The discussion sections were the strength of this course. The TAs were much better at explaining concepts than Prof Mooseker was. I think the use of whistles worked well to signal when you had a question in lecture. In order to improve the course, the lectures need to be more understandable. Prof Mooseker needs to define basic concepts and terms before going into the details. Instead, he just threw a ton of new jargon at students, and then proceeded to use abbreviations for the jargon that no one understood. The papers we read for discussion section were sometimes too complicated and unrelated to the course material. I think it would helpful if we were provided with an easy-to-understand summary of each paper with definitions of the terms used in the paper. Enrichment should be expanded so that ANY student who is struggling can get extra help. The peer tutors were flooded with questions during peer tutoring hours, and they often gave students the wrong answers, which hurt students grades on psets.",
    "I think this class could be improved by a slower pace and better explanations, especially of scientific terms used to describe the processes we were learning about. One example of this is just terminology used to describe directions and techniques. It was difficult to process information in class when I couldn't figure out what the words used meant. I think the class could also benefit from sections used to review material. While the journal clubs were interesting, because the class itself was so fast paced, it would have been helpful to review this material in more detail at a slower pace. I think one strength of the course is that it introduces a lot of different material than what is usually covered in cell biology courses.",
    "Strengths: focused on understanding concepts rather than memorization Weaknesses: lectures poorly organized and difficult to follow along with, grading is too harsh and an unreasonable amount of points were taken off for simple mistakes",
    "Interesting material, poorly organized.",
    "Good build on Bio 101.",
    "This class was fairly poorly taught. I hardly understood anything in lecture, and the questions on homework especially were poorly worded. It was difficult for anyone to understand what was being asked, and the grading was harsh, in some cases taking off all the points for answering the question asked, but not what they meant. The material was interesting, though.",
    "Nice professor but terrible lecturer. The material is also not co sistent with material taught in spring.",
    "Again, highly ineffective lectures, which could be improved by going over concepts more in-depth in section. Instead of spending section discussing jargon-filled and technically challenging scientific papers, they should be spent reviewing and reinforcing concepts from lecture, which are often filled with small details and almost impossible to grasp as Professor Mooseker glosses over them quickly during lecture.",
    "Although the course's depth was great, it was often too fast for me to understand, let alone appreciate, the cell's inner functions. I went to enrichment each week, which was very helpful, but wish that there were more sessions like that throughout the semester to help solidify the vast amount of content that is rapidly discussed during lecture.",
    "Overall wonderful. I definitely preferred the break from weekly quizzes, and the problem sets were fun and challenging (although sometimes graded arbitrarily it seemed). Material was covered very fast but not overwhelming.",
    "sometimed lecture info was difficult to understand but there were plenty of opportunities for help eg enrichment and weekly review sessions. I thought the problem sets were fun but could have been released earlier so that we could have had more time and opportunities to visit peer tutors.",
    "I understand it is supposed to get students ready for upper level bio classes, but it just made me never want to take bio again. The content just didn't interest me.",
    "BIOL 102 supported its students with a number of reliable information sources which identify as strengths of the introductory course. The Piazza website introduced its student-users to an out-of-class question and answer hub with the professors and students, oftentimes clearing up concepts we overlooked or that we were set on figuring out for ourselves. The student\/teacher responses were expertly stated and supported and I recommend the continued use of the website for future classes. Discussion sections for this course encouraged student dissection of various literature, as well as review of main topics covered during the lecture. The sections and research papers were so helpful that it trained me personally in the analysis of experimental results, their relationship with the lectures, and the anatomy of the document. The toolkits of BIOL 102 presented auxiliary material, but were so very interesting to learn since they tied the lecture with what we would anticipate as real-world examples of laboratory\/equipment processes. For me, this always stimulated my interest in the material. As with these toolkits, I was continuously impressed with the amount of focus, specificity, and breadth of cell biology presented. There was much to learn in this course and I found its one overriding strength to be the amount of knowledge one could gain to become a rivalrous student of biology. Cell Biology & Membrane Physiology was not expected to be easy for many of us, but I can admit that the difficulty in managing this course was far greater than originally thought. Weaknesses of BIOL 102 mostly rested with the ability to absorb knowledge at a fast but thorough pace. Because of the large amount of information per slide and per lecture, it was not uncommon to find myself in a clouded train-of-thought, despite reviewing the study guides that were provided beforehand. The lecture slides hit the main points and were of course meant to accompany the lecture, and not meant for solo reading, and because of that I found the textbook to be a good resource for understanding and for clearing up my train-of-thought. Despite my positive appraisal of the textbook, I felt most reliant on the lecture slides due to its (extra) content and guides for homework, but I also want to make clear that the textbook, which according to many BIOL 102 students isnt very popular for reviewing the course material, is what helped me capture the most of the information on the lecture slides and in the course. Since I feel the only true weakness of the course could have been managing the ambiguity of how to think on the topic (fact organization, how to correctly incorporate toolkits, where to start thinking for homework\/test responses), I really believe the only improvement could be more emphasis on the textbook. The choice of textbook is another strength that I did not mention about this course, and it serves its purpose to present the massive amount of knowledge in 102 in a simplified, clear way. Additionally, I found myself struggling over some of the complex questions presented by the homework assignments. I only hoped that there was more leniency toward our answers because of the range of possibilities for our responses to solve the problem. Other than that, 102 is a great course not in need of other improvement.",
    "This class goes through the material quickly, and while I barely understood anything in lecture, taking the time to go through the lectures by myself and doing the reading helped me understand the material--basically, with the class outlines and slides of the material, I could teach myself the course.",
    "Although the material is interesting, it was not taught very well. Lectures went too quickly and were often hard to keep up with, especially since the material is cumulative.",
    "I think a strength of this course is the incredible amount of information that it covers. I also like how the course really discusses the experiments that were done in order to make keystone discoveries in cell biology, especially by assigning papers for discussion section. However, I think a weakness of this course is that the material is so advanced. I am someone who has a passion for biology, has taken AP biology and got a 5 on the exam, and has done years of graduate-level biology research at different institutions. Even with an extensive background in cell biology, I still struggled with a lot of the material taught in the course. I can't imagine how someone who has only a year of high school biology (or none at all) could be successful in this course, and I don't think the course is an introductory level.",
    "The structure of BIOL 102 is absolutely not conducive to student learning. I have spoken with many of my peers as well as the Peer Tutors, who took this class in the past, and everyone is unhappy about the structure, and nothing has been done to fix it. Going through Units and not Lectures actually inhibited my ability to learn. I spent way more time trying to figure out where we were in the structure and procession of the course than I ever did in BIOL 101. The transition from 101 to 102 was disastrous because we went from a professor who bolded key concepts, made clear what was important, and connected what we learned to larger significances to a professor who showed by complaining that we held hum up from covering all the material by asking clarifying questions that he doesn't prioritize our understanding of the details and concepts, who doesn't seem to realize that he needs to communicate to undergraduates, and who hasn't listened to any of the previous complaints and evaluations. Through talking with other students, peer tutors (who have taken the class with Mooseker before), and with TAs, the Unit structure instead of lecture structure is not conducive to the learning.",
    "Overall, for such a large lecture, the course is more or less organized. The lectures follow a certain trajectory and the TAs graded things in a timely fashion. There were a lot of weaknesses, though: 1) Prof. Mooseker mumbles quietly for half the lecture; 2) Prof. Mooseker expects us to understand what he's mumbling, unless we explicitly ask him to repeat something - but if we asked him each time, the class would get nowhere; 3) the class's structure at first is difficult to follow because the units and tool kits are mixed; 4) the material itself was really not enjoyable, and I am a \"science person\".",
    "Strength: solid training on how to become a scientist (paper reading, experiment design) Weakness: concepts are not explained well and clear, going a bit too fast",
    "Found it difficult to understand the content in lecture as technical terms weren't fully explained and the course moved fast. Preferred the midterm final sequence more than the weekly tests ok biol 101",
    "The discussion sections are absolutely terrible. Discussion sections are supposed to be where students go over material from the lectures and clarify any questions they may have, but for the intro bio sequence, discussion sections are places where more work is assigned. Nothing was really gained from the papers because the papers we were reading were so old and only at times tangentially engaged with lecture material. I think discussion section would be much better spent if all sections were enrichment sections and the papers were scrapped from the course.",
    "The course taught you a lot about the experimental procedures that were used to learn about various biological systems. If you are interested in lab work for the rest of your life, I'm sure this is very helpful. However, for the rest of the class, there was no need for us to learn so many details about experimental procedures. We are often given an excess of information, which made it hard to determine the big picture of lectures and the course.",
    "The strengths would be the interesting content and the diagrams used to help explain things. Also the discussions of the papers were very useful. The weaknesses was being able to understand the lecture slides during the lectures as the professor moved to fast. Also the problem sets were very challenging.",
    "It can sometimes be hard to follow the lecture and the pre- and post- lecture slides are confusing (it would be better if there was only one slide set or they were organized the same way). The professor is actually really nice and loves answering questions (so don't be scared to ask him about stuff or get things wrong). The research he talks about is very interesting and his expectations for the student's understanding is high. The tutoring sessions are often overloaded with students because the weekly psets are very challenging (hopefully next year they'll have more tutors).",
    "The course, and lectures specifically, was amazingly disorganized. There was almost no sense of why we were learning what we were learning or what relevance it had to the other aspects of the class during lecture. Those details are built into his lecture slides, as I discovered while studying for the final, but are left out when he actually gives the lecture, which makes it extremely difficult to place the material into the broader framework of the cell and the class as a whole.",
    "Strengths are the interesting material and TA structure. Weaknesses are the vast amount of material and the teaching styles of some TAs.",
    "This course does a great job giving you a very detailed view of cell membrane structure and function and it does an excellent job of introducing crucial biology lab procedures. The tests are structured really well and give you lots of options. They require you to apply concepts taught in the lectures but the format is predictable. This course throws a lot of information at students and the lecture slides can be a bit messy and fast-paced. But while many see that as a weakness, I think it's actually a strength. It keeps students on top of their toes and really reinforces the need of preparation, doing the reading, and asking questions. I would like more feedback on the problem sets. Perhaps in discussion section an outline of the basic concepts tested in the problem sets could be handed out.",
    "The duration of this course was only half a semester, however, the amount of material covered in the course would definitely have been more appropriate for a full semester course.",
    "I felt enrichment was extremely useful sadly it was not available to all. a good improvement would be if it was available to everyone.",
    "This was the kind of course that I did not really appreciate until afterwards. Its main strength is that now that I've taken it, I know an insane amount about cells and membranes and really appreciate the biology. However, the experience of taking this course was very rocky. While the lectures were intended to be structured similarly to those of 101, the slides were much harder to comprehend because there were so many, they lacked clear titles and labels, and so it was unclear what was relevant (especially when red starred slides were mixed in). Plus, the way they were organized both into lectures and units\/toolkits made it hard to reconcile the pre- and post-lecture slides, especially when referencing the information much later, say at a review session. Plus, since the course covered so much material so quickly and in such a disorganized manner, it was very difficult to study and make sense of anything. In that same vein, I rarely if ever left lecture feeling like I understood what I should have just learned. As for the psets, I thought they were on the hard side of fair. They were definitely challenging and often required me to sift through hundreds of slides looking for one small detail to explain, say the results of an experiment proposed in the question, but I sort of enjoyed putting the pieces together. While a bit excruciating, the experience of working through the psets was definitely a strength of the course in hindsight. However, the psets were returned especially slowly, which hindered my learning. I made the same mistake in one pset and, later, on the mid-module exam, but this double jeopardy could have been avoided if the pset were returned to me in the week or two between when it was due and the exam. Overall, the course could definitely be improved from an organizational standpoint, but the way it pushed me was a good thing.",
    "This segment of the biology sequence was definitely more challenging than 101. The content was taught at a much faster pace and included much more small details that were necessary to understand the greater picture. While this made understanding the content more difficult, I thought that it challenged students to comprehend the greater idea and find the significance of what was being taught.",
    "At the end of the day I learned a lot, but it required a lot of outside work that was dependent on me, and not on the quality of the class. The class needs to be taught as more of an intro class, and acknowledge that not every student got a 5 on AP Bio. The Piazza website was very helpful, I definitely learned a bunch from that!",
    "Lectures were fast moving and difficult to follow because they introduced new concepts using unfamiliar terms.",
    "Strengths: the material itself is interesting once you truly understand it, Professor Mooseker cares for his students and is very responsive to questions on piazza, and my TA (Danielle) was extremely helpful and supportive. Weaknesses: the lectures covered so much content that I was often lost and confused despite previewing the slides\/textbook the night before. Professor Mooseker isn't a very clear lecturer and explains concepts in convoluted ways. Also, the textbook did not explain the most difficult concepts and the slides were often confusing, so the only way to understand the material was to ask my TA questions or use piazza. Almost all of the learning had to be done outside of the classroom because lectures were very confusing.",
    "The course is really hard to follow during the lectures, and most of my learning was done on my own, by going to review sessions, looking over slides, and reading the book. One issue is that the text book does not always correspond to lectures, however it is still a good way to get a base-level knowledge on the topic.",
    "This course required quite a lot of basic knowledge in biology. For instance, I had never taken any biology course since freshmen year of high school, and was always lost throughout the course. It would be helpful if the enrichment course was more widely available to everyone, instead of being capped.",
    "The speed at which we went through slides was inconsistent, and often seemed fast at the crucial points and slow at points that were well understood already. This made it difficult to keep full attention. However, Professor Moosker is a great lecturer and is very enjoyable to learn from. His demonstrations are the best. My biggest complaint is the lecture hall. I have never been in a course that was able to use SSS well. In my econ class that eventually switched into LC, it was much easier to focus in LC when the classroom was slightly tilted towards the lecturer and where the lights were brighter. Space makes a difference, and if I were the professors organizing this course, I would do my best to use OML or a similar lecture hall that isn't dark and flat.",
    "The speed of lecture was way too fast. I ended up understanding nothing in lecture and had to spend tons of time going over the slides just to have a grasp over the material. There is so much information that it is very hard to keep up and most students end up cramming it in, which ends up as dull memorization that isn't enjoyable. However, if you put in the time(a LOT of time), you can do well. I think the course should be organized better so that instead of learning about specific experimental procedures that we cannot practice (since there's no lab in biology), we should spend more time learning about the actual biological concepts.",
    "This course sucked a lot. It was not easy, prof Mooseker was a horrible teacher. I was really disappointed that an intro bio course was so specialized, ungeneralizable, and sad.",
    "Great subject material. Confusing lectures.",
    "I liked how the class focused on practical explanations. But I think the instructors need to make sure people understand the topics better before moving onto practical applications. Often in lecture, too many terms were used without being explained. I feel that many students were lost.",
    "While the material covered in this class is foundational to an understanding of cell biology, Prof. Mooseker is clearly a better scientist than a teacher, and garbles the material to a nearly incomprehensible degree. My main complaints with his teaching style are as follows: 1) He makes no effort to build a cumulative knowledge base. Rather than introducing a concept by giving an overview and explaining why it is important in the cell, Prof. Mooseker jumps straight into the experimental methods, such that the class is left totally in the dust with no idea what he's talking about. This problem also manifests itself in the advanced vocabulary he uses right off the bat. The class and I were left wondering which of the terms Prof. Mooseker is throwing around we were expected to be held accountable for. 2) Prof. Mooseker's lectures are a complete disaster. His slides are impossible to digest as he packs them with paragraphs of text. Rather than selecting easy-to-interpret three-dimensional drawings of cellular components, Prof. Mooseker once again draws from his love of experimental methods and packs in as many electron microscope images as he can. These are nearly impossible to interpret without an understanding of the concept he is trying to illustrate, and since he doesn't bother to introduce the concept properly, you'd be better off just reading a textbook than coming to lecture.",
    "The course was very scattered and could be drastically improved with better organization.",
    "Way too much time spent on the details of the membrane. Wish we could've spent more time on mitosis and organelles other than ER\/ribosome\/golgi. Also the WHISTLES. Does the professor have any idea how embarrassing that is for students? Students with anxiety disorders or even students who are just shy and introverted cannot learn effectively in an environment that requires them to obnoxiously blow whistles when they have a question about the lecture. PLEASE get rid of that. The weekly journal clubs were actually informative and helpful though. By the end, I felt I had improved significantly in reading scientific papers.",
    "Strengths: Extra help provided for those who need them. Weaknesses: Not much time spent on particular concepts.",
    "I had mixed feelings about this course. I thought the structure and type of material covered was definitely a strength - I liked how it wasn't entirely fact-based recall but rather tested your ability to design and interpret the results of biological experiments, applying the processes and procedures we learned about. I also thought the amount of help offered was great, from the peer tutors to the office hours to Professor Mooseker's answering questions during lecture. On the other hand, there were definitely also some weaknesses to the class. Although I personally liked Professor Mooseker and his sense of humor and demos, his lectures were often unclear and felt rushed - he would spend seconds talking about a graph or a diagram, leaving me feeling really confused and lost for pretty much all the following slides related to that concept. Even though he always opened the floor to questions, the problem was that we went so quickly that I didn't even know what to ask without just asking him to basically repeat everything he said in the last slide more slowly. It usually wasn't until afterwards when I reviewed the slides and my notes on my own that I finally realized what was going on and knew what specifically to ask about. The textbook readings often didn't include a lot of the specifics from lecture either, so it wasn't useful for clarification.",
    "The lectures were a bit too quick and covered a significant amount of detail which was hard to follow in 75 minutes. Some of the papers and concepts were interesting but the class could be made a lot better if it were slowed down.",
    "lecturing style was so difficult to follow - i learned everything by re-reading the slides; format disorganized and assumed too much prior knowledge; professor is too close to the subject to explain it well",
    "The course taught how to analyze data and understand experiments and apply the concepts to explain various observations on the molecular level. The course did not focus on diseases and health which at have added value to it.",
    "Mooseker is a good guy, but he should NOT be teaching a lecture class like this. The material is interesting, but Mooseker made the class unbearable. He makes disorganized teaching materials, does not project his voice during class, mumbles, occasionally does not use his microphone, and assigns readings that are not on material that students are not responsible for. The only aspect of the class that made sense was his scattered and disorganized \"learning goals,\" which were basically topics we had to know for the exams (aka. the words we would input in a Google Search when teaching ourselves the material). If there were no \"learning goals,\" I would have been even more lost than I already was.",
    "The strength of this class are the homeworks, which prepared students well for the exams. I think the weakness is how few ways there are to ask for help on the homework. I found the homeworks to be pretty hard, and asking TFs or tutors resulted in formulating wrong answers! Without friends to work with on the homework, they are incredibly difficult.",
    "At the beginning of the course, Professor Mooseker used terminology that I had not learned in 101, which made the lectures confusing. The \"red-star\" material and the micrographs at the beginning of each lecture were intimidating. The first paper was not presented in appropriate context and was full of terms that we wouldn't fully appreciate until the very end of the course. I thought the material was interesting and well presented. I never had any trouble understanding Professor Mooseker, and his review sessions were fantastic. Exams were very fair. Problem sets were quite challenging but rewarding and good for studying. The final three papers in particular were instructive and useful.",
    "I feel as though some of the information could be presented in a different manner. Perhaps with more demonstrations and videos.",
    "I enjoyed learning the experimental techniques. However, I think we went through them way too fast most of the time. The material was interesting, but it was often not explained well enough.",
    "One major strengths of this course is Prof. Mooseker himself. He is a brilliant lecturer. Both witty and knowledgeable, he was always able to completely answer our questions in class and never failed to make every lecture interesting. I also enjoy the treatment of the discussion sections as journal clubs instead of a rehash of certain concepts in class. This allowed us to understand how the concepts taught in class were discovered and helped us practice analyzing scientific literature. Piazza was also very helpful, since asking and answering questions allowed us to improve and test our understanding of the concepts. Overall, I think this is a great course with not much for improvement.",
    "The lectures covered a lot of material very quickly, which allowed for very quick acclimation to the material, but the quantity was sometimes overwhelming, and then it was difficult to sift through what we were actually responsible for (detail-wise). The problem sets were appropriately challenging, but perhaps could've been a little longer to give more opportunity to practice for the exams and to gain points, because it was very easy to let one mistake have a large impact on your grade. The discussion section format was very strong.",
    "I think enrichment was a major strength of this course and helped with review. Mooseker's review sessions were also helpful. I think having weekly quizzes might have been more helpful for the course.",
    "I think that some sort of lab would be useful for the early part of this class, as the toolkit lectures go through several techniques that we discussed in the rest of the course that I believe would be much easier understood if the students were able to actually see them in vivo.",
    "A huge amount of material was presented in this course, and it was very difficult to predict which material was important for the course -- it often seemed like we needed to memorize each individual detail. Feedback was minimal, as were opportunities for help.",
    "A strength of this course was that it challenged students and forced them to think in different ways than they are used to. The course went in depth into many concepts, allowing a greater understanding of many aspects of biology. It was also useful that the course covered several experimental methods in the toolkits because this is practical knowledge for employment in biology fields, which often isn't taught in classes. A weakness of this course is that it is not treated as a typical intro class-- way more is expected of students and a lot of intro material isn't covered. This makes it way harder to learn the material, and forces students to spend a much greater amount of time studying. If the course spent more time introducing these topics, it would make it much easier to absorb the other material.",
    "The structure and organization of lectures could be much improved. The peer tutors are great and sometimes the professor is extremely clear. It just seems that on occasion he spends a really long time on very simple material and then quickly skips over complicated material. Also, it is ridiculous that a unit addressed for 10 minutes the last lecture of the course would play such a large role in the final exam.",
    "I thought the course was fascinating, lectures went by quickly and we're very fast and sometimes difficult to follow.",
    "Being able to ask and answer questions and do so anonymously has made the class a lot more interactive and engaging. I wish lectures could be recorded and uploaded so that we can catch things that we missed instead of asking unnecessary questions on piazza",
    "I really thought the academic paper reading was pointless. I think time would be better spent using section to understand the material, which was very difficult. I guess the PSETs were a strength because they were very challenging and forced you to really understand things, but I also thought that often they were too difficult to complete with only what we learned in class and many, many students had to go to the TAs to get help with them.",
    "I cannot think of any strengths of this course. The weakness, though, are numerous. The lectures are not engaging and the problem sets and exams are very challenging. I did not feel prepared for the assessments and regret taking the course!",
    "I loved the level of engagement in Mooseker's lectures. However, I occasionally felt that there wasn't enough of a student support system",
    "I thought that this class was a very detailed course and was perhaps a bit too detailed for an introductory biology sequence. Although the topics are important overall, I believe a more general cell biology sequence would be more beneficial. I can tell that Professor Mooseker cares about teaching his students, but I found lectures to be conducted at a face pace and covered extreme details without addressing the over arching concepts.",
    "Strength was that the material lent itself to being discussed in groups, and forming study groups. Weakness was that the material seemed disjointed at times, and I had a hard time seeing how each topic related and formed a coherent whole.",
    "This is a very detailed course, which is certainly a strength but can also cause the course material to be confusing at times. I believe the lecture slides could be made more concise in order to help students better understand the information presented. For example, I felt that in some instances, a new concept or process was being explained with multiple diagrams when only one was necessary. I also feel that I understood many of the new concepts in this course better once I was forced to apply them in problem sets or in interpreting data from the weekly papers for discussion section. For this reason, I think it might be helpful to structure this class in a flipped format, with an (ungraded) problem set with two or three questions provided to the students before each class. Students could read the lecture slides and attempt to solve the problems based on their understanding of the material. In the class, Professor Mooseker can explain the correct solutions to the problems and clarify any misunderstandings.",
    "Strength of the course is that it provides insight into the field of biology. Weakness is that there was so much content that sections were skimmed over, instead of delving into lesser topics. Another weakness is that the content seemed randomly arranged.",
    "Sometimes the level of knowledge that it was assumed the students had was higher than where it actually was, and at times lecture could be confusing. The sections were very helpful in clarifying certain topics, as well as Piazza.",
    "It was difficult to understand the course material because many different concepts were taught in a short amount of time. I found reading the textbook unhelpful but the lecture slides were much more engaging.",
    "It was a great course overall. Very focus on relevant material that will allow us to understand he basics of biological processes at the cell level. A weakness of the course is the intensity of the finals. I mean it was stimulating, but at the same time there was a lot at risk like my gpa and my future.",
    "This class goes into much more depth than Biology 101, almost to a point it becomes too fixated on small details instead of the larger picture. However, I learned a lot about the topics presented. Also, the class was structured quite well.",
    "The course is very fast paced. Most of my learning of the material occurred by doing the homework rather than in class. Having 127 slides in an 80 minute lecture is too much.",
    "I wish there was more big picture teaching so I had a way to contextualize the information."

    "This is by far the worst class I have taken at Yale. It is really disorganized and the content is needlessly difficult. You will spend more time trying to figure out what the actual topic of the lecture is than learning new information, and the problem sets and discussion sections are of little to no help. Try and join enrichment if you can, it's the only thing that kind of makes sense.",
    "I wouldn't recommend taking BIOL 102 unless you absolutely HAVE to (for pre-med or a biology major).",
    "I would recommend this course to a student who is looking for a rigorous and challenging introduction to cell biology. This course is difficult and involves a great deal of work, but I think the knowledge gained was worth it.",
    "I do not feel I benefited as much from this course as I did from 101. It was dense and often unintelligible and requires a lot of self-studying to understand the material. Overall a helpful course, but the amount of independent work it takes to achieve a comfortable level of understanding is a drastic increase from 101.",
    "I would not recommend this course. It's an intro class that isn't very fun, but it's still a requirement, so I guess there's not much most students can do about it!",
    "I would recommend it to others because not only did I learn a lot, but I also learned how I could use the information from class to make discoveries of my own.",
    "This class seriously made me reconsider a major in Biology. The lectures are disorganized and not engaging, the psets are unnecessarily hard and the material was not particularly interesting to me.",
    "I would not recommend this course. For an intro bio course that claims to not be a weeding out course, it certainly feels like a weeding out course in that it's so soul-crushing.",
    "I would recommend it! As opposed to BIOL101, this course provides the introduction to biology that I expect from Yale, and I think a student pursuing a bio degree would be disadvantaged by not taking this course.",
    "I would only recommend the course if you absolutely have to take the bio sequence.",
    "No, only take it if you have to.",
    "yes because you learn a lot. If you are prepared to work hard, then you can do well.",
    "As a class that is essential for someone who wants to major in biology yes, but for someone who is curious and experimenting no.",
    "I vehemently advise against taking this course unless you're pre-med or this class serves as a prereq for your major. Otherwise, take anything else besides this for your science credit. It's not worth the stress.",
    "Only if they need fundamental biology knowledge to take other advanced courses, I would recommend this course. If not, do not recommend.",
    "Don't take this class unless you have to. Mooseker fits around 100 text-filled lecture slides into each class period; it is impossible to keep up. He also speaks too quickly that nothing is clear until you have re-read the slides 4 times on your own. Very time consuming and overall stressful for only half a credit.",
    "Unless you have to take this class for your major or because you are premed, don't. It's boring and lectures are a waste of time.",
    "Do not take this class. Unless you absolutely have to.",
    "The only reason you should take this course is if you do not place out and need it for your major\/med school. The course is not really enjoyable.",
    "Beware of taking this class with Professor Mooseker - he's so difficult to understand, and it doesn't get easier over time to do so! If you're not up for teaching a huge volume of information to yourself, consider taking the shifted, spring semester-starting bio sequence.",
    "Yes I will, but only when you are a bio major\/pre-med. It is not an easy intro course for distributional requirement.",
    "Yes! It was a fun course with a lot of material... for those who want to learn biology.",
    "I would recommend this course to students who are self-motivated and can learn on their own, because the lectures are practically nonsensical unless you teach the material to yourself. BIOL 102 is a requirement for many majors and for pre-med, so many students will end up having to take it regardless of how good the course is. I would strongly recommend every BIOL 102 student watch youtube videos about the topics before they appear in lecture. There are many online lecturers who can explain the basics much better than Professor Mooseker can. There are lots of videos on Khan Academy, too. I would also recommend setting up one-on-one tutoring sessions with your TA to go over the material and ask questions, especially if youre not in enrichment.",
    "Bio 102 is a necessary course and pre-requisite for all of the biology majors as well as for pre-med requirements. I think the course is interesting and it definitely challenged me, but the way that it was taught made it really frustrating at times.",
    "If you think 102 will be like 101, you're wrong. This course is much more difficult and unclear. The lectures were almost completely incomprehensible. If you take time to look at the lectures afterwards, you find that the material is not impossible, but this is certainly time consuming. The exam was fair but the grading was too harsh and the curve was ridiculous. Although Mooseker's lecture content may be better than other professors', his lectures are so difficult to understand that I'm not sure if it's worth it. He's very willing to stop and answer questions though, so definitely tae advantage of that and his review sessions. If you can teach yourself from the slides and the book and get help from the tutors\/your TA, you'll survive this course.",
    "Unfortunately probably not.",
    "Yes.",
    "So far, this was one of the most awful classes I have taken at Yale. Although an introductory course, it was incredibly difficult and the workload very hard. If you just need to fulfill the science requirement, do not take this class. If you have to take it for your major or for premed requirements, good luck. Read the book, work with friends, and don't get discouraged. The material was interesting if you can get past the hard work.",
    "You have to take the intro bio sequence to be an MCDB major. So sure, if you want to major in MCDB, you'll end up taking BIOL 102 and I don't need to recommend it. Otherwise, though, absolutely not.",
    "I would recommend the course to another student, but would warn them greatly that they need to invest a lot of outside study time and pre\/post lecture reading\/studyign to be able to understand the content.",
    "Definitely take it if you're looking for bio. And try to get mooseker if possible. He is fun and informative",
    "It's difficult, but necessary for higher level biology course and other STEM courses.",
    "I would definitely recommend the course as you get to learn about biology (important) while also getting involved in thinking like a scientist regarding papers and experimental hypotheses\/methods\/conclusions. I wish I'd taken the bio sequence before other science classes. I also thought grading was a lot more fair than bio 101-- more concept related and less buzzword-focused. Sometimes it was tough tackling concepts but I found it really rewarding.",
    "No, unless you need it for your major or pre-med do not take this class. Do not take it for an elective or just for fun. It is not a fun class and you might end up disliking bio if you take it. I liked bio until I took this bio 101-102 sequence.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to another student. The amount of material presented in this course is so wide and advanced that a high school student of biology, even one who took AP Biology, would find a great difference in content and specificity. While there is a great deal to be covered in both courses, BIOL 102 introduces the cell membrane and cell biology with a focus on the experimentation and research behind the discoveries. This evidence-based approach is not typically seen in a high school course and is certainly not part of the AP Biology syllabus. With this approach, BIOL 102 assists the transition into the professional lens of biological studies, training the student to extract and relate knowledge from research papers and to understand real-world applications from toolkit lectures. BIOL 102 further encourages collaborative answers tied to ones private and personal study, whether it was during group discussion about the student-read research articles, facilitated by the teaching fellow, or during the in-lecture red questions that pulled inferable knowledge from student-to-student communication. BIOL 101 students are in a particularly good position to take this module because of the learned concepts of energy-favorable conditions as well as biochemical structures and properties that explain all of cell physiology. 101 students can also relate to the structure of the 102 module. I give my recommendation to 101 students and high school students entering Yale who are interested in the rigorous study of cell biology. Anyone looking for a small introduction to the professional, although strictly educational, view of cell biology will also find the 101-102 module quite useful\/necessary.",
    "If you are taking Biol 103, its probably because you have to. It's a necessary course that you are just going to have to trudge through. Studying for the midterm and final exams take a long time, but it is worth it in the end because the material is interesting. Many of the labs at Yale deal with topics covered in Biol 103.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student, but only if they have had a solid amount of biology background. I truly think this is a great course that covers a lot of important information, but I would not recommend it to someone who hasn't already been exposed to the information. I really do think this course is not suitable for an introductory-level course.",
    "Please do not take this course for your own well being if Professor Mooseker is teaching. By the end of the semester, you warm up to his humor and personality, but he is a great researcher, not a great teacher. Teachers need to know how to communicate information in the best way for their audience\/students. A professor who says out loud in a review session that \"oh, I guess I do this for a living, so the concepts are natural for me to understand and harder for you\" should not continue by saying \"so just keep up.\" The correct response of a professor who actually cares about students really and truly learning the material would be \"okay, so I will figure out how to use the right language and tell this is a clear way that will make sense to you.\" I'm sure Professor Mooseker teaches his graduate classes well because those are people within his field already, but I do not think his place is in the introductory undergraduate course. Please listen to everything all the students are saying, and place the professor in teaching positions best suited for the students. It might be more worth your time as a student to use the 75 minutes that lecture would be instead to just read through the slides and actually try to understand the information at a pace that suits you.",
    "Do not take this course unless you're pretty certain on pre-med\/biology major\/etc. Mooseker mumbles all the time and is not very clear as a lecturer. The slides take forever to actually comprehend. Despite what Mooseker says, memorization is the key to doing well in this course. If you find memorizing dry material fun, maybe you'd be okay.",
    "Only take the course if it is part of a requirement; it is only valuable to those that intend to use it toward a major.",
    "Since this is an intro bio course you kind of have to take it Prof. Mooseker's class could be intimidating at first, but he is really a nice and kind person willing to answer all your questions, and it force you to push yourself hard to understand all the logics behind the lecture slides",
    "Most students may require this course for a major in which case they have to take the class, but i would not reccomend this class to a student looking to take a science credit. The 102 is much harder than 101 and not as enjoyable. Despite understanding all the content I didn't think that It was reflected in my midterm and final.",
    "Unless you absolutely need to take this course, do not take it.",
    "Yes however use the peer tutors because they can explain things very well.",
    "BIOL 102 is fine in concept and the material is interesting, but Mooseker is very disorganized and extremely difficult to follow. He assumes a base level of knowledge that I at least plainly didn't have, which could have been resolved very simply with single sentences detailing basic ideas before moving onto the further material. Be ready to teach yourself the vast majority of the content of the class.",
    "Yes if interested in biology or medicine.",
    "Yes I would but only to a student interested in pre med or a science major like MCDB. It is a very rigorous course and you benefit greatly if you took AP Bio or have biology lab experience.",
    "This class was challenging and had an incredible amount of material for half a semester, but the material covered was very interesting and enriching. I would recommend this class to another student with the disclaimer that the student be prepared to devote a lot of time to this one class, and to be prepared to do a lot of learning independently.",
    "I think if you want to see what it really takes to be a scientist this course is great.",
    "It's hard to see the light at the end of the tunnel of this course, but it's there. Expect to spend a ton of time of the psets and always work with other people and the peer tutors. The teaching is definitely hard to follow and often made me feel very underprepared (even though it's an \"intro\" course) (but it really isn't). I'd recommend going through the most recent slides at the end of each week or so and trying to make sense of them (because I know I didn't during lecture). It was much harder to try to process everything right before the two exams that it probably would have been if I had done it bit by bit. Overall, this course is sort of a rollercoaster and definitely has a lot of downs, but it's worth it.",
    "I find all of the content taught in this course very interesting, and I would definitely recommend it to another student. I believe this course does an excellent job finding the balance between challenging and engaging.",
    "I have mixed feelings about this class. The good news is I did learn a ton about biology, and some relatively advanced concepts. However, I struggled with how the class was taught. Dr. Mooseker seemed to think all students had received a 5 on AP Bio, and so taught the class assuming a prior knowledge many students did not have. If you put in a lot of work outside the class you will catch up, but know that it is not taught as a foundations or intro class, but assumes A LOT of prior knowledge.",
    "If you don't have to take BIOL 102 as a premed\/major requirement, then take this class only if you are deeply interested in biology. Also, the biology we learned in BIOL 102 was nothing like high school biology, so you have to truly like biology to enjoy this class.",
    "If you are interested in pursuing a degree which requires this course, it is not a bad course to take. Also if you are able to focus and learn in really big lectures, and want to learn about cell biology then you can enjoy this course.",
    "I would recommend this course to any student interested in biology. You leave the class with a very in-depth understanding of the processes discusses in lecture.",
    "Only would recommend if it is required. This is a hard course - the material itself isn't bad, but there is so much information to be memorized so be prepared to do a lot of work just to keep up with lecture slides. It did feel rewarding when I could answer questions on the final, but it takes hours and hours sitting in front of your computer memorizing his slides. I'm not sure how much actual biology I learned though.",
    "If you are pre-med or pursuing a STEM major, you have to take this class. Sorry. Biol 102 felt pointless, the problem sets were tedious and arbitrarily graded, and many of my peers only showed up to lecture to be lulled to sleep by Prof. Mooseker's voice. Pray for a good TF.",
    "No",
    "You probably have to take it. If you've taken the placement test and can choose wether or not to take it, don't; you don't need it; I should not have taken it. If you've done labwork and stuff you're fine.",
    "No",
    "While the material covered in this class is foundational to an understanding of cell biology, I cannot recommend this course to a fellow student if Prof. Mooseker is teaching it. He is clearly a better scientist than teacher, and garbles the material to a nearly incomprehensible degree. My main complaints with his teaching style are as follows: 1) He makes minimal effort to build a cumulative knowledge base. Rather than introducing a concept by giving an overview and explaining its significance in the cell, Prof. Mooseker jumps straight into the experimental methods, leaving the class totally in the dust with no idea what he's talking about. This problem of failing to build a foundational understanding also manifests itself in the advanced vocabulary he uses right off the bat. The class and I were left wondering which of the terms Prof. Mooseker was throwing around we were expected to be held accountable for. 2) Prof. Mooseker's lectures are deeply frustrating. His slides are impossible to digest as he packs them with dense paragraphs of text. Rather than illustrating cellular components with easy-to-interpret three-dimensional drawings, Prof. Mooseker once again draws from his love of experimental methods and packs in as many electron microscope images as he can. These are nearly impossible to interpret without an understanding of the concept he is trying to illustrate, and since he doesn't bother to introduce the concept properly, you'd be better off just reading the textbook than coming to lecture if you want to learn the material.",
    "Yes, because there are crucial biological components\/elements taught in this course",
    "Yes, the course really challenges your patience, reading skills, and ability to grasp concepts in a limited time.",
    "I would really only recommend this course if it's a requirement for you or if you're interested in taking more cell biology courses. If you fall into one of those categories, it was actually quite informative in teaching you the basic tools needed in cell biology experiments and giving a solid foundation. However, the course itself is really tough - although Professor Mooseker is eager to answer questions and seems like a nice person, his lectures are often really confusing, so a lot of self-studying or extra help outside of class needed. It definitely goes a lot farther in depth than any other intro bio class I've taken, with a lot more details. Then again, if you have the time to put in a lot of effort into it and seeking help when you need it, it's completely doable.",
    "I would not recommend this course to another student unless they needed it for a major requirement or a pre med requirement. It was very difficult to follow for an introductory biology course.",
    "yes but with a different professor",
    "Yes it is a good course that teaches you to think beyond the basic memorization of biology and is a requirement for all biology majors.",
    "This class sucks if taught by Mooseker. Take it if you have to and use the \"learning goals\" to teach yourself the material.",
    "If you want to learn in depth details of cellular functions\/details\/experiments, go ahead and take this course!",
    "This course was fantastic. I learned a huge amount of material and gained mastery of advanced topics. The homework was challenging but very rewarding, and exams were fair. Professor Mooseker is an expert in the subjects he teaches, and it is exciting to learn from an individual who discovered some of the course material. The required scientific papers and the tool kit component of the course helped me feel confident for future biology courses. Biology 102 isn't for the faint of heart, but if you have a commitment to the material, the course will be incredibly rewarding.",
    "I would, so long as I know that the student will put in the time and effort to do well with the course.",
    "I would recommend this class if you have a background and interest in biology. The course moves very quickly, so it can be hard to follow if you aren't super engaged or if you don't have the background. That being said, this course does cover interesting material, like experimental techniques, that is not often covered in most intro bio classes.",
    "Yes",
    "Yes. Any prospective bio major must take or place out of this course. I strongly suggest that every bio major should take this course since it sets the important foundations and concepts in stone.",
    "I would recommend this course because it goes beyond a \"typical\" intro course in that it touches on a lot of current research and builds familiarity with experimental techniques that will be helpful in future coursework.",
    "Take it if you have to, if not then avoid.",
    "This course is a bit of a slog. It's hard to understand the professor and the sheer amount of material presented in each lecture is ridiculous; it's impossible to predict what you need to know. The information presented is not at the level of undergraduates new to these departments.",
    "I would recommend this course to someone who has to take biology for a major requirement or someone who is very interested in the field of biology. However, that being said, as someone who has not been interested in biology in the past, the bio sequence made me think about taking more bio classes. This class is very difficult, so only those who are willing to put a lot of time in should take this class. Although it does seem difficult and overwhelming at the time, the information that you learn is actually really interesting.",
    "Odds are you are taking this course because you need to. The intro bio sequence is probably one of the groups of courses that are a prerequisite to basically almost anything in stem. This course has more challenging material than 101 and the psets are sometimes actually fun in that they are hard but doable.",
    "The tests and psets in this class were not fair",
    "Definitely, especially if you can devote the necessary time to it.",
    "I wouldn't recommend this module, although I did like BIOL 101. This module was SIGNIFICANTLY harder. However, I don't think most people have a choice in the matter, because they either need the course for pre-med or for their major.",
    "Absolutely not!",
    "Yes! It taught what it intended to very well!",
    "This course is a requirement for most of the biology majors and for professional schools such as medical and veterinary school. Therefore, it is required for many science major students to take this course. However, I would advise one of these students that the course is a bit disorganized and extremely challenging as a result. It can be difficult to understand the concepts of the material without looking up research papers on the topics.",
    "I would recommend this course. In addition to important information about cell biology, this course teaches students to draw conclusions from hypothetical laboratory data, which is certainly a very important skill for anyone pursuing a path in biological sciences.",
    "Necessary for student considering science majors, so this is a helpful insight into the topics that would be covered in higher level classes.",
    "I would recommend it as it helps to give a level of understanding necessary for future biology classes.",
    "Yes, this course will be difficult and sometimes boring. But I learned a lot from it because it really pushes you to not only think like a scientist, but be a scientist.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student that has expressed interest in the topic, as it is extremely detailed and allows for more inquiry and a better understanding of the information presented. However, for someone with a casual interest in Biology, this class is far too detailed and convoluted.",
    "Bulleted Points about BIOL 102: - Okay class, nobody who doesn't have to take this\/ isn't interested in biology will take it. - Enrichment saves lives, go to it. - Donald Trump was also elected during the semester I took it so that was interesting. I would not recommend you take this class if another orange is elected to lead our nation. It does not bode well for your performance (although the professors are nice enough to give you a pass on the exam, but then your final becomes 60% of your grade which isn't fun). - Fantastic in-class demonstrations. Less emphasis (obsession) with lysosomes than BIOL 101. - Make sure you study every week - you don't have weekly quizzes in the 102 module to keep your feet to the fire, and God knows those exams don't play games.",
    "If you are taking a major that requires BIO then yes."
