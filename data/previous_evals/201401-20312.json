    "Take this course if you can get in.",
    "A thoughtful and small seminar context in which to learn about American poetry.",
    "The opportunity to be one of Bloom's students is an experience unlike anything else at Yale - especially when the class is an exploration of the two poets that have been most important to him personally. Take this class if you want to truly learn and become a more sensitive reader of poetry in the process.",
    "This class is very special; there is probably no better thing to learn from Professor Bloom than Hart Crane and Wallace Stevens whose extraordinarily complex poetry he reads with incredible fluency. Much better than the first semester class, which was great in its own right. I am normally suspicious of the claim that a class could teach you how to think, rather than give you material to think about, but that's actually exactly what this class does. Learning to learn from Professor Bloom takes time, but--once you have--the kinds of insights you get from him are things you'd be hard-pressed to brush up against anywhere else. He reads poetry from inside it, and listening to him guide you (especially through the more obtuse works) feels like getting dispatches straight from the hearts of the works. Probably misleading to call it a class...it's more of an experience. By that same token, it doesn't have a lot of work (essentially none), but the seminars themselves are quite demanding in terms of the concentration they demand, and the more you put into them the more you get out.",
    "Studying poetry with Harold Bloom is an experience unlike any other. He has this incredibly deep veneration for Stevens and Crane, and much of his study and analysis of poetry relates back to the lives, the demons (and DAEMONS) of these poets. In that way, this class is so unique, because we're not just looking at the structure of verse or poetical devices, we're really investing ourselves in the spirit of these poets. And Bloom is a thoughtful, grandfather-like figure (in addition to being a genius). You end up feeling like his grandchild after studying with him for several semesters."
