   "comments": [
    "I think I gained an incredible insight into the history of environmentalism and current issues and solutions to deal with climate change. While environmental studies isn't a major I plan on pursuing, I think its so important for everyone to cultivate an eye for sustainability in anything they pursue. I also feel like I learned a lot about problem solving and appealing to two sides in a polarized American reality. Furthermore, I enjoyed the policy memos because I like how they force you to think creatively about real world solutions.",
    "I think this was an amazing course to take; although I am not an EVST major, it was extremely relevant with all that is happening today. I developed a new appreciation and understanding for the environment and everyday actions to help. I particularly liked how it tied the environment with politics, the economy, and other relative things.",
    "PLSC149 gives you a straightforward if repetitive at times view of what the world needs to do to not go to hell over the next century. Professor Esty does a good job of the material, and seems to mainly go off the top of his lecture. It works for the majority of the class, but you might find yourself hearing the same phrases over and over. But he absolutely knows what he's talking about and I really enjoyed hearing him twice a week.",
    "I came to understand sustainability from a more holistic perspective, and developed a wider toolkit of approaches from which to suggest policy solutions. Prof Esty does a great job of synthesising overarching themes for the course.",
    "I learned how to generate my own policy ideas to address sustainability. I was not simply regurgitating lecture knowledge, which was refreshing.",
    "I developed a general overview of sustainability (which was what I was expecting)",
    "I gained an overview of sustainability nationally and globally for the 20th and 21st century. Mostly focused on big themes like good governance, carbon pricing, trade schemes, international cooperation, and market liberalism versus institutionalism.",
    "I learned a lot about a multitude of topics and perspectives surrounding sustainability. Each of these was taught and studied in great depth. I developed skills in how to assess problems surrounding environmental issues and sustainable development and developed skills in how to address policymakers about these issues.",
    "The class gives an incredibly broad-ranging overview of sustainability issues. The class topics were all relatively interesting, but they didn't fit together into a particularly cohesive scheme. I felt at the end like I had learned a bit about a ton of isolated issues, but without a systematic analysis of how the problems connected or what solutions should look like. I also think that the class failed to engage students in critical thinking. I came in wanting to question the ideas I had about sustainability and environmentalism, but there was little structure in the class to do so. I will say that the policy essays gave students a good opportunity to delve into a specific issue to understand it more deeply. It was also good experience with writing policy essays more generally, and I definitely developed that skill. On the whole, though, I was disappointed with the factual and theoretical content in the class.",
    "A broader overview of the climate change debate. But this class is extremely repetitive and boring at times. Professor seems to not be that into other view points.",
    "The course is an overview of the major sustainability challenges faced by individuals, firms and governments in the modern context; therefore, it is constantly updated by new developments in the media, which is one of the course's greatest assets. The other key asset of course is Professor Esty's depth and scope of knowledge in the field - definitely try and spend time with him if you take the class.",
    "This semester, I was able to experience my first lecture style college course. That was challenging at first, but I was able to quickly figure it. The most valuable skill I learned during this class was how to take what you learn during the lectures and readings and apply it to the real world. With the Policy Papers, I was able to come up with my own ideas and policies based on the material we learned, which was a great way to see how well I knew and understood what we were learning.",
    "I learned about the wide variety of approaches there are to achieving a sustainable future-- primarily I discovered the vast number of roadblocks that exist on that path. This course both frustrated me as I began to understand the depth of the politicization of science, as well as energized me to continue in this field. The course opened me up to the world of \"market based solutions,\" which I was definitely unfamiliar with until this point.",
    "I learned about the history of sustainability in the US specifically, I also learned a lot about how global institutions work towards sustainability goals, often not very successfully. I also learned about potential solutions to sustainability issues and the urgency we are facing with these issues.",
    "This is a very well set-up overview of the field of environmental science in general. It integrates science, economics, and policy in an engaging semester-long argument for how to achieve a sustainable future. In particular, I now have a much better idea of the history and proceedings behind international agreements, and the motivations behind the governmental and community-based opposition efforts against the sustainable movement.",
    "How to patiently wait 4 days after the deadline for our critically acclaimed and incredibly attentive teacher to post our grades (especially for juniors, whose GPA is important to know when applying for fellowships and internships!). By the way, I'm being sarcastic. The course was an exercise in patience and incompetence.",
    "I learned a lot about the challenges facing people trying to combat climate change.",
    "I learned both about the scope of sustainability and the policy challenges it presents moving from the 20th to the 21st century."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths: Esty knows his stuff!! You're learning from one of the experts in the field. I especially appreciate his lawyer background because he's great at explaining complex laws and agreements like trade policy. You learn a ton!! The class pushes you to synthesize material and then come up with your own ideas. While I didn't always do all of the readings, the ones I did do were interesting. I like that Esty ran it as a \"leminar;\" he really engaged with students. Weaknesses: It could sometimes be a little repetitive. While he did a great job of drilling in key concepts (\"price harm,\"good governance,\" etc.), it sometimes felt like the same ideas were repeated too many time. Also, I would love to see more diverse voices in who we read and study. This is probably more a product of the field, but it often felt like we read and studied old, white men. I would love to see some pieces from minority groups, especially regarding EJ. Overall, super great class!!! Amazing intro to sustainability and such an important field for everyone to study\/be familiar with.",
    "I think this was a great course, lectures were interesting, Esty is such a cool guy and has so much insight on the topic. Even though he just lectured us most of the time, he made it fun because he never had slides to read off of; it was always him talking to us telling stories.",
    "I think a section reading quiz would be nice just to make sure people go over the reading. Otherwise current format is solid.",
    "I think the class dealt too much in generalities and lacked the specifics that would bring the principles of sustainability to light. Focusing more on case-studies would be helpful.",
    "The course is very informative and lectures and sections are strong. However, the course is a bit repetitive and seems to end in a similar place to where it began, which is slightly depressing.",
    "It was a good overview of sustainability past. The main weakness of the course was that because it was designed to be so broad in content that there was next to no depth. I would definitely try to cut down on the content to allow for more deep conversations. The policy essays were very good, but the rollover on feedback could afford to be much quicker. I ended up having to write multiple assignments without feedback on how I was improving in my policy essay writing.",
    "Strengths: policy essays as a way to gain depth in a sector of the class Weaknesses: lectures can get a little repetitive, not enough case studies as evidence for policy proposals.",
    "So many readings that by the end of the semester it was really hard to keep up with the readings and final projects in other classes. More of a focus on green business\/finance would have been great.",
    "I was very happy overall with the structure and level of depth of the course. The only thing I may have changed was the degree to which we discussed agriculture. I believe that topic could have been discussed with greater care and in greater depth.",
    "The major weakness of the class is that its topic is far too broad. I think an entire semester-long course could be taught on any one of the class topics, and there is not enough of a coherent connection between the topics to justify such a syllabus. All of the topics and readings are interesting, but it's difficult to determine what, if anything, from class or readings is important to know or remember because there's no guiding narrative that the class follows. The benefit of this approach is that each session is interesting, as are many of the readings, but in any given class, I rarely thought that our previous classes or readings had anything to do with the topic. Anyone off the street could walk into class one day with no background, having not done the reading, and have no trouble understanding the lecture. I would have much preferred if the class built on previous ideas or at least referenced the readings more. Prof. Esty barely mentioned many of the readings. I guess this means that it would be relatively easy to do well in this class without putting in much work, but it also means that people who do put a lot of work into the class and want to understand and explore more are not rewarded intellectually. My other main criticism of the class is that Prof. Esty largely presents his view of sustainability issues as THE approach to environmentalism. The readings, for the most part, feature economists, businesspeople, or other proponents of the free market, and we read more than 5 of Prof. Esty's own pieces by the end of the semester. These views are important, but I think he neglects and marginalizes many other valid perspectives.",
    "Strengths - okay fifth class and the policy paper assignments were actually pretty good. Weakness - difficulty of the final relative to the midterm, probably my own fault but I found it a lot harder. Way too much reading to actually accomplish; by the end, I'm sure less than five people were doing all of them.",
    "Strengths - enthusiastic TAs, extremely knowledgeable and well-connected professor, relevant readings that are easy to process Weaknesses - can get very dry at times, hard to come away with specific knowledge but rather a very general overview",
    "The greatest strength of this course is Professor Esty. He presented the material in a way which made me engaged and interested.",
    "The course's main weakness is the amount of content it tries to cover over the course of the semester. Rather than looking at lots of case studies regarding the main themes of the course, we spent most time drilling the theories rather than examining whether they were sound. Also, the amount of reading that was 'required' was unrealistic for the average Yale student to be able to complete in full. I would recommend assigning just 1-2 short readings per class to familiarize students with the coming lecture, or to assign many shorter case studies to give the students opportunity to apply their understanding of the themes discussed in lecture.",
    "Although I learned a lot of new information during every lecture, the class was often very repetitive.",
    "Above all, Esty is a fantastic professor- vast amount of experience, excellent lectures, strongly opinionated but very cognizant of opposing views. The course was really well set up and it had great relevance to so many fields. Its weaknesses shouldn't take away from that, but there were a few ways the course could be even stronger. Chief among them is the fact that much of the course was a repetition of a few key refrains that were very important but didn't go very in depth- economic incentives, good governance, international agreements, climate change, climate change, climate change. For example, it would've been nice to learn a bit more about which cap and trade programs around the world worked, which failed, and how exactly they were set up- while we got a taste of this, we just kept hearing that cap and trade is one way of pricing carbon. The readings covered this a bit, but they were quite lengthy and not at all necessary to getting a good grade. There was thus low incentive to do them (they were reduced a bit in the middle of the course, but it still would've been helpful to have specific pages or key points to dig into rather than the entire MEA). Finally, from a personal perspective, I would've liked to see more than just a lecture on conservation of biodiversity- it sort of came across as a niche element of sustainability despite being at the very least a great way to study international agreements, economic incentives, and controversial policy. I say all this not because it was a bad class, but because it was such a good class that I feel strongly about it being well done in the future. And also because Esty and his TAs were invested enough in the students that I'm confident they'll take this seriously.",
    "It could be improved by sharpening the curriculum, including slides during presentations, so that it doesn't all feel quite so improvised and unplanned.",
    "Strengths include the subject matter, the professor because esty is amazing and the way the course is run (fair grading, test IDs, etc) Weaknesses include the readings because they aren't really relevant to class material.",
    "The course was very heavily policy-focused, which is fine for those interested in environmental law, but the course was billed as being more of a survey of the sustainability challenge."

   "comments": [
    "Yes! I personally think every person should take a class in environmental studies and\/or sustainability -- its so important for our modern world! But I think this class is especially interesting because it relates environmental policy to the economy and focuses on real world solutions and policies. You don't need to be super into environmental studies to be interested in this class because it relates to so many different topics. Professor Esty was great and really knew his stuff. As a warning, Esty doesn't use powerpoint so it can sometimes be a little repetitive.",
    "YES. Esty is actually amazing, and this class taught me so much. I am so glad I took it because I have learned so much about sustainability and the environment that I can apply to my everyday life.",
    "Definitely, especially if they had no prior experience with the field of sustainability. Otherwise I migth tell them to take something a little bit more advanced.",
    "This course is a great way to survey the tensions between sustainability, economic growth, and by necessity, equity in our present and future world. Professor Esty is incredibly informed and engaging, and the readings insightful. You get what you put into it.",
    "Sustainability is a vital topic, and Professor Esty knows more than almost anyone else in the world, so I would strongly recommend this course.",
    "Good for an overview of sustainability, but not the best for delving into a topic. The policy essays allowed us to do so a little bit, but not nearly enough to my liking.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class to another student if they are looking for a good survey of modern environmentalism and generally want to be more aware of current topics in environmentalism and climate change.",
    "Great class, often super interesting readings if you have the time. Definitely read the stuff written by the Yale professors, Kahan in particular. The class really changed the way I approach problems of any kind.",
    "I definitely would recommend this course. The instructor promised at the beginning of the semester that this course would grow our knowledge of sustainability by explaining a broad range of issues, prospective solutions and perspectives, and the course successfully delivered on this promise.",
    "This class is useful as an interesting, fun, not too challenging fifth class. If you're looking to meaningfully improve your understanding of sustainability issues and what it takes to create meaningful, equitable solutions, search elsewhere.",
    "Eh, if you're interested in this stuff I can see why it would be useful, but I felt like my time could have been better spent.",
    "Definitely take even if not Env Studies; if you are Energy Studies, generally interested in energy\/environment\/economy overlap, or just looking for something cool, it is certainly worth taking. Some lectures\/moments will be boring so look out for that. To do well: find a couple of buddies, divide the readings up between yourselves for midterm and final, and write short summaries of them so you can quote them in your final answers. Essay questions in midterm\/final are pretty generalized. Study hard for the IDs - they really want detail there. For policy papers, just be as specific and granular as possible but make sure you think through your argument and you will be just fine. Enjoy!",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to other students. It is perfect for any level of interest in sustainability, which is why anyone could enjoy this class.",
    "Take this course! It's a great crash course \/ gateway \/ introduction to a bunch of history\/policy\/ideas about sustainability. You'll learn more than you could probably ever remember, but professor esty's lectures were always interesting and engaging and section added to that. The policy essays were a bit tricky at first, but actually kind of fun once you got the hang of them. Highly recommend!",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course, primarily because Esty is an incredible professor with a deep background and a great way with words. It is very much a survey course but it is a topic worth surveying- economics, science, policy, and psychology are all discussed to some degree. Workload is very high if you do the readings, which are good and probably more informative than the lectures themselves (which are better for discussion and Esty'a own experiences). But to get a good grade there is no need to do them, meaning workload is mainly based around 3 2-page single space policy essays. Sections were well done but I had a really good TA. Grading seemed very lenient.",
    "Yes and no. I would recommend it because the course material was fascinating and the policy memos were great; also, our TAs were excellent guides. But I would not recommend that a student who enjoys order and consistency take this course, because the professor clearly does not value those things at all.",
    "A wonderful course that is so well run! Would definitely recommend",
    "Yes! Professor Esty is wonderful and I learned a lot this semester."
