   "comments": [
    "I would recommend doing 496 instead because you will probably end up doing as many hours as 496.",
    "Your experience will be based on the lab that you work in, so it is important that you join a lab that you will be happy working in.",
    "You're majoring in MCDB and you don't want to write a literature review, and you don't want to do intensive research. Now you're here. And you're reading an evaluation that probably won't sway you much either way. Basically, same thing as MCDB 485 except you're finishing up with a research paper that is 12-15 pages long and a poster presentation. Not really difficult if you've got an understanding and encouraging PI, but realize that there isn't much input from the administration and there isn't much feedback on how you're doing unless your PI tells you. Other than that, standard senior research.",
    "Good research experience. Pretty chill senior project considering.",
    "Great chance to experience research in a highly effective and cutting edge lab",
    "IF you want the B.S., you should for sure do it! Just keep in mind all the deadlines, which sneak up on you towards the end of every semester. Like most things in STEM, and at Yale in general, the experience is what you put into it. Find a good lab mentor, a good PI, and make the most out of your experience. Learn techniques that you can use beyond Yale. Ask your postdoc really good questions. Try to become independent in the lab. And try to go in as much as possible.",
    "thesis",
    "This course was a very good way to gain exposure to independent research in a real setting. The work is completely up to you. The structure of the course is relatively laid back with all deadlines known ahead of time, making it easier to plan ahead how the research should go.",
    "You need this to graduate as an MCDB major but make sure you have a good PI",
    "Chill graduation requirement if your PI likes you. The final paper isn't too bad because it builds on the other assignments in the class. Just give yourself enough time to do it.",
    "MCDB 486 will be the most involved course you will take at Yale. This course not only will provide you with real-world lab experience, but it may open many more opportunities for you beyond Yale. Because of the experience I acquired in this lab, I now have the opportunity to perform neurobiology research at a lab in Madrid, Spain next year before I attend medical school.",
    "You are taking this class to get a bs in biology. Take it. Don't go for a BA. It isn't too bad.",
    "My TA was wonderful, but my mentor was largely inaccessible. Similarly, I did not feel connected with the person in charge of the 'class portion.' The 10 hours worked out fine; 20 hours would have been too much."
