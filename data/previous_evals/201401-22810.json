   "comments": [
    "The course title is self-explanatory. If the issues are of interest, I would certainly recommend the class.",
    "Do not take this class. You really won't learn anything more than if you just read the New York Times. Very disappointing. Would not recommend.",
    "I would recommend GLBL 765 to anyone who is interested in American foreign policy and diplomacy and who wants to hear interesting stories \"from the inside\". However, I would not recommend it to someone who is looking for such a topic analyzed more theoretically or more in-depth.",
    "Great overview of--as the title says--current topics in American diplomacy. Interesting mix of backgrounds represented among the seminar participants.",
    "Yes! A great place for discussing world issues with very knowledgeable students and faculty.",
    "Great course- would absolutely recommend if you are admitted, without question take this class. One of my favorites at Yale.",
    "Survey of contemporary diplomatic issues facing the U.S. Take because Negroponte has great stories and insight.",
    "This course is appropriate both for US and foreign students. The former gain an eye on what it is that their government holds dear, abroad. The latter acquire a greater insight into what it is that makes America tick.",
    "I'm not sure I'd recommend the class to another student. Professor Negroponte is brilliant and brings tons of experience at the highest levels to the discussion, but the class is so unstructured that it's hard to gain anything from it.",
    "You will learn a good amount of a range of US foreign policy interests in various parts of the world. At the same time, you will have the flexibility to also focus your interests; for example, I tried focusing on the South Asia but still came out of the class with a great understanding of everything. The reading list was out of the world.",
    "Only those who want to make networking with those who is interested in American foreign policy.",
    "I would absolutely recommend the course, but understand that it is unequivocally practitioner-oriented. Don't expect a bunch of IR theory. Do expect an engaging discussion of events that are almost always on the front page of the New York Times.",
    "A must take, regardless of background.",
    "Ambassador Negroponte is a legend and one of few true statesmen. I don't think there is a better person to teach global affairs than Ambassador Negroponte simply because he has dedicated his life to global affairs and his experiences and insights are of enormous value to anyone interested in \"global affairs in practice\" out in the real world.I firmly believe the fact that he is at Yale as a distinguished fellow should be exploited by all Yalies. In addition, given his stature and leadership, I believe Yale would benefit from Ambassador Negroponte's potential class on \"leadership in the public sector\", along with others including General McChrystal or Former Secretary of Treasury Timothy Geithner.Again, I strongly recommend all Yalies to take advantage of Ambassador Negroponte's classes.",
    "An in-depth discussion of contemporary foreign policy issues with a real-world practitioner who has seen it all, and has likely been previously involved with crafting U.S. policy on the issues that we discuss in class."

   "comments": [
    "It confirmed my interest in the policy community.",
    "Taught me about the world of foreign policy,and now I can converse about any topic around the world thanks to Ambassador Negroponte's instruction.",
    "Though I am not interested in a career in diplomacy, this class has given me an important understanding beyond just the daily I-read-the-news kind. You will critically assess a range of locations, which really fulfills the purpose of liberal arts. Finally, I think just hearing the different stories from the Ambassador's experience is worth your time.",
    "Deepened knowledge in American foreign policy.",
    "I thought this course was tremendously relevant for anyone interested in global affairs or national security. It was also a tremendous opportunity to interact with a senior practitioner.",
    "Prepared me for interaction with the greater world.",
    "I came to Yale to complement my MBA from INSEAD. My passion lies in aerospace and aviation industries, which go hand-in-hand with government and defense while relying on energy and infrastructure. Due to the capital-, regulation-, and technology-intensive nature of the aviation and aerospace industries, they has enormous implications on adjacent industries, economy as a whole and national security.Given my long-term goal to contribute to advancing South Korean aerospace industry in close collaboration with Canada, France and the US, I wanted to take a class that touches upon a broad set of considerations when it comes to global affairs.I am grateful to have taken Ambassador Negroponte's class as not only have I learned a great deal about \"global affairs in practice\" from no one else but Ambassador Negroponte, but I have met leaders of today and tomorrow through the class.I wish to stay in touch with Ambassador Negroponte and many others I met in class.",
    "It provided me with a priceless opportunity to learn about national security issues and U.S. foreign policy from a true expert and a great American statesman--this was a priceless experience."
