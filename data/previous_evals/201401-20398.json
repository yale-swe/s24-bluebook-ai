    "While this class is enjoyable and good for keeping up the language, it is very work heavy for an L5 language course. Irina is a great teacher and very understanding, but I do think that she would underestimate how much time the homework would take. The assigned readings could be very difficult, especially as the vocabulary on the side would only cover a fourth (if that) of the words and having to look up every other word would take ages. That being said, if you want to take fourth year russian you don't have another option and I certainly did make improvements throughout the year. If you care about keeping up with the language, take the class."
