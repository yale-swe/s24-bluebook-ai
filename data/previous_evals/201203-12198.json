    "If you want to take an introductory economics course, take it with Professor Simons. She makes lecture interesting and easy to understand. As opposed to other professors, or worse the large lecture class, she also focuses on group activity and one-on-one interaction. By doing so, she is readily available to help if you don't understand and clarify when a point is unclear.Also, when she is not lecturing, she is usually guiding group discussions to talk about current events or hypothetical situations. This helps to make the class more than just a \"sit and digest\" type of class that you might see when other professors teach economics.",
    "I would not recommend this class to another student - at least not with this teacher. I wish I had taken the lecture course instead, or Econ 108.",
    "I would recommend Econ 110 for anyone who's interested in Econ, but not for those like me who took it just to see what is was like. This wasn't the right class to take just for the heck of it; a genuine interest in Econ is needed.",
    "Definitely! Must take class. I might switch from an engineering to an econ major because of this class!",
    "I would not recommend it solely because the curve was very hard. However, you learn a ton and it is very interesting.",
    "ECON 110 has a great balance of being both an introduction and in-depth class for Microeconomics. From speaking to many of the students in the lecture for Intro Micro, if it is possible to take 110 instead of the lecture, I would definitely do so - and therefore recommend ECON 110. It's a nice class to take for people who are interested pursuing the Econ major, or even for those who just have a general curiosity about markets and how they function.",
    "I would definitely recommend Econ 110 for students interested in pursuing a major in econ, or gaining a comprehensive understanding of the concepts. However, it is important to go in with your eyes open and make the decision to take the seminar, as opposed to the lecture. To be frank, the seminar is more work, harder, and tougher to get a good grade, but if you put in the work, you can do well and you WILL learn much more. As someone pursuing an econ major, I am glad that I have this background. I did not take econ before, and it did not set me behind much. I definitely recommend taking the course with Katerina. Tolga has a reputation for being a better, more fun, teacher, but I was very impressed with Katerina. She takes the time to answer all of our questions in seminar and even relocated office hours to a more convenient location. She is not alway perfectly clear in her explanations and you need to be sure that you understand everything, but the class is definitely worthwhile.",
    "I would summarize this class as a more math intensive version of the Econ 115 lecture. I would recommend this class to a student interested in pursuing economics, but not to one who only wants to take Microeconomics.",
    "This was a good introductory microecon course, and is good for students across the board whether they major in econ or not. I took the seminar version, and it seemed to have a little more math than the lecture (some basic calculus) but I think both classes cover basically the same material. The problem sets are quite easy, and the workload is light overall. The textbook is very good (though expensive--do not buy at full price) and you should definitely keep up with reading as best you can throughout the course. Simons is a good lecturer and pretty much follows the information in the textbook, so between class notes and reading you'll understand the material just fine. For those who've taken AP micro in high school, this class is very similar. There is much more detail regarding oligopoly and game theory than in AP micro, and you definitely use more math (mostly algebra). Overall a good course.",
    "I would definitely recommend this introduction to microeconomics to any students who has not been exposed to economics before. It's challenging but not terribly difficult or time consuming and the material is both interesting and practical.",
    "Econ 110 is a harder, much smaller version of the lecture. It helps you learn the material way better and simons is great. I recommend this for anyone considering the econ major!",
    "A thorough intro to microeconomics...probably more work than the lecture. One problem set can be dropped and there are 6, and office hours are helpful (the p-sets are time consuming but not too bad). Katerina was funny and made the material interesting. The course is taught in a seminar style but is graded like a lecture (the curve is not great). Midterm was fair; final was super hard! Would recommend taking the lecture unless you absolutely want to learn in a small seminar style.",
    "A fairly deep and very broad overview of microeconomics. The course sticks heavily to the syllabus and the textbook and manages to pack a tremendous amount of content into one semester without seeming rushed. I would higly recommend the course to anyone interested in economics.",
    "I thought this was a very interesting introduction to microeconomics. From talking to my friends in the lecture, it sounds like you generally learn more in the seminar; I certainly felt that we'd learned a lot over the course of the semester. At the same time, I thought Professor Simons was great. Not too much work: six problem sets (but only your best five count), a midterm, and a final. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who thinks they might be interested in learning about economics.",
    "I would summarize it as a solid class, meaning that it will take some effort to do well in, but it will not be difficult to the point where the experience is miserable. I would recommend the class to a student looking for a QR or looking to fill some free time.",
    "A manageable introductory microeconomics class in a comfortable seminar setting. I would recommend it because I feel like I learned a lot."
