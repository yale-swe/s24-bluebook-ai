   "comments": [
    "Yes, definitely. Not only is italian a wonderful language, but everyone who takes it is so much fun and has a great personality.",
    "Definitely take it. Great class",
    "Italian 110 provides a great foundation for the Italian language and covers many grammatical structures and a good deal of vocabulary. I would definitely recommend it to any student interested in learning a new language.",
    "I would recommend it to any student. Italian is a beautiful language and Anna is a fun and likable professor! If you're thinking of taking level 1 Italian, definitely take it with Anna Iacovella.",
    "Be prepared to work you butt off. Lots of people romantacize Italian, but it's a bitch to learn.",
    "Take this class with Iacovella if possible; don't expect it to be a really easy intro class though. The Italian department is great though so if you're thinking of taking a language for a few years, Italian would be a good choice.",
    "I would recommend this course.Language is beautiful, class is not that hard.Anna is a great teacher. Always smiling, fun and nice. She has a perfect Italian accent.",
    "Certainly take Italian 110 - and certainly take it with Prof.ssa Iacovella! She is a skilled language instructor, passionate about her native language and culture, making each lecture and each tidbit of knowledge more interesting. While the Italian language, especially its grammar, can be confusing at times, Professoressa Iacovella does an exceptional job at explaining the intricacies of the language. By encouraging you to speak in the target language in class, you leave with a wonderful understanding of the Italian language, more than prepared to continue onto L2 and higher. The work-load is constant (the class meets daily), but certainly manageable. Don't leave the workbook exercises to the end! If you're looking to study a new, interesting language within a smaller, more intimate department, certainly take Italian 110!",
    "It is a great introduction to the basics of Italian. If you really want to learn Italian then I would definitely recommend it. However, it is very similar to Spanish, so if you have already taken another Romantic language you may want to reconsider taking it or realize that you will have to dedicate extra time to Italian.",
    "Italian 110 is a fun class, but it's a good bit of work (less than Arabic or Chinese, but don't underestimate it), especially if you have morning class. It's tempting to skip class in the morning, but it's really necessary to go as often as possible and practice. Writing assignments are weekly, and take about an hour to complete if you do the full requirement. Likewise there are almost weekly exams and workbook pages to hand in, and the workbook can take hours to do if you leave it for the last night. Thankfully the grading is not very harsh.",
    "Italian Level I is the introductory Italian course. The work is totally manageable if you do it on schedule and don't wait for the last minute. You will learn so much about the language that by the end of the first semester, holding a decent conversation is totally within reason. Take this course with Anna if you can!"
