   "comments": [
    "Was not able to attend section, but Natalia was helpful via email and in office hours. Would have been nice had she provided individual feedback on problem sets.",
    "Take it if you have to.",
    "Yes - necessary for program completion.",
    "504 is a necessary (but not sufficient) class to prepare for the field exam in quantitative methods. It's also lots of fun.",
    "The course very much reflects the Yale Political Science Dept.'s views about quantitative research - namely a big focus on research design. This is great and seems to be the way the field is moving. On the other hand, the course does not do a very good job covering the core elements of statistical models that most researchers rely on in practice. Instead, it simply seems intent on pointing out the weaknesses in these approaches. To some extent, I think this is a mistake, since it leads students to criticize things that they don't really understand.",
    "Yes, I have and will continue to strongly recommend this course to the students below me in my department. It is possible to pick up statistical modeling techniques in many courses in different departments, but (after sitting in on classes in multiple departments) I feel that a course like this is necessary to learn how to carefully think about causal inference, which is ultimately what we all care about.",
    "It's a great summary course, and a great course to help you really think about how to conduct research. If you want to learn how to implement specific techniques it's not the best but that's not the intent of the course. I would highly recommend to anyone interested int taking the course.",
    "I highly recommend the class and think it's a fundamental course for our training as political scientists.",
    "A must take class if you want to know empirical quantitative model.",
    "Yes, I would (and did) recommend the course. It's one of the few graduate courses that provides not only theoretical insight but also practical programming opportunities."

   "question_text": "How did this course deepen your knowledge of your discipline\/profession? To what extent did this course contribute to your dissertation\/research?",
   "comments": [
    "interesting methods but I came away with the impression that I really can't use any of them...",
    "Useful insights into edge-cutting tools; interesting discussions of the peer-reviewed publication process.",
    "In general, quantitative methods will be very important to my research. This course also forced me to think very hard about research design, which is a very good thing. On the other hand, it did not really provide much practical knowledge for doing research. Most of that, I will have to develop on my own.",
    "This course has changed the way I think about what can and cannot be done with data and models. More than \"deepening my knowledge of my discipline\", it has made me a little disturbed by the way my discipline uses data to answer causal questions.Because of this course, I have shifted my dissertation project towards one that is more design-based and amenable to causal inference. I am currently returning to the supplemental course readings (or readings I did not have time to study carefully during the course) as I prepare a proposal for my research next semester. This course will definitely continue to shape my future research.",
    "It has helped immensely. I have a deeper understanding of quantitative methods for research, and I feel more comfortable learning new methods on my own.",
    "Again, this course is of fundamental use for our dissertation, as we prepare to understand causal inference and quantitative methods."
