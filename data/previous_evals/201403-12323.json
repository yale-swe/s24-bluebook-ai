   "comments": [
    "I would recommend it if you want an easy interesting class. The material is not that exciting.",
    "Fascinating subject, and Prof. Slap is great and full of \"inside baseball\" stories from his time as a reporter and now as communications director for the state Dems. But lengthy student presentations ate up at least half of each class, and frankly the quality of discussion just didn't match that of other PLSC seminars I've taken. Shop it, but if your classmates don't seem truly engaged, I'd pass.",
    "I would absolutely recommend it, it was great",
    "I would recommend it if you are interested in the impact of journalism as well as learning about how it is changing for the future.",
    "I would recommended it. Definitely better if you like the subject and are engaged, it could get boring if for two hours you had nothing to say. The presentations every student has to do are interesting and let's you explore sometjing of your own interest.",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone with interests in journalism and government, because the discussions revolve around the intersection of the two. I think this course would be particularly useful to students looking for a career in journalism because it gives them a chance to look at foundations, principles, and impacts of the field. It is one of the few courses at Yale that focuses on journalism.",
    "Seriously, don't take this class. I took it because it seemed mildly interesting and a friend told me it was easy. While there isn't much work, Slap grades pretty harshly and gives no actually constructive criticism. All you have to do is a final paper and a presentation, which may sound nice, but if you fuck that up (because of lack of guidance, let's be honest), you're kind of screwed. Not much interesting about this course, and is graded harshly for a polisci seminar. My advice is to not take it.",
    "I think that the concept behind this class is interesting and certainly worth exploring; the effect of journalism on policy is a topic certainly worth of discussion. Unfortunately, class frequently didn't live up to expectations - in some ways, it almost felt like we were having the same conversation every week, and I wish that we'd focused more on the readings than on the student presentations, which were frequently unfocused and went far over the allotted time. Mr. Slap is certainly experienced in both journalism and public policy, and I wish that his experience came into play more often; not sure how his status as journalist and policy-maker made him uniquely qualified to teach this course, and I think that there was definitely the possibility for that kind of qualification."
