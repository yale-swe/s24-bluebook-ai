    "MATH 225 by Pro. You Qi is a fairly good class, though I strongly recommend those of you who take this class watch the Linear Algebra class in the MIT open course before or concurrently with this class; MATH 225 focuses on proofs, so you might get lost without prior knowledge of linear algebra, which you could grasp in the open course. That being said, I think this class is a good step from high school mathematics to more rigorous mathematics.",
    "Linear algebra is essential for any math major, and this class is pretty good. It moves really slowly, so you shouldn't worry about course load.",
    "The course was very informative, and does well to help introduce students to proof based math. As for myself however, this proved to make it difficult because my mathematics had mostly been problem-based in the past. If you're not great at proofs, be prepared to have to work harder than others in the class.",
    "This is a class that should not be taken if it is not for your major. Honestly, why put yourself through a ton of stress if you don't have to. My suite mates warned me not to take it, but I enjoyed math a lot, so I decided to take it, despite their advice. I really messed up by deciding to take this class. I'm begging you not to take this if you do not have to. Please, think about it.",
    "In the past this course has had a bad reputation, but there is a new professor and it was actually pretty good. Linear algebra is not in itself very inspiring though.",
    "A great first proof-based math course. This class is very theoretical, as the course description makes clear, so don't take it if you're looking for applications. But it is an enjoyable course if you want to understand linear algebra more deeply and\/or work on your proofs. For those serious about math, this should be an easy class, but it is still interesting and engaging. Professor Qi is a great guy and keeps it enjoyable. His math jokes are a great way to start the morning. The P-set are also very manageable, but still satisfying. I'd say if you want a class that will make you think without consuming too much time, take this course.",
    "All in all I enjoyed the course, but think that I personally would have done better taking Math 222. Take 225 if you have a background in proofs or are interested in them for sure. It's hard to grasp what the point of the class is exactly, unless you're into theory and going to be a math major or something. The material is pretty cool though, and it was totally different from any math I had taken before, which was quite interesting.",
    "In short, I definitely recommend this course over Math 222. This is a great course if you want to really understand Linear Algebra (which you should). Professor Qi was very clear, friendly, engaging and accessible. He taught the material well, and encouraged student participation and thought during class. He was also pretty funny. The book is generally pretty clear, and the book\/course presented the material in an order I felt made a lot of sense. Make sure to actually read through how they proved the theorems in the book--I found it really helpful! Also, taking a bit of time sometime during the second half of the course to just read the book from the beginning and remember what we had done was really helpful in understanding later parts of the course.",
    "Linear algebra comes up all over in stats and comp sci, and this class goes through the basics of the subject. In comparison to math 222, this is a much smaller class and the homeworks are much more theoretical (proofs instead of calculations). The tests are reasonable and fair, and You Qi is a great professor--he cares that students learn the material and will help outside of class whenever one needs it. I'm a science but not math major, and proofs were new to me, but I was able to get a lot out of the class after putting in the work on problem sets."
