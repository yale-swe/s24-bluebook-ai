    "Intro to Sound Studies is a class with great assignments that pretty much make it worth taking. Brian Kane is a great human being. He's clearly passionate about the subject and enjoys interacting with students. Some of the readings were a little long, and, as a result, sometimes discussions were a bit subpar because people hadn't done the reading. Take the class if the assignments interest you, otherwise, maybe not...",
    "Really interesting course. It's very self-selecting...take it if you're really excited about sound..duh. Covers sound from many angles -- historically, philosophically, culturally, etc. The papers are open-ended enough that you can basically research whatever you're interested in. Readings are great. Professor Kane is a total genius-- and in such a way that I think everyone left the class wanting to just get a beer with him and talk about life.",
    "Sound Studies are seemingly important to many fields and subjects, and taking the course can give you a vocabulary and avenues to further explore within your own particular interests. Would recommend.",
    "This is a reading-intensive course. With the exception of a few awesome projects, this class is reading and discussion based.",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend the class, particularly to music majors. This is material all music people should know about",
    "I thought it was great format for a class a survey-style course held as a biweekly seminar. You cover different subfields and movements within Sound Studies, do two fun projects, two short papers, and a long final paper. I'd recommend it if Kane teaches it again.",
    "Musi 345 is an introduction to sound studies where sound is viewed as an interdisciplinary field with relevant areas of study in science, history of science, cultural studies, music, and film. I would highly recommend this class to another student-- chances are you have not encountered a class at Yale that looks at sound in this way. Brian Kane is an amazing person to get to spend a semester with. The music department should offer more classes like this one!!!",
    "While there is a lot of it, doing the readings is key to taking the most from the class.",
    "If the student want to think outside the box and have an overwhelming learning experience, yes."
