   "comments": [
    "This class is a great humanities credit. If you enjoy greek mythology, you will love this class.",
    "Interesting class, not too tough.",
    "HSAR 247 is a good class if you're interested in Greek mythology and want to get a broad survey of many topics. The workload and readings are reasonable. Going to lecture is important or else it is hard to catch up on the material.",
    "I would not recommend this course if you're not an art history major, or have no experience with art history. As someone who took the class out of interest rather than any requirement, it was very difficult to do well and little help was provided.",
    "Great class about ancient Greece. Take it if you like that topic.",
    "It's an intense introduction to Greek Myth and Art and you have the potential to learn a lot if you engage and pay attention. I would recommend this course to another student if they were looking for an engaging and in depth intro to Ancient Greece Civ.",
    "I'd recommend this course if you're really interested in Ancient Greek myth. It looks at the complex interplay between art and literature and myth, so be prepared to actually do some reading too, not just look at art. Professor Gaifman is lovely and approachable, but expectations for essay and midterm were somewhat unclear--definitely talk things through with your TF to see what they're looking for. Overall, pretty cool course with reasonable workload--not the worst, not the best, but if you're into Greek antiquity, I'd recommend it as a good survey of their myths.",
    "Art and Myth in Greek Antiquity is a fun and interesting art history course that shows just how key mythology was to both the ancient Greek artistic canon and to the central metaphors of its society and norms. The specificity of the topic allows students to leave feeling like there really is a part of the museum they will understand, connect to, and enjoy more than before the took the course, and it avoids the fatigue-inducing structure of a survey class. The work is definitely manageable and it's pleasant to learn how to write and analyze in the realm of art history."
