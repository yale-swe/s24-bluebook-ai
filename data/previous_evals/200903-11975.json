   "comments": [
    "It's a class about how to read changes in the cityscape, how one experiences the city, questions of what is public\/private space, how does one analyze a city, etc.",
    "Yes! If you have any interest in urban landscapes or in New Haven, take this class! The reading is reasonable, and the shorter assignments are straightforward, fun, and hardly feel like \"work\". The field trips help open your eyes to the urban landscape and history of New Haven. Professor Rubin exudes a lot of energy and passion for his field of study and is always willing to help his students. One of the best classes I've taken here.",
    "I would recommend this course, but be warned that the kind of activities described on the syllabus-walks through the city, field projects- sound great during shopping period, but when you are pressed for time by midterm, they become inconvenient and a lot of the potential enjoyment can be taken out of them because of this.",
    "Field Trips, Good and sometimes hard readings- fun work.",
    "Urban Life and Landscape is a great course for someone who does not have much background in urban studies - the readings cover multiple perspectives on the city and will give you an excellent overall understanding of the field. The projects throughout the semester are best for those who are willing to be creative and think outside the box a little bit. Overall, good class, not too much work, but not extremely light either. The paper at the end of the semester is tough to get through, but doable.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this class. It offers an overview of the urban environment and focuses your attention to certain details that you may not normally notice. The work and the reading was quite enjoyable and class discussions were usually engaging.",
    "A great course on cities and the interaction between architecture and culture. It's a bit touchy feely, which isn't necessarily bad, but could bother some students. Overall I would absolutely recommend the class; I enjoyed the readings and always looked forward to seminar. The discussions were interesting and the field trips were always fun (if a bit disorganized at times).",
    "Urban Life and Landscape is a wonderful course that I would recommend to any student with an interest in urban studies. Reading assignments and papers are manageable and enjoyable. Students complete several varied assignments that take many forms from report to photo montage. I appreciated the three field trips that gave students the opportunity to explore New Haven. Professor Rubin is a fantastic instructor because of his availability to students and the structure and knowledge, which he brought to the class."
