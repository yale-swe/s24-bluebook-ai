   "comments": [
    "Brilliant introduction to the statistics involved in social sciences for those not mathematically inclined: complete emphasis on the qualitative aspect of all the papers we read but explanation of all the statistics and regression tables in class. Really great broad introduction to a lot of the themes in global affairs\/ political science, from international development and allocation of goods to experiment designs to regime types",
    "Learned a lot about democracy and reading polisci papers.",
    "I learned a lot about democracies and how complex they really are.",
    "While this is not an introductory course, I found that it covers a diverse and comprehensive list of topics in political science, from corruption to inequality to ethnicity. I developed a broad knowledge of the cutting-edge research in political science today. More broadly, I learned how to read political science research papers in a critical and time-efficient way, and I now understand basic statistical methods that are widely used in the social sciences.",
    "I developed an understanding of the obstacles young democracies go through during democratization and how different factors may play into the trajectory of a young democracy. More so, I was able to understand fully what political science experiments look like and the different approaches there are to them, as well as being able to interpret their data. More so, I learned about different countries from around the world and their histories and different experiences with democratization."

   "comments": [
    "It's a lot of reading but honestly the vast majority is very engaging",
    "This course definitely covered a lot of academic material, but also made students relate it to real-life examples with the presentations. The professor goes through all the material thoroughly, which is also good. I wish we had more \"interactive\" activities, like the last day of class in which students led discussion, but overall I really did enjoy the class.",
    "A little boring at times and its a little weird that professor marks attendance especially when this class isnt even a seminar.",
    "Too focused on specific papers, often felt like we were just memorizing each title and a few sentence blurb on them.",
    "This course covers great material, and a fantastic lecturer and TA in Professor de La O and TA Shikhar Singh. No matter your specific interest in politics, there's something for everyone in this course: development, corruption, elections, welfare programs, political dynasties. The group projects are interesting too, and the grading was always fair. I think discussion went best when Prof. de La O asked us an open-ended question and then encouraged debate between students, so more time could be devoted to that sort of discussion.",
    "The class was super interesting and always pushed us to think about these challenges in different ways, considering that a challenge to democratization might look differently in another place. The use of various group activities also helped us stay engaged with the material and think critically about the topics. I think the class could benefit from the use of different types of media, perhaps a video or some sort, as we had a movie assigned on the syllabus and that led to a great discussion in class. Overall, the class is great."

   "comments": [
    "Would definitely recommend. Extremely engaging conversations and the type of world that is both demanding but also very easy to take the back seat on when other things need to be prioritized (you just catch up on the readings)",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend this course to another student. The material is interesting, the professor is passionate, and the discussions in class were really thought-provoking.",
    "It's a really great class if you're actually interested in the material. There's a lot of reading but it's not a problem if you find political science articles interesting, and Prof. De La O is very nice and a clear lecturer.",
    "If youre interested in political regimes then yeah go for it. Not too much of a time commitment.",
    "Definitely! Especially for students interested in social science methods, democracy, or development. I found this course to be far more interdisciplinary and comprehensive than I expected, in a really positive way. It makes for a great introductory course in current topics in political science with a small class that still functions as a lecture. Professor de La O knows her stuff, and she asks great questions of the class that led to more engagement. The workload isn't that rough; basically just two social science research papers a week and one 20 minute presentation.",
    "I would! The class is definitely helpful for anyone interested in the political science major who wants practice looking at and interpreting political science research and data, all while learning about it in the context of the world. More so, the class goes in depth with these topics and doesn't gloss over them, which I found very helpful and why I would recommend the class to another student."
