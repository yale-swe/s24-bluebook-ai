   "comments": [
    "Not recommended. Professor Sethi is very nice and can be a great lecturer, but some of the topics were so dry. The class could be great if there was more discussion and debate among students and more use of case studies. Instead, there is just lots of abstract theory.",
    "No. There are better business ethics classes available (especially spring semester). Just wait it out.",
    "Good overview of the topic. Most readings are interesting. Yes I would recommend it.",
    "Fun and engaging intro to business ethics and corporate conduct as a whole. Wanders all over the place, with Sethi providing colorful anecdotes along the way. Not a particularly difficult course, but sometimes feels unorganized. Low reading requirements, high writing requirements on the weeks you are assigned to respond.",
    "Beware that there is almost no discussion component in this course -- essentially Professor Sethi lectures for almost 2 hrs and occasionally asks rhetorical questions. This is incredibly difficult to sit through for a morning seminar.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course, if you get in, then please take it."
