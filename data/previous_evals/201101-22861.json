   "comments": [
    "MUSI334 is a fun class to take. you get to sing with professional instrumentalists!",
    "Absolutely. A great way to be exposed to early music, whether you are familiar with it or not; the class has a fun camaraderie about it, and the concerts are always a ball. Prof Malafronte and Prof Herreid are very passionate and knowledgeable about this era of music - you can learn a lot from them, while also having a lot of fun!",
    "A fantastic class that delves into music history and allows you to sing beautiful early music!",
    "It's a great class as long as the class size is not too big and as long as the students take it seriously, notjust as a gut. Yes, the class is very easy, but it can also be very enjoyable. Unfortunately, the best thing about the class is leaving this semester, Professor Malafronte.",
    "If you are a good sight-reader, absolutely take this class! It was one of my favorite at Yale. You rehearse for twohours a week and give two concerts during the semester. The professors give you an excellent overview of the history and background of the pieces you perform and the concerts are very well put together--in both a musical and historical sense. You'll learn a ton about music theory and history but you will mostly grow as a performer. It is also a lot of fun to sing with so many talented Yalies. You will definitely learn a lot from them as well. I am very glad I took this course and have left a more confident singer. I will be searching for opportunities like this in the future.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class to competent singers. The low-key environment enabled me to learn a lot in an enjoyable way.",
    "This is a good class. It'll be changing without Prof. Malafronte, but it's a fun chance to learn some early rep and get to work with incredible instrumentalists (Robert Mealy is a genius).Not too much work. Lots of singing. Class can be a bit dull, but it's usually alright. Overall, a lot of fun and a good class if you like performance.",
    "Mostly just singing for 2 hours once a week. Assignments are just program notes before each of the two concerts and terms at the end of the semester (and obviously going to the concerts). This is a great class if you're interested in old choral music and you're a good sight reader (that's really what the audition is for). Maybe don't do what I did, which is make it the last of four classes in one day (it's just so hard and tedious to sit through when you're tired).",
    "YES. Really helped me grow as a musician and a fun relaxed class where I actually learned a lot of music history too!",
    "This class is really chill and a lot of fun. It's a great way to gain exposure to early music. The repertoire we studied and sang was really cool, even for a newcomer to early music. I'd definitely recommend this class, particularly for any singers who haven't already been exposed to this type of music.",
    "The course is an opportunity to learn basics about early music history and theory through performance (and a little bit of reading and writing). The experience in the course might depend on who your classmates are. The workload depends on who will be teaching the course. Also, the chance to perform accompanied by the orchestra(s) that the profs hire really is amazing.",
    "It is a fun, relatively chill course where you will be doing a lot of sight-singing and some solo work. It is a super fun fifth class or senior class, with few commitments (only three very short written assignments all semester) other than expecting musical aptitude. The professors are super passionate and interesting people that you will want to get to know outside of the classroom.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to any singer. This was a really good course that practices a lot of sight reading skills. It has a really relaxed environment and that makes the class really fun to take.",
    "It was a fairly easy class, and if you like early music, extremely enjoyable!",
    "I would recommend it. Singing beautiful music with other enthusiastic singers is very satisfying and enjoyable.",
    "It is a vocal music course that focuses more on being exposed to this genre of music than on technique or other performative aspects. Usually fun!"
