   "comments": [
    "Plant ID",
    "Basically everything I know now",
    "A budding grasp on the diversity of woody plant diversity in Connecticut and strong familiarity with many prominent woody plants in the region.",
    "Knowledge of temperate trees and woody shrubs, including common community types. Skill in being able to recognize ecological traits and patterns among woody plants.",
    "My ID skill improved tremendously.",
    "I learned how to recognize so many different trees, vines, and shrubs in CT!",
    "I learned a lot of tree species!",
    "This class is incredibly useful for learning plant identification. Marlyse also touches on some key concepts about land use history, geology, and silviculture in the region.",
    "Great taxonomy skills, plant identification skills, skills to be able to read landscape better, skills to make thoughtful insights for identification.",
    "Marlyse's class taught a range of skills including plant identification, habitat and ecology, plant taxonomy, morphology, soils, hydrology, and more. While challenging and deeply engaging, Marlyse's class was the highlight of my term. In the course, I learned to identify plants using sophisticated ID techniques that included visible traits, smell, environment, and more. As a forester, these skills are incredibly important. It is also valuable to engage in a course thas primarily field-based to learn functional skills I will use in my work outside. This class will leave an indelible mark on my education at Yale and in my future training as a forester.",
    "I learned basics of forest science and tree identification techniques with a focus on southern New England tree populations."

   "comments": [
    "Very well",
    "Absolutely aligned with and exceeded my expectations",
    "Very much in alignment with my expectation to be able to skillfully assess and identify trees.",
    "I thought I was going to learn about trees, and that is what we did.",
    "I learned exactly what I expected to learn and more. There was a lot of material on geology and other place based information that I did not anticipate learning.",
    "Very well; I felt that the class delivered exactly what I was expecting!",
    "Very well!",
    "The knowledge, skills, and insights gained in dendrology far exceeded my expectations. I expected a course on plant identification. I learned a rounded set of skills that included systems ecology, how climate affects plant life, morphology over time and space, and a range of other skills that stimulated my curiosity about local ecosystems and will serve me well in my career. I heard frequently from students that Marlyse's class is the best course offered at the School of Forestry and Environmental Studies. After completing the course, I would agree and add that it is \"the best\" because it inspires curiosity, challenges students, is fun, interactive, and well-tailored for a number of career paths.",
    "Perfectly. We focused a lot more on the individual tree species than the broader forest ecosystem but I learned a lot."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of the course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "A strength of this course was that it was field based, which was a ton of fun and really helped me learn plant IDs.",
    "The consistency of the classes, the field-based aspected of the course, as well as Marlyse and Laura's laid back but well informed natures were all great strengths that aided in my own learning. Field cards are also a great weekly assignment. I would have appreciated a more structured way to learn the content that ended up on the written final exam. It was good and important content that I wish I'd been able to learn more about but learning them through (what felt like) normal conversation or random facts in a setting that is difficult to take extensive notes in was not a good way for me to learn or retain that information. Also a written midterm might be helpful!",
    "Strengths: Marlyse is an absolutely lovely person and the sites we visited were well organized and well chosen. The weekly quizzes kept us accountable to really learn and remember the material. Weaknesses: The readings were a bit too much and the final caught me off guard. I think if we got a small amount of materials to review (maybe vocabulary with pictures as we did on the first day or with trap rock ridges on the East Rock Day) it would be a bit easier to learn the supplementary material.",
    "More emphasis on plant habitat in quizzes would be helpful.",
    "Strength of the class is the field portion of the class. Being able to see plant communities and recognize ecological patterns of the plants we studied was essential. A weakness of the class is that the final paper is a bit out of character with the structure of the rest of the class. Additionally, much of the content of the final exam was only peripherally (if at all) talked about or formally taught during the course.",
    "I think the instructor really needs to clarify the learning objectives regarding phylogeny and habitat. Even though this is field based, readings should be incorporated more into the class meetings.",
    "Marlyse does an excellent job describing what makes each plant special. Sometimes we use more colloquial terms when describing the plants, which made studying for the written final difficult since we needed to know the technical names of the traits. I also, knowing nothing about soils, could have benefitted from more description of what different soil types mean.",
    "I love that we go out into the forest for class!",
    "This course is fast-paced, and gets you out the field every week actively practicing plant identification skills. The positive side of this is that as a student you have the opportunity to take in a huge volume of information. The downside is that if you miss a class, it can be very hard to catch up again. That being said, I'm not sure there is any real way to improve this, except for maybe holding review\/catch-up sessions periodically (or perhaps facilitating a way for students to do this on their own).",
    "Marlyse is an incredible professor! In field identification was great!",
    "The greatest strength of dendrology is the the instruction by Marlyse and our TF Laura Green. Both Marlyse and Laura are deeply passionate about the subject and it comes through. They are also incredibly knowledge and ready to learn actively like we are as students. With Marlyse and Laura, I felt both safe in the fact that I would be learning and comforted by knowing they saw me as an equal participant in the learning process. The class includes a set of weekly quizzes, a midterm, final, and one long essay. The weekly quizzes are great for keeping students accountable to the material. I found myself studying regularly for the quizzes and engaging in the material. At first, studied hard for these weekly quizzes - which do not account for much of the grade - because I am generally Type A. As the term went along; however, I found myself studying hard because I wanted to impress Marlyse and Laura with the knowledge I had gained from their teaching. The midterm was a comprehensive tree identification test. The weekly quizzes prepared me considerably for the test and my grade reflected this. Without the quizzes, I may have punted the material until the midterm and crammed. The test was challenging but fair. The final paper allowed students to engage with material of our choosing in a 10-page paper. I loved the paper because it allowed me to pick a geography of my own to take a deep dive into. I heard from some students who found it somewhat distracted and off-topic; however, for me, as a student who will likely never work in the geography we were studying, this offered an opportunity to gain some knowledge about the geography I do plan to go to after graduation. Last, the final test was very difficult and reflected some issues regarding my own preparedness. The test included a plant ID portion - which I was well prepared for. Following the ID, we did a written test that included information from reading and general course synthesis. This section was difficult and included information I wasn't certain we covered in the class. This material was likely in weekly readings I either skimmed or skipped. The course is so focused on the field material that students like myself - often glaze over the readings. I would suggest some sort of assessment in the middle of the class to hold students accountable to the readings. I wish I had been more focused on this because that section of the final - on our last day of class - felt defeating after an incredibly successful and stimulating course. Marlyse's class was THE BEST course I have taking in my college career which includes junior college, undergraduate, some post graduate credits, and now graduate school. Marlyse should be commended for her care for students, knowledge, field skills, and engagement. Please consider Marlyse for a tenure-track position. She is so central to the lifeblood of the forestry track at FES and a treasure in our program. Her class was a refuge in an otherwise challenging first term of school. She challenged me to produce high-quality work, to learn, to engage with the material, and to offer my best skills and insights every day in class. Thank you, Marlyse!!!",
    "Marlyse is the highlight and makes the class. I looked forward to each session and loved getting outside. We went to different ecosystems each week and explored the natural surroundings. No real weaknesses! I wouldnt have minded a short, 5-10 minute lecture on the localized ecosystem before each class (after the quizzes) to help facilitate learning. I think we focused so much on the specific tree populations that sometimes a lost the bigger picture."

   "comments": [
    "It's a great class, but it may not be very relevant to you if you don't plan to work in this region.",
    "Do it!",
    "If you want to learn how to identify woody plant species, I can't imagine a better class to take then this one. You will also learn small bits of evolutionary history, geology, ecology, etc., but the vast majority of this class is devoted to learning and memorizing local woody flora.",
    "This is the best class I've taken at FES. Definitely take it if you're interested in being able to better recognize and identify ecological patterns and plant composition.",
    "Study the trees throughout the week. If the class feels overwhelming at first it will get better as you become more accustomed to the class structure and the scientific names",
    "If you have a strong desire and\/or need to gain plant identification skills, this is the class to take! The weekly quizzes will help you gradually add more and more trees to your bank of knowledge. If you do choose to take the course, do it with an understanding that it can be very difficult to catch up after missing classes, as the in-person field experience is key to learning.",
    "I would advise them to study consistently but not to stress the little mistakes! Additionally, press for information expected to glean from outside readings.",
    "First of all, reach out to Marlyse directly so that you can get into the class. On our first day, three times the number of students allotted showed up to sit-in on the class. You won't get in unless you prepare to do so and engage with Marlyse. Once in the class, prepare weekly for the quizzes, but do not stress them. You will find yourself wanted to learn and succeed in the course because it is so engaging, and not because of the grade. The quizzes are for you and should be treated as such. Second, study with friends in the course, in the field. Go outside, get curious, be that weird person staring at tree buds on-campus. You won't regret it and will have a lot of fun doing so. Third, do the readings. She will hold you accountable for them in the final. Finally, please seek out Marlyse and Laura as a source of knowledge and support. Marlyse is the best instructor I have found in FES for giving context about the university and the process of navigating graduate school. She is like a professor, career counselor and sometimes therapist mixed into one. She knows this school because she experienced it for many years as a student. Leverage her institutional knowledge and pay close attention to everything she says.",
    "It takes a lot of work but its well worth it! Spend more time focusing on learning tree attributes and less on the Latin names. I did the opposite at the beginning which wasnt helpful!"
