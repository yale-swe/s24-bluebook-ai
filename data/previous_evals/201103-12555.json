   "comments": [
    "pretty easy class for the math major, and really interesting material. it's really the foundation of math. and professor zuckerman really puts in the effort to get to know the students. really good class, really good professor.",
    "As a math major, I thoroughly enjoyed this course. The workload was very manageable and Professor Zuckerman is both approachable and engaging. Take the time to get to know him and speak to him after class. It's worth it.However, this IS real math - proof-based math - so be aware of that. It's probably not a great idea to take it if you haven't taken real college-level mathematics (or at least be prepared for a bit of a learning curve in that case).",
    "Set theory is one of the most interesting courses I've taken at Yale. It's a great introduction to proof-based (ie- real) mathematics as well as formal logic. I had an interest in set theory coming into the course, and though it was a little tough for me at points in the middle of the semester, I came out happy to have taken the class and feeling as though I learned a lot. Unfortunately, the course only covers a very basic level of set theory: the axiom of choice, the construction of the reals, etc. are left out. But still, that's a lot more than most undergrads get.",
    "You should take it, but be advised the course lies at an awkward place between being a class for math and math-philosophy majors. I felt it probably went too slowly and didn't cover as much material as a regular math course, but I imagine it must have been quite a step up in proof-based math for math-philosophy majors. I can't see myself having taken this class without the preparation I'd gotten from other math courses.",
    "The class appeals to a wide variety of people, from people who have never taken a college proof-based math class to those with much more experience. The material is pretty abstract, so it did not give me as much of a sense of the foundations of mathematics as I would have hoped. We went very slowly the first few months while Zuckerman went beyond the material in the textbook, so we got to the more interesting stuff only at the end of the semester and did not get the opportunity to delve into that material as much as I would have liked. Professor Zuckerman is very good. He is quite friendly and approachable, and gets to know all of his students personally by the end of the semester.",
    "MATH 270 is a slightly non-standard introduction to axiomatic set theory. The course felt slow at the beginning but picked up towards the end. Prof. Zuckermann is a wise old professor with a great sense of humor. He explains the material extremely well.",
    "A sweet math class. Take it. It's not that much work (only a handful of psets, two midterms and a final) and the material isn't all that difficult. Professor Zuckerman goes slowly, so you don't cover that much, but you'll come to appreciate the nuances that he observes in set theory. Set theory is quite abstract, but it will probably get you thinking differently. Highly recommended.",
    "Yes if you want an easy credit toward the math major.",
    "A proof-based math course, Set Theory might seem intimidating to a non-math major but to a math major this could be a nice light course to balance out a schedule. The workload this semester was 5 problem sets of reasonable length (25%), 2 midterms (20% each), and a final (35%). We received timely feedback on homework and exams. If you\u0092re considering the course for a QR, understand that you don\u0092t need *any* prerequisites (the bluebook says 120 but that\u0092s completely wrong\u0097we never did any calculus). If you\u0092re comfortable with learning how to write proofs\u0097basically explaining every step in the solution of a puzzle\u0097then Set Theory could be a good QR, even if you have no math background. My biggest objection to the course is that the pace is quite slow: Zuckerman only covered about half of the syllabus. (So, math majors, take at least one other math course with it.)"
