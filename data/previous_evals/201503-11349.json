   "comments": [
    "BIOL 102 is likely required for you. Just know, it's very different from 101. The slide and lecture format changes, and its' very easy to feel completely lost in lecture. Trust me, you won't be the only one who feels this way. I recommend doing the readings before every lecture so that you can use lectures as supplements to material you already have a decent grasp of and to answer any remaining questions you have. Otherwise, lecture can seem like a waste of time as Professor Mooseker moves fairly quickly and it's hard to learn the material just by going to lecture alone. Reading afterwards is fine too, but then you showed up to lecture and didn't get as much as you would've otherwise. tldr; read before lecture, it makes a world of difference.",
    "Well, you probably have to take this class so sorry. The subject matter is dry and at times was not in any way like an INTRO bio class. Mooseker is nice but moves very fast. A lot of emphasis (I thought too much) on experimental tools, which I understand are important but I also think aren't the most valuable thing to be taught. I liked 101 a lot better.",
    "You have to take it, but it's not great. But the topics are interesting. Definitely utilize the peer tutors as a resource!",
    "Don't fall asleep in lecture. Pay attention. Read the textbook when you don't understand. Don't blow this off just because you did well in 101, because this one's much harder.",
    "I would recommend this class to only those people that are premed or have an interest for biology. Otherwise it is just a waste of your time.",
    "Lots of information thrown at you at once with no real means of distilling it.",
    "Not really an introduction to cell biology or an overview of the subject. You go very in depth in the membrane, protein secretion,and the cytoskeleton but don't touch on any of the other functions of the cell.",
    "Lots and lots and lots of detail, a lot of concepts to understand, not just memorize. A lot of them are interconnected or depend on each other, so you really need to have a thorough understanding of the course. Read the book to get help on concepts you don't understand - the book is actually a lifesaver for certain topics. Ask a lot of questions and get answers to them before the tests, because they are challenging.",
    "Not recommend if you don't have to take it, but if you are taking it you probably have to.",
    "Biol 102 will definitely challenge you, but it is a great course to take because you learn a lot of interesting material and get to apply you knowledge when you read the research papers.",
    "PSETs and exams hard. Mosseker is fine but be prepared to basically learn everything on your own. He doesn't spoon feed you anything.",
    "Take this class only if you really need it. It is difficult and fast paced. Be sure to keep on top of the material and ask questions immediately if you don't understand a concept.",
    "Only take if needed for premed\/major.",
    "Significantly harder than 101, but if you have to take it, it's not the worst. You'll learn a lot.",
    "BIOL 102 is more difficult than 101, but an extremely worthwhile class in which you will learn a ton of new information and concepts (far beyond what is taught in high school biology). You will get practice reading scientific research papers and work through challenging problem sets that expect you to apply material from lecture into experimental situations.",
    "BIOL 102 is a lot of hard work, but if you manage to get through it with a good grade you'll have a great and valuable understanding of the current knowledge on cell biology. If you can't cope, or have to skim through significant amounts of material, the course will lose its value.",
    "I thought that overall the course was fine. The material was not too challenging once you really spent the time investing yourself in it, but lectures were hard to follow because there was often vocabulary and concepts mentioned in an explanation that we hadn't actually learned yet.",
    "Sometimes it can be very tempting to fall asleep in class, because Mooseker speaks so quickly that it's easy to get lost and want to lay your head down in mild despair. Sometimes you will fall into temptation and then wake up five or ten minutes later three times as lost because you just missed about 10-15 slides. Aside from that, the TA's are really willing to help, there're enrichment sessions you can ask to join if you feel like you're struggling, and the use of scientific papers to drive home the biological concepts learned in class is a fairly effective method of helping students learn. It's not bad, you just have to know how to keep up with Mooseker.",
    "It's a lot of content to cover in just half a semester, but definitely take it! It is a great way to improve critical thinking skills, and the grading is always very reasonable. The exams and psets are definitely fair, though a good study group is essential to success in this class, unless you have a really good TF support system or are super proactive about the readings and lectures.",
    "For students interested in BIOL or a major in it, I highly recommend BIOL 102. Especially for students with a background in research, the lectures will be very enjoyable. However, the BIOL modules are definitely not for everyone. BIOL 102 provides an appreciable challenge, anyone looking for a relaxing semester may not want to place this particular module at the top of their list.",
    "I would recommend this class if you're interested in studying biology. Obviously, many people have to take it but if you do, I wouldn't worry about it. I liked the class. It can go really fast sometimes, so be ready to do a decent amount of studying on your own outside of lecture. Professor Mooseker can go through things quickly but he's always willing to stop and answer questions so take advantage of that. Also, I can't stress enough how important it is to meet with the peer tutors if you're having trouble with the class. They know what they're talking about and can make sure that you don't get lost. Overall, it's a good class and the material is actually interesting once you get into it. There are five problem sets, one midterm, one final, and research papers to read for section each week.",
    "The subject matter is interesting and relevant. Expect to have to study quite a bit. Reading the textbook can help.",
    "Great course.",
    "It's a prerequisite for a lot of science classes, but I really wouldn't recommend taking it unless you have to. I found the material frustrating and poorly taught, and assessments seemed unfair. Good luck!",
    "Would recommend.",
    "You're taking this because you have to, and you'll get through it and learn quite a bit. Just don't expect to enjoy it.",
    "It's meant to be a hard class with a lot of material. Just work through it and spend time with the peer tutors and TA's when you can. Don't be afraid to call up your TA's because they're amazing people who just want to see you succeed in life. Plus, once you start understanding the concepts everything just starts to be okay.",
    "One of the worst classes at Yale. This class is so poorly organized that you have no idea what's going on and how you jump from one topic to the next. Before you take this class ask yourself if why you're taking it. If it's for fun just don't. If you're required to take it really reflect on how much you want to do that because it may not be worth it just because of this one class. You will feel personally victimized by this class.",
    "Although you might have heard that BIOL 102 is the hardest of the four introductory biology modules, do not be afraid. Professor Mooseker goes quickly through lecture, but he also holds weekly review sessions and answers questions on Piazza and there are also several peer tutoring sessions throughout the week. This is definitely a rewarding class, and you will come away with a deeper understanding of cell mechanics.",
    "A great class where I learned a lot more than I ever expected to learn. By the end, I could keep up with difficult papers and discussions I wouldn't be able to before-- although I was doubtful that the intro bio sequence would actually help me, this class showed me how useful it really was. So much better than the hell that was BIOL 101. You'll be totally lost in lecture unless you read the textbook pages before attending- lecture is a good way to review what you just learned and have little questions answered, but not a good way to learn something completely new. Would definitely recommend printing the PowerPoints beforehand, going through them while reading the textbook pages, and trying to answer the \"red questions\", all before attending lecture. Otherwise, it will be unintelligible. Problem sets were challenging at first but overall will teach you so much if you take time to work through them. Tests were very fair-- I recommend reviewing problem sets and looking at the learning goals that are outlined before each section on the PowerPoints. There's also always Piazza to help you- some TA's could really improve in their Piazza answers and overall knowledge. I understand that there were a lot of questions, but some were truly clueless and it actually made me wonder how they could become TA's if they themselves didn't know the answers to questions being asked in an intro biology class. No answer would have been better than the wrong answers certain TA's would consistently give. Overall, if you put work into the class, you won't be disappointed (I did not find this to be true with BIOL 101).",
    "Bio 2 is tougher than bio 1 for sure. Be sure to to the textbook readings in addition to the lecture slides! You can get there by seeking out resources--everyone in this course really wants to see you succeed.",
    "Bio 102 with Professor Mooseker is manageable and honestly not as terrible as people say it is, but nonetheless still not the most pleasant. He started the module by telling us that everyone hates him and the 102 module, which was not exactly a positive start to the course, but it course didn't end up being that terrible. It has major flaws though. It's not exactly that he goes excessively fast (though he does move through the slides at a very quick pace), but it's that he can't recognize what material and concepts require clear explanation to intro level students. He glosses over or entirely skips over lots of \"basics\" in lecture that he assumes we know. Because of this, it was always really hard to follow the material in lecture without having read the textbook beforehand. I never read the textbook for Bio 101 but did every reading for 102 because there would've been no other way for me to do the psets. The naming system he used for slides and units on classesV2 was a massive headache. The material of 102 itself is not extremely challenging if you review slides and read the textbook, and some of it is quite interesting. The psets required a lot more time and thought compared to 101 psets. Don't take it if you don't have to, but if you do have to, you'll survive.",
    "Biology 102 was a pretty good course. The 75 minute lectures often felt very tedious, but such is the nature of a 75 minute lecture. I did not really enjoy going to class, but I do feel like I learned a significant amount from each lecture. I would definitely recommend printing out all of the lecture slides prior to class, even though there are a lot of pages; you have to put in a lot of effort to stay engaged, and I think having the slides in front of me were a key part in that. Overall, it was a good introductory course to cell bio, and if you're thinking about taking this class, you probably have to take it anyway for your major. It probably is the worst module of the intro bio sequence, but it is actually not that bad!",
    "BIOL 102 moves very quickly and is a lot of work, and is very hard. But, you will look back on the course and be glad you took it and that it wasn't that bad because you learned a lot throughout. I would recommend BIOL 102 to students who need to take it for credit or if you're extremely interested in biology.",
    "I would recommend BIOL 102 to another student, because although the course is challenging, the information in the course is both important and necessary for a future in the sciences.",
    "The experience of BIOL102a was like sitting in a windowless, white room twice a week. This room is completely empty other than a single speaker box from which a constant stream of numbers is broadcast without any clear structure or punctuation. At the end of the course you are asked to recite the numbers you heard. What this metaphor is trying to convey is that many good facts and scientific methods were presented without the necessary context. As a student new to biology, the first half of each lecture was spent asking, is this a process happening in my body, in a plant, in a text tube, in a cell? Which part of the cell is this? How many organelles does a cell have? After about 35 minutes of intense concentration with no clear answers to these questions, I lost interest in the lecture and hoped to gain insight from the textbook.",
    "I would recommend the course to another student because of how well organized it was. It ran like a well oiled machine and the examinations were fair.",
    "Fascinating and challenging problem sets and exams. Meaningful Sections. Excellent, consistent, evidence-based teaching\/pedagogical philosophy. Reasonable weekly workload. Overall, too much material. Poor main lecturer. Sometimes questionable testing. Strengths: -Yales biology department is one of its strongest. In fact, from the impression I get, it is one of the good ones in the nation. The best reason is the teaching philosophy. The BIOL department is at the forefront of strengthening STEM education and the BIOL module is at the heart of this dynamism. Key features include: early reading of primary scientific literature, big emphasis on primary methods, discouraging most memorization, individual presentations during Sections (communication skills for STEM majors), effective Piazza management, well-trained TAs, rigorous feedback systems, access to a range of resources (Peer Tutors, Enrichment I and II, review sessions), transparent grading and clear syllabi. -I think BIOL sections are an intelligent addition to the course. It was mentioned that you can only be a well-informed layman if you read secondary literature on the sciences. To be a scientist, you need to read academic papers. Some are horribly written and challenging. Others are wonderful and easy-to-follow. But they all build critique and scientific discussions skills. -The problem sets and exams are a mixed bag. All in all, I think theyre a great idea. Each problem set is very short (3 problems) but usually very challenging. It can take hours of discussions with fellow peers, peer tutors etc and Google searches before you find an answer. Oddly, the professors and TAs had a policy of not discussing the problem set at all and even Piazza questions about the pset were often met with hostile rejection and skepticism. This was a mistake. On the other hand, for better or for worse, most answers could be found on a single slide of one lecture or another. But given that the professor sometimes covered 140 slides in one class, this wasnt easy. -Psets each week, read a paper each week, 1 midterm, 1 final. A lot for a 0.5 credit course to be honest but overall not stressful. The overall material, however, is too much. Luckily, the professor admits it and gives you a hilariously generous amount of choice on the exam you do 10 of some 18 questions and can basically skip many topics for study. -The saving grace of the course for me was Enrichment. Professor Lin is an excellent teacher who teaches things logically and calmly without expecting everyone to have done everything in high school. Without Enrichment, I wouldve failed. Now, I probably have an A. Weaknesses: -Lectures were poor and useless. If you are new to biology, you will learn nothing. If youve done biology but havent read the book before a challenging lecture, you will learn nothing. Mooseker teaches every lecture as if youve done everything he has taught in high school and his job is only to make you think critically. Ive never taken biology in high school so I felt disillusioned. Professor Mooseker cant explain anything in a 200-student setting. His demonstrations are wasteful, awkward and annoying. He moves way too fast (sometimes 140 slides in one class). He does not speak clearly. His whistle system fails to understand student insecurities and reluctance to proclaim your stupidity in class, especially because preparation differs so atrociously in BIOL courses. I must admit hes gotten too old now its time for a change. You could read the book, read the lectures and never show up to class and still get the same grade. -Slides are chaotic and often only contain a series of unconnected images without any textual explanation (which lecture fails to provide). As usual, STEM professors need to work on their structural organization, effective communication text formatting, graphic design and public speaking abilities. Youre not smart unless you can explain clearly what you know.",
    "Biol 102 is a fair class. I'd recommend it if you really like biology.",
    "Biol 102 is an introductory course to biology that covers cell biology and membrane physiology. I would recommend it to other students because it covers important primary literature and thoroughly covers many essential concepts in cell biology.",
    "BIOL 102 is so much harder than 101... Good luck...",
    "BIOL102 is very dull and dry. Mooseker is very smart, but he does a poor job of explaining concepts to the class. If you have to take this class it's fine, but I wouldn't recommend it to someone who is just interested in biology for fun.",
    "If you're looking to fulfill a science credit I would take something else. But otherwise, if you're a biology major or stem major, you will really enjoy this course. It is very fast paced, but worth it.",
    "I would only recommend BIOL 102 to another student if that student had specific interest in the layout of the cell, or had to take it for a requirement. I would tell the student that it's a huge overload of information each lecture, and that he\/she should try to read over the material independently before the lecture, then write down as much as possible during lecture, and then try to really understand it afterwards.",
    "I would say BIO 102 is a good course. It is a bit of a step from 101, but the subject can be quite interesting and it is very satisfying to see oneself become much more familiar with the actual forms of cell biology.",
    "If your not interested in biology then this course is not for you.",
    "I would recommend this class to another student. I came in knowing no cell biology, and now I feel that I have a solid introduction, which is very gratifying. I would encourage other students to take advantage of the many resources the course has to offer.",
    "Biology 102 is an overall poorly-designed course, and Mooseker's lectures won't teach you much. You'll be on your own for understanding the material, mostly by reviewing the lecture slides yourself or reading the textbook. It also goes into too much detail about a select few topics in cell biology rather than giving a broader (but more useful!) introduction to all aspects of cell biology. But, if you're pre-med or considering any major that includes biology, you'll have to tough it out.",
    "This was an enjoyable class, if not a bit dry. Definitely an improvement on Bio 101, which was an absolute nightmare. Good professor, material isn't too hard to grasp if you're willing to put the time in. Problem sets are a nuisance and require a lot of synthesis. I liked the layout - very focused on understanding concepts instead of just having them thrown at you.",
    "As an introductory Biology course, I feel like this class is subpar. There is entirely too much emphasis on experimental techniques and details, and I really feel like I didn't learn anything in the class. Had I not been well-prepared from my high school biology courses, I have no idea how I would have survived. I would not recommend this class to anyone, unless required.",
    "I highly do not recommend this course to any other student unless they need to take it to fulfill their major requirements.",
    "Bio",
    "Make sure to understand big concepts And experimental procedures! Exams fair; hw psets a bit difficult",
    "102 is exactly what you'd expect. I found it extremely interesting, and if you like bio, you will too. The workload is manageable, though the p-sets tended to be lengthier than those from 101. Moose (the prof) personally discovered a bunch of the lecture topics, which I think is really cool.",
    "Bio 102 builds upon the foundations of 101 and encourages students to embrace the scientific problem solving process. Although high in content volume, I would highly recommend it to another student.",
    "I would say BIOL 102 really takes biology to the next level - it takes biology and its facts and applies them incredibly well. That being said, it is a tough class to follow at times because of how the material is presented.",
    "You will probably take this because you have to, but I wouldn't recommend it if you had a choice. The material is cool, and Moosker is really knowledgable but lectures were a bit disorganized and easy to get lost\/space out\/fall asleep in. Homework is basically impossible to score perfectly on if you try to do it on your ownwith the peer tutors it is pretty manageable. The material is hard to grasp in class, but once you learn it the midterm and final were very fair.",
    "If you're interested in cell biology, definitely take it. Gives a lot of great and complex information that you may not have encountered before.",
    "A big lecture course that will cover lots of material, but is manageable in the end of you take advantage of your resources.",
    "Mooseker is not a great lecturer; you will have to learn all the material from the lecture slides on your own for the most part. Did the readings before exams. Exams were fair with a good amount of choice.",
    "I'd recommend it. I expected BIOL 102 to be completely awful based on review from past years, but it's totally doable. Remember to pay attention in lecture and section and read the textbook\/post on piazza if you're confused about anything.",
    "BIOL 102 is a necessary class for most premeds or biology majors, so you can't really get out of it; however, it is a poorly-taught class and can be very confusing. The material is very interesting for people who like biology, and self-study is very rewarding, but it is necessary to teach oneself most of the material because Mooseker does not effectively teach any of the material in class. His lectures have sometimes upwards of one hundred slides and are almost impossible to follow. Good luck!",
    "The course is challenging and a lot of material, but you will come out of it very impressed with your extensive molecular biology knowledge. You learn a lot in a short period of time.",
    "If you are taking BIOL 102, it is likely to fulfill a prerequisite requirement for your major. If you're like me and taking it just because you liked biology in high school and maybe considering a major in biological sciences, I would say take the course, but beware, it is much more difficult than high school biology. This class is very consuming; the lectures are dense, the readings are long, and the material can be very hard to grasp. However, if you manage to survive, you'll leave the course having learned so much about concepts you may otherwise have never even imagined. I feel so much smarter after this course, and it is only introductory. Also, USE ENRICHMENT if you can; it is a life-saver!",
    "This was a good course. Be prepared to do a lot of self guided learning. It's a lot about experimental methods. You will learn a lot. I guess I would recommend it...?",
    "Learning few biology concepts, focused on experiments and papers.",
    "I would only take this class as a requirement for premed or a major. While I do feel that some of the material was interesting and engaging, I believe that other portions of the syllabus were unnecessary.",
    "Prospective BIOL 101-4 student. I'm not going to lie: this module is a real pain in the gluteus maximus. Some classes you'll sit the entire 75 minutes and leave the lecture feeling more confused than you have ever felt in your life. You sit and read through the textbook, unable to fully decipher the words before you. Who knew one could put words together in such cryptic combinations? Why do I have to print out so many freaking slides each class? How am I supposed to memorize all of this stuff for the final? Should I even be a premed\/bio\/chem\/mb&b\/biochem\/etc major? You can do this. You will understand. The slides help (and if printing is an issue, bring your laptop to class). And no, don't change your major just yet. Though BIOL102 is many times more difficult than its BIOL101 predecessor, it isn't as daunting once you are able to take a step back at the end and ponder over all the work you accomplished. The stuff you just learned is freaking beyond the scope of any other biology intro class at another college. If you have Prof. Mooseker, rumor has it the lecture slides he uses in class are the same ones he uses for his grad students. Just hang in there, wo\/man. Because even though this isn't by any means an easy class, this has definitely been, at least for me, a transformative experience. Instead of complaining over how much work you have now, let this be a learning experience where you actually start reviewing your stuff every week. Go to review sessions. Find PRODUCTIVE study groups. Go to the peer tutors. Ask questions. Log on to piazza once in a while. Use your whistle. Because this course is a reality check of what college classes in the sciences are actually like. Those that succeed are the ones who do these things and start to become better students. It's going to suck. You might pull a couple of really late nights (at least get some zzz's before the tests). But once you finish this sequence, you're going to realize you can handle anything. Good luck fellow Yalie. Godspeed.",
    "I would not recommend this professor to other people. I would recommend the course to other people if it were taught by someone else.",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend this course. It is a great introduction to cell biology and the material is very interesting. I liked the structure of this course--two exams and research paper journal clubs each discussion section.",
    "Only take this course if you have to for your major or for premed or something. It was very difficult.",
    "BIOL 102 is described as an evil you have to take for premed\/bio majors, and by definition as a difficult science class, it is somewhat that. But i found the teaching staff incredible, and the material fantastically engaging. So while difficult, i overall loved it",
    "It is a great biology course, but one that needs a lot of work.",
    "gotta take it if you gotta take it, its hard and sucks, but you learn",
    "Biology 102 was exponentially better than 101 because it didn't put me to sleep, but I still disliked it because it was so detail oriented that I found myself out of my depth when I tried to read the textbook accompanying the course and when I tried to research the lecture topics online (there is no information online on the lecture topics besides papers, joy).",
    "It is a great course if you know for sure that you're very interested in biology, but might be too complicated or in-depth otherwise.",
    "BIO 102 was a very demanding course that requires a lot of time and effort if you want to do well. The material is not always easy to understand the first time so I recommend simply rereading the lectures over and over to yourself. It helped me to talk through the lectures with another person. There are a lot of people that want you to succeed and who are willing and enthusiastic to help you if you need it. This class has taught me how to not just memorize facts, but to apply concepts to biological scenarios and think critically in a way I never have.",
    "The material learned in the class is very fascinating. Unfortunately, you don't have enough time to really appreciate the material because this course covers a whole lot of ground. I recommend this course because it teaches you basic methods for analyzing research.",
    "I love that it covers so much material, but I also think there is too much material for its own good. Because there is such a short period of time for such a vast amount of materials to teach, lectures often move way too quickly. However, overall, it was a very informative, interesting, and fun course.",
    "BIOL 102 was a difficult course, very specific, and very focused on the minutiae of cellular biology. Do not go into this course thinking that reading the book and going to lecture is enough. You will have to go above and beyond, stay focused on the course everyday, and take an active role in your learning in order to understand the course. I would recommend this course to determined students or students on the fence about pursuing premed or any sort of biology related major. It is a course that will make or break your interest in biology.",
    "BIOL 102 is a difficult class, because it requires more than what one generally think of of a introductory biology class. Nonetheless, I would recommend the class because it offers a solid foundation in cell biology.",
    "BIOL 102 is both an interesting and challenging course. We went in depth in cell biology, beginning with membranes, discussing endocytosis and exocytosis, and concluding with the cytoskeleton and cell division. I would recommend it to a student with a strong interest in Biology and who is not taking other difficult courses. While there is a lot of information, it can be rewarding to see how much you have learned.",
    "It was alright. I think 101 was better taught. 102 took a lot of time to go into unnecessary detail.",
    "I would recommend because it is a very fascinating class.",
    "I would not recommend this course unless you take it Credit-D because it was just information overload.",
    "I would wholeheartedly recommend this class to any student interested in Biology. While difficult and a bit intimidating simply by virtue of the amount of material we were expected to know, the challenges the class presented ultimately made me and other students much more competent in not only understanding general biology but also (and perhaps more importantly) in understanding the basis for experiments in biology.",
    "Exactly what I was expecting for an intro course. I would recommend it - a good introduction to the topics that goes far more in depth than high school (even AP) biology.",
    "I would definitely recommend BIOL 102 to a fellow student. Do not listen to what students in past semesters of this class have said: Prof. Mooseker is a great professor and a great teacher. You will learn a lot in this class and understand the brilliance behind cell biology. The focus on experiments adds a level of logic and methodology that is not necessarily a given in an introductory biology course. The discussion section papers really help to understand the material, and the discussion section leaders are very nice and helpful, whether TF or Prof. Lin. Take this class and learn a lot. Just remember to bring your little plastic whistle.",
    "BIOL 102 is a very interesting course with an excellent teaching staff, however there is so much material that it may be overwhelming. There is a lot of reading to do, and it is really really helpful to actually do it. Do not rely on lecture to teach you material - use it as a resource to see new examples and ask questions. Take time to do the problem sets - they are challenging and require a lot of time, including prior reading, consulting with TFs\/Peer tutors, etc. If you can stay abreast of all the work, it is a great course that will teach you valuable biological concepts and perhaps more importantly, experimental protocol techniques that can be applied to research.",
    "Good foundational course and teaching staff really cares. Be prepared to spend extra time re-categorizing information to digest as the content lacks clarity and organization.",
    "A class that takes a lot of studying but is interesting material that will make you feel hella knowledgeable."
