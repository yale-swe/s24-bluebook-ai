   "comments": [
    "This was an OK class. If you're looking for a relatively good Cr\/D\/Fail option, take it. And get Ruthie as your TA.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS. You learn a TON and I loved every moment of it. It's really not an obscene amount of work.",
    "Fabulous course, Great way to combine american history with art history",
    "I would recommend this course to another student!! It opens the eyes to a new side of American history, but also allows you to form your own creative opinions on photojournalism. A very fun course, more work than one might expect, however.",
    "Excellent lecture course. Very interesting material that's tangential to lots of fields, but beware of lots of memorization for exams.",
    "Great lecture! Also, Nicki (TF) puts a ton of work into preparing for section and giving feedback on student work.",
    "I would recommend the class to an Art History major because I believe a course in photography is necessary to a complete Art History education, other than that perhaps another art history lecture is preferable.",
    "American Photojournalism is a course on the evolution of photojournalism dating from the Civil War through the Vietnam War. It covers social movements, war coverage, and important moments in US history like the Depression and the assassination of JFK. It balances visual analysis and historical knowledge, making for an incredible interesting and exciting lecture. I would recommend this class. It is a reasonable work load with high reward, teaching you about all of the iconic images you've seen but never known anything about. You will walk away feeling like you know US history with a lot more depth and visual understanding.",
    "The course has a fair amount of work but it's manageable and the grading is very fair",
    "Take it!",
    "Yes! So interesting, and you learn to think about photos in an entirely different manner, even ones you've seen before.",
    "Amazing lecture, rough TA's.",
    "Interesting combination of history and photojournalism. Yes- I learned a lot about visual analysis.",
    "Its a good way to get an engaging overview of history without even realizing it, plus developing visual analysis, which you don't get in other classes. I would recommend it, especially if you are not an art history major.",
    "I really enjoyed American photojournalism. The class centers around images from through us history. It combines both visual analysis and historical artifacts. Raab is a great professor. Definitely recommend.",
    "HSAR 213 is a class that combines American history with images from important time periods. You study images, as well as how to conduct visual analysis. Unless you are an Art History major, I would suggest taking this class Credit\/D\/Fail.",
    "Going through American history by looking at photos. Emphasis on visual analysis. Good class if you're interested in this stuff. True to its course name.",
    "The course focuses on photographs from the Civil War through Vietnam and the present day. Professor Raab was a great lecturer and I looked forward to every class. The readings were very relevant to the material covered in lecture which I appreciated. I enjoyed learning about American history through the lens of photography and I would definitely recommend this class to another student.",
    "It is looking at famous photos analytically. If that is what you want, I recommend it.",
    "From what I have heard there are lots of interesting art history classes at Yale. I do not think Photojournalism was one of them, and would not recommend it to a friend.",
    "No",
    "This course was so interesting. It was my first HSAR course, but definitely easy enough for a non-major. It was a perfect combination of history, close analysis, and the intersection of art and writing.",
    "No, unless revised."
