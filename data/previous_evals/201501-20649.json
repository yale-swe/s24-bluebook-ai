    "Yes, I will recommend.",

    "Friday morning required course.",
    "Of course, because we learn researchers' duties in this class.",
    "It is helpful",
    "While the course is required, it offers a great look into ethics and makes you think about \"simple\" issues in a more complex way. Go in with an open mind and be ready to talk about some interesting things.",
    "It is right that we should all take it. Sure",
    "Yes.",
    "The course provides a nice overview of key things we must know as researchers, including what constitutes human subject research and the associated clearances we must get.",
    "Show up and listen",
    "This course covered the responsible conduct of research. It is required by NSF and other federal agencies so I would definitely recommend this course. It is mandatory."

    "We know the bottom line, bad examples and good practices.",
    "it helped me to understand the ethical complications of my discipline.",
    "This provided us with some background regarding how we should proceed with our research from a nuts-and-bolts perspective such as \"what constitutes sufficient work for authorship\"",
    "Gave me valuable insight into ethical code of conduct for writing scientific articles",
    "This course highlighted the ethical and moral implications of research. It emphasized how important character is to sound academic studies.",
    "The course informed me of laws specific to Yale and research which I was not aware of previously."
