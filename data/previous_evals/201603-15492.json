   "comments": [
    "I learned literally everything about liberalism and conservatism between the New Deal and the present (okay, well maybe not everything). BUT Professor Gage gave us an incredibly well-curated selection of readings each week that solidly introduced me to the material. I also really appreciated the two major writing assignments, as the first made me situate myself within the exact ideological histories that we were talking about and the second gave me freedom to really explore whatever interested me in liberalism or conservatism.",
    "I learned about the trajectory of political and party ideology over the course of the 20th century, and the origins and impacts of those shifts.",
    "My knowledge of political history and ability to engage with primary texts improved markedly.",
    "This course taught me a lot about the philosophies upon which America's political parties were founded. It also gave me insight into how specific policies, on crime, taxes, welfare, healthcare, etc. came to define the Republican and Democratic party.",
    "You will read an amazing breadth of primary sources that became seminal works for the intellectual development of liberalism and conservatism. The political autobiography will help you articulate and understand your own philosophical frameworks, how you developed them, and where they are lacking. You will realize how much your opinions are dictated by sentiment vs. facts. The focus on primary sources and conversations in class really dig deep into how people understand their moral, ethical, and legal support for conservative or liberal positions.",
    "I learned how to write a primary source-based research paper.",
    "This course taught me the importance of intellectual history and provided me with a new framework for understanding American history.",
    "This course provided an effective survey covering the establishment and evolution of American conservatism and liberalism in the 20th century from the standpoint of presidents, intellectuals, and movements. I found the opportunity to go into archival sources for research to be a fun and useful experience. The historical context provided by this course has been particularly relevant in understanding our current political climate."

   "comments": [
    "I literally have no idea how I would change this courseit was so perfect. Great readings, great timeline, great assignments.",
    "I enjoyed the syllabus and the combination of primary and secondary documents. Sometimes it felt that more connections could be made in class between the weeks.",
    "This was one of the best run seminars I've been in at Yale. The readings were fun, interesting, and so applicable to the election. I loved it.",
    "I cannot think of any weakness, other than that I wish our class discussions were a little more debate centered, as opposed to conversation based. Sometimes I felt class discussion was too much of everyone agreeing with each other. However, this was one of the strongest courses I ever took. The readings were incredible, and Professor Gage and Justin did such an incredible job of guiding us through all of the texts.",
    "Take this class. Well-facilitate discussion, spectacular readings, and diverse opinions among peers. The only improvement would be more guidance about what to focus on in the readings.",
    "I really appreciated the assignments of the course. Rough drafts, outlines, etc. kept us on top of our papers. Reading responses allowed us to engage with the readings. The only weakness of the course I could think of is that in-class discussions sometimes remained surface level and could have gone more in-depth with the readings - particularly since the readings were quite thought provoking. Professor Gage's ability to synthesize class material was astonishing!",
    "Strengths: While I did not appreciate it at the time, I was later grateful for the early paper draft deadline, as it provided a crucial time buffer to locate additional sources and polish the paper. I particularly enjoyed the primary sources in this class, as well as some of the secondary sources that integrated many primary sources (most notably Nash). Weaknesses: While I found the political autobiography an interesting exercise to go through, I did not find it that intellectually stimulating (although perhaps it will be nice to reflect on later in life). It might have been useful to balance the course composition with a few more conservative-leaning voices, as it was predominantly liberal-leaning (as expected). There were a few secondary sources that I found somewhat weaker (specifically: Theoharis and Self). Suggestions: While I understand there is so much possible content that could be covered in this course, I would have appreciated if we could at least have a cursory summary of some of the presidents\/issues we skipped (most glaringly: WWII and Vietnam), especially as it pertained to liberal\/conservative coalitions."

    "HIST 136J is an incredible class -- a gem of Yale. If you are lucky enough to get in, take it. It is difficult--the political autobiography is harder than you'd think, there is a lot of reading, the course discussions are rigorous, and the final paper takes a lot of work--but I learned so much from this class. The course's overview of the development of liberalism and conservatism (and other strands of political thought and activism) from the New Deal onward provided much needed context to my understanding of American politics. The political autobiography provided an opportunity to zoom out of the daily toil of assignments and activities at Yale and think critically about who we are and who we are becoming. It was a pleasure learning from Professor Gage, who is not only brilliant, but a highly effective seminar moderator who manages to keep seminar on focus without stifling student creativity and discussion. It was also really wonderful taking this semester during the 2016 presidential election, and Professor Gage (and this seminar more broadly) helped me make sense of what happened and think about how to move forward.",
    "Favorite class I have taken in my 2+ years at Yale! Professor Gage is a genius, the material is so captivating, and the research paper gave me virtually complete freedom to explore my interests.",
    "YES! This is such an important class to take for anyone remotely interested in US history. Prof. Gage is truly spectacular and knows so much about this subject, and the readings are so interesting and you'll definitely want to do all of them. This class is difficult to get into unless you pre-register through the history department but I would definitely recommend it. There is a lot of readings but the two assignments are very manageable and even fun to do.",
    "Yes -- Professor Gage is a great seminar leader and asks really interesting questions. The reading list is interesting and it provided an interesting historical background for the political culture today.",
    "Yes. Take this course. Whether you're a history major or just interested in political history this is a great course to take. Professor Gage is incredible and choices a group of students with diverse background and viewpoints. She knows how to manage the class so that everyone gets a chance to talk, and no one person dominates. Professor Gage helps walk you through the paper, so that it doesn't sneak up on you at the end. There are a lot of readings, but they're great. She chooses recently published secondary texts. Take it.",
    "Absolutely. If you are interested in politics, this class will make your opinions much more informed, and even challenge some of your beliefs.",
    "ABSOLUTELY. This course was key in my own political awakening at Yale where I learned some great places to start to explore my own conservatism and think critically about its strengths and shortcomings.",
    "This seminar is truly fantastic. The materials we covered were highly engaging and incredibly relevant to the modern day - no joke, we read about the \"Forgotten American\" and \"law and order\" politics the day before the election. This is a phenomenal class for history majors and really anyone interested in exploring why the political climate exists as it does in the modern day, and Professor Gage really makes the whole experience as enlightening and rewarding as possible. The final paper is not nearly as daunting as it seems, and you'll get plenty of feedback after the first draft. All in all, I cannot recommend this course highly enough.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course. Professor Gage is very engaging and great at synthesizing and explaining decade after decade of US political history.",
    "I would absolutely recommend taking HIST136J. The readings are strong, and the research paper allows you to delve into a topic more deeply. But it is Professor Gage that makes the course so amazing. She keeps the discussion lively and her dedication to teaching is evident.",
    "Yes! I would strongly recommend anyone interested in understanding the evolution of political ideologies and movements in America take this course."
