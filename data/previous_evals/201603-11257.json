    "Course teaches you about the basics of Fourier analysis, along with its many applications. Not a bad course to take if you're a physics major or just generally need a slightly laid back math course.",
    "This class gave a very nice introduction to analysis through the various types of fourier analysis. I appreciated that it was an applications class, yet still attempted to handle the concepts in a semi-rigorous way. I learned a lot about the method of fourier analysis and how it can be used in many different kinds of problems."

   "comments": [
    "Course could probably cover more material.",
    "Overall I thought that the course was very good. It gave an introduction to fourier series, fourier transform, discrete fourier transform, and many related concepts like norms, L2 space, diagonalization of linear operators, etc. There were a few times, especially early in the semester, where the class felt a little bit disorganized and there wasn't super clear connection between topics, but this improved with time.",
    "Poorly organized and too confusing to follow, also too few students which made it hard to be in class as well - maybe change the topic of the course so that it attracts more students Strength: passion of the teacher"

   "comments": [
    "Not a bad course to take if you're a physics major or need a slightly more laid back math course.",
    "If you are interested in some applications of analysis or are looking to learn about Fourier analysis for applications, this is a great class to take. The workload it pretty light but you still come out having learned quite a bit. If you are taking physics and haven't taken, or are avoiding, real analysis, I would recommend this class because it gives you applications of analysis which are useful for physics.",
    "No at least not with Xiuyuan. Although I could see her effort to maximize our learning in this class, it was so poorly organized and poorly taught that I couldn't take advantage of the class and it caused me a lot of stress"
