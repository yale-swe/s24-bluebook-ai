    "I would recommend this course for a student more interested in chemical biology or biophysics, but not an organic student.",

    "I would. Its nice",
    "It was a good class for learning about some aspects of enzyme catalysis, although the final exam was slightly overwhelming."

    "This coursegave me a much better understanding of enzymology.",
    "Was really nice discussion.",
    "This course greatly contributed to my field of research, since I anticipate studying enzyme catalysis quite heavily."
