    "Definitely! The course is a gem. It seems to be theoretical at first hand, but in fact it is very dedicated to details but in a very different framework offered by typical historians. We cover almost all groundbreaking works in historical scholarship since 1950s. The scope of this course is fabulous.I am the only history major in this course and I find that every piece of reading brings something new to me. Unfortunately the readings are too much and way too dense to handle, especially for those who do not have a substantial background in global history since the 1500s, but Gagan is sure to improve this part and I believe the course in future years will be even better. Gagan is super-kind and always encourages you to learn and think if you want to. This course is a revolutionary course. It will teach you to look at the past in a more comprehensive and well-rounded framework. Most historians tended to focus on history of specific areas without looking at its connections of the rest of the world. However, the world is interconnected and only one looks at history in a broader picture could one understand the past more. Gagan Sood is such a special historian who is more than just a traditional historian. He is knowledgeable about economics, sociology as well as political science as well. The course makes the past sing!",
    "Take it - it will be difficult and confusing at times, but by the time class ended I felt I had learned something new and exciting, and you can't say that about every class here.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. Professor Sood is an engaging and thoughtful instructor who gave us a lot of room to think on our feet but also guided the discussion in a productive manner. The syllabus was filled with readings that were very interesting, though quite long at times. The course focused on understanding and critiquing different historians' methodologies and revealed the changes that arise over time in a school of thought or in a single author's work. A few of the readings were historians' responses to one another. These proved to be my favorite because they showed honest desire to understand another person's point of view and true intellectual passion. Although the syllabus had a clear and logical structure, I think the discussions were still quite spontaneous at times and filled with unexpected discoveries."
