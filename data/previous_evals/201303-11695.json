    "Highly recommended. Great class with a great professor. Dean B is truly the best! The topic of this class is very heavy -- students must be prepared to fully dive into the material to get the most out of this class. I appreciated the breadth of the course, but I felt like some of our more theoretical discussions were frustrating due to their lack of depth. Overall, take this class if you get in!",
    "This is a wonderful class. The topic is heavy at times, but Dean B is able to keep it light (and will offer you a hug and candy if you need it). The students also bring a lot of interesting perspectives as many of them have a personal connection to the topic. The workload is certainly manageable, but prepare yourself for more than a few unsettling readings.",
    "Firstly, Dean B is AWESOME and take this class for her if for no other reason.\"Genocide and Ethnic Conflict\" is an extremely interesting seminar. I found it to be extremely informative and it was great to get to learn more about instances of genocide worldwide. Often, courses address ethnic conflict as part of a larger syllabus on any number of issues (human rights, intervention, war, etc.) but few courses devote more than a few brief readings and a little class-time to genocide \u00e2\u0080\u0094 which is by far the most severe human rights violation in existence. We definitely got that in \"Genocide and Ethnic Conflict.\"However, the course is currently taught as an overview of major issues from the field of genocide studies and then a case-by-case study of various different instances of genocide. I think this method of organizing the class is inadequate because learning about specific examples of genocide does not lend itself particularly well to discussion, and it becomes difficult to devote two hours of class-time to discussing what actually happened somewhere. I found the classes devoted to issues in genocide studies to be much better, as there are currently many important debates in the field: whether prevention or intervention is more important, and if so, how best to prevent a nascent conflict from escalating, to name just one such debate. The class would be better if it consisted exclusively of issues in genocide studies, and if each case study were tied to a specific issue. For instance, rather than just learning about what happened in Rwanda, we could have learned about the tension between international justice institutions and domestic reconciliation mechanisms \u00e2\u0080\u0094 a tension that evolved extensively in Rwanda, when the ICTR failed to win public approval while small local courts (gacaca courts) truly took off.Regardless, I recommend this class and I think most students really enjoyed it.",
    "This course is amazing. For such an intense topic, it is really laid back. Dean B is an amazing professor, very approachable, and very excited about studying genocide. That being said, the subject matter is rather unpleasant, so be prepared to have some downer discussions and a lot of really heavy reading (subject matter, not difficulty). Highly recommended, even if you're not in global affairs or sociology.",
    "Awesome course! It's an extremely interesting and relevant topic, great group of students, and a wonderful professor-what more can you ask for? Dean B chooses a really great group of students, from different backgrounds, with different experiences regarding the topic of genocide. She really cares about this class, she's very passionate about the topic, and she's passionate about making sure her students get something out of the class that's beyond the classroom, which I really respect. We went on a class trip to DC together and that's when a lot of the students got closer and became more friends than classmates. We also got to borrow IPads for the semester. And Dean B brings chocolate to every class. Besides all these wonderful perks, I truly looked forward to going to class every week because of the conversations, the people, and the knowledge I took away from the class every week. Take the course if you can get in!",
    "BEST CLASS EVER. TAKE IT. DEAN B is the nicest and smartest professor at Yale.",
    "This is a fantastic class that covers a topic that's not available elsewhere at Yale. It's also a really chill atmosphere, and Dean B is wonderful at leading discussion. Take it if you can!",
    "Yes, I always looked forward to go to class each week.",
    "Definitely, if you can get in. The course is exciting, well-structured, educational, and an experience on its own",
    "What a great course. It's obviously a really intense topic, but the class is very hard to get into, so the people in the class are chosen because of their interest\/knowledge in the topic, making discussions very lively and interesting. As always, sometimes you can get caught in some circular conversations, usually when talking about how to deal with genocide prevention\/intervention, which is obviously a tricky topic, but in all the discussions were very engaging. I really enjoyed all of the readings we had, although sometimes the reading load was a bit heavy (which was mainly problematic because I actually wanted to read all of it and it was just taking too much time.) You really read some great stuff. The weekly responses were manageable and helpful in discussion and processing the readings. Just one final paper on top of the responses, definitely manageable and really interesting if you choose a good topic.Dean B is really great--she's very sweet, always apologizing for the intensity of the material. She's really approachable and flexible, very interested in student feedback. She also has a great way of facilitating discussion, really leaving it up to the students to do the talking, but commenting every once in a while to focus conversation or add a really great insight. She is clearly so knowledgeable about the subjects, and her personal experience in Bosnia is fascinating to hear in relation with the course.Obviously, this is a really intense class, so just be sure you're ready to dive in to such an upsetting topic, often with very graphic discussion. It's important stuff and can be really fascinating, so I would recommend giving it a shot."
