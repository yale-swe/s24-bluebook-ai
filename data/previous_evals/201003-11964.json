    "If you're looking at these evaluations, you have to take this class.It's interesting, just a little disorganized. Advice? go to class.",
    "Intro BME Class. If you are a BME major, you have to take it.",
    "This course covers some basic mathematical models used in biomedical engineering, but it presents them in a way that is accessible and not too math-heavy. It's a very interesting way to combine mathematical, biological, and engineering perspectives. The workload, in the form of weekly problem sets, is moderate. The TA's are a huge help to getting through p-sets and preparing for exams. Prof. Fahmy is interesting, very approachable, and has a lot of confidence in his students. The final project, in the form of a research proposal addressing an important biomedical question, is a good way to sum up the material learned in class and really get a feel for what BME is about. Since it's only a proposal (you don't actually carry out the lab work), you can be very creative with it (within realms of possibility) and come up with a promising, novel idea.",
    "You probably have to take the class if you're BME major. to be honest this class makes me reconsider being a MB&B or Biochem major. Not because it is hard, rather because it simply isn't serious enough. I'm slowly realizing that BME undergrad here is kind of a joke, if you have time I strongly urge you to consider chemical engineering if you are considering BME molecular track or electrical engineering if you are considering BME imaging track. If you're really serious about this major, definitely supplement the requirements HEAVILY with courses from those departments and more serious science classes from MB&B department.",
    "I would recommend this course to any Biomedical Engineering major because it encompasses major topics in the field.",
    "Great course. The material was very interesting.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to any student interested in BME. It is a gateway course for the major and it provides a great overview of the field of BME.",
    "To all BMEers: since you have to take this anyways, start with a positive mentality! This is actually quite a good class if you come to lectures, go to sections, and stay on top of your stuff. Once you get the general flow of the class, you're golden - especially if you get a grasp of what kinds of questions Prof. Fahmy likes to pose in problem sets and midterms. The project is actually a fun thing to do as long as you don't wait until the last minute.",
    "I wouldn't recommend it as a course to take for fun. If you're absolutely set on being a Biomedical Engineering major then I would recommend supplementing the core classes with some more serious engineering or basic sciences outside of the BME department. Professor Fahmy doesn't take this class very seriously and basically dumbs down all of engineering, so if you want to actually understand the concepts presented I would take some classes in other departments that are more serious.",
    "You have to take it if your BME",
    "I would summarize it as a course where you learn some of the basics in quantitative biology\/physiology such as diffusion, ligand-receptor interaction, physiological modeling, and modern techniques for cell counting and analysis. I would recommend it to anyone who is interested in the more quantitative aspects of biology.",
    "Well, if you're BME, you have to take this class. If you aren't, then I wouldn't recommend it unless you're really interested in the material (and are thoroughly prepared for the math)."
