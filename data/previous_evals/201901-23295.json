    "The technical aspects of renewable energy and other energy sources. What are the limits of efficiency for each form of energy. How do you calculate costs of energy.",
    "Gained a ton of knowledge and quantitative skills for understanding and analyzing renewable energy (and, surprisingly, quite a bit about non-renewable energy!).",
    "I really liked Renewable Energy and feel like it filled in a pretty good gap in my knowledge around the technical side of the energy system. Some of the problem sets were pretty hard, but that could just be my background. I feel like there was a lot of information to cover throughout the entire term.",
    "The fundamental principals of renewable energy and how it is generated.",
    "Gained an understanding of the geographic, economic, and physical implications of renewable energy sources. Enhanced my technical understanding of renewable energy.",
    "I audited this class and so treated it as a seminar course. I found that the explanations and lectures within the class were incredibly well done and wish that previous classes I took on the subject were as clear.",
    "Working knowledge of renewable energy",
    "Learned how all types of renewable energy technologies work",
    "Knowledge of the technology behind renewable energy systems and their trade-offs.",
    "Good fundamental understanding of the factors which make different renewable energy technologies effective and suitable alternative for carbon energy. Simple equations to calculate and estimate the effectiveness of renewable energy power in specific locations. A broad view of the market and emerging technologies.",
    "I learned the physics behind renewable energy generation",
    "Gives a good understanding of renewable energy sources and how they work."

    "Pretty well aligned.",
    "Good.",
    "Very wellthe course matched the level of detail I was expecting.",
    "I'd say that it was a lot but I did learn quite a bit. I struggled with some of the tests because of the amount of material covered. I enjoyed each lecture though and going over all of the topics.",
    "Very well. I learned an incredible amount and think it will really help me in the future.",
    "They aligned well. I learned what I was hoping to learn.",
    "The class was a little more granular than expected, delving into the physics behind some of the technologies, which felt a bit unnecessary. Overall, the knowledge gained about renewable energy technology exceeded my expectations.",
    "The class did not go as deeply into the technical aspects and calculations as I expected but the content and knowledge base was very much what I expected to learn during the semester.",
    "This was a great class for learning hard sciences and physical forces that govern sustainable energy",
    "Very well."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of the course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I liked the homework exercises. I thought they were practical in helping implement the technical things we learned in class. At times, I found the homework to be a little bit long. Maybe, split some of the assignments up and make them be weekly assignments instead of every two weeks.",
    "The course is very well organized, and allows both professors to cover their strongest material. The material is presented very clearly and expectations for problem sets and exams are likewise clearly communicated. A few things that could be improved: 1) Formulas: Every engineering equation displayed on a slide should also have a plain English description of each term (what is epsilon? what is rho?), as well as the units of that value. While I think our professors take it for granted, it makes it very difficult to interpret these during class in a way that enables us to continue to engage with the material. 2) The Renewable Energy industry is changing rapidly: Many examples in the slides were a bit outdated. Sometimes, this was only a few years, but in the world of RE, a few years can be a lifetime. That made these aspects of the class feel much less valuable than learning the fundamentals of how RE actually works, especially given that many of the students in the class have significant background in the policy, economics, etc. of RE, but not the science & engineering. Perhaps the professors can assign topics to students to research up-to-date trends such as the cost of utility scale PV solar or the largest CSP plant in the world? 3) [Relevant F&ES students only:] There is significant overlap between the material covered in this class and in Energy Systems Analysis at F&ES. While I understand this class is not primarily an F&ES class, I think both would benefit from a detailed comparison of the syllabi and dividing up in-depth coverage of each topic appropriately. For example, we spent more time on thermal & Carnot efficiency in RE than in ESA, and I think it should really be the other way around.",
    "The course was great as were the two instructors. Maybe a little bit more engagement before some of the exams on some of the key ideas? Often the formula sheets felt like every single thing we ever covered!",
    "I think the biggest strength of the course was the breadth of material covered. I do feel that more time could be spent on the actual formulas and calculations.",
    "Strengths: both professors were good lecturers. They seemed to be well-organized with their materials. They kept the information engaging. Weaknesses: some of the information on their lecture slides seemed out-of-date. The renewable energy sector has changed so quickly that even a graph from 5 years ago might completely misrepresent the industry today.",
    "This course spent a good amount of time talking about heat engines at the beginning of the class even though the class is supposed to focus on renewable energy systems. While I enjoyed this and felt that those explanations were incredibly helpful, I could see where other student might think that should be discussed in another class. I really enjoyed the field trips!",
    "Strengths: field trips, problem sets to engage with material, professors very knowledgeable and brought demonstrations Weaknesses: The class could have used more structured discussions about the role of certain technologies.",
    "Strengths: Knowledgeable professors who organize the material well. This makes a wide range of information accessible and digestible for students. Weaknesses: The course is fairly large so engagement with the professors or other students is limited. There are times when the financial \/ future viability discussion of a technology feels too cursory or anecdotal. It would be great to hear the professors' views on what a transition away from a carbon system would require and how realistic that is in a fundamental, organized, and data driven format.",
    "This course could be improved by access to more practice problems, especially practice exams. Too little guidance provided on what to study. Posting videos of the lectures online would also be very helpful.",
    "Good course structure."

    "Get a head start on the hw. They take quite a long time to do.",

    "you'll get out of this course what you put in",
    "Would suggest taking if you are interested in pursuing a career in clean energy. Requires extra effort if you do not have a technical background, but is manageable.",
    "A good class for background on renewable energy technologies with some math involved. Undergrad calendar can present issues with scheduling of exams.",
    "It's a good class which provides a strong background when thinking about renewable energy. It is not focused on finance but should be taken by anyone who believes they want to work in renewable energy so that they understand the fundamentals of the different alternatives.",
    "This is a quants heavy course, buy a nice calculator.",
    "High recommended for those interested in energy."
