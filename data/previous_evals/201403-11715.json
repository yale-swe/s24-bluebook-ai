    "This course is basically a first stab at an Ottoman history orals list. It presents a good introduction to the major debates in Ottoman history. Some of these are applicable outside of the field, but if you are not specifically interested in the Ottoman world or its immediate vicinity I probably would not recommend this course. On the other hand, for those students interested in the field, the course is an absolute must.",
    "If you are interested in Ottoman history, this course is a must. I would recommend it for anyone, however, as it is taught well and provides an interesting change of pace for those not specializing on the Ottomans.",
    "yes i would. essential for people doing middle east history.",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend this class to anyone interested in the the Ottoman Empire or more broadly, the study of empires in the early modern period."

   "comments": [
    "As a student of Ottoman history, but one without much tailored study of history of the empire as a specific object of study, this class was crucial for my academic work. It will be important not just in shaping my orals lists but in helping me decide what questions need to be asked, and in fitting my own work into the framework erected by previous scholars. This course was indispensable for me.",
    "It gave me a good background in a field that figures importantly in the history of my own region.",
