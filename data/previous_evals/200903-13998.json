   "question_text": "Looking back on this course, what is your overall assessment of the course:  What are its strengths and weaknesses, and in what ways might it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "A very good and fair course in terms of homework assignments and homework.",
    "Strengths: material was very relevant to my studiesWeaknesses: The SAS labs were not very instructional",
    "Strengths1. Workload is clear; though more challenging at times2. Professor easy to followWeaknesses1. Professor should pause a bit more between subjects; it's sometimes hard to keep up",
    "the professor is amazing, which makes the course so much easier than it would otherwise be. TAs were very helpful and supportive.",
    "As far as statistics goes, this course was great. However, the homeworks take forever and the sas questions are ridiculous if you aren't a computer whiz!",
    "Im not a big fan of the projector writing. its impossible to understand when u look back at it.",
    "Dr. Claus might benefit the students if she were to move less rapidly and use powerpoint.",
    "overall, the class was very helpful. It requires you to keep up with the material, especially if you have not taken previous stat courses.",
    "The SAS lab was very helpful and the TAs were great.",
    "excellent review of the basics of statistics. I feel very prepared for Biostatistics II.",
    "Great. A fine job of establishing a basis for future stats work.",
    "The course was really good, I think that Dr. Claus really made it interesting which is not easy for an early morning course with this topics material. The homework really was good review\/practice, and the exam questions really tested concepts and application, rather than having us recite equations, etc. I wish we had SAS labs more than once per week, as it's hard to become proficient with such infrequent use, but I gather that next semester is more SAS-intensive.",
    "Excellent course. I would never have taken a class like biostats if it weren't required. That said, this is an excellent course that everyone will benefit from.Strengths: Dr. Claus, the home-works are representative of what we need to learn for the midterm and the final, the basic concepts of biostats are easy to pick up - even if you haven't had a math or science class for 10 years!Weaknesses: My grasp of SAS that this point is pretty shaky. The SAS labs are taught by TAs, who, while very wise themselves, don't really instruct. More SAS focus would be helpful if that is one of the main goals of this course.",
    "I felt the class quite structured which made it easy to know when more time would be needed (i.e. when homework was due or studying for the midterm) and also it made it easy to connect all the concepts together for the course. I also felt like there were a lot of real world examples we worked with that helped to connect the concepts to other core classes and made the coursework relevant for any field one may interested in.",
    "I thought the course was good in that it slowly and logically stepped through the basics underpinning not just biostatistics but statistics in general. There was not much interaction with the instructor during actual class, more of just writing whatever you thought she said was important. But such is the nature of core classes.I did think, however, that the course moved rather slowly. We covered more in my undergraduate course (ANOVA, multivariate regression) in 10 weeks than we did in this course. I do feel that I have a much better grip on statistics after having taken this course, most likely due to my enhanced ability to acquire material in the 6 years between the two courses.",
    "Great intro statistics class. Extremely well organized and easy to follow. The assignments are all helpful and fair.",
    "This was by far my favorite course of the semester. I learned a lot, the pace was perfect, and I felt I had a great understanding of the material. I would recommend making labs 2 hrs long. I felt they were rushed and it would have been nice to take the time to learn SAS rather than just rush to try and finish the assignment when the TA was there. In general, SAS lab was slightly lacking, I felt like more time should have been taken to each us how to use the software.",
    "It was a great overview of the basics of statistics.",
    "This is a fabulous course. Dr. Claus works through problems on the overhead projector in class and all notes are taken interactively (no powerpoint!). It was the best course that I took this semester and I feel that I now have a strong biostatistics foundation to build upon.",
    "Its fine. It is taught very well and with realistic expectations. SAS lab was essentially always frustrating and I don't feel like I learned very much.",
    "I really enjoyed Stats, it was my favorite actually, and I cannot think of any weaknesses.",
    "The labs are fantastic: the exercises really help us understand SAS and how to apply statistics to real-life problems, and at least my TA (Trang) was phenomenal. She was incredibly patient, instructive, and taught very well. Lecture was not as helpful as I had hoped. I've taken statistics at Yale College (Psyc 200a with Teresa Treat) and it was worlds better than this class. Professor Claus just doesn't explain concepts in a way that makes sense to people with no stats background. I was lucky that I was already familiar with the material. Also, the grading rubric for labs was not clear at all -- almost the entire class got 20% docked for the first lab because the instructions were not clear.",
    "It can be taught better and have a better time for meeting.",
    "Excellent. I mean its biostats, we need to know this, and the course does a good job of teaching it",
    "A major strength of the course was the gradual shift of the lectures' emphasis; by increasing the stress on SAS and the way in to interpret the outputs was pragmatic, particularly in light of the summer research internship. Another strength of the course was the bulk homework packages, rather than homework being due every week. This allowed for optimal absorption of the material before having to work through problems. A major weakness was the miscommunication between students and professor and TAs and professor; this led to some confusion for homework and lab assignments.",
    "I like the open-book format of the exam.",
    "I think that the inital few homeworks were a bit too long. Otherwise, a good class.",
    "This course was very well organized and very straight forward. Professor Claus was an excellent teacher!",
    "Material was not very well organized or presented.The formulas and information often contradicted by the professor and her notes.My other intro stats class was much clearer and more informative than this lecture.",
    "Clear instructed",
    "I think the first 1\/2 is too rudimentary. It is a graduate-school level class, but the material for the first part of it was from high-school level math. It's too basic in the beginning.",
    "This course is a good introductory course and also provides useful connections to epidemiology. The course also provides a helpful foundation for SAS.",
    "I thought the course was well directed and informative. I like how it was straight forward and i learned a lot.",
    "I understand the basics of statistics well and feel like I can apply them. The course met its stated objectives.",
    "The strengths:1.) The professor is very welcoming during office hours.2.) The professor wants you to pass - she is forthright on the first day with what she expects... if you do that, you will do well.3.) The TAs offer ample office hours.4.) SAS is intimidating, but the labs are more than fair in the amount of work associated with them.The weaknesses:1.) The notes are pretty messy and little disorganized. If you miss class, it is not easy to go back to the posted notes and figure out what you missed.",
    "I thought Dr. Clause did a great job making a very dry subject into something that was interesting even at 8:30 in the morning. The homeworks weren't terrible, but I thought that it might be nicer if they were split up a little more so we didn't have so much due at the same time. The exams for the class were fair.",
    "The course is really important and every single bit in it is critical to our degree.I dont think there are any weaknesses",
    "Was a good intro to BiostatsLabs were GREAT for helping with SAS\/other parts of course that weren't clearI think the format of the course can probably be improved- I think at the end of the course, many students are still stratching their heads as to the course meaning, to be honest.",
    "Good sequence of concepts (made more sense the way we did it then the way the book was organized), helpful and available TAs. As someone with quite a bit of calculus and linear algebra but no stats background, I would have liked a little bit more depth mathematically, but it probably wouldn't be practical since this is an intro stats course required for the MPH.",
    "The class was very good. The homework was lengthy but did a great job of preparing me for the midterm and final.",
    "The main weakness of this course is a lack of a 'lab' or 'discussion' section such as the ones required for Epidemiology or Contemporary Issues in Environmental Health. The TA sessions as is are helpful, but are focused only on answering the specific questions not general concepts. Having a voluntary review session each week would have ensued that anyone who was concerned about their retention of that week's material was sufficiently up to date.",
    "Lecture was not helpful - more efficient to read the book and take notes rather than go to lecture.Lecture notes were difficult to read and unhelpfulThe SAS textbook is not useful, a manual written by the TA's that serves as an index of SAS procedures would be very useful.830am class is just wrong on so many levels.",
    "8:30AM is too early given the context of my workload. I am sure this applies to many others beside myself. We not only have to fulfill our course requirements, but also certain financial obligations necessary for our living expenses and the completion of our education. While the workload for this particular course is very manageable, attempting to decipher the professor's archaic handwritten script has proven an exercise in itself. This is especially true for those whose first language is not English. The lesson here is that if the course is early in the morning, well-prepared PowerPoint slides should be the standard. I would even suggest recording the lectures in video format, but I suppose that is too much to ask.",
    "The professor did a really good job setting the foundation for biostats in the future. I though it was good that she posted overhead notes, though perhaps she could use paper and double side it rather than use all that plastic? Overall though the course was enjoyable and I liked the lab component.",
    "Strengths: well-taught, fair examsWeaknesses: 8:30 meeting time, material covered in homework (problem sets) did not always correlate with material from class",
    "A 10\/10:30 time slot might be better for this type of course.",
    "It was a great course overall. I felt that the tests were fair and the homework questions were representative of the material we were tested on.",
    "She does a very good job explaining what is important and relevant to our future in public health. This is an excellent class. The knowledge gained from the class will be very useful in the future.",
    "The class was great, but could get pretty boring. Also, there is a huge gap in between class and lab; much disconnect between SAS lectures relevance to Biostatistics lecture.",
    "Enjoyed the course",
    "This was a solid introductory class in biostatistics. The one area that I would improve is the teaching of SAS programming (not the interpretation of SAS outputs which is fine). The weekly lab handouts need to be fleshed out. I would recommend putting them togehter in a more detailed lab manual available at the start of the course that specifically addresses each lab.",
    "Weaknesses: 8:30am start time - hard to get \"involved\" in stats that early, people are tired (including myself!) and watching an overhead isn't that interesting\/doesn't get people involved. There is also no really clear outline for the course or why we move from one topic to another. Information learned does not always feel applicable. It's also hard to figure out how some concepts are related to each other. Dr. Claus also talks about unnecessary information sometimes and it's hard to distinguish when that's happening and then what is important to really know and what is not.Strengths: Dr. Claus is nice. She makes an effort to understand that many people in the room aren't intrinsically \"math\" people. She uses good examples.",
    "Overall, the course is very good. The homework assignments, in particular, are helpful. However, the lab assignments, which are graded, are poorly written and ambiguous.",
    "This class is relatively straightforward, logical, and sequential, as a stats class should be.",
    "good",
    "Strengths:- Clear lectures, with lecture notes and handouts posted promptly to Classesv2- Good coherence between lecture topics and textbook chapters so that I could reinforce lecture material with examples from the textbook- A good selection of homework problems to ensure that we did at least one problem by hand of each type of statistical test we learned- Weekly labs, which provided a structure\/discipline for doing the lab assignments with support from the TA's- Integration of SAS examples into lectureWeaknesses:TA's were not always coordinated in terms of their advice to students on how to complete the homework\/lab assignments. Before responding to student questions, TA's should coordinate amongst themselves and with Dr. Claus to ensure that consistent information is given to students in all lab sections. Sending clarifications via Classesv2 would also be a good way to ensure that all students receive the same information (or \"hints\") about the homework\/labs.",
    "Class time was used very well with a mix of excellent SAS and book examples. The homework assignments were very comprehensive--a good review for the exams.",
    "THE GOOD-Professor used humor in lecture-Teaching assistants cared about students-Adequate time to perform homework and practice examsTHE BAD-The main textbook was cumbersome and did not illustratethe material effectively. \"Biostatistics\" by Pagano&Guavara (SIC)THE UGLY-In lecture, the professor would work extremely quickly throughthe problems and there was no reinforcement of the key concepts. For example, if a professor is teaching about Pythagorean theorem, at least two problems should be shown involving Pythagorean theorem. On more than one occassion, I would perform the reading and come into class, and the lecture would make me more confused and less confident.-Some of the students in class have degrees in physics, mathematics, and statistics. They ask questions like \"Couldn't you also perform the problem by...\" Tell them to take a fucking hike, or \"Please see me after class to discuss the alternative method.\" They are trying to show off their intelligence, and a substantial number of people in class become confused by this alternative method. We are trying to determine the primary method for solving the problem.-The professor was so involved in rapidly performing the problems in class that students would raise their hands and she would never see them!",
    "The lectures were focused on the theoretical aspects of biostatistics, but the homeworks and labs were focused on applications of the material. It would have been very helpful and insightful if there had been more lectures on applying the theory and approaching problem solving (e.g. which statistical tests to use on a given problem). It was assumed we could figure this out on our own, and as someone who had no previous statistics coursework, this was very confusing. I think this course missed the mark; it was too basic for people with previous statistics coursework, and extremely confusing and unhelpful for people with no statistical experience (like myself). I ended up having to loan a different text out of the library to make sense of biostatistics, because the course text did a completely insufficient and horrible job of explaining the basic concepts we needed to learn!",
    "The organization was good overall, but the pace could be improved. We seemed to spend a long time on relatively simple concepts (such as the definition of a rejection region) and not enough time on more complicated subjects (such as R^2, chi-square, etc.).",
    "more examples might be helpful for master the course materials"

    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0The professor had a positive and friendly attitude.The instructor taught the course with the assumption that students knew the material BEFORE taking the course. Since this course was an introduction to bio-statistics, I think that this mentality should be reevaluated. I spent a significant amount of time on understanding the material outside of the class because I wasn't able to get instruction inside the class. When I asked for additional resources, the professor suggested a book that cost $150.- The instructor's notes were illegible.",

    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0I think Dr. Claus is an excellent instructor. I have heard from other MPH students at other schools that they had a miserable time in biostats, and I actually really liked this course. I like her teaching style and her sense of humor. I would have liked for her to talk a bit more about her research in the class (some professors apparently do that more than others) and at times, her handwriting could use improvement but overall I would rate her as one of the top professors I have had in my educational experience. She was also really receptive to questions in class and explained things well.",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0What can I say? Dr. Claus is fantastic. She is a dynamic professor that treats a required subject that basically no one wants to take with such finesse that it ends up being a favorite class of almost everyone. She's a brilliant professor and we're all lucky to have her for a class like biostats 505a. take any class she teaches.I don't have any complaints.",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0Dr. Claus is an amazing instructor. She explains things very well and clearly answers questions during class. She also shows a great passion for biostatistics and that makes class much more enjoyable.",

    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0Dr. Claus is a fantastic professor. She is organized, clear, thorough, and even witty in her lectures. No one is sure why a famous pediatric neurosurgeon is teaching intro biostats to first year MPH students, but we try not to question it and hope she continues to do so!",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0Claus was excellent. She was very thorough with the material and made sure to take time to answer all questions. We worked with real-life examples and made the material very applied. I would have been nice if her writing was a little more legible- reading notes online was slightly difficult and I would have been lost if I didn't write down what she said rather than try to just read the notes.",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0The instructor had outstanding time management and always asked if students had questions from the lecture. The only downside was the instructor's handwriting on the lecture overheads that sometimes proved difficult to read.",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0Did an incredible job of making complex concepts easier to understand.",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0Dr. Claus is an amazing instructor. She is a very organized, responsive to student questions\/needs, and straight forward. Especially in statistics courses, these qualities can be hard to find. I would highly recommend her as a professor to future students and as a great resource for biostatistics MPH and PhD students.The only weakness that I identified is that sometimes it was hard for students to attend the 1 office hour per week. Personally, this was not an issue for me but I heard many other students who had conflicting courses venting their frustrations with Dr. Claus' availability.",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0Taught very well and with realistic expectations. Sometimes in class our instructor would try to see if we're paying attention by doing a problem wrong and waiting on us to correct her, which was often more annoying than helpful. Otherwise she was very good at explaining concepts clearly and tests were very fair and manageable.",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0Dr. Claus was a great teacher. Maybe needs a little better handwriting though!",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0Professor Claus's style of lecturing is unbelievably condescending. She speaks slowly, as if we're incompetent little children, rather than capable, intelligent adults. I suspect that this is just the way she speaks naturally, buteven though I keep that in mind, I always leave class feeling like she doesn't trust any of us to actually learn.Also, she spends way too much time explaining very simple concepts, and skims over critical pieces of information too quickly.",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0She knows her subject but it could be taught better.",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0She was great. In biostats, open note\/book tests are more realistic due to the number of formulas, so I appreciate that she recognizes that.",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0Major strengths of Dr. Claus include her patience, humor, vocabulary, and intelligence. Occasionally, however, certain topics are not effectively relayed to students because the instruction itself may be rushed.",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0Prof Claus is nice and very friendly andyou can always go to her if you have problems. She's also got a wry sense of humor that makes 8.30 classes somewhat more bearable and interesting. It may be better if she gave the class some type written notes (of just the main points) just to complement her lectures because it's sometimes hard to follow the writing on the OHP.",

    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0I thought the instructor was very knowledgeable and explained things well.",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0Dr Claus has a good teaching style. I like that she uses the projector rather than powerpoint as we can keep up with her (and she explains while writing). I wish she used different examples than those from the book during the later sections of the course (paired t tests and correlation) so that I could have seen other applications and examples.",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0Elizabeth Claus is forthright, welcoming and pleasant.She tells you exactly what is to be expected during the course, open to any questions both during class and during office hours, and she tries to lighten things up during class. Biostat is not the most fun class, but she tried to make it better with jokes.",

    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0Dr Claus could have made the course more interesting. She is such a lovely lady and she was so accessible but she is not the best teacher. I spent most of the time learning from the book and if it was not for the SAS part of the course, I would have not gone to the classes.",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0She is a fantastic teacher. I was always able to stay awake during the 8:30 AM lectures.",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0Strengths:Instructor is excellent and definitely knows what she is doing",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0Dr. Claus is an incredibly competent professor. She was great to learn from and made the class 100% more enjoyable.",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0One of the main strengths of this course was Dr. Claus' patience in working through each problem by hand during class. This method (vs. power for example) was extremely helpful in understanding key methods.",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0Very good instructor",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0The professor seems very friendly, but her responsiveness (or lack thereof) to emailed queries leaves much to be desired. Also, her secretary (or whoever) does a fairlypoor job uploading her lecture notes onto the web. Notes from three sessions were not uploaded by the beginning of reading week. Two of these were uploaded upon requests by me via email; the third request went without being addressed. Oh, did I mention that it was difficult to read her handwriting? That probably explains why no one bothered to email her about the missing notes until the end of the semester.",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0As answered in the previous question I thought she did a really good job.",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0She was great, I really enjoyed her as a professor",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0She is very nice and fair. Very responsive to issues that arise with computers even though she is hard on the deadline.",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0Instructor was helpful and readily available.Use of overhead was a bit messy\/confusing. Straightforward, clear slides might be helpful.",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0The instructor is fair and presents the material clearly in class. Writing her own notes in class and posting them after was very helpful.",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0Professor Claus is an excellent teacher. She is patient and understanding of the level of comprehension of the class. She is also very practical and great mentor.",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0Claus is great. Very sweet and incredibly knowledgeable.",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0Excellent instructor, extremely knowledgable, addressed questions clearly, her sequence of lectures and notes were very logical. Actively taught the class.",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0Strengths- specified what needed to be learnt for each class period- the labs for each week were well correlated with the topic being covered in class",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0Dr. Claus is very good lecturer who is supportive of students.",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0Dr. Claus is nice. Copies of the overheads on the course website are helpful. It would be good to have a powerpoint sometimes with definitions or something though. Dr. Claus's handwriting is also often hard to read, which is frustrating. Also if you miss a class and have to use the overhead slides it was unclear what went on in class that day. The flowcharts that Dr. Claus went through before the midterm and final were great. Dr. Claus also uses good examples usually. Sometimes it's very frustrating when she gets into explaining something just to tell us that we don't need to know it. It might sound silly, but I only want to learn things I need to know in Statistics because the extra stuff is very confusing sometimes.",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0Dr. Claus is an excellent in the classroom. Outside of class, though, she is only available for 1 hour a week immediately following class. She makes no concessions for those of us who have class during this one hour period. Moreover, she does not respond to requests for help via email, and turns over much of her responsibility to the TAs in the course.",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0strengths: uses the microphone. Clear expectations for exams and homework.weaknesses: awful handwriting. It was frustrating that she mentioned on the first day of class, \"people always mention my bad handwriting on course evaluations,\" and then proceeded to give us a whole semester's notes in un-decipherable chickenscratch. So, you ADMIT you have a problem.... do something about it - type!In between: wry sense of humor is sometimes appreciated, sometimes not. Once did a whole problem wrong, and then told us it was wrong... I'm still not sure why.",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0good",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0Dr. Claus was an excellent instructor. She was very clear and patient in answering student questions. She wrote out each step of the examples she presented in class, which offered a template for how we should answer homework and exam questions. She was clear about her expectations for the exams and what would and would not be covered. She kept class on-schedule, ending lectures on time and covering all the syllabus materials. In particular, I appreciated her technique of asking questions to the class but being willing to answer her own question and move on with the lecture if no student immediately responded. This kept this large lecture class on track. I have no recommendations for improvement; for a class of this nature, Dr. Claus was an ideal instructor.",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0Dr. Claus was a great lecturer. Keep things engaging even at such an early time of day. I really appreciated her posting class notes after useful.",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0She is a good professor, but somehow the class missed the mark. I would have appreciated some \"practice problems\" instead of just homework assignments that I had to struggle through for hours on end to try to understand the material (and I don't think the homework problems did a sufficient job of solidifying my understanding of the material).",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0very nice and patient, well-instructed. handwriting a bit hard to recognize so suggest to use ppt.",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0She had the ability to make the material interesting."

   "comments": [
    "My TA for SAS was not very helpful and just went through powerpoint slides with very little explanation.",
    "The TA rushed through the instruction portion of the tutorial and responded to most questions with \"you will figure it out\"",
    "TA Leslie Park---complete waste of space; useless; rude; not helpful in section; her drop in section attendees was nearly 30 percent at times; she was perhaps the most disappointing TA that we've had this semesterTA Trang---Nothing but positive words for her. She is so awesome. I remember Trang having a paper due an afternoon when she had office hours before the midterm. She finished office hours, ran home, finished her paper, and then came back to 47 college to help those of us that really neededhelp. She is so caring, so genuine, and is just a damn good teacher. She was by far one of the best TAs we could have in this class.TA Javier Cepeda---this guy is great. he's so helpful, knows his stuff very well, and is just a nice guy. I think that a lot of people loved his style and approach to people. He complemented this with his mastery of the material.TA Elain Lee---Having relationships with students seems to be really inappropriate. Elain not only did this, but really had a poor mastery of the material. She was not a particularly good TA in terms of being helpful in section. The number of students she had attend reflected people's tendency to flock to Javier's and Trang's sections.",
    "Some TA's were great at explaining SAS. Other's were not. I appreciated the flexibility in choosing which computer lab to attend.",
    "Lesley was really helpful and presented the labs clearly.",
    "Leslie- Leslie was great! She was always willing to answer questions and help clear things up. She would make us logic our way to the answer. This was great because then we remembered how to do if for the next lab.",
    "My TA (Elaine Lee) was the bestest!",
    "Our TA was excellent- attentive to the inquiries of the students.",
    "Elaine was incredibly helpful throughout the labs and the rest of the course. I appreciate all of her help.",
    "You can learn a great deal from the TAs. They break down the information and provide additional support. They're especially helpful for SAS.",
    "Elaine S. LeeShe was very helpful with the SAS program and was available to answer questions.",
    "TA was very good in lab, pretty good in responding to email questions.",
    "Trang was an incredibly good TA. Very committed to helping her students understand SAS.",
    "Trang is incredible!!!",
    "Thu-Trang Thach.Great TA, she did the SAS labs at a good pace and was very helpful when answering questions by email. Also very sweet.",
    "Lesley Park:Lesley is great and helpful. Very smart at SAS and very willing to work through questions. The structure of the SAS labs left me in the dust pretty much every time (they are so fast!), but Lesley herself was great.",
    "Javier Cepeda was my TA for this class and he did a great job. He answered questions well during class. He did seem to rush through the instruction part of the labs and I know quite a few people got lost through that.",
    "TA's were good, nothing amazing. Most of our labs consisted of \"just type this\" instead of the intuition behind it or a background on basic computer programming. More focus on the \"log\" portion of the SAS program would have made troubleshooting infinitely easier.",
    "Elaine and Trang were great!",
    "Trang Thach was a fabulous TA. She made SAS accessible to those of us completely unfamiliar with the software and also went out of her way to be available to us to answer questions on homeworks, labs, or exams.",
    "Javi was a good TA. I think it would have been better for us to spend more time in SAS lab and really learn what was going on, and learn trouble-shooting and be able to do all the labs completely in class so that when it came time to do the homework, we really knew how to operate the program.",
    "My course TA was Thu-Trang Thach. I cannot say enough good things about her and her instruction. She was always organized for weekly lab sessions extremely familiar with the course material and she was always willing to make time to answer course-related questions even if it involved staying past the lab session. Excellent TA.",
    "Trang was amazing! She was very very accessible and always took time to answer and thorough explain any of my questions in and out of labs.",
    "The TAs knowledge, demeanor, teaching ability, and SAS skills varied.Of the TAs that I worked with personaly both Leslie and Trang had the highest mastery of the material (both SAS and textbook) and the best teaching skills. It was very common for other TAs to leave office hours, say \"Wait a second. I'll be right back. I'm going to go ask Trang the answer to that.\" Elaine tried very hard but often got confused, doubted herself and her knowledge, and refered students to other TAs rather than answering questions on her own. Javier, although a great person with a friendly personality, should not have been a TA as he only knew the very basics on SAS and couldn't explain\/teach the concepts. He was frustrating to work with because when you asked a question it was common to get an answer of \"oh, I never learned that\" or \"you don't need that for this course\" or \"I don't know. I don't have the answer key anymore.\"The one general difference I see between Masters level and PhD level TAs is their ability to explain the material in multiple ways. Often if you asked a hypothetical example or changed any of the #s in the homework problems, the BIS 505 TAs could not adapt and explain the overall concepts behind the calculations.",
    "Elaine was not very effective in setting up and introducing the learning goals for each SAS lab. It felt like it was on us to learn how to figure it out, or copy from the person next to us. When we had questions that were specific enough, Elaine was helpful in addressing those concerns.",
    "Trang was an awesome TA. Very helpful accessible.",
    "My TA, Trang Thach, was phenomenal! She's probably the best TA I've ever had in college or at the School of Public Health. Her explanations are clear and concise, she's incredibly patient and kind, and she makes us feel like we're competent and capable people. She gives prompt feedback and responds to emails rapidly. Hands down, best TA.",
    "TAs were helpful.",
    "Lesley was great at teaching SAS and went out of her way to help.",
    "Trang Thach struck the perfect balance between helpful\/knowledgeable and patient\/friendly.",
    "I realized that different TAs taught SAS lab differently. Some were giving their students the entire SAS code (mine didn't). So it's a little unfair. Perhaps the way that TAs conduct the labs should be standardized to minimize such discrepancies.",
    "Elaine LeeShe was very patient and understanding. I learned alot from her.",
    "The TAs were a bit variable- and had very different teaching styles. The TA that I had for the most part of the semester basically left us on our own to figure out SAS problems, however when we had a substitue TA, she basically went through the entire code with us (which was much less frustrating for me, and a lot more helpful , and I was able to understand it much easier with the additional help).",
    "My teaching assistant, Elaine, was excellent as well. She was very helpful and willing to answer questions whenever we saw her, regardless of whether or not she was in office hours.",
    "Trang was awesome.The one thing I would critique all of the TAs on is that when students come into office hours, they're usually just giving the answers directly, as opposed to \"teaching the man to fisH' analogy",
    "My lab TA was excellent -- she clearly explained the methods for programming SAS and was always willing to answer questions.",
    "The TA was not very helpful and did not seem well seem well informed.",
    "Lesley was our lab TA. I had a hard time keeping up with her explanations on occasion.",
    "My TA was great. Elaine was always helpful during labs and answered all questions sufficiently. We were all new to SAS and she never got frustrated with us.",
    "Javier. He was very knowledgeable of SAS, but I think sometimes he didn't do a very good job explaining it. Overall he was fine though.",
    "Trang was amazing in everything. She was so helpful and she answered every question thoroughly. She is sweet in person too",
    "TAs were great",
    "Trang Thach was my TA and she was marvelous.",
    "The TAs were incredibly helpful! Trang, especially, was extraordinarily patient and through in her explanations to even the most basic inquires.",
    "Elaine was cool. But sometimes she would respond to email without really reading my questions.",
    "Javier was very patient with us.",
    "Javier- he was excellent, very knowledgeable and helpful with the SAS labs and homework",
    "The TA sections were helpful, but my conversations from other students revealed great variability in the level of assistance the TAs gave their students with respect to homework problems. Perhaps in the future the TAs could agree on the material taught in section in a meeting at the beginning of term.",
    "The TA seem to vary quite a bit in their teaching styles and ability to help.",
    "I switched sections. Javier was nice, but wasn't helpful at all in lab. Elaine was much better.",
    "It is more difficult to assess the TA because the instruction and help provided by the TAs was so different. Certainly some of the TAs were simply outstanding and earnestly and effectively explained what seemed to be the illogical nature of SAS. Yet maybe it's my ineptitude for programming, but I left with very minimal and vague understanding of SAS and the steps necessary for generating an output.",
    "Lesley was an ok TA. She rushed through our slides a lot in lab. She also wasn't always clear. She is good answering questions one-on-one though.",
    "The TAs try very hard, but they are no substitute for the professor.",
    "I struggled in lab sessions, I feel, partly due to my TA. It was difficult to ask a question and get an answer without feeling like I was asking a very stupid question. It was frustrating. A little kindness would have helped.The scheduling in the lab was sort of a problem. People would come in for the lab following ours and hover around to claim computers and this was SO annoying; we were trying to use our last 5 minutes but people were always pushing us out. TA did nothing to help this situation.",
    "great",
    "Thu-Trang Thach was a very good TA. She gave clear presentations of the material in lab and spent a lot of time circulating to individual students to answer questions. She reinforced key concepts across multiple weeks (e.g. creating a Libname, importing data, proc printing to check accuracy of the data import, etc). She responded promptly to questions sent by email.Most importantly, Trang brought tremendous positive energy to the class. She was very encouraging when students were frustrated with SAS and always sent our class \"good luck\" emails the night before exams. These personal touches made the class much more pleasant.My only suggestion for improvement would be for Trang and other TAs to coordinate together (and with Dr. Claus) before giving advice to students about how to complete homework\/labs. This will ensure consistency across classes in terms of the degree of \"help\/hints\" that students receive from their TAs and also clarify what the grading standards are (reducing the amount of regrading required).",
    "SAS labs were sometimes confusing at times but TA overviews to the weeks labs were very helpful in navigating the new material.",
    "My teaching assistant was Thu-Trang Thatch and she was superb. She went above and beyond to help me, and was very patient.",
    "I did not find the TAs to be helpful (I had Javi for my SAS lab). His explanations did not really improve my understanding of SAS or biostats. It seemed like there was an assumption that people had previous familiarity with stats, so for students without any, the \"help\" was not very helpful.",
    "Elaine was a very helpful lab TA and made SAS less painful.",
    "very sweet and helpful."

    "Yes, as an essential course to public health, it was very well taught and gave me a great knowledge base.",
    "I would summarize the course as manditory, difficult to understand and frustrating. If you can learn the material independently, you will do fine.",
    "Well, it doesn't matter if I recommend it because it's required. :-)I would say this course is very manageable, especially if you've taken a statistics class in the past, and even moreso if you've used some kind of statistical software in the past. The homework can be hard, but it's easy to manage when you work in groups. The tests are very straightforward and are reflective of what goes on in class. Overall, a good course that requires some energy but shouldn't be over your head as a graduate student!",
    "Good course for Dr. Claus's teaching alone. If you didn't know biostats, you'll learn it quite well under Dr. Claus.",
    "Fair testing and grading. A lot of computer time.",
    "Its not nearly as bad as you're afraid it will be. I have friends who have taken and equivalent course at Harvard or JH and thought it was awful and painful because the instructor did not explain things well and they were lost all the time. Because Claus is so good, the class was hard work but pain free. You acquire a skill at agood steady pace, but you're never left in the dust or lost because she steps you through everything really clearly.",
    "well, you have to take this course...so i guess i would recommend it? The course, despite being so early in the morning, was an overall great class. I'd recommend you buya calculator and do the homework as you go. It's really challenging to do it the weekend or few days before it is due!",
    "You have to take it. Period!",
    "I would say that the student might gain just as much by studying the textbook and attending a few group meetings as he would in attending the course daily. The lectures were a bit redundant.",
    "I recommend it because basic stat knowledge is required for public health research.",
    "Would recommend because it's a good refresher of biostats basics if you haven't had a statistics class recently. Challenging but very fair.",
    "I would say get the basics down, focus on the lab.",
    "I would highly recommend it- Dr. Claus is a thorough instructor and you really get a good foundation for biostats- helpful especially if it's been a while since statistics. I am looking forward to next semester!",
    "It's required and you have to take it, but the good news is, you're in for a treat! It's perfectly taught and the entire course is fair. Great class!",
    "I would recommend this course to another student (though it's required, so you don't really have much choice). I took a statistics course a few years ago, so I could have technically waived this couse, but I'm glad I didn't because I understood the concepts so much better in this course because it was taught in a clear manner and connected well to field of public health.",
    "For someone who has not had a stats course in the very near past I would definitely recommend this course as it is a good review of intro stats and makes things we encounter in readings much clearer.",
    "A good, basic intro biostat course with introduction to SAS. Four problem sets, weekly SAS labs, a midterm, anda final exam.",
    "This course provided a great basis of biostats. It was enjoyable and challenging. The workload was consistent throughout the semester but could have been cumbersome if I did not take the time to work on assignments on a weekly or bimonthly schedule. I would absolutely recommend this course to another student.",
    "The course is required and of fundamental importance to all areas of public health.",
    "excellent.",
    "This was a great course. The TAs are hit or miss but the professor makes up for their lack of experience. I would recommend this to any student who does not have, but wants, Biostat experience.",
    "I would definitely recommend it as it gives a great foundation to statistics which is integral for an MPH.",
    "I've taken statistics before, and thank god! This class was not particularly well-taught, and I saw many of my classmates struggling to understand her lectures. Because I recently took a phenomenal stats class in Yale College, I knew what she was trying to get at, and I understood the big picture. But I would have had a much harder time, had I not just taken stats.",
    "It was alright.",
    "It required but its pleasant",
    "Pragmatic course that sufficiently introduces the basic of biostats and SAS programing. If you have a background in statistics, minimal outside work is required to do well.",
    "Well, this is compulsory unless you receive a waiver. Fortunately, I think this course serves as a good refresher biostats course and the exams are relatively straightforward. So 4\/5 stars for me :)",
    "Lots of work",
    "Great class- Just go to class and take notes.",
    "I would recommend it to another student (although they have no choice). Professor Claus is an excellent professor and I learned a great deal about Statistics as well.",
    "This is a useful introduction to biostats,very important",
    "Good intro to Biostats course.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course -- it was one of my favorite courses this semester because of the interesting nature of the material and the usefulness of the skills for my future career.",
    "I found the course valuable would hightly suggest taking the course!",
    "Well, it's mandatory so it has to be taken. It is a good introductory course and I feel I learned the material well.",
    "Since it is a CORE it is hard to say whether I would recommend it. If you are from outside PH, I would recommend it if you are specifically interested in learning an introduction to biostatistics and SAS. Once in the course, start your homeworks early! I would recommend starting the week before they are due to get a head start (some material may not be covered yet, but do all you can the week before). Also, work on your lab write-ups weekly. Don't leave them until when the homework is due because you will be able to answer the questions better when the labs are fresh in your head. Feel free to ask questions during class and don't skip! It might be early, but her in-class examples are very helpful for the homeworks and tests. Although the exams are open-book, still study and prepare your notes beforehand.",
    "This class was a good introduction to statistics, especially for someone like me who had no background in the subject. The 4 homeworkassignments were time consuming, but not particularly difficult. The exams were fair and tested knowledge of both SAS and mathematical equations. I think one area the course could be improved would be by getting a textbook that explained concepts better, rather than just providing extended and difficult-to-interpret examples. Overall I would recommend this class, but that recommendation doesn't really mean much because it is a requirement that we take it.",
    "It is really imortant course and I would totally recommend it",
    "Great course even if you've had statistics before. Lays a good foundation in both using formulas and SAS",
    "Good intro to Biostats",
    "Overall this is an excellent course. Yes I would recommend it.",
    "Well, we do have to take this class. But I would definitely recommend it, it fits nicely with Epi, and as long as Dr. Claus teaches it I'm sure it will remain a great course.",
    "It's required. Just do it.",
    "Yes I would recommend it",
    "I would summarize the course as something totally unnecessary. I thought the lectures were more distractions than a tool to aid in learning. All the materials are presented fairly well in the text and other sources. As such, no, I would not recommend the course to anyone else (unless they were paid to attend).",
    "Even if this wasn't a requirement I would still take it.",
    "It is a required course, but I still enjoyed it very much.",
    "This course was great overall. I would recommend it to other students as an intro to statistics and SAS.",
    "All students have to take the class, but I would say it is useful information that will definitely be of use in the future.",
    "Course was very good overall.",
    "COnsidering it is a required course, I think it provided an excellent statistics foundation. The information was effectively delievered in light of the class's diverse set of skills and knowledge of the subject.",
    "Yes I would recommend this course to another student- This course covers the basic introductory topics in biostatistics. Coupled with the SAS labs, there is practical application of what is being taught in class.",
    "A strong introductory biostatistics course, but the SAS programming portion needs to be improved.",
    "Weaknesses: 8:30am start time - hard to get \"involved\" in stats that early, people are tired (including myself!) and watching an overhead isn't that interesting\/doesn't get people involved. There is also no really clear outline for the course or why we move from one topic to another. Information learned does not always feel applicable. It's also hard to figure out how some concepts are related to each other. Dr. Claus also talks about unnecessary information sometimes and it's hard to distinguish when that's happening and then what is important to really know and what is not.Strengths: Dr. Claus is nice. She makes an effort to understand that many people in the room aren't intrinsically \"math\" people. She uses good examples.In terms of recommending this course to others... everyone has to take it so it doesn't really matter I guess!",
    "The course is very good.",
    "Well, you have to take it, so you better! I would recommend it because it is straightforward and doesn't require too much work. Open-note exams are always a bonus.",
    "I would recommend it to other students.",
    "This course is an introduction to statistical methods and software used in health sciences research. It provides a good foundation in probability theory, sampling methods, and hypothesis testing. It is a straightforward course where each statistical method is presented in lecture and then practiced in homework and labs.I would recommend this class to any student who had not previously taken an intermediate or advanced statistics class as an undergraduate, or who had not previously worked with SAS.",
    "I would recommend this course as a great introductory course to biostatistics and SAS programing.",
    "I did not like this course. It was too easy for people with previous stats, and completely confusing for people without any stats experience. The only way I learned the material was by teaching myself with a different textbook that I loaned out from the library!",
    "it's a great introductory stats course."
