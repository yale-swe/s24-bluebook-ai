   "comments": [
    "Highly recommended. This course is going to help you learn how Biochemistry got to where it is and will teach you how to think about problems in a way that is reasoned and elegant.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class, even though it's a requirement and only open to our track. I will speak highly of it to the incoming students.",
    "If you are in Mark's section: have a great time. If you are in Lynne's section: beware.",
    "Methods & Logic is the meat of the coursework requirements for the fall semester. It integrates biological, chemical, and physical knowledge with developing scientific intuition and a critical thought process. I definitely recommend the class. And I recommend that students take it seriously: it is the most important class of your first semester.",
    "You are expected to memorize three paper's methods and scrutinize the author's conclusions. I would recommend this class to a student who is interested in the fields covered by these papers.",
    "I would highly recommend this course! There is a fair workload but it's all so invaluable and completely worth your time. I only wish I had spent more time going over each of the papers so I could have contributed more frequently in class.",
    "A lot of work and a real pain but the best course you'll ever take. I think it is an absolutely critical course to take as a graduate student because it teaches you to not regard everything you read as fact. I would definitely recommend it to other students for this reason.",
    "This is a great course surveying methods and seminal research in molecular biology. The discussion format of the class is highly conducive to learning and understanding material, and really helps to develop the critical thinking required when reading and evaluating primary research.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student. I learned a lot on methods\/techniques that are involved in biochemistry\/molecular biology and the critical thinking that is required for the understanding and assessment of each paper. I enjoyed each discussion of this class.",
    "It has been my favorite class so far. A+++ Would buy again.",
    "I highly recommend this class to any student. You will learn to read properly scientific papers, and recognizing \"elegancy\" in methods and strategy. LOVED this course. I will honestly I would leave class one day feeling frustrated because I didn't feel smart. But, this only motivated me further to get it right the next time. This class will teach not to believe and trust everything say say in a publication. IT will also be fun to learn about the connections between the Yale faculty and the publications and the history of other famous researchers.",
    "Yes, it is a very helpful course for developing our research skills and scientific career. I would recommend to take it, it is really really helpful."

   "comments": [
    "I feel so much more prepared for labwork, attending seminars, and generally to be a biochemist after learning the techniques and critical thinking from this course.",
    "I learned much more about approaching scientific publications than I had expected. Very worthwhile course.",
    "This course improved my ability to read and critically evaluate research papers in the biological sciences. It will likely prove to be extremely useful in approaching my dissertation work.",
    "I learned how to analyze and read papers much better.",
    "I learned how to really read a scientific paper which is exceedingly valuable.",
    "This course provided me with a great foundation of methods in molecular biology, and further developed my critical reading of primary literature necessary for a scientist.",
    "I felt that this class definitely helps us to widen our understanding of various ways to solve specific problems. This course also helps us to critically evaluate each problem and take into account all possibilities that may occur with each method\/technique.",
    "It helped me understand and comprehend diverse scientific fields and there research interests. I enjoyed learning about different techniques I can apply in my future scientific research.",
    "This course helped me in reading the papers from different points of view, and I enjoy the process of discussion; I also learned that by speaking up more, you can be more involved and learn more."
