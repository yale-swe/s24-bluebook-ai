   "comments": [
    "HSHM 653 is a in depth perusal of the important issues in the sciences in Enlightenment Europe, including spectacles of science, the public sphere, body representations, women in science, technology, business, travel, and weather. Sufficiently broad, the course accommodates a wide variety of students whose research interests may vary. However the depth that the course offers gave me the tools to write a good research paper with confidence. I feel that the course has had a major impact on my scholarship and it will continue to affect me in positive ways. I recommend the course to anyone and everyone the slightest bit interested in history, culture and\/or science in any part of the world, in any century.",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend this course. It offers an excellent approach to 18th century history and has a lot to offer anyone interested in the Enlightenment or in the history of science in general. I learned a lot in this course and think that, overall, it was a very rich experience."

   "comments": [
    "Although outside of my department, the course deepened my knowledge of 18th century France and Europe, on which I will most likely write my dissertation. The course also allowed me to think in new ways about topics that will most certainly be germane to my dissertation.",
    "This course most certainly deepened my knowledge of the Enlightenment and pushed me to think about the 18th century in ways I never thought of it before. This course also made me quite excited about the Enlightenment."
