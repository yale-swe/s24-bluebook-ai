    "Good class although some of the other students can be pretentious about their existing knowledge of Latin America.",
    "Take this class!!!",
    "Take it take it take it!!! De La O is wonderful. She's both very relaxed when it comes to understanding college students (e.g. that we have busy weeks sometimes or that certain material is a stretch for us to understand) and intense and brilliant when discussing the material. At the same time, she's very warm and engaging, so you'll be excited to come to class every week. The content of the class is also great. De La O mixes in a variety of different approaches, ranging from statistical to sociological to historical approaches, and every week feels very different. You also do a variety of different types of work, all of which is kind of fun and not too overwhelming. And don't be turned off by the assigned group projectyou're assigned based on who you're sitting with, so sit next to a friend, and the project is low-key.",
    "Take it if you're prepared to do most\/all of the readings. Professor De La O is brilliant and an engaging discussion leader, but she will tell you if you're wrong and call on you if you're not participating.",
    "Politics in Latin America investigates the intersection of inequality and politics in the region. The course builds from a theoretical foundation and from country case studies. A large component of the class is discussion - make sure you do the readings and understand them prior to each class session. Professor De La O is fantastic and passionate about the topics, which makes the course very engaging. Assessments are very straightforward: class participation, two group presentations, one take home midterm and a final paper. Take this class if you are interested in the region!",
    "TAKE THIS COURSE! Professor De La O is one of the best professors I have had while at Yale and if the material interests you, you absolutely have to take this class. Latin America is a very unappreciated but unbelievably rich part of the world and with so many limited opportunities to study it in depth, the course really allows you to dig into the many key issues, dilemmas, and concepts that make the region what it is today. Placed within the context of looking at income inequality (something which as first I was skeptical about) was really useful because it gave the course a good ground from which to explore the various topics that we discussed.",
    "A lot of poli sci articles, forced discussion. Might have been more engaging if De La O wasn't so intimidating.",
    "At the beginning, I found Politics in Latin America intimidating. The course material was definitely not for a beginner in Latin American politics, Professor De La O was clearly brilliant, and the class discussion was fast-paced. As the class moved on though, I truly fell in love with it. True -- you will have to do the reading and be prepared to participate in class, but you will also come out with such a good understanding of many complex and interesting issues about a region of the world that many never think about. You're also assigned a \"task force\" on a certain country, which seems odd at first, but makes a great smaller group experience in a seminar and also will help you become an expert in one country in the region, which is really cool. I highly recommend this class, even if you don't think you're interested in Latin American politics, you will learn so much and you'll enjoy it."
