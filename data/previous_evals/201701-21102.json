    "I had never taken a sociology course before and I felt like I gained a plethora of knowledge about the sociological method for studies and also how to evaluate people from a sociological perspective.",
    "Learned the basics of the different visual research methods and issues.",
    "I gained a better overall understanding of visual sociology methods? I learned both how to decipher and analyze studies, and how to start building original research designs.",
    "This class seemed to cover everything. It was a bit of a survey. We briefly went over everything from photographs to maps to park design and urban planning. I learned a lot about how to read research papers and will look differently at advertisements, city parks and people standing in line. As an artist, this was a very useful class that taught me a lot about how to measure and evaluate the intention and effect of visual design.",
    "I learned how to write a social sciences paper, and how to run an effective research project. I learned what the field of visual sociology is, and how almost anything can be studied just by looking at it."

   "comments": [
    "Overall the course was structured very well. I think the only criticism I would have is that the midterm and final paper needed to be a little more clearly defined and prompted.",
    "Every class was pretty confusing because of the way it was structured - Everything was very interesting but sometimes the TA's and the professor would have a discussion without including the students in the class. I wish there were more structure to the class sessions.",
    "Strengths is that you get a taste of a lot of different things, weaknesses is that it can be repetitive\/ you may not feel like you are learning about anything in a lot of depth.",
    "The strengths of this course are the discussions and the variety of interesting readings. One potential weakness is that we do not always cover all the readings, but I think this just tends to happen when people get interested in a paper and want to talk about it. Another potential weakness is that the two projects that make up the majority of your grade are very independent. You choose the topic and design the study. However, Professor Smith and the TAs are very willing to help out when asked, and even let you revise your project if necessary.",
    "This course is strong in its breadth, covering so many different topics and methods. This allows you the freedom to conduct a study that interested me personally, which I appreciated. There were many problems, in my opinion, however. The readings were specific examples of methods, but we never got into the big ideas behind sociology, which I thought we would. The syllabus was deceptive in that way. There seemed to be too much emphasis on learning specific projects and details of what other researchers did, running through the nitty gritty of their papers, rather than trying to understand anything more from them. Also the discussion was so disorganized each day that it was almost ineffective - especially the three instructors at the front of the room interrupting the students almost any time they spoke. That was detrimental to students' abilities to contribute and share their voices."

   "comments": [
    "Absolutely! This course is a great introduction to sociology, it's very interesting (will get you thinking for sure) and the grading is fairly lenient.",
    "I would recommend if you are open minded and the content of the course appeals to you.",
    "Yes! Amazing course w\/ amazing prof; super interesting and unique topic area.",
    "Yes! Great class and not an insane amount of work, very interesting and fun.",
    "I wouldn't recommend this course unless you were really interested in studying things from a sociological perspective. To me, visual sociology only scratched the surface of so many other disciplines that provide deeper ways of thinking about the same issues. I'm not sure I actually learned anything in the class, other than through my personal research projects, which were very interesting and engaging. Those did happen to be some of the most interesting papers I've written, though I could have done so without the class."
