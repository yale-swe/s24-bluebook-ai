    "the best class at yale because you get to sing in an opera with great people and perform in a rather professional setting (with lavish set and costumes, baroque instrumentalists in a beautiful theater!)",
    "Take it! Why wouldn't you be in an opera for credit?",
    "Absolutely. A highlight of my Yale experience.",
    "Yes. But take it only if you have time and are willing to memorize the music early and spend long hours in rehearsal, on top small assignments for the class and being a full-time student. It is the kind of top-notch academic, musical, and theatrical experience you can only find at Yale.",
    "This class is great; it focuses on a single Baroque opera for the semester in which the main goal is to perform the opera at the end of the semester. You also get to do a somewhat in-depth analysis of theopera, which is an important step in the process of successfully performing it."
