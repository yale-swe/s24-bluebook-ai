    "Take this class if you even have the least interest in poetry (or if you want to cultivate one). Howard Stern is an amazing man. He will pontificate a lot about his life philosophy. It is, however, always related to the poetry. If you are annoyed by brilliant professors talking for long periods of time, don't take this. I would encourage anyone who does, though, to feel free to but in during the discussions--he's not arrogant, honestly, he just has a lot to say, but he'd love to hear you speak (provided you're not bullshitting).",
    "I can't tell you whether or not to take this course - it all depends on whether you like Professor Stern or not. Shop it and ask yourself whether you would enjoy listening to him for 75 minutes twice a week. Don't be fooled if he talks about making one meeting a \"discussion\" - he ends up taking for the large majority of the \"discussions,\" too. I loved him and therefore loved the course, but he's really not for everyone.",
    "It's a good course. You read good poems, discussions are interesting. Be aware, however, this is as much a lecture course as it is a seminar. Pipe up. Obvious opportunities to speak are more limited than in traditional seminars so feel free to raise an interruptive hand.",
    "The class works like this: Each week you will be assigned about twenty poems. On one day, Professor Stern will give a lecture on one of them, illustrating the technical characteristic that they have in common and that is the week's subject. The next day, the poems will be open for discussion; however, if the class is passive, it will turn into another lecture. The professor is usually illuminating to listen to, but he could do a better job of tracing the progression of the course. Fortunately the workload is quite light. There are only the poetry readings, then two 3-5 papers and a final 5-7 paper, which can be replaced by a poem in translation or an original poem.",
    "Take it.. this is the best class at Yale..",
    "prof. stern is very kind, interesting, digressive, and available. he is also the type of person who will destroy you on papers if he thinks your writing is needlessly complex. meaning complex.",
    "This class was a total joy. Learning how poems say what they say is a rare pleasure, and an essential skill for life. Professor Stern was one of the most wonderful teachers and human beings I've met at Yale.",
    "YES",
    "If you have any interest in reading or writing poetry, take this class.",
    "Very good course. I had not taken a lyric poetry class before at Yale, and I found this class to be a good and fast-paced introduction to it. Perhaps the highest praise I can give this class is that it made me *write* poetry much more frequently this semester. I am also glad to have had the chance to take a class from Professor Stern. He is clearly passionate about his subject and about teaching students. His paper comments were fair, thorough, and helpful, and he made himself freely available to students outside of class. My only reservation about the class concerns the pacing of some of our class discussions and lectures. Sometimes, we would spend a class-and-a-half on a poem that didn't inspire strong discussion among the students; at other times, we would rush through a poem about which we had more to say. On the whole, though, this class taught me a great deal, and was quite fun to take.",
    "For a poetry newbie like me, this course was helpful. But I can see how it might be frustratingly simple for someone who has experience studying or writing verse. Howard Stern is also frustrating at first -- long-winded, rambling, drowsy -- but in time you adjust to his teaching style. A worthwhile course, but you definitely need to shop it."
