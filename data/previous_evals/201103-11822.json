   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this class to a student who wished to improve their writing, but was also willing to do a lot of work in order to do it.",
    "I would absolutely recommend English 114 01 to another student. In this class, I learned how to write a college essay through the lens of childhood. It was extremely helpful, while also very interesting. Despite the heavy workload, the class was always enjoyable, and I felt that I learned a lot from it.",
    "English 114 is the best introductory writing class an undergraduate can take at Yale. I must caution that the workload is heavy, significantly heavier than many other classes. However this also means that students emerged from the class with their writing skill significantly improved. However, there are more than ten different classes with their own respective topics\/themes, and I would urge students to shop a few. Every class has its own themes, and its own professors, and some classes, in my opinion, are better than the others [although this still boils down to personal preference.]I took the one on childhood, self and society and it was AMAZING! if this class is ever taught in your semester, take it! it is a great, great class with a great professor. I have not regretted taking it because it is such a intellectually stimulating class. It is not just about reading papers and discussing issues, but also include presentation, creative analysis of fun\/playful toys\/rituals\/videos\/other primary source, and even include a trip to the Beinecke rare books library to look at old, beautiful children's playbook! The professor, professor heather klemann, is one of the best professors I have ever met. She is articulate, intelligent and extremely sharp. She conducts the class in such an engaging and decisive manner, and I left every class feeling impressed, inspired, awed and intellectually satisfied all the time.This is definitely a new but potential MUST-TAKE class at Yale. The workload is heavy but manageable. The readings are very interesting and discussion are extremely rewarding and thought-provoking. I have learnt alot from this class and felt extremely lucky and privileged to be in this class. Do not regret it, take it!",
    "This class is mostly about brain-storming over a topic and getting your own contestable argument. I know people who complain about their section being boring, so I guess the key is to look over the topics and find the one that would keep you interested through most of the semester.",
    "This was my favorite class this semester, and this is due to the fact that Professor Klemann was such an amazing professor. Her passion about the subject of childhood comes across clearly from day 1, and her commitment to improving her students' writing is inspiring. The material was composed of short pieces of writing (often controversial and interesting) and we wrote 4 essays, the longest being 10 pages. I HIGHLY recommend this class to another student!",
    "English 114 generally is brilliant. It is a lot of work but it's constant, so I never felt as though I was actually doing that much. It's not the class that loads a pile on you at at the end of the semester so that you freak out and collapse into a heap on the floor. There are assignments to work on and one of 4 papers to edit and keep up with each week, which keeps you learning and working regularly.",
    "If your writing is shaky, I think this is one of the best courses to learn how to write. There is certainly lot of work but I think the dividends are great.",
    "Professor Klemann is an awesome professor. This was my favorite class of the semester. Professor Klemann's expectations and feedback are really clear so I think it's a great class to improve your writing. The source material is also fascinating and you get to have intellectual discussions about topics such as the meaning of toys. Overall, TAKE IT.",
    "Yes, i would recommend English 114 to a fellow student who seeks to improve his or her writing while interacting with a small group.",
    "I would recommend it, because it was an interesting class and I did learn a lot about writing.",
    "It is a class that offers both unconventional views of childhood and great attention on writing. I would definitely recommend it to people who are interested in these two areas."
