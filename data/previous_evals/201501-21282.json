   "comments": [
    "This is one of the most useful courses I have taken in grad school. Prof. Rand is really great at explaining modeling agent based simulations using MatLab. What is especially great about this course is that it is about learning skills that will add to your investigative toolbox (rather than about getting good grades on busy work or memorizing lecture slides for exams like so many other courses have unfortunately been for me). There is a steep learning curve with creating models, but with practice and the guidance of Adam Bear (the TF at the time) by the end of the course I was able to think of what I wanted to get out of my code and actually code it (if I can do it anyone can do it). The course is mostly about agent based models in social behavior, but I was able to adapt the skills I learned to address questions in Evolutionary Biology (I work on the evolution of viruses). I think it would be better if the course met twice a week rather than just once a week. Or maybe if it was split into a lecture portion and then a lab portion so that we get more hands-on coding opportunities with the TF and Prof. Rand. Overall excellent course. Prof Rand and Adam were incredibly patient and great teachers. Highly recommended.",
    "This is a fantastic introduction to agent based models and evolutionary game theory. You will learn how to program in Matlab and implement many models relevant to human societies. In many circumstances you will learn the models behind cutting edge research published in outlets like Science and Nature. Along the way, Dave will provide the encouragement and enthusiasm you need to get through really tough problems. I would recommend this course to anyone interested in modelling and understanding social interactions between humans. I don't think you will find a course like this anywhere else in the world.",
    "A lot of work - the problem sets were too long and demotivating. I would only recommend it to somebody who was really motivated to learn agent-based modeling, and maybe even has a specific reason to learn it.",
    "This is where you build characteristics of groups and see them evolve! I highly recommend it since no other courses can teach you the same cool stuff.",
    "I would tell another student to be prepared to spend significant time coding up agent based models in Matlab to determine how individual agents make decisions in the context of dynamic and strategic group interactions. I would recommend it to other students, especially econ and social psych students. I would recommend it, because this is an invaluable tool that provides enormous insight that we wouldn't be able to obtain otherwise.",
    "I would recommend the class to a fellow student because computational modeling is a really useful tool.",
    "This class is a mixture of computer science and social psychology, though it's more about coding and modeling than the theory behind psychological interactions. I would highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys coding. It's unlike any other course I have ever taken.",
    "I recommend this course, in particular to the students who want to learn computational approach to social interactions. The instructor is a specialist of the evolutionary game theory. We could learn not only the agent-based simulation, but also evolutionary mathmatics in this course."

   "comments": [
    "This course was pivotal to my dissertation\/research. I was able to get the skills I need to add a theoretical component to my research which greatly strengthens my research as most of what I do is empirical. I will surely continue to use these skills as I continue in my Academic career.",
    "This course gave me the tools to create a model that will serve as the cornerstone of my dissertation. So, it was super vital that I take this course, and I am so thrilled that it was offered.",
    "I've wanted to have modeling as a research tool for a long time and this class help get that process started",
    "I did not know what computational modeling of social interactions really meant, and I certainly did not know there was a whole field devoted to modeling in psychology.",
    "Because my research topic is a part of the evolutionary game theory, I learned a lot from the couse. Also, I could enhance my simulation capability by this course."
