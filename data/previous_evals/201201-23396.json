    "(6) I thought the pace of this class and the expectations of students was great. The speed allowed one to explore additional material and seek help on specifics without getting behind.(9) There need to be more sessions devoted to teaching R. Coming in to the course without any command line coding experience, I found the first few weeks of R-related material incredibly confusing.",
    "Question 9: I wish there had been times when we got together as a scheduled class to work on R. I think that would have been helpful and informative.",
    "I enjoyed the course very much.",
    "This was not a good course. The explinations of the concepts were very unclear and difficult to follow. Only a few (PHD) students in the entire class seemed to be following them and I think Professor Gregoire took that to mean that the entire class understood the concepts. We often schemed in groups before class about asking more quesitons but even when we spent long periods of time asking quesitons, the explinations became more and more theoretical and based on mathmatical concepts that we either a) had not learned yet or b) that we were also very unclear about. The explinations only served to further confuse us for the most part."

    "Learning how to use R. The assignments start slow and then ramp up in difficulty - very appropriate given the steep learning curve in R.",
    "(1) The best aspect of this course was focusing on a single topic for a significant length of time. Homework assignments and reiteration in class helped to develop solid analytical skills, and introductory skills with R.(2) The instructor was very good about letting us know when we should and should not bother remembering that algebra or formulas behind what we were doing. In this way, the approach fit into real-world application, as we didn't spend wasted energy trying to remember details that could just be looked up in a book.(3) The amount of work was realistic!",
    "Tim was great, and super helpful. I got the most out of the final project, when I had to go back and really understand how to use many of the tools we discussed. After the final project, I felt like I could confidently put to use and understand how these diagnostic tools for fitting regression models worked.",
    "The problems sets were helpful and the discussions about what resources are available for reference about statistics and R was also valuable. I'm sure I will consult them in the future and now I have an idea of where to look.",
    "I loved the lecture material. It was very thorough and clear.",
    "Learning R I suppose. However, even the little R programing I know now feels very inadiquate since the concepts behind the statistics we learned were so poorly explained and limited in scope."

   "question_text": "The things about this course most in need of improvement are:",
   "comments": [
    "Textbook is pretty brutal.",
    "The instructor, perhaps due a lack of comfort, chose to teach most classes by walking through text-based power points, with frequent forays into R. In this way, the delivery was not particularly dynamic, and in a dark room after lunch, some students would lose attention. In addition, a more available and attentive TA is needed - preferably someone who is not working through their comprehensive exam.",
    "This sounds silly, but I wish the homework had been harder\/ more demanding. I was able to coast through a lot of the course without internalizing\/ understanding a lot of the material, because the homework (and the level at which it was graded) did not require me to fully understand what was happening. Fortunately, this was corrected by the final project, so I feel very good about what I got out of this course. And I understand that it should be my prerogative to make myself learn the material. But had the homework been more demanding, I would certainly have been forced to learn and understand the material more thoroughly.",
    "I found the lectures a bit confusing. We didn't spend enough time on equations for me to understand them, so scrolling by them on the pdf was a bit confusing and made the lecture harder to follow. The pdf notes themselves were helpful when I looked at them outside of class, though.I didn't get much feedback on the homework and we didn't go over it in class, so I honestly don't know what I did wrong or could have done better. I didn't feel like I was improving in my understanding from one homework to the next. Going over the homework and talking about how to interpret the data in different ways would have been incredibly helpful.",
    "Nothing needs improvement.",
    "The conceptual explination.",
    "TA was practically non-existent. Lectures were difficult to follow - it was easy to get lost in the material. Not enough assistance and background provided in R."

    "The help I received from the instructor was excellent. He was always willing to answer questions and to help clarify points of confusion - both in class and without. He made himself available for face-time if so desired, but was also prompt with email correspondence. The TA was helpful during the early portion of theterm, but his comprehensive exams soon took over. Since he was mostly unavailable for the bulk of the semester, I didn't even bother trying to get help from him, and went straight to the professor.",
    "Tim was great, and very available and responsive to questions. I should have visited him more often.Kris is a great guy, but was absent for a lot of the course. I understand that he had other things on his plate, but I don't feel like he was very helpful as a TA. The comments on the homework were sparse, and good grades were easily obtained with minimal effort (this contributed to the fact that I didn't feel that I needed to work hard to do well on the homework). I wish there had been more organized times when we got together with him to go over various ideas, talk through how to run things in R, etc.",
    "I didn't ask much for help outside of class so I can't comment, but I wish we had gotten more feedback on the assignments.",
    "The instructor and TA were very helpful and always available for questions.",
    "Kris was helpful when he was available. However, he was very unavailable for the last month of classes during his PHD exam period.",

    "This course provided a suite of skills for data analysis that will be useful in much of my work. Regression is one of the more common forms of analysis, so this is a much needed topic for most scientists. Additionally, it provided a base on which to pursue more advanced statistics. For me, this course was situated between introductory statistics and spatial statistics.",

The course did not live up to my expectations in that I hoped to come away feeling very confident in my regression skills. Instead, I feel reasonably confident, but will surely continue to seek advice on modeling from those more experienced than I, even for basic modeling.",

    "I did not participate in a formal work group, but did work with others on many occasions. I highly recommend working in a group, since R can seem like gibberish, and it takes communal experience to help wade through it. Over time, as your personal library of R code gets larger, a group is less necessary - though still helpful. Someone starting the class with no R experience should plan on working in a group.",

    "Try not to get frustrated with R.",
    "(1) Plan on working in a group for homework assignments(2) Take detailed digital notes within the instructor's digital handouts, since you will inevitably forget some of the complexities of developing code or using R functions.(3) This course has a very nice amount of work - not too much, not too little. It allows time to do outside reading to build on concepts, amd to seek advice on certain issues. In this way, it was the best class I have had thus far.(4) Ask the professor to run more R coaching sessions during the early weeks. The first homework assignment (if you don't know any R) is the most daunting since it seems like you are wading through pure gibberish. Having additional help sessions would resolve this.(5) This course is more meaningful if you have data to work with. If you don't, you end up practicing on data that you don't necessarily care about.(6) If you don't know anything about R or matrix algebra, and are a little rusty with your regression modeling, definitely take this course before moving on.(7)Don't be afraid to ask questions. The professor presentation style might make it seem hard to interject, but if you raise questions, he is very good about helping resolve the confusion.(8) I ran a time tracking project all term to help future students plan their lives. The regression course, including all class time and all out of class time, but no traveling associated with the course, took 142:20 for a reasonably focused student. The semester was 106 days (including spring break), or about 15 weeks. That is roughly 9.4 hours a week. Depending on whether or not you work over spring break, or save projects until reading period or finals week, this figure might change.",
    "Make yourself do the reading. Make yourself understand what is happening after each class. Most of all, talk to Tim often about what you don't understand- he is great at getting you to understand concepts. Don't be afraid to ask him to go over things in class as well as in office hours.",
    "Make sure to get feedback and come to class prepared with questions about the homework so that we can go over it.",
    "I would advise them to read through the lectures carefully and to practice with R often to improve their skills.",
    "I would not recommend this course to other students."
