    "This is going to be a pretty long response, but here it goes... I came into this class after having almost changed majors from intensive physics to one of the combined physics majors (think physics and astro, physics and geosciences and so on). I kept the intensive major because it gave more flexibility, but it meant that I had to take this class. I'm really glad I took it though, because I think that I became more adept at using mathematics and I learned about some interesting physics concepts. It's a dry course because of the amount of mathematical manipulation needed and that's never going to change. This year, the assessment worked like this: problem sets were worth 40%, the final was worth 35%, a presentation was worth 5%, and the midterm was worth 20%. The problem sets were generally long but not too difficult until the last few weeks. The presentation was a lot of fun, especially because we could choose to work with friends. The midterm was pretty easy if you studied, and the mean was a 74%, with a standard deviation of 10, but I know a couple of people who scored 90 or above. Nagai is a really awesome person: he's the kind of professor who our class wants to catch up with one day outside of class. Quantum isn't his field of specialty, but he was always willing to help outside of lecture. I definitely benefited from this: quantum isn't my strength and Nagai was always ready to email students or to meet us in person to discuss concepts. The class was also pretty tight knit because we've been taking classes together for a while. After the midterm\/final\/hard problem sets\/studying for the final, a few of us would often get beers together. Overall, I'd say that this class is worth taking. It's not the sort of class that made me want to be a quantum physicist, but quantum mechanics just doesn't do that for me. However, it's the sort of class that I'm really glad I took, because I think it did challenge my skills, the professor was great and I enjoyed learning about the material. Take it if you can fit it in your schedule.",
    "I would recommend this class to someone who enjoyed 440 and wanted to go more in depth in Quantum. This course is mostly about Hydrogen, and you will really master how to apply quantum to that system in deriving the various energy corrections to Hydrogen, although at times the pace felt a bit slow. In addition, some of the other topics covered towards the end such as the variational principles are very interesting, and help shed light on how chemistry works (so in some ways this class is a bridge between quantum physics for physicists and quantum physics for chemists). The workload is heavy in that the problem sets take a long time, but they really are necessary to understand some of the more difficult topics. The presentations at the end were also a great way to see some interesting applications. Overall certainly a course I would recommend.",
    "Anyone who has read it would acknowledge that there is little that is particularly exciting about Griffiths Ch.s 4-7, material that must be covered methodically to give a correct intuition of quantum mechanical concepts. And acknowledging this, Nagai's 441 is excellent. We systematically cover what must be covered, material that tends to be dry at times but in total is very clearly important. Nagai has a clear and engaging lecture style. We gave small intraclass presentations at the end of the course, and having these presentations was an inspired choice on Nagai's part; they clarified the context and value of the work we did this semester.",
    "The second semester of a yearlong introduction to quantum mechanics. Definitely an interesting and often conceptually rigorous course, though most are taking it as a requirement for the (intensive) major. I really enjoyed the two semesters of quantum mechanics, and plan on continuing to study the subject. It has been a welcome change of pace from classical mechanics\/physics, and it cool to get a better and more fundamental. understanding of the ideas that are so often thrown around in popular science. Take this if you have taken 440!",
    "The class is a continuation of first semester quantum that focuses largely on solving the hydrogen atom. If you're interested at all in chemistry or atomic physics you'll really enjoy it, because you derive where the quantum numbers come from and learn about bonding and anti-bonding orbitals. More generally for the physics major, it's just an application of basic QM and perturbation theory to 3-d systems. I found it easier than 440 but it probably depends a lot on the professor.",
    "This is the kind of class that will push your sense of the world to the max. You need to be fluent in multivariable and linear algebra, but if you are taking this, you probably took 440, so you know the deal. This class is conceptually trickier than 440, but probably less difficult mathematically. This class is not for the faint of heart, and will require significant work each week on problem sets. However, it is the kind of class that is satisfying to take because it is a mutual struggle. Take it if you have to, or if you have an iron stomach and want to learn some really cool things about the way the world works.",
    "The continuation of Physics 440. Overall, this course was enjoyable and I'm glad I took it. The workload is similar to that of Physics 440, or possibly slightly less.",
    "Definitely less work than Physics 440 with DeMille -- the problem sets are shorter, and there is less brand new material because you've already learned all the basic skills. I also found it less interesting for that reason, but I learned a lot and have a better understanding of quantum mechanics.",
    "Good class. The material was rigorous but not overwhelming. Daisuke maintained a reasonable pace throughout, so that we had time to read the book beforehand and absorb the material. The psets were mostly taken from Griffiths, which makes it very easy to look up the solutions in the solution manual. Even the midterm was composed of three Griffiths problems. But the class got significantly harder after the midterm. We covered three chapters in the second half, compared to just one in the first. The last chapter on bosons and fermions was confusing, but don't hesitate to talk to Daisuke when you have questions. He is very nice about it. The last week of class consisted entirely of student presentations (no homework, which was great). I thought I wouldn't like it, but I actually learned a lot from the presentations in a low-stress manner.",
    "Beginning your junior year, you're probably deciding whether or not to go for the intensive major. This is kind of the make or break class for physics majors in that situation. This class is very similar to 440, so I would judge my decision on how confident I felt with the material in the first semester of quantum. With Nagai, the psets were about the same and the midterm and final were much, much easier than those of 440, although the curve was correspondingly tougher, so pick your poison I guess.",
    "If you liked 440, or didn't like it because you didn't see the relevance of what you were learning, take this and find out more about why quantum is cool. If you're intensive, you have to take it anyway, so enjoy. Professor Nagai is really nice and a good lecturer.",
    "Good class, well-organized. All of the course material is pretty much taken directly from Griffiths. Slightly easier than 440, I think.",
    "Basically a continuation of 440, easier if anything in problem sets and in tests."
