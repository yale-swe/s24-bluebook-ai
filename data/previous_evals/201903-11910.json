   "comments": [
    "Strengths - Fun psets which didn't take too long to complete - Prof Lafferty's lectures were interesting and accessible Weaknesses - Prof Feng's combined class (with 365) at the start was intimidating, and I almost dropped, but this is not a fault of either professor",
    "Pretty good. Might do with more python in class (especially at the start, but i'm not sure if that was a facet of the extenuating circumstances this semester with the professor being out).",
    "more coding tests than written tests more feedback on assignments\/midterms otherwise a very good course, learned a lot!",
    "This course, although new, was incredibly well designed. Professor Lafferty is wonderful. The lectures were interesting and informative, and the problem sets, although sometimes very challenging, were always doable and rewarding. Furthermore, the exams were very fair. Overall, I loved this class.",
    "Lectures were very engaging, especially with Lafferty. Problem sets made be comfortable applying tons of existing machine learning packages which was super valuable. Weakness: I feel like more time could have been spent on math and the mathematics behind some of the models. I feIt comfortable applying things and had some high level intuition about how the models worked. I wanted a little more math.",
    "Strengths: Lafferty is just a stellar teacher. I think he does need to refine some of the lectures and institute more a framework for learning each of the algorithms and methods (would better keep them distinguished.) But overall he is one of the kindest, warmest, most validating profs I've had in a while. Weaknesses: among the 7 psets, they kind of swung between being far too difficult at the beginning of the semester, to far too easy at the end. I would say Assn3 - 4 were the perfect middle ground where we did actually have to write some code and grapple with the conccept, without it taking an obscene amount of time.",
    "Well-taught course, even though the front end was a tad bit confusing.",
    "Strength: The material is carefully handpicked to give us an overview of the popular machine learning methods useful to a variety of fields. The class has a focus on language models and natural language methods, which I am particularly interested in. And Lafferty is great he is the reason that a lot of people took the class. Weakness: Though the material is good and the instruction team far more than capable, the class is severely lacking in its logistics. Office hours are an hour and half at most. For a class that requires heavy programming, this is completely dwarfed by the easily three-hour help hours of a CS class. A lot of the times the ULA or TF cannot really help the students because of the length of office hours. It would have be significantly better if help resources are pooled together to make longer office hours. I believe this inadequacy is reflected in the drastic attrition of students taking the class for credit. This class also attracted a large number of auditors almost the same number as actual students in the class. This caused a lot of confusion for viewing grade distributions on Canvas. For an extended period, students taking the class for credit were misguided by the distribution which is skewed much lower than reality as Canvas automatically gives auditors 0's. Also, there is a wide range of previous experience in the class, which is jarring for an introductory course. I think it would have been helpful for everyone if we are given a better idea of whom this class is actually for (this is not to say the material is overwhelming as introductory course; it is perfectly doable). There were also a lot of last minute changes to exam formats, last minute cancellation of office hours etc. which students would have happily preferred to have avoided. In all, logistics of this class has to be improved so as to not sabotage what otherwise could be a great class.",
    "This course was well-conceived, and for the most part, well-executed. The chaos and changing professors at the beginning of the semester was not good, but once Professor Lafferty returned it was much better. He is a great teacher and was clearly dedicated to making the complex topics we covered as accessible as possible. One weakness would be the discrepancy between the problem sets and exams. Without much practice doing handwritten problems or preparation for what kind of questions would be asked, it was very difficult to prepare for exams, and the midterm in particular felt a little unfair.",
    "Great intro to many different topics, although doesn't go very deep. The lectures were very informative, although the office hours were not super helpful."

   "comments": [
    "Yes I would recommend to take - I think Prof Lafferty has some great plans for the future iterations of this course, e.g. video lessons, self-testing etc",
    "If you're interested in machine learning, but don't have the time or desire to go deep into the math, this is the class for you.",
    "yes, not bad at all if you credit\/d",
    "Yes!! If you want to learn ML concepts and skills to apply in a wide variety of potential fields, definitely take this class!",
    "I would recommend this course. You learn a lot about a ton of different useful models. Also, I think math 120 or some calculus is really all you need. I had not taken any other stats course and found it manageable. If you want more math, you should probably look elsewhere.",
    "Yes! Take it for Lafferty. Only real criticism is that the 2nd midterm and final are no joke, and could be made a little fairer with regard to not having your grade depend on the quality of your cheat sheet. That RNN question was a little dirty.",
    "Yes. It's a great course for non-S&DS people wanting to use ML in the real world.",
    "Great way to learn python",
    "Hopefully over time this course will get better and better, but it is promising as a good introduction to topics in machine learning without unnecessary amounts of math\/theory\/proofs. It does teach some practical skills in using Python for ML, which is great. It should not be your first taste of ML though. Many of the lectures were difficult to follow even with some background in the topics, so I would not say this class is good for beginners. Also, you need to know Python reasonably well.",
    "Yes, if they want a good intro to machine learning. If you don't have the programming\/statistical background, the assignments may be difficult"
