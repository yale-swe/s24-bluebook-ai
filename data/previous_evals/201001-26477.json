    "It is a course to learn the basics of letterpress printing, and the production and appreciation of printed matter. Everyone should take it!",
    "You will spend a huge amount of time and probably a fair amount of money on letterpress printing. There are generally three projects (bookmarks, broadside, book), which require ascending levels of time and skill. Consider taking one of the extracurricular letterpress classes in Davenport or another college before enrolling in this seminar -- the learning curve can be pretty painful.You'll end up with a bunch of gorgeous projects. Take it.",
    "This is an amazing class with a great instructor. It's perfect for you if you have an interest in letterpress printing, graphic design, or book arts. The projects require a great deal of work but they are well worth the effort.",
    "I would definitely recommend it. For most of the time you do not have much work, except for projects with will force you to spend dozens of hours in the press room, that is, if you want to have a good finished product.",
    "Yes, definitely. A must take class at Yale. Incredible--you are learning a skill that is so important, interesting, and fun. TAKE IT (if you can get in)! It is a lot of work, but so rewarding."
