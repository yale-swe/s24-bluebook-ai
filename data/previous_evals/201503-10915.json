    "Lives up to its reputation for being an easy course. While I feel more familiar with some of the math behind the Data Science, I don't feel as though I learned too many modern techniques. I also think it is good to hear some of Professor Rokhlin's programming advice. It's not what you've been taught, and hence it is a good way to gain exposure to different coding styles. While I don't think it is as applicable in the application development world, I can see how much of what he says is useful if you will be working with numerical computations.",
