   "comments": [
    "Chemistry 421 has fallen from its pedestal under Professor Shepartz. It is now a course struggling to define itself and find a structure. Assignment due dates are arbitrary (presentations on research proposals began before our Specific Aims was due, so the 30%-of-our-grade presentation was due before our topics had even been confirmed) and the course is generally frustrating.I would NOT recommend this course until the professors get their acts together.",
    "Overall, the topics were great but the structure was a little disorganized. We didn't get a first problem set until 5 weeks in and only ended up with two total problem sets for the semester, so I never felt like I was prepared for the exams.",
    "I think this was the first time in a while that Profs. Spiegel and Crawford so they're still working out some of the details (we only had two problem sets the entire semester when I think originally they were supposed to be weekly). I did enjoy the having the research proposal\/presentation as an opportunity to explore a particular topic in depth; such opportunities are rare in chemistry elective courses. Take this course if you really enjoy learning about various methods of chemical biology.",
    "I learned a lot about how broadly defined chemical biology is, and I learned about some of the research frontiers within chemical biology. The preparation of the research proposal and presentation made me master one particular subject. The workload is normal. A background in both organic chemistry and biology is helpful.",
    "I enjoyed this class a lot, as it taught me many new things in chemistry. I also wrote my first graduate level project proposal, and gave a scientific presentation for longer than 12 minutes. I really value the skills that I gained throughout this course. That said, this class needs more organization to be a good course. It needs more grade transparency; even though the majority of the class are graduate students, we should still get a better idea of how we are doing in the class during the semester."
