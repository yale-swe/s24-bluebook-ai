   "comments": [
    "Great class. Hard, yes. Confusing, yes. Rewarding? Very.",
    "Great seminar. It is billed as a seminar but North does a considerable amount of teaching and explaining the ideas in class, and her style is easy and accessible, so that was tremendously helpful for some of the less science-minded among us. It's also a fascinating topic that is more complex than it seems and easily sustains the length of the semester. The workload is pretty light too; the \"problem sets\" are just explaining the concepts in paragraph form, so there is no math or formula-work done. I really enjoyed this class; light workload and very interesting material.",
    "Great for anyone interested in the philosophy of physics. Sometimes seemed like more of a lecture than a seminar, but this was necessary for most of the topics to make sense. Very reasonable workload- takehome midterm and final, and light (albeit sometimes confusing) readings.",
    "I would recommend this class. It's very specific and fairly physics intensive, but if you're interested in the material, it's a lot of fun.",
    "Take this if you're interested in the material; it's REALLY COOL if you're the physics\/math\/philosophy type. It's fun. You have to stay engaged though-first half of each class is normally lecture and then we start to discuss.",
    "Nice bridge of philosophy and physics - heavier weight on the science side though. You will get more out of it if you have some basic understanding of physics, including quantum mechanics, although it's not necessary to get through the class.",
    "This is an excellent course. Professor North is wonderful in a seminar setting, and the material is incredibly engaging. There's a lot of science here (more than philosophy), but if you're interested in the sort of philosophy that puts this on your radar, you'll be fine. I definitely recommend this.",
    "Approaching this course from the view of a physicist with some interest in philosophy, I found it to be excellent. This is by no means a resolved issue from a physical standpoint, and thinking about the issues at hand is good to help obtain a solid grasp of the foundation of statistical mechanics. I presume it was interesting for philosophers as well, but I cannot comment on that myself.",
    "This class is not what you might expect it to be based on the cereal-box description. It involves a lot of physics i.e. you actually have to earn the science credit. That being said, the workload is similar to most classes and making comments is not at all anxiety-inducing because Prof North is so friendly. Really interesting material regarding the implications of special relativity on the fact that time might not be real, but if those kinds of questions don't interest you, it might not be the class for you. This is not really dinnertime conversation with the parents."
