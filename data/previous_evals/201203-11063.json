    "Definitely take it, if the subject interests you. Professor Frahm is a great professor and his enthusiasm for the material is infectious.",
    "Definitely. This is the kind of course that is structured in such a way that every student has something to learn and contribute to the class. We surveyed a variety of texts that pertain to women in Assyria and Babylonia\u00e2\u0080\u0093 laws, letters, contracts, etc\u00e2\u0080\u0093 and attempted to put together a coherent picture of what kinds of lives women led in those areas. Our course material was chosen with the differing specialities of the students in mind, so that everyone had something they could talk about in class and everyone also had something that they had much to learn about."
