   "comments": [
    "It is important to note that the course topic is subject to change on an annual basis, so this evaluation is only pertinent if Energy remains the emphasis.",
    "The pace of the class was a bit too slow-- there was a lot of time spent on introductory material, but everyone in the class was screened for having already known the introductory material.",
    "This is the best energy class I have taken at Yale. It was helpful to focus on just one energy industry each class and learn about the major issues and financial components. It would have been helpful to expand this class to two semesters because there was so much material and I would have liked to go a little deeper into each topic, especially since there aren't any other energy classes like it.",
    "The workload is fine, though a good amount of reading materials.",
    "My biggest recommendation would be to focus the course more. THe energy industry as a whole is too broad of a topic and the enrolled students clearly had a clear understanding of the industry from an overview standpoint. Diving deep into one concentration, such as electricity, would be an awesome chance to develop the class and make the most of such an advanced seminar structure.",
    "Great class if you're interested in thinking through energy systems at a deeper level that what's covered in ESA. It's still a huge subject, and the course wasn't able to spend as much time on every aspect of energy (electricity, natural gas, etc), but it did help you dig deeper. Final projects gave you an opportunity to really hone in on a subject of your choice.",
    "Great course and we need more like it!",
    "It provided both overview and in depth assessment. It was sometimes hard to meet both of those goals.",
    "Question 6: The course was 'too slow' for anyone that has taken other energy classes. As this is my field of interest I had already taken Energy Systems Analysis, Energy Markets&Strategy, and some other classes about energy and there was a lot of reviewed materials. Thus, the class wasn't very valuable for me. Yale should create an 'energy-track' so that each energy class covers entirely new materials and there isn't so much overlap.Question 7: Bill Ellis is very knowledgeable but he is a dry lecturer. Marian Chertow was hardly involved at all, which surprised me. I thought the class would have much more of an industrial ecology element than it did. I wanted to hear more from her."

   "comments": [
    "Professor Ellis is an incredible resource; a bevvy of information for the students to learn from. You will absolutely know more about the energy field, in a comprehensive way, from taking the class",
    "I liked the final project because we were able to dive deep into a particular topic of our interest that was covered in class.",
    "Detailed analysis on each energy industry was very helpful!",
    "Flexibility of the final project to reflect student interests. The exposure to the next deeper level of energy topics.",
    "The instructor is very knowledgeable on energy system.",
    "Bill's enthusiasm.",
    "Some of the readings and all of the guest lecturers were fantastic.",
    "Professor Ellis brought an encyclopedic knowledge of the technological, political, and economic factors associated with our modern energy systems and conveyed that knowledge clearly through his presentations and lectures. The readings and case studies were well chosen. Our field trip to the New England ISO was a great way to help the students understand the reality of managing the power grid."

   "comments": [
    "There is a very high amount of reading material assigned; frankly, more than most students were able to get through entirely. Sometimes you could read for hours, not get through everything, and then find in class that certain selections would have been more pertinent than others.",
    "A lot of material was fit into one semester; it could easily be spread across two semesters and gone a little deeper.",
    "Discussion at student roundtables can be made more informative.More international focused topics can be interesting as well.",
    "It really did try to cover a lot. I think maybe tossing out one of subjects (maybe coal?) and spending more time on something like electricity markets or renewables or energy efficiency could have been useful.",
    "Readings were sometimes unwieldy\/too many\/posted too soon before class session.",
    "The complexity level of the material covered and the lectures could be livened up.",
    "Time management during class sessions to allow sufficient time for student-led roundtable presentations and discussions."

    "As an Industrial Ecology student, I found the course to be light on IE focus, while very heavy on energy. This is not necessarily a criticism, as knowledge on the energy system is vital to take with you into any profession, and pertinent to IE.",
    "This was a key component of my energy curriculum.",
    "It is certainly a good course to take after Energy Systems Analysis, to provide additional details into different energy industries.",
    "Directly fit into my overall program, as one focused on energy broadly -- policy, markets, economics, etc.",

    "For the class presentations, choose something you're not familiar with, as many in the energy concentration tend to focus on their primary interest, but this is a good opportunity to explore outside of that interest.",
    "Like always, try to go through the reading before the class, it helps to expand the information you received in class.Start your paper early, Bill and Marian are great resources for digging into the topic deeper, you should not wait till last minute to seek their helps.",
    "Go in to the class knowing at least one energy related topic that you want to really dig into. Assuming that the topic is covered in class and can be researched in your final project, you can really use the class to learn a lot on that subject. The seminar format of the class is also really enjoyable, but make sure you're prepared to speak up and participate!",
