    "Yes I totally would recommend this course because it offers an insight on how images of the other are constructed. The knowledge acquired in this course offers an opportunity to review the image of Muslim and Islam--including social and personal perceptions-- and critically assess the discourse behind political positions regarding Islam. Very useful to analyze the construction of the \"other\" and it is applicable to many other social construction regarding other religions."
