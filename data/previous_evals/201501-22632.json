   "comments": [
    "Take it, but do clarify what the professor is looking for on the midterm because it was a bit unclear. Also, DO THE READINGS!! Once you get past the economics (which Professor Torres explains fairly clearly) you get into some interesting stuff. Also, try to speak up in lecture -- participation is actually important.",
    "The professor is great, but the topic is dense if you're not a political science major or into this subject. You don't need a background in stats to take this class, but it is helpful.",
    "If you like papers and statistics and young democracies this is the perfect class for you. We spent a lot more time on numbers than concepts though, so if you're looking for a more qualitative experience, don't look here.",
    "This course is absolutely WONDERFUL!! The subject matter was fascinating as we went through various elections in numerous countries, uncovering various cases of corruption. The workload is manageable and the readings are interested.",
    "This course was amazing and my favorite taken at Yale. As long as you take notes in class and know the readings, this class in enjoyable and not that difficult. Very interesting and I learned so much that I will use outside of just an academic setting. Take it if you can!",
    "The course itself is not bad. The 9AM was a bit rough sometimes.",
    "Take it! Good course, good teacher, not much work. Beware the midterm though, it comes out of nowhere. The class is all about the big picture, so always keep that in mind. Professor De La O is great in class and a little harder to connect with one-on-one, but it's definitely a class worth taking because it's super relevant to today and super applicable to the real world. Even though it was at 9am, I would take the class again if given the opportunity!",
    "The class consists of reading academic papers from mostly African and South American democracies and going over them in class. A lot of looking at statistics.",
    "A great first global affairs class. Interesting lectures and not too much work.",
    "This class is amazing because it comprehensively discusses various challenges that developing democracies face. The class setting is in between a lecture and section because the professor is mostly lecturing, but also expects regular participation. I would absolutely recommend this class to any student who wants to study the differences between democracies and autocracies, as well as what makes nations more or less likely to transition into one of these government types.",
    "This class is an excellent introductory course, although a background in statistics would be helpful.",
    "Absolutely. This course is not an overwhelming amount of work, your only homework is reading (which are very interesting, not boring at all) and a group presentation. You walk out of this class with a thorough understanding of how democracies develop, thrive or fall, and overall structure of the democratic system. Totally fascinating.",
    "Yes! You should learn about young democracies!",
    "Fantastic course! The themes were very helpful and supported with relevant, important readings. Very current material that addresses pressing policy problems in the world.",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone interested in PoliSci, Global Affairs, or even Latin American Studies (since a lot of the countries we talked about were in Latin America). I think the class shows the problems that a lot of developing countries face and how hard it is to solve them. It is a bit hard at first if you've never taken stats, but by the end of the class you will be able to understand basic stats and how to read tables, so that is a plus. I really enjoyed the class and professor De la O is great!"
