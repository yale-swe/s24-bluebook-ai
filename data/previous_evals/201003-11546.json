    "Q7C Frequent changes in syllabus were not announced to class, especially the half of the class that was forced to leave early everyday.",
    "General suggestions: Readings were outdated and somewhat repetitive within each theme. Would have liked to receive more readings and discussion on climate change, since this is a hot topic these days.",
    "More recent readings would be appreciated.",
    "1. There were too many readings to keep up with, or to be able to treat fully in the discussions.",
    "The content of this course is very important, and the class overall was very good. I think there is some room for improvement.",
    "Question 7: When Ann gets away from her powerpoint slides, I would give her a 1 ( Excellent). When she sticks right to them it becomes a little tedious and I would appreciate more of her spontaneity and less reading from the slides.Question 10: This course was perhaps the most relevant to my course of study this term and I really enjoyed it. It kept me in touch with my cohort and we learned a lot together.",
    "The course is essential for anyone interested in forests and forest development, but I believe this should be a heavily field-based course. Ideally, there should be two hours of lecture each week and two hours (at least) in the field each week. The material needs to be discussed\/recited\/analyzed in a forest setting. Even very local excursions would have been helpful. I feel knowledgeable in some senses, yet I still lack any experience being in the woods with colleagues and assessing a stand and talking about possible trajectories\/past disturbance. Our one trip was great, but we just need more field work.The course also needs a discussion section from the start, or a TA run drop-in on a weekly basis. This started up after the midterm, because students did poorly--the exam challenged people to think and synthesize in a way that class discussions and lectures never had. The lectures need to be reframed so that the group is thinking critically from the start and discussing stand dynamics in meaningful ways from the get-go.",
    "Question 5: Ann was not very responsive to comments as she had an agenda to get through her multitudes slides. As a result (Question 6), the pace was very fast. With little time for questions, a poor learning environment was created. It was general consensus that if you didn't show up to class, you could just read the slides as this was 95% of what would be covered in class.",
    "As an MF, I think the course is critical to my coursework.The readings sometimes seemed a bit tangential to the topics they were supposed to address."

    "Field trips, applied knowledge, transparency of course objectives and of important points to learn.",
    "The TAs were very responsive to students' questions.",
    "Reading Ann's 1997 paper on fire refugia and talking about it in class was the highlight of the course for me. I also enjoyed Kristof Kelemann's guest lecture- it was great to hear an international perspective on stand dynamics and to hear what research is going on in the field abroad.The readings on the whole were a highlight. They comprise a classic body of forestry literature and I enjoyed them a lot.",

   "comments": [
    "More in-field work (during class times or on weekends).",
    "Critical analysis paper--it's hard to play expert when you're not one.",
    "the lectures",
    "Discussions and lectures.Discussions were poorly facilitated and attempted to cover too much material. Discussion of 10+ articles is completely unreasonable, especially without facilitation. Paring the articles down to 2 or 3 through an in class vote or poll would be helpful. Facilitation of discussions by students, TA, or instructor.Lectures were not engaging. Reading powerpoint in the dark is not an effective teaching method.",
    "Not all article readings were useful. Should possibly revise the readings (add newer literature), reduce them, and focus discussions. Having fewer readings would allow us to focus more on the most pertinent articles. Few people actually read all the readings, leading to an uneven discussion when people didn't read the article. There were also a lot of repeated concepts in multiple articles, where a reading could have been cut out completely.",
    "Powerpoint slides - too many words, some slides seemed more like paragraphs which made it hard to pick out the main points.",
    "There are too many readings per discussion session. It's hard to cover anything in great depth.",
    "More up-to-date readings.",
    "-Classes would be much improved if the lecturer didn't read off of the powerpoints.-Discussions were usually off-topic and didn't cover important points from the readings. More guidance is necessary.",
    "I think enrollment in this course should be capped, so that the discussions can be more productive. There were too many people (though some people NEVER opened their mouths in the discussions) and it was difficult to get the discussion to flow sometimes. I also think we should take more field trips - it would really help the class material feel more concrete.",
    "Getting away from the lecture notes - dynamic pedagogy.The Ashton readings were not very good, and the Oliver textbook is full of errors and typos.",
    "More attention from the TAs, and more field trips.",
    "Having perhaps another field trip - even an afternoon closer to school - could be useful.Perhaps instead of analyzing a paper related to stand dynamics, a possible final assignment\/project could be to look at a specific forest and identify certain processes and phases happening there. (obviously speculative)The textbook is fairly dry, but that can't be helped. It was good to get some foundation in historically important papers, but I felt it would have also been useful to read current papers to see how those same questions are or are not relevant and still in discussion today. This might help make the discussions more lively.I also don't know that it would be such a bad idea to ask for some recall rigor for exams. I have heard that some forestry professionals aren't sure that the students coming out of FES have the applied knowledge of forests (\"they can't tell their trees\"). I'm not sure if that's something for Stand Dynamics to fix, but that is an important comment I've noted lately about FES forestry generally.",
    "There was a conflict with other class and many students could not take every lecture fully.",
    "1.There was too much focus on reading powerpoint slides aloud to the class. I appreciate the information contained in the slides, but I prefer to hear a lecture from the professor.2.I thought that our discussion sections tackled too many articles all at once. We should focus on 3 articles at a time and not try to get through 10 in an hour and a half.3. I would appreciate more structure in the discussions as well. For me, the discussion is about hearing from classmates, but it is also about hearing form the TAs and from the professor in a slightly less formal ( i.e. not lecture) setting.4. I felt that there was a bit too much overlap betweenthe first half of the course and the second. I would perhaps suggest focusing on the stages of stand development for the first half and then delving into the readings and applications for management in the second half of the course so that we could spend more time analyzing the articles from a forest stand dynamics viewpoint.",
    "The reading discussions was not so organised. I think if that could be improved it will help students benefit from the discussions.",
    "Reading discussions were not always focused on the material or particularly helpful.",
    "need more field trips and discussion.",
    "Forest Stand Dynamics needs to be taught more dynamically. Reading directly from slides is inadeqaute pedagogy. One field trip is simply unacceptable for a course that endeavors to elucidate the processes at work in extant forests. Readings should be fewer so that more attention can be focused on the content of each assigned article. Discussion section needs a serious overhaul- if the class is as large as it was this year, it needs to be split into two groups, and there should be students assigned to lead the discussions.",
    "I wonder if covering less material and discussing fewer articles would improve this course--everything seemed so rushed, and we just scratched the surface of so many different topics.",
    "The course could have gone into more detail on other models of stand dynamics such as the Franklin model.",
    "A need for more dialogue and less monologue. Get the students engaged, don't just rush through the slides...",
    "The discussion sections weren't well organized. We wandered all over the map. We needed more structure, in the form of questions to address, and also needed a shorter leash."

I also appreciated his review questions- they were thought provoking and helpful.",

Brea was always very responsive to queries via email, and she did a great job leading our discussion sections.",

The complete disdain for any attempt at pedagogical proficiency, ostensibly founded on the conviction that graduate students should be adept at learning on their own, is fundamentally flawed and yields a wasted opportunity to teach enthusiastic students. To sit in the back row was to witness student multi-tasking at its pinnacle. Since the professor really does read straight off the slides (with some anecdotes sprinkled in, many of which are more memorable than anything on those slides), many people wisely chose to tend to other matters while half listening to catch anything of import.
