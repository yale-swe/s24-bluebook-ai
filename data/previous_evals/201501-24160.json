    "I anticipate that this course will change considerably the next time it is taught. The Jackson Institute is shaping in such a way that it will probably be better linked to other courses in future. So, forget the material on this. Take this course for the Professor. You will not be disappointed. Any time with Unni is time well spent.",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone considering working in complex situations where they will be forced to choose beyond bad options, in what can literally be life-or-death decisions. I fully expect to be confronting hard choices in the future, and to have conversations from this class serve as guidance.",
    "Yes I definitely recommend this code to any student interested in exploring major themes in humanitarian crisis response.",
    "A fascinating and eye-opening look at the ethical and moral dilemmas that arise when trying to do good work in conflict or disaster afflicted areas. Highly recommended for students interested in philosophy, humanitarian action, and global health."
