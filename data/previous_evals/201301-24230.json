    "It was taught down to the undergrads. Lots of hand holding through papers\/projects. If its going to be a YSPH course, it should taught like other YSPH courses, with the assumption that the students are mature enough to manage their own work. Example: for our final research paper, which was only 10 pages, we were made to submit 3 potential topics to write on 10 weeks before the due date, from which Judy selected 1 for us, and graded our potential topics out of 15 points. This is grad school. We don't need 2.5 months to write a 10 page paper and we certainly are capable of selecting adequate topics on our own. Submitting 1 proposed topic for approval is understandable. But to grade 3, and then choose 1 for us is obnoxious and paternalistic. This was a fairly common theme throughout the semester.As far as the substance of the course, it was heavily qualitative, which was unexpected from an economics class. Again, this felt like it was done mostly for the undergrads, because the YSPH students are well versed in quantitative analysis. We spent a lot of time talk about what we thought and felt about certain topics, rather than really digging into the economics of the issues. Disappointing.",
    "Great course. Very interesting. I think that by reducing the participation\/discussion space during classes and the presentations towards the end of the semester, time could be used to deepen the analysis in some of the themes.",
    "Honestly, I was a bit disappointed by this class. My understanding was that it was a graduate level course, but it seemed to be structured more like an undergraduate class. (This is not a comment on my fellow classmates; graduate and undergrads alike had insightful comments and equally contributed to the class)The homework struck me as a bit paternalistic: ie. it was an undisguised effort to make sure that we did the reading. While some motivation is of course necessary to make sure students do the reading (we are human after all), I would have responded better to homework which *assumed* that we had completed the reading, and asked us to use that information as a jumping off point to process and take what we had learned to the next level. In short, the weekly assignments were an exercise in \"tell me the right answer\" rather than \"what do you think about this information as an academic peer\". The class discussion suffered from this phenomenon as well (eg. \"what is addiction\" according to the reading?) as opposed to taking the information we read to the next level (eg. \"Does society treat addiction a matter of lack of willpower or a mental illness? Does this reaction vary by sector (ie. congress vs public opinion vs. parents vs....?) Are different responses warranted given different contexts?)) etc.Also: while a variety of classroom activities can be effective, I didn't get much out of the role playing activities.",
    "I liked it. Teacher was very intelligent and understanding. Same for TA. Very interesting material presented in a variety of ways. Given a large amount of freedom on final project. Great.",
    "The class discussion was engaging, though I would have preferred more in the way of lectures. Though the total workload for this class was not bad, the number of assignments could be pared down."

    "Instructor: Jody Sindelar \u00a0Jody is a good lecturer, but is sometimes oblivious to the concerns of her students. For example, the week before spring break (which is a notoriously busy week for students) Jody assigned a significant group project that was to be presented in class on the Monday we returned from spring break. My group of 4 spent spring break in 3 different countries, and 4 vastly different time zones, which made the project far more of a frustration then a learning experience. Other groups ran into similar problems. Despite students conveying their concerns about the timing of the project, Jody's response was along the lines of \" well just make to get it done before leaving for break.\"",
    "Instructor: Jody Sindelar \u00a0Great teacher! Very accesible. Wish she had more classes.",
    "Instructor: Jody Sindelar \u00a0The instructor was very friendly and accessible. She could do more to facilitate discussion which involved more critical thinking as opposed to regurgitation (see above)",
    "Instructor: Jody Sindelar \u00a0She was great. One of the best at YSPH. Not perfect, obviously, but can't think of any way she'd be better off the top of my head.",
    "Instructor: Jody Sindelar \u00a0Dr. Sindelar worked hard to engage everyone in the class discussions. She provided useful feedback in developing final paper projects."

    "Qualitative. Underwhelming, and occasionally frustrating. Good topics, but poorly examined. Not hard work, but frequent and mostly unnecessary busy work. Class discussions have potential.",
    "This course discusses the facets of addiction with a slight take on the subject through the lens of economics. I would recommend this class if you are looking for a light workload and have some interest in the subject matter. However, if you are looking for a rigorous and challenging academic experience which stokes your intellectual curiosity, I would look elsewhere.",
    "Great class. Second best one I've had so far. Highly recommended.",
    "This course looks at the economics of several types of addictions, including drugs, alcohol, tobacco and obesity. It looks at the impacts and intervention options, and applies them to modern cases."
