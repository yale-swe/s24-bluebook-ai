   "comments": [
    "Take this course for a good understanding of Korea's history during the past 60 yrs.",
    "Going into this class, I was interested in Korea but really had no background (aside from the cursory glance you get at Korea in Gaddis's Cold War lecture). I learned SO MUCH. Prof. Cho is really nice and brings in a lot of current events--though this sometimes results in getting behind on the syllabus. He also injects some game theory, which I found fun but others found confusing. If you go to lecture and pay attention, it's pretty easy to get a good grade without a lot of additional effort.",
    "This is a great class if you're interested in learning about Korean Politics! I would highly recommend it to anyone as long as you are interested in focusing on this specific topic. Both the midterm and final were extremely short and not too difficult. Professor Cho is a really nice person and a great professor too!",
    "Definitely a course worth taking especially for those desiring to learn about the political, social, and economic history behind North and South Korea. Workload is manageable and engaging. Professor really knows the subject matter and is not a harsh grader. Do not let teaching style discourage you from taking the course.",
    "If you're interested in the Korean peninsula and want to learn beyond just headlines about North Korea, I think this is a great class. The discussion on democratization in South Korea may be overwhelming for some who haven't taken political science classes before.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student because I learnt a lot from it.",
    "Overall good, average, introductory course on Korean politics. If you're interested in just getting a general idea of Korea's political history (up to present day) like I was, then definitely take this course. It wasn't very engaging and a bit boring at times, but fine. The three main grades in this class are from the midterm, paper, and final. All of which, I thought, were fairly easy. The final is just like the midterm (though Prof. Cho says it's comprehensive, it really focuses more on post-midterm material)."
