    "Any student who wants to become involved in urban politics, whether as a politician or an expert\/advisor, should take this class. You'll learn about issues affecting cities and learn analytical approaches to understanding the city. You will read books detailing recent political movements and forces in San Francisco and New York that will challenge you to think about what we should do with our cities. You'll also read articles about reforming the police and rebuilding New Orleans. The material this course covers feels random sometimes but fits well together. You'll have a 2 pg dbl spaced reading analysis due every week, which isn't bad so long as you stay on top of the reading and get it done before Wednesday night. Some of the reading can be a bit dense and tedious, but nothing too bad.Professor Horan can be a little bit of a hard grader, but she's very available via email, office hours, or appointments. She's great at giving feedback for how to improve your work. She'll also review drafts of your essays before you turn them in, which is great!",
    "It's a study of why cities are the way they are and how they might be changed in the future.",
    "This is one of the best classes I've taken at Yale. It completely opened my eyes to a new way of looking at cities, economic development, taxes, services, and a number of other topics that I now realize I didn't actually understand all that well before. I think most of the reviews I've read from former years have been a bit histrionic about the level of difficulty. I'd say the class is challenging, but only in that you really can't half-ass it. The papers can't just be hammered out thoughtlessly the day before the deadline - you have to actually think about them in advance. Once you commit to doing this class, it's completely manageable and highly, highly worthwhile. Professor Horan is very nice and helpful - and while she can come off as serious and almost a bit intimidating on the first day of class, she is actually very laid-back and quite funny, in my experience. All in all, I would definitely recommend this one as long as you commit to it.",
    "PLSC 245 is a challenging but fulfilling course. It is exactly what it says it is about - urban politics and policy - and doesn't really overlap with a lot of other urban studies-type courses. There is a lot of reading and writing (with weekly reading responses and 2 very difficult papers), but it is not impossible to get through it. Professor Horan is great - she challenges students to think critically, and is also nurturing and very helpful. I would recommend this course to other students, but they must realize that the course really is about urban policy and analyzing how people write about it. Class discussions were usually pretty lively (especially given how boring some of the readings are) and thought-provoking (usually the 2 hours were not too painful). Take the course if you are willing to put in the work and you will learn a lot, and get extra help from Professor Horan if you need it.",
    "Great class, and covers important and under-served topics that you'll have difficulty learning about elsewhere. Professor Horan is really invested in the course, and you'll be glad you took her class. We had a pretty small group my year, which contributed to a relaxes and fun atmosphere. You're responsible for leading the class discussion for multiple weeks with some of your classmates, which is a great experience. The writing assignments were really difficult to understand and write, but those may change. Be sure that you're committed to doing the reading and writing well thought-out weekly analyses. Professor Horan doesn't accept mere reactions. Highly recommended."
