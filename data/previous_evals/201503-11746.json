    "Pretty basic upper level course. Be prepared for work and memorized conversations every day. Readings sorta dull but oh well.",
    "This is a very effective continuation of the Japanese language sequence at Yale. The readings are interesting and well chosen, and the discussions are good. At the start of each class we did shadowing exercises (kind of like CCs, but shorter and more practical), and I felt like my intonation improved as a result. I would generally like more conversation practice, but that can be hard to do in upper level language classes. The format of the homework is the same every night, and it becomes very repetitive. I was hoping there would be a decrease in homework relative to L3\/L4, but it still takes a significant amount of time to complete. There are kanji quizzes at the start of each class and three larger tests each semester. There is a final speech instead of a final exam, which is a nice way to end the semester.",
    "If you're looking to take this course, odds are that you are familiar with the way the department teaches Japanese. There are many elements that are similar to the previous levels. The course meets three times a week and has three *non-cumulative* tests, and a final speech (2 pages double spaced, not so bad). The tests are non-cumulative because if they were, it would be impossible to pass this class. By the end of the year, we learned 140 different kanji (with 4-5 compounds EACH), 142 grammar structures, and 120 additional vocabulary words. There are shadowings, which are similar to Core Conversations from L1-L3, but MUCH better. Each class starts with a short kanji quiz, and then shadowing recitation. There is a huge emphasis on the pronunciation and inflection\/intonation of the shadowing text, which I greatly appreciated because I felt it had not been stressed too much in the earlier levels (and is very important). The readings are pretty interesting. Some are better than others, some are way harder than others, but the sensei are always willing to meet with you to help out. There is also a weekly 30 minute individual session with a Japanese speaker where you're supposed to talk about specific things relating to the course, but we kind of just had fun talking about whatever we wanted! I don't feel like my Japanese got WAY better by taking this, but I feel like I definitely fought off the atrophy of not being in Japan. It is hard when you only have the class 3x a week, so go to language table every week.",
    "Yes, good course, good teachers, learn good manners."
