   "comments": [
    "Hmmm, I have mixed feelings about this class. Some weeks discussion was really good and interesting, other weeks it was bland. The reading was mostly theoretical\/academic journal stuff and sometimes hard to read if you aren't used to reading academic materials in the social sciences. Very much an academic political science kind of course, doesn't focus much on policy or application. Still, a lot of the material was interesting, great professor, and not too much work.",
    "Helpful to have significant background in international politics\/international conflict resolution\/conflict or post-conflict studies so you can really engage with the material, and have something fresh and informed to add to class discussions. Not too much reading. A few weeks in between required responses. Depends a lot on the people in class so feel it out for a good vibe and engaged classmates.",
    "Yes! While you'll never come to any final conclusions about violence\/conflict, the papers you read make you so much more knowledgable.",
    "YES. Fascinating questions, great readings, engaging discussions. Challenging concepts but very rewarding to immerse in this class. Professor Kocher is extremely knowledgable and leads discussion masterfully - he also has a great sense of humor that lightens the intensity of the discussion somewhat. Reading responses require time and effort but extremely reasonable length and the readings are very manageable. The class is a gem.",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone looking for a great Global Affairs seminar, especially for those who may be studying a different field but still find the subject to be interesting."
