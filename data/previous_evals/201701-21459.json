    "It's like FREN 140 on steroids. More reading, more writing, more talking with more specific oral, written, and grammar exercises.",
    "My French (especially pronunciation and writing) is certainly improved after this class. Our grammar work solidified some of the topics with which everyone can struggle from time to time (deciding whether to use an article or the determinative, for example, has always been difficult for me) and our discussions were very helpful and usually interesting."

    "Strengths: Wow, you definitely improve your French. It's a ton of work; it really should be a 1.5 credit course-- I did as much if not more work for this one credit than I did for my 1.5 credit language courses. Weakness: The weekly assignments are only announced the weekend before you have to begin them. Which really bothered me-- there was no way to work around a busy week or know what was going to happen during a week you knew you would be missing class. Even with the best time management skills, you wouldn't know how much work (and it's a lot of work) you would have to do each day.",
    "There seems to be more information about testing and grammar in particular during the sections lead by a professor rather than a teaching fellow. The readings are a little boring and feel outdated\/bland (especially relative to Diversit). The grading can be mildly confusing because the grade is split so many ways and it's never quite clear how it's specifically apportioned (plus there is no way to see your progress because Canvas isn't updated). The course is reasonably engaging and I certainly don't regret taking it."

    "Your French will definitely improve if you take this course. Just don't be deceived by the fact it is only worth one credit. I did as much, if not more, work for this class than for my 1.5 credit FREN 140 class. DO NOT BE FOOLED: if you want to do well in this course, you have to really apply yourself (at least as much as you would for 1.5 credits).",
    "Yes. You have to take F150 if you want to study additional French and you don't yet have the level. The class was enjoyable, and I definitely experienced significant personal growth."
