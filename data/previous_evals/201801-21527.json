   "question_text": "What knowledge, skills, and insights did you develop by taking this course?",
   "comments": [
    "I learned about the procedures and thought processes behind site-directed mutagenesis, protein purification, and enzyme kinetics.",
    "This course allowed me to better understand and develop skills in some of the most basic and important laboratory skills. I was a little nervous about taking the course considering my lack of experience beforehand, but now see that the course was very well set up to facilitate quick but thorough learning.",
    "A lot of knowledge of basic tactics used in a biology lab, including how to run gels, plate bacteria, run chromatography columns, analyze reactions based on absorbance data, and everything that goes into protein folding and activity.",
    "I improved IMMENSLY in my lab skills; I currently work in a lab and am doing a lot better there now. Got to practice writing lab notes. Became calmer and more confident in the lab. Got better at scientific writing.",
    "I learned how to do PCR, how to clone into vectors, how to assay for proteins of interest, how to run gel electrophoresis, how to lyse cells, how to purify proteins via affinity column chromatography, etc. Through this course, I've developed an appreciate for and background knowledge of various techniques used in microbiology and molecular biology.",
    "I learned how to function in a lab, something with which I was not previously experienced. This proved incredibly important and the skills learned would translate to most other lab settings. Particularly, I learned certain techniques used widely throughout biochemistry and biology labs, including PCR, gel electrophoresis, protein purification, and more. In addition to the lab techniques themselves, I learned how to work independently in a lab as well as seek help from those more experienced, as to follow proper techniques and learn more intimately how they work and why they're used for certain end goals for experimentation."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths: Drs. Pawashe and Konigsberg care a lot about the class, and it has a lot of utility for beginning to understand how different biochemical experiments work. I definitely learned a lot. Weaknesses: There seemed to be a discord between TA expectations and the expectations of the professors.",
    "A major strength is that the course is very fair - while it is a lot of work, if you put in a lot of effort, your work will be rewarded and you will do well. Also, both professors and the TA are extremely approachable, encouraging, friendly, and helpful, while also taking what they do seriously. It is however, very time consuming and a lot of work, which may makes it overwhelming or stressful at times. The quizzes in every single lab period were helpful in that they ensured students were fully prepared for and understood what they were doing in lab, but could also add up to be a lot when they required extra readings or to watch extra PBS documentaries. I wouldn't eliminate these, however, because I found the documentaries to be very interesting, important information to know, and a good supplement to the course material.",
    "The course is strong overall, I believe that Professor Pawashe is a very good, kind, and thoughtful instructor. Unfortunately, it seems as if Professor Koenigsberg is either unable or no longer able to deliver lectures in an understandable way. He did not give many lectures, but the lectures that he did give left the class lost, and required frequent clarifications and interventions by Professor Pawashe to help. Prof. Pawashe should either teach the class by herself or with the aide of an instructor who is more able to deliver content to the students in a coherent way.",
    "It was honestly a great course and while very hard for the half semester it was run in it was very effective.",
    "Strengths: - Very practical - Very well related to biochemistry concepts - Experiments have clearly been done a lot - Got to do cool things like look at DNA sequences - The practice problems were great for making sure that we understood the concepts of labs - Got a lot of help with writing the lab reports Weaknesses: - Class experiments seem old, if not outdated; consider doing something new and more relevant - The second lab report was a great way to practice my scientific writing, and the first paper was very difficult. Consider switching the two, so that students get to practice scientific writing with the easier paper and then get challenged by doing the harder paper. - Course handbook could use revision; I recommend looking it over and fixing the mistakes. - Could do better at explaining lab concepts. I had already taken Biochemistry I and II so I understood most everything, but there seemed to be a lot of students who didn't really understand the pre-lab lectures. - Modify the quiz questions. They were often hard to understand - Review and standardize the problem sets; they were extremely difficult to do, not because the concepts were difficult, but because the instructions and format were unclear. - In general, it often felt like documents in this class were not proofread, which caused much confusion",
    "I believe that the half-semester-long rendition of this course is optimal, because it allows fluidity between experiments and allows easier view of the bigger picture, relating to the projects themselves. Providing lab notebook is probably a great strength of this course, as it details all experiments with sufficient background information and explanation, with detailed and comprehensive procedures. Perhaps one weakness of the course is the timing of the lab reports-- one required much work over spring break."

   "comments": [
    "It's a twice\/week lab so OBVIOUSLY it's going to be a lot of work, and unfortunately lab 1 and lab 2 write-ups end up being due somewhat near each other. However the professors are happy to help and have extended deadlines for my class many times.",
    "I would definitely take this course if you are at all interested in research (especially in the MBB department). The techniques you learn are bound to show up somewhere. The lab reports are long but worth it. The quizzes are really specific, which means you have to study for them quite a bit. The thought process behind the quizzes makes sense, but if I had to change anything about the lab, it would be making the quizzes less specific.",
    "I would recommend the course to someone who wants to learn a lot and improve their laboratory skills, but would also warn them that they are going to need to take the course seriously and put in a lot of effort to stay on top of the workload and do well.",
    "Yes, great course, you really learn a lot and for most of the time it is very manageable, just the final 2 reports can be pretty tough.",
    "Sure! It's good for lab practice. Also, the instructors clearly listen to student feedback, so it's only getting better. If you want to learn about cloning (not necessarily with plasmids) and a bit about protein purification and a wee bit about enzyme activity, this class seems like a fair fit. It really is, if nothing else, a good foundation for lab work.",
    "You should take this course if you want a background of common techniques used in most modern day biology labs.",
    "I would definitely recommend the course, as it does function as a crash course in lab techniques and is well-facilitated. Also, I would not recommend missing the opportunity to learn from Aruna Pawashe. :)"
