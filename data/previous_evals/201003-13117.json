   "comments": [
    "Absolutely. Rawson is wonderful; the poet himself diminishes in power over the years but is such an important cultural force that it's great to feel one knows a great deal about him.",
    "I ended up hating Eliot, but not because the class was poorly taught. It would probably be more useful to a student that felt personally moved by Eliot's work. Take it if you're ready to be self-motivated about the reading. Don't if you need lots of assignments and individual attention.",
    "If you really like T.S. Eliot, then this class is perfectly suited for you. The reading assignments can be bafflingly huge as a warning.",
    "I wouldn't recommend the course to a fellow student because I felt that we didn't spend enough time on Eliot's major works and spent too much time either in badly controlled general discussion or discussing less famous works. There were also too many people in the class this time around.",
    "This was an enjoyable course, focusing on a fairly wide range of Eliot's work. The discussion was accessible and Professor Rawson is helpful and knowledgeable. Some of the class was fairly quiet and the conversation wasn't always really high-level, but I still got a fair amount out of it.",
    "English 449 is a discussion-based course on T.S. Eliot. Professor Rawson is a kind teacher and a great thinker. He gives his students a lot of freedom in and out of class. I left the course with a greater appreciation of Eliot.",
    "Yes, because the material is compelling enough on its own and the class was well-run, over all.",
    "I would highly recommend the course to a fellow student. Dr. Rawson is an excellent guide through the often difficult poetry and prose of Eliot.",
    "If you love Eliot, this is a wonderful way to read a lot of his works, from the early to the late poems."
