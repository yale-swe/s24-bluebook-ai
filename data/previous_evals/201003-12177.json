    "Lots of reading, great freedom with the paper. Take if you are interested in questions of free speech - the people in your class will make a huge difference in whether or not you enjoy the discussion.",
    "It's an intellectual history of free speech. I would only recommend it if you like that type of theoretical historical stuff.",
    "Yes: great readings, interesting discussions. Ambitious focus so obviously don't expect to cover everything, but very good grounding in key issues, thinkers, and misconceptions in free speechthought.",
    "Take this class if you are looking for a good junior seminar.",
    "Take the class. There's so much there to learn and Walton, especially, is very adept as forcing the issue of whether \"free speech is indeed free.\" Challenging intellectually, historically, and with engaging material and involved students.Good subject, surprising readings and good discussions led by a star in the making professor of history at Yale. In my view, this may be a course that will be talked about in years to come as a \"must take\" in undergraduate history.",
    "I would definitely not recommend this course. Discussions are empty and pointless, and the course isn't really historical--its more philosophy-dense, and not even interesting in that sense. Walton's a nice guy, but doesn't really care about his students or the structure\/quality of the course, evidenced by how many classes he missed.I'd take something else, especially considering how many good junior seminars there are."
