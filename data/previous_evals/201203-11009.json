    "The course material's great, and I would definitely recommend this course to anyone considering taking it.",
    "The course covers a fair amount of material at a quick pace and the work load is significant.",
    "This is a tough class when taught out of Atiyah Macdonald. The majority of the reward is in doing the exercises and if you complete it you will no doubt feel that you have a strong grasp of many important ideas - localization, flatness, finiteness conditions, and integral dependence. Take this class if you want to work hard, learn a lot and be pushed.",
    "I will recommend it to other students.",
    "Professor Payne makes this course interesting. I will recommend it.",
    "It's a challenging course for first year grad student because of the homework. But we can learn a lot of algebra.",
    "I would recommend it to another student."

   "comments": [
    "I took the course mainly to practice for the quals, and I felt it did help me understand the subject better, mostly due to the large amount of exercises and the geometric explanations.",
    "I feel that I have gained a lot of concreteness where I had only intuition earlier in algebraic geometry's local picture.",
    "The course would be helpful for my later research.",
    "It helps a lot.",
    "It is an important part of the math qualifying exam and it is also very important general mathematics that everyone should know."
