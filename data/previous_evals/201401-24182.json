    "A class covering an enormous breadth of material in which you have to work hard to do well. However, I could not recommend it more highly- if you can get in, take it.",
    "Take it!It will open your eyes to the world.",
    "Of course take GS. Although some students criticize the conservative edge that the class might have, this does not mean that there is nothing to learn from these professors and these fantastic texts. It's a group of engaging students discussing the practical implications of some of the best literature out there.",
    "I would highly recommend it, and I would urge the prospective student to arrive well-prepared for each class. The only times I was frustrated with the course was when the students weren't prepared to engage with the faculty and the texts.",
    "Heartily--this is one of the best courses at Yale, hands down.",
    "Grand Strategy is one of my classes \"about life.\" The actual utility of strategy to everyday events and even its applicability in decision making (particularly in the government) is debatable. But the importance of understanding what strategy is and how it works is essential. That essence is what Grand Strategy is really about, and that essence permeates every aspect of our professional lives.I would highly recommend Grand Strategy to any student, at any time, for that reason: we all (as members of a democracy) have an obligation to explore and understand the essential elements of our political world."

   "comments": [
    "I had never taken a strategy course and I'm not sure this one taught me about strategy specifically, but it did teach me a different way of looking at the world. All told, I really enjoyed it.",
    "Terrific, particularly for someone with a public service orientation and leadership experience.",
    "Grand Strategy, while not directly linked to my specific research, is a far-reaching and interdisciplinary (or \"ecological\" for Professor Gaddis) subject which challenges notions of what we know and boundaries of our understanding. This is useful in any endeavor in life. Sincerest thanks for the opportunity to study."
