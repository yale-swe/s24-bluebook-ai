   "comments": [
    "Being in lab and carrying out the protocol was actually really good (a lot better than the other labs I've taken).I appreciated that the class was also aligned closely to Genetics lecture course material - something I haven't found in a lot of labs I've taken before.Having said that, writing the actual lab reports (one every two weeks) was painful. It takes a lot of time, and it constantly makes you complain about how you put in a full credit's worth of work in a half credit lab!",
    "This is a very interesting and pretty laid-back lab. The lab reports are hard and graded very specifically, but this lab does a lot to clarify concepts introduced in class. Take it, its fun (except for counting Drosophila, that is not fun).",
    "Great lab. You actually learn a lot. Lab reports are challenging, but there are only 6 and you learn a lot.",
    "The lab reports were brutal. Don't take it if you don't need to.",
    "MCDB203L is a great intro bio lab with a fair workload. There are four quizzes spread out over the term and six lab reports due every otherweek.",
    "Overall, genetics lab was a good, fairly laid-back lab that provided an introduction to many basic genetic techniques and commonly used model organisms. I thought it gave me a better understanding of many of the concepts covered in genetics lecture. The workload is not unsubstantial though, there are 6 lab reports throughout the year and 4 pop quizzes during the lab sessions. I'd recommend it to another student if you're looking for a good bio lab,but just be prepared to spend hours and hours on your lab reports!",
    "Interesting, and not as much work each week as general chemistry lab",
    "The lab is good, but the class that you have to take to take this lab is brutal.",
    "It's a lab. You're probably taking it because you have to. If you don't have to take it... don't. Lab reports and quizzes are impossible to do well on.",
    "Really great teaching course, I felt like I learned a lot about how geneticists think and the methods and model organisms they might use, and I generally enjoyed going to lab. Professor Dawson and our TA were extremely knowledgeable and accessible, leading to a very chill atmosphere, although I was sometimes frustrated by the fact that as someone who had never taken a biology lab before, it felt almost impossible for me to do well because of all the experienced upperclassmen taking it as an easy lab. I did feel like my bio lab reporting skills improved, so hopefully I'll be better off for my next lab, whatever it is. If Sara is TA-ing next year, get her and get to know her!",
    "I would recommend this course for premeds who need to take a lab. This was a very good supplement to the genetics lecture course.",
    "I would recommend it, but the grading of the reports is hard to follow and your grade might not end up what you want it to be, regardless of your participation and knowledge in the lab itself.",
    "Interesting labs, write ups every other week",
    "MCDB 203L is a wonderful complement to MCDB 202. Taking the lab significantly enhanced my understanding of the concepts covered in the lecture course. The techniques covered in lab are those that are fundamental to understanding the basic principles of genetic investigations. The lab atmosphere itself is very relaxed. Although lab reports are only due every other week, they are extremely time consuming and really challenge you to think about the experiments that you perform. I undoubtedly spent more time on this lab course than I did on some of my full-credit courses. While the lab reports account for 80% of the grade, there are also four pop quizzes over the course of the semester worth 20% of the grade. Despite the time commitment, I am ultimately very happy with my decision to take the lab.",
    "Only if you are a Pre-Med student or MCDB major.",
    "Recommend as standard pre-med \/ bio lab. Once a week, average 2-3 hour lab, not crazy like electron-microscopy. Pretty lab-report intense and some concepts are hard to understand without reading or asking the instructor.",
    "I would recommend taking MCDB 120 lab before doing this lab, since that lab will better prepare you for this class. I also recommend taking it concurrently with the genetics class, so you are better suited to write up analysis of your results.",
    "I definitely learned more from Genetics lab than from the class itself, so I'd recommend it if you want to get a better handle on the material. It's not a bad class, too\u0097straightforward, and the instructors are good. The lab reports can be a lot of work, but probably if you don't start them the night before it's not as bad...",
    "This lab is very well structured; the labs themselves are interesting and fairly simple, and not too long; the lab reports are quite time consuming, but overall not a bad lab.",
    "Pretty painless lab. Never went till 5:00. The lab reports are sometimes a bit of a chore. More importantly, this lab was actually helpful for the lecture class, particularly the problems on the final. I actually think I understand genetics better because of lab--can you believe it?",
    "This is an interesting lab that covers a broad range of different types of genetic experiments. The weeks when lab reports are due are hell (there are 6 total), but the others are really easy. You don't really need to understand what's going on when you are actually in lab, just follow the directions. You can then synthesize all the concepts later when you are trying to write the lab report (although that may make life more difficult). Professor Dawson is pretty nice and gives decent pre-lab lectures. I would say take it if you have to or if you are interested in genetics, but not just for fun because the lab reports really do suck.",
    "This was a really interesting lab. Lab reports took a long time but they are only due every other week. Quizes were tricky.",
    "A fairly engaging lab, the reports are definitely tough and time consuming, especially with some of the trickier concepts. A great companion to the lecture course.",
    "I would recommend it to someone as a good bio lab course, especially if you don't enjoy being in labs where you need to get really good results- our interpretation of results was important, but the results we actually got didn't matter.",
    "Genetics lab is a lot of work, but it is a pretty good lab course. The labs are pretty interesting. The lab reports are long and hard, but they are spaced out so that they are every 2 weeks instead of every week, which is helpful.",
    "The course is a very interesting introduction to genetics from a lab perspective and has labs with the classic organisms such as fruit flies and yeast. It requires a lab report every other week. It is difficult to write in some respects since labs are spread out over several weeks and since the lab reports are free-form and essay-like. Expect to spend at least one full night writing the report. Grading depends on the TA, and since they're essay-like, you can't every really expect a perfect score like with other labs.",
    "A good lab!",
    "It is so bad!!!! Writing the lab reports sucked. You only have to write them every other week, but I would rather have taken a course that required weekly lab reports because these were such a pain to write.",
    "Good lab to help understand and apply the concepts learned in genetics lecture.",
    "Useful lab. Important topics. Solidifies knowledge from lecture."
