   "comments": [
    "The class mostly focuses on cash transfers as a development policy, and most of the readings revolve around where, why and how the policy has been implemented as well as around broader discourses about social protection. I think the main skill I gained was analyzing research and documents to see how certain ideas have been framed and presented, and how that reflects different ideologies.",
    "A deeper understanding of welfare policy through the lens of major international organizations.",
    "This class if definitely exactly as the course name suggests it is: a comparative approach to welfare policies around the world. Students gain knowledge about the welfare systems around the world, debates around such policies, the role of international organizations in the welfare policy-making process. However, it is very much limited to the countries that are being discussed as well as the major international organizations in the listed countries.",
    "I learnt A LOT about how international organizations work, and the details and politics and economics behind international development. It was very interesting! I learned how to analyze articles and media distributed by international organizations for their bias and motivations, and to take a critical approach, like an investigative detective, to understand what is really going on."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I think the strength of this course is Professor Seekings he's very knowledgeable about cash transfers and development policies as a whole, and is able to ensure that discussion remains interesting by asking thought-provoking questions. The only weakness I would mention is that the readings can be a little repetitive in the beginning of the course, as they all center around cash transfers. It might be helpful to discuss other developmental approaches more before narrowing the focus down.",
    "Strengths - The lectures\/class was very interesting! Professor Seekings is so knowledgeable and has so much experience and it's a privilege to take this class with him, especially as an undergraduate. He is also really kind and approachable, and going to his office hours was really helpful when I felt like I was struggling in the class. I really appreciated how he structured the class so we got many different perspectives from the articles we read and the discussion, so we could form our own opinions on different methods of economic development. He didn't push one perspective onto us, instead allowing for diversity of class opinions, and having class debates to try to understand the different perspectives surrounding international welfare (such as the ideology of the World Bank vs. the IMF). I learned so much about the underside of international development and how systems or structures are created, that isn't apparent from just learning about different countries' systems of welfare. I also learned how to be a critical thinker and to evaluate programs and organizations in an investigative way, and not just rely on the common narrative or perspective. Overall, it was a great class and I'm glad I took it! I also realized during this class that policy and politics isn't that personally interesting for me as a future field of study--but despite this, I'm saying I'm glad I took this class, and that it was very interesting and useful to me, which should say something about the class! Weaknesses - the lectures would benefit from being restructured. They sometimes got dry, and having class for nearly 2 hours straight could get very tiring and was too long. Having even a five minute break at the half-way mark would have been much appreciated, as there would be at many times a student or so falling asleep, not because it wasn't interesting, but just because the lectures\/discussion mixture would go on for too long. Some other ideas that could help include having a mixed media approach, or with different sections of the class, with greater student portions and greater lecture portions, and looking at more online media for example, just to change things up instead of having just one structure for an hour and 50 minutes. The articles also got to be sometimes dry, often saying similar things. We could have more group work with making a class page summarizing articles and types of welfare programs? Just a suggestion, that would also make for interesting cross-country comparisons and easier essay writing\/finding examples. Also, I didn't feel like we got enough feedback after the midterm essay; although the comments on the essay were comprehensive, it would have been nice to have spent sometime in class looking at each other's essays (after submitting them) and seeing different arguments or styles of writing. I also personally would have appreciated more time spent on the ethics of poverty and welfare; some time was spent on this, but discussing from a philosophical\/ethics perspective even more would have been interesting, and to compare the ethicalness of different approaches to poverty (World Bank\/IMF\/etc.)."

   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this course to any student interested in social protection (its history and its future) and in developing countries in general. While the emphasis of the class is definitely on the policies themselves, the latter part of the course focuses on policies in specific regions, which was really helpful in learning about different developing countries.",
    "The course is relatively interesting for someone who wants to understand how welfare and international organizations work, however it is not the most engaging or intellectually stimulating given the repetitive nature of discussions. However, it is a good way to familiarize yourself with the general welfare landscape and key debates within the field.",
    "Yes, if it is a topic interesting to them. Anyone who is interested in studying more about global neoliberalism, international economic development, the politics\/economics\/ethics of poverty and welfare, should definitely take this course!! It changed the way I see the world."
