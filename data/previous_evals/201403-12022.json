   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend taking this course if you're interested in social movements, particularly from an organizer's perspective. It forces you to take apart collective action and think about how each piece of the movement works. I think the class might be a little dull if you haven't been involved with social movements before, simply because everyone talks so much in class about the specific protests, boycotts, etc. they've participated in. Also, if you're an EP&E major, this is a great way to fulfill the social theory requirement. Finally, Professor Eyerman is great. He's really down to earth and just wants everyone to engage with the material. You can write your final paper on basically whatever you want and it's only 10-15 pages. There's not much work throughout the semester other than reading responses and a relaxed in-class essay for the midterm. He's a VERY fair grader.",
    "Yes. I would recommend this course. It gives a good introduction to social movements, centering heavily on the Civil Rights movement from the 1960s. The course provided further insights to sociological theories.",
    "The readings were really interesting, but I thought that the class discussions were pretty superficial.",
    "Social Movements is a great course if you're interested in the subject matter. In our class, almost everyone considered themselves members of social movements in one form or another, so a lot of discussion relates readings to people's experiences. The workload in terms of reading is lighter, but Ron makes discussions much richer than many other professors I've had. This isn't a complete history of social movements, but how they relate to Sociology. Much of the course is spent theorizing about how social movements begin, how they're structured, and how they change society. It provides context for movements within society, but also stays very relatable with the class discussions. It's a positive environment with a lot of material you can learn if you apply yourself. In terms of workload, we had readings plus an in-class midterm paper with a cool topic and a final paper on anything we considered related to the course topic.",
    "A great and highly relevant class with a very reasonable workload. I came away more capable to look a social movements of the past, and present, with a more critical eye and more complete vocabulary. Although the textbook readings can be dull, the additional weekly readings are fantastic, really enjoyable. Lots of freedom on the final paper seemed a bit daunting but ended up being a great thing.",
    "A class that I would definitely recommend. The course work is very manageable and the topics are interesting as well. Professor Eyerman tries to lead the discussion at times but also tries to limit his input so as to allow students to eventually lead the discussion.",
    "I would recommend the class to another student, especially if that person was interested in the theoretical aspects of sociology more than anything else."
