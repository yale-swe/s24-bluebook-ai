    "This is one of the best classes you will ever take at Yale (if you can get in).",
    "Great class. Take if you are interested in education or just policy and politics. Much better than traditional seminar.",
    "PLSC 240 is not a course, it is a way of life. Seriously. Well, almost seriously. This is the best course I have taken not only at Yale but ever, anywhere, any time. And I don't think it would be misguided to claim that this is one of the best, and probably even THE best course at Yale (along with 260). Why? Here's why:1) Professor Starr cares dearly about his students. The amount of time and attention he puts into this course is unparalleled. It shows. The class is superbly taught.2) There is a lot of work. Yes, this is a pro for the course. Partly because the things you're doing aren't contrived academic exercises but stimulating and applicable thought problems. The reading, of which there is a lot, is 100 percent worthwhile (Prof. Starr will excise a mere stray paragraph so to save you time if the author in question digresses).3) Class time is class time. Not a minute is wasted, which means class does not consist of just sitting around twiddling thumbs waiting for one's turn to speak. Prof. Starr structures seminar per a protocol he e-mails every morning before class that splits students into small groups where excellent conversations ensue. And part of the reason this works so well is because...4) Students are awesome. I was humbled to be around so many folks that have their act together. Everyone does the reading and their assignments so you always have to stay on yours toes to keep pace in study group and class, which is a wonderful. And as a consequence of these small group discussions you get to know every member of class (literally, everyone!). So the class gets tight which may or may not lead to PLSC 240 parties at the end of the year...",
    "Take the class if you can.",
    "Great class, greatest professor. Absolutely take it if you have a strong interest in the subject.",
    "Do you want to take a course in which you know that every page of the reading was carefully selected by a professor who will never waste your time? Do you want to take a course in which every minute of class time is scheduled so as to optimize your educational experience? Do you want to take a course in which some of the brightest minds at Yale work together to discuss the most pressing problems in education policy? If your answer is \"hell, yes!\" - and it damn well should be - then take Public Schools and Public Policy. It's one of the best courses at Yale University. Period.",
    "Take this class. You absolutely will not regret it. You will learn so much and have a great time.",
    "The best class in the entire political science department. Recommended if you can commit to the substantial workload.",
    "Yes it is one of the best courses you can take!",
    "This is an excellent in-depth exploration of policy creation and implementation in schools. Readings are hefty at 200 pages per week and there is a mandatory study group and weekly response papers. As much as you put in to the class, however, you will get in return. Professor Starr is brilliant at presenting challenging issues and leading thought-provoking discussions in class. The level of preparation for each class shows the care and passion he has for the topic. The material is on the cutting edge of policy and would feel relevant to anyone who takes the class, no matter their interests or backgrounds. You will learn more from your peers than in most other courses at Yale, and that makes it all the more exciting. Take this class if you possibly can!!",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student, but only if he or she is willing to devote him\/herself to the course. The workload is undeniably demanding, but is well worth the time. For the first time at Yale, I felt really proud of the work I produced in the course and was able to tell how significantly I grew both as a student and a person throughout the course. It was an amazing experience that no other course at Yale comes close to.",
    "Fan-tasticAnalyzing strengths and weaknesses is almost pointless as it is one of the best classes at Yale. People who are interested in it and prepared to do the work should apply.Strengths: incredibly organized professor, great readings hand-picked by professor and woven into casebook, long enough casebook that you feel like you understand the topic, place-based study so you're learning about something real, getting to know other students and solidfying knowledge of subject in study group, weekly responses keep you accountable and solidify knowledge while sharpening your writing skills, classes run like clockwork according to protocols created by the professor, tons of time talking and listening in small groups, very little listening to the professor, students reach actual conclusions, lends itself to students coming up with great paper topics, and professors' work ethic motivates you to follow through, oral midterm is a very satisfying experience, allows you to get a handle on a lot of material and then share some of it via give-and-take with the professor, the warmest, hardest working professor on campus.Weaknesses: long casebooks, sometimes slightly redundant, professor in New Haven only once\/week, only a semester long. sometimes you'll spend a lot of time on a topic you aren't interested in, and the course will not cover all possible topics. charter schools and home schooling receive the same amount of attention. no historical background on education if you're looking for that. there's lots more work, but its totally worth it. indeed, so enjoyable you hardly notice.The class is a real pleasure. The students and professor tend to be awesome, and by the end of the semester students form a real community. Generates not only knowledge but also friends.",
    "This is the best class at Yale. Take it if you can get in. The professor, John Bryan Starr, spends more time and effort on making this class as good as possible than any other teacher I've had. The students who are admitted to the class are some of the brightest and more interesting people around, and you will learn as much from them as from the weekly, 150+ page casebooks. Do not take this class if you're unwilling to do all the readings, write weekly reading responses, and meet in a study group weekly outside of class time. The peer pressure to work hard and come up with really smart ideas is enormous -- and can be overwhelming. This is a good thing.I cannot stress enough how great this class is for students who are willing to put in the work!",
    "Incredible course if you are at all interested in education and policy. The students are what make the course. Given how competitive admission is, you are bound to end up with the who's who of policy and political groups on campus which makes for really interesting discussion.This seminar creates a community of learners. This was the most rewarding course I have taken in my five years at Yale. I highly recommend taking this course. If I wasn't graduating, I would take PLSC 260 in the fall."
