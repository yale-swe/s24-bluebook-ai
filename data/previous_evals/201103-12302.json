    "I would definitely recommend this course. It does wonders for your grammar (starts on future tense) and there is some poetry and literature, which makes the learning much more interesting. Ayala is great, and while there is quite a bit of daily work, it's never too difficult.",
    "Take it with Ayala! She's the best.",
    "Yes! We learned so much Hebrew and the class was enjoyable!",
    "Take Hebrew with Ayala!",
    "Its definitely more work than L1 and L2 but it's doable. She expects a lot on te home works and they are often annoying and don't feel like they help you lean. The test are fair though, and the class itself is good.",
    "I imagine this class was like any lower-level language course: lots of little assignments, some grammar, some stories\/songs. There was a lot less vocabulary than I thought there would be, and an emphasis on writing. The tests aren't difficult and the presentations are few and more than manageable. We reviewed the past tense for a large portion of the semester and then almost finished the future tense, and we also reviewed some other grammatical constructions. We did a lot of different things each day, so the class didn't drag on and on. Overall, it was an alright course."
