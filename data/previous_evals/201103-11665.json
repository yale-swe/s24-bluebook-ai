   "comments": [
    "I would recommend it! Take the seminar rather than the lecture. The grading can be harder, but you learn so much more.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. I liked the size and structure of the class. I would summarize the class as a discussion. It is not a class where lectures involve coping down powerpoint slides. Everything is explained and written on the board.",
    "It's a good class, but it's fairly difficult. Try to get into this (the seminar) rather than the lecture, as that is supposed to be a more painful experience. Professors Simons and Koker are both very good. I'd recommend it. It might not be your favorite class of the semester, but you will probably learn a lot, and it's a pre-req for a lot of other classes. Also, it's really easy to fall behind on readings or do the p-sets without fully learning the material, but try not to get lazy, because the final is hard.",
    "My experience was so-so, but you might have a great time! I am definitely taking more economics courses after this one, but not necessarily because I had an exceptional time in this course. But if you have any interest in economics at all, take this course! You'll come out having a more realistic world-view.",
    "I would recommend the course to another student. Although the problem sets are tedious and difficult, they definitely cover the important information for the class and get you to understand it. Simons lectures were very good summaries of the readings, and when she does examples, you really come to understand to material. Sometimes the lectures can drag on, but they are important for the midterm and final because they cover mainly what was covered in class, specifically the types of examples. Both the midterm and final are hard, but the curve helps and with some studying and the review sessions you will be fine.",
    "If you are not dedicated to Econ, I suggest just taking the lecture. The curve is better in the lecture and I'd assume it is a similar course with less calculus-based material. Also, there is no grade for class participation in the seminar, so that makes it even more like the lecture.",
    "I would definitely recommend it. The fact that it's a seminar makes it better. Compared to other students taking the lecture (Econ 115), I believe my level of understanding was better.",
    "The microeconomics seminar is similar to a small lecture hall class.",
    "Economics 110 is a hard class. There is a lot of textbook reading and self teaching. A lot of your grade depends on the exams. If you don't stay on top of your work, its easy to fall behind and do badly.",
    "I think it's a good course for everyone to take, regardless of major",
    "Econ 110 is a fast pace course in micro economics that covers a wide range of topics in depth. I would recommend it to another student as long as the student is willing to put in the work. Doing the reading for Econ 110 is very helpful!",
    "I would recommend this course to others, because it was an interesting class that i did enjoy. It had a math portion to it with real world mixed in.",
