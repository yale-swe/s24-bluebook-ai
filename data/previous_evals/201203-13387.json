   "comments": [
    "I would strongly recommend this course to other students, because it is essential for English-types who want to begin to explore the nuances of reading and writing, but also helps form a really strong base in reading and writing for those students who intend to major outside of the English department.",
    "If you're interested in getting better at writing, take the course. It's a lot of work (writing exercises, readings, essays, peer evaluations), but I think it's worth it.",
    "Yes, but take caution. ENGL 120 is a LOT of work and it can be very time consuming. Deming is amazing and great, but the writing can be tough. Either way, in the end, I got a lot out of it, but it was quite a struggle the whole way through.",
    "I would highly recommend this course. You come away such a better writer, and reader, that it's so beneficial for the rest of your Yale career. It's a lot of work, but well worth it. Don't take this class if you don't want to write - you do a lot of it, but most people in the class were taking it to simply improve, and get better. It was my best class so far at Yale.",
    "I recommend this class-- I think I grew a lot in my writing. I also learned a lot from having to edit and find what could be improved in classmates' essays. I enjoyed the readings, but I didn't enjoy the in-class discussions because I didn't feel like we ever got anywhere and Deming is intimidating. On the other hand, he gives really great feedback on essays (you peer edit the first draft and then turn in all your drafts to Deming in the end and he grades you).",
    "It's a ton of work (basically an essay every week -- either rough draft or revisions for the final) but Professor Deming is brilliant. He brings reading and writing to a new level. However, he is demanding and does not really create a comfortable class atmosphere. Be prepared to be constantly challenged.",
    "Definitely a rewarding writing class. Deming is challenging; you have to stay on your toes during class, as he randomly calls on people and grades our essays rather meticulously.But we read a selection of truly profound passages, and my writing has improved so much. I now look at language in a whole other way.",
    "great first English course at Yale that forces you to think hard about what you're reading and what you're writing about. definitely take it with Deming",
    "I would highly recommend taking English 120, especially with Professor Deming. I'm definitely not an English person, but I wanted to work on my writing and English 120 was a great opportunity to do so. The class is a lot of work -- even more than it may initially appear from the syllabus. In addition to the five 5-6page essays you write over the course of the semester, you also have a number of writing exercises, five 2-page critiques of other peoples' essays, and a 2-page cover letter per essay. However, I think all the writing is worth it. The readings are also great, and I consistently looked forward to class discussions every week.",
    "I would highly recommend English 120 02 to another student. I was not particularly invested in English courses, as I have no intention of pursuing or majoring in the English language, however I learned more than I could have hoped to imagine throughout the semester.",
    "Take English 120 except not with Deming. Deming is hard, but that's not why I say don't take it with him. Don't take Engl 120 with Deming because he's also, I think, unhelpful in developing student writing. His hubristic manner of giving seminar deterred class conversation."
