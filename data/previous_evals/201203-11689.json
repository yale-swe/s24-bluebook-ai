   "comments": [
    "Wonderful course, but a lot of effort. If you're interested in neuro, you have to take this for sure. But there is an amazing amount of material covered, so do not EVER let yourself fall behind. Exams are tough, but I think grading is reasonable. One of the most rewarding classes I've taken at Yale.",
    "The material gets interesting towards the end. Its a really hard class, the exams are difficult and the curve is brutal.",
    "Good intro to Neurobiology. So much material to cover, but if you're interested in Neuroscience, you'll enjoy it!",
    "I don't think I have ever taken a course at Yale with more fascinating content than neurobiology. However, the professors were the kind of very talented researchers that care very little about the undergrads they teach that characterize Yale science courses. The exams were absolutely brutal, and they were so problem solving-dependent that an extremely thorough understanding of the material did not mean you would do well by any means. This course was so stressful because of the grading that I sincerely regret taking it. Only take this course if you meet two conditions: 1) you want to learn an immense amount of valuable and in-depth neurobiology material (not just biology in general), and 2) you are willing to work every single day studying the couse material. Seriously, the exams in this course are so intense that you need to be putting in constant effort into the class to do even moderately well.",
    "If you're looking for an easy A, this is NOT the class for you. I took it, expecting to get a more memorization based class, but they really look for you to integrate your knowledge and apply it, so that absolutely threw me off.",
    "A very difficult bio class, but I thought I learned a ton. It was a lot of studying for the two midterms and the final, but it was all very interesting things. I just wish I could've actually had the time to digest it and really appreciate how awesome the human neural system is.",
    "Not coming from a science background, I started off way behind the other students. I also probably finished behind the other students, but it provided me a great chance to learn about neurobiology. If you're not a science major, take credit d. Had I not, it would have been a scary experience.",
    "Neurobio is a good course. The exams are very challenging, but the material is very interesting. The first half of the course teaches you the basics of action potential propagation and ion channel physiology, which becomes essential for understanding the mechanisms ofthe more complicated systems discussed in the latter half of the course. There is also a middle section dealing with the early development of the nervous system taught by Weimin Zhong, who is very intense. Overall I woud recommend the course, but it is definitely not one of the easier MCDB electives out there. Definitely take it if you are interested in the neurobiology track, since it is basically the only core requirement for that.",
    "It was a great class. There's a lot of material and the lectures sometimes are hard to follow. I would advise typing notes on a laptop while drawing diagrams on a notebook. The exams are tough but fair.",
    "Overall, an above-average Yale course. You're definitely going to want to have taken your year of physics already, and the class isn't as organized as it could be, but I walked out satisfied with the class and what I had learned about neurophysiology. I have a better idea of thebrain at a cellular level rather than a systems level, which may or may not be ideal, but I appreciated the class. Oh, and don't worry too much about the textbook.",
    "This was far and away the best and hardest course I took this semester. It covered an enormous amount of material, but fortunately almost all of the material was awesome and mind-boggling.For the first month, Forscher will teach you about basic electrophysiology, action potentials, synapses, experimental methods, etc. I found this to be very hard, and I actually received my worst grade ever on his first midterm. It's easy to let yourself fall behind, to the point where lectures don't make any sense whatsoever, so don't let this happen. This is one course where it's really critical to do all the readings before you come to class. Also, memorize the name of every single toxin Forscher mentions in class; chances are, he'll test you about the mechanisms of various toxins without telling you anything other their names. I only started to love the course when Keshishian took over. For his section too, it's really important to read the textbook or his lecture notes before coming in, otherwise you will sometimes be totally lost. I used to think biology was sort of lame, and this course has completely changed my mind.",
    "pretty interesting material, study stuff covered in lectures\/notes, don't worry about the book, try to pay attention in class",
    "It's a really difficult course. Paul Forscher's half of the course is rather daunting, since it's not entirely clear what you'll be quizzed on for the midterm and final. There's a lot of material to learn, and you never quite know what you'll be quizzed on. Beware of intense pre-meds and obnoxious grad students in your class.",
    "Interesting course but very hard and not well organized. Only 2 midterms and a final but there is a ton on material and reading. Would only recommed it if your willing to put in a lot of time and effort. They don't tell you much about what will be tested and don't provide many problem sets. You do learn a lot if you put in the work",
    "Neurobio is hard. But its fascinating.",
    "Neurobiology is an interesting course - especially the second half of it that is more system and pathology oriented. In my opinion, it really did get better as we went along, but make sure you understand the material from the beginning of the course well and early.",
    "You should have cell bio beforehand. Otherwise you will struggle. Besides that, this was a great class. The professors are great, and the material is interesting. The midterms\/final are tough, though the second midterm was decidedly easier than the first. Your entire grade is based on two midterms and a final.",
    "You will never understand the brain if you don't understand the fundamental biology of neurons. Take this class. I am looking at you,Psych majors on the neuroscience track."
