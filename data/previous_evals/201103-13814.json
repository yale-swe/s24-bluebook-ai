    "There is no way to give a good summary of what the class is like, because the they are constantly changing as they try to make the Arabic department not suck. My friends in L1 now had a very different class than my L1, and that is sure to be true as they go through L2 and L3. You can never guess what you are going to get with the Arabic department. Whatever it is, its going to be at least a little bit shitty. But hopefully, its getting less and less shitty.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone who has started in the first year, however it's difficult to say what the course will look like in future years as I'm sure Shady will not be teaching it (he is the department head). The Arabic department itself seems to be in a bit of a transition period and is rather unorganized, that can make the course frustrating at times if you are a diligent planner.",
    "Much better than L1\/L2 but ONLY if you get Shady. Shady is the man, Aziz sucked.",
    "Arabic 130 is a lot more comprehensive than the previous levels. There is more speaking and writing, though not as much reading. I feel that it was during this course that my understanding of the language has really started to click.",
    "Don't take this class. It was better than L2, but that's really not saying much of anything.",
    "Unless shady is teaching the class, DON'T TAKE IT.",
    "This class is a lot of work, and if you aren't willing to put in the effort, don't take the class. Also pay close attention to who is instructing the class. Certain instructors (Sarab, Shady, Hasmik) are excellent but others are far more... variable."
