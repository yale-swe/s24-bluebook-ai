    "BEST class I've taken at Yale thus far. The syllabus is absolutely amazing and Dean Mahurin is even more inspiring. You have to read a book a week but it's honestly the most rewarding course and I've learned so much. Dean really pushes you to become a better thinker, highly recommend.",
    "Best",
    "MUST TAKE. This is definitely the best class I've taken at Yale.",
    "Easily one of the best seminars I've taken in 4 years at Yale. These books are incredible and importanta chronological syllabus from the 1880s to the 2010s spanning four literary genres (nonfiction, fiction, poetry, drama). Weekly student presentations, two short papers, and a final exam. There is so much to learn just from reading these books, but the rich class discussions made each one a gift. Dean Mahurin is the best, just the best. You're in for a treat if you take a class with her.",
    "It's great! Discussions are wonderful, books are amazing. Be aware though: THIS IS A LITERATURE COURSE despite only being listed as Afam\/American Studies. The bulk of the work and grading is analyzing and writing about fictional writing; the writing just happens to all be 1) relevant to the black south and 2) genius. 10\/10 would recommend, no matter what your major. & do all the reading.",
    "AFAM 120 is a must take class. It is a class that will broaden your perspective and lead to long-term success. The skills learned in this class are definitely transferable. A greater appreciation for literature and a better understanding of race, gender, class, and religious aspects of the American South are the nice goodies that one can add to their knapsack from taking this class. Additionally, Professor Mahurin is one tough, honest and loving professor. If you're wanting a great experience with a professor, this class is a must take!",
    "Yes I would recommend, a great class. Yale needs more classes like this.",
    "Great class on literature of the Black South. Syllabus is exceptional & will feel like you're reading for leisure rather than work. Crafting papers will become fun as you write about something that interests you. Would recommend!",
    "This is one of the greatest intellectual experiences I've ever had. The only way to make this class better would be to make it last all four years."
