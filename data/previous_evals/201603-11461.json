   "comments": [
    "Got much better at problem solving",
    "I gained a more extensive and deep knowledge of classical mechanics and a broad knowledge of topics in simple harmonics, waves and thermodynamics.",
    "This class does a very solid job of covering all the basics of mechanics, relativity, and thermodynamics. I feel prepared for future classes in the mechanical engineering track after having taken this class.",
    "I got a solid understanding of many important concepts in physics, and with this strong foundation I was and am able to apply them effectively in a wide variety of situations.",
    "Although we learned a lot of physics this past semester, I'm not really sure what I have developed. I had seen the material in the past, and despite it being more thoroughly taught in more depth, the poor quality of instruction made it difficult to understand.",
    "Lots of problem solving strategies, good survey course of mechanics, relativity, and a little thermodynamics. I also think this course helped me learn a lot of good study skills.",
    "Physics. Just Physics. Perhaps a stronger focus on calculus in physics would have been nice.",
    "I learned a lot about physics subjects. We focused more on problem solving then on the derivations behind our methods, but pretty much covered all the derivations",
    "I learned how to approach complicated problem solving problems related to mechanics.",
    "I learned a lot of new physics concepts and mathematical skills to accompany them.",
    "I became more curious about nature and why things are the way they are. I was very sad this semester for various reasons so was not able to put much effort into my studies as I usually do. But I appreciated the class.",
    "This course was very rigorous. We learned all of classical Newtonian mechanics, as well as relativity, damped oscillators, heat, and thermodynamics. This class made me a better critical thinker and problem solver.",
    "Problem solving skills",
    "I now have a much more solid and broader background in fundamental physics topics like mechanics and have been introduced to new topics like relativity.",
    "I learned both skills specific to physics as well as critical thinking and problem solving skills in general.",
    "I learned a lot about physics and mechanics, specifically in the areas of thermodynamics and relativity.",
    "This course helped me develop slightly more mathematical instincts for solving difficult physical and abstract problems. I liked the emphasis on using variables, and on checking one's solutions to fairly obscure problems by plugging in limiting values (eg, two masses of m and M are suspended on either side of a (massless) disc, what's the acceleration...and in your answer, as one of the masses approaches zero you should get just the acceleration of the other mass). Also Shankar's lectures are very clear and I feel like I understand oscillations and relativity much better than ever before.",
    "I learned many physics skills and built on to what I already knew, and I also developed problem solving skills.",
    "I learned how to use mathematical concepts in physics perspective. .",
    "I wish I had developed better problem solving\/conceptual skills. The first half of the course was great, but the second half felt like a bunch of disparate ideas that we got a tiny taste of. I don't feel like I came out knowing that much more than when I started",
    "This course covers what the description says it does. We go over problems in class, and develops our abilities to solve physics problems.",
    "I learned a great deal about how the physical world works, as well as picking up various problem-solving skills. It was much more in-depth learning wise, as well as more difficult, than my physics C class in high school.",
    "I felt like I learned a lot about physics - especially subjects I had never studied like relativity and four momentum.",
    "I learned about problem solving skills and expanded on my physics knowledge to include multivariable calculus",
    "I gained a better grasp of physics on the survey of topics discussed in class, and I have developed new methods for solving problems and tackling issues with quantitative reasoning.",
    "In this course, I learned how to solve problems regarding Newtonian mechanics, special relativity, oscillations, waves, and heat\/gases. I learned to solve these problems at a table with a group of other students (who I got to know for the rest of the semester).",
    "I definitely learned more about applying theoretical physical ideas to semi-ideal real-world situations, and I also feel as though I am more able to analyze those situations in a dynamic, calculus-based way.",
    "PHYS 200 provides a clear and compelling introduction to mechanics, relativity, and some thermodynamics. The course aways took steps past basic analysis and the realm into comprehensive explanations while making suggestions as to various areas of further study. Nonetheless, the width of the syllabus requires a steady clip through topics and no single topic became overly involved. For physics majors, I imagine PHYS 200 offers a steady foundation that will prove invaluable in later courses. For myself (a non-physics major who was fulfilling a science credit and maintains an interest in physics), I now feel conversant in the fundamentals of the modern field and prepared to use its basic methods as necessary. Certainly, the course prides itself on promoting problem solving, particularly collaborative problem solving. The format is designed to this end. The course entails ample time in a group setting and a stream of problems for the group to solve. Currently the physics department is conducting a study on what instruction methods best promote knowledge acquisition, problem solving skills, and collaborative thinking. I, like many, will be interested in the findings of this study in relation to PHYS 200."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths - material is very engaging Reverse classroom is nice Weaknesses - People aren't forced to do that much work, so it is possible to not really know what's going on then you're in trouble for the midterm\/final",
    "It's a flipped classroom, so that style works well for some people and not at all well for others. I think having short lectures in class before breaking out and doing problems was really helpful for everyone.",
    "Watching the lectures at home was helpful so I could watch at my speed and rewatch sections, but class time wasn't always spent very efficiently.",
    "I enjoyed the flipped classroom format. Being able to solve problems in class was useful. I could watch lectures at home and get a feel for the concepts then try to apply them in class with help from the professors and my classmates. I wish this class had distributed the testing a little more. I just felt that too much of the final grade rested on the midterm and final exam. The biggest weakness is that the solutions to in class problems posted on canvas are oftentimes unclear and hard to follow.",
    "The course was great overall. I have no major improvements to suggest.",
    "The online lectures are very well put together and are clear in their explanations of various topics. However, the flipped classroom experience is awful. Frankly, it seems that it was put in place because the instructors do not know the material as well as Shankar does. The problem sets are far too difficult for what we are actually being taught and any confusion is not helped by the instructors. It could be improved by reverting back to lectures in class and by reinstating Shankar as a lecturer of the course.\/",
    "This class is amazing-- by far my favorite class that I took this semester. It is really hard, but there are so many support systems in place. It's a flipped classroom, so you can really take your time and rewind the lectures if you don't understand something the first time. Then you can ask any lingering questions when you go to class. In class you work on problems that the teachers put together, and these problems are a very good representation of the types of things you would be expected to be able to do with the material (eg on an exam). The teachers are amazing, especially Professor Caines. She is super clear and super inspirational! Also the TAs are clutch, especially Anthony and Volodymyr. I would highly recommend going the the study halls and office hours, because there are so many people who are so happy to help you, and they realize how hard the class is. I'd say the biggest weakness of the class is that it just moves way too fast. You have to really keep up with it on your own, and this class is a huge time commitment. Also, in lecture 17-18 about oscillatory motion, Shankar rushes through it in the first lecture, realizes that he went to fast, and then recaps it in the second lecture. I think that these two lectures should be re-recorded so that it moves slower over a span of two lectures, so that rather than rushing and doing it twice, it is done well and thoroughly once.",
    "The flipped classroom really disincentives students from coming to class. The combination of psets AND lectures to be seen at home makes coming to class also severely irrelevant for performance in the class. Either evaluate the problems done in class (i.e. complete problem sets in class) or just do simple style. There is also a great variation between that which is taught in the video lecture and that which is then assessed.",
    "I think the difficulty level of material covered in class and problem sets was perfect. However, the flipped classroom format was difficult to work with.",
    "I think less of an emphasis on watching lectures at home would have helped me learn more. I always felt much better about the material after a professor had talked through it in class.",
    "The flipped classroom setup was one of the strengths of this class because it gave us time to work on problems with the help of professors. Watching the lectures outside of class was a little difficult to keep up with, it's a lot better than spending class time on lecture and not having as much exposure to different sorts of physics problems. Exam prep was also well-executed; we had a practice exam in class before our midterm and final.",
    "I would have preferred a lecture rather than online lectures and then in-class problem solving.",
    "The flipped classroom isn't a terrible idea in theory, but in practice it is not super well executed. For example, Shankar's lectures\/curriculum did not directly match up with the curriculum we were following or the content we were expected to know for examination purposes, and so this disconnect was very frustrating and confusing.",
    "Taught somewhat disorganized, much of the in class lectures felt like repeats of the video lectures. Maybe it's just personal choice, but I didn't like the flipped classroom setup because of this. The lectures themselves seemed disorganized as well. although the practice problems were helpful, I thought I could get as much from doing th problems alone at home with the answers to check afterward.",
    "The study halls are a great strength as is the in-class problem solving setup. The lectures are kind of hard to learn on your own outside of class but the in-class lectures help solidify the concepts.",
    "The course is very strong in all areas.",
    "The flipped classroom was not an effective teaching method.",
    "I did not like the 'flipped' element of this course. By forcing us to learn on our own outside of class, it was harder and less efficient to learn. It also dramatically increased our out-of-class workload.",
    "I enjoyed the course overall, despite it being a fairly continuous work-load. I don't think the exams always matched the in-class and problem-set work very well, but that's about my only complaint.",
    "I found that the \"flipped classroom\" wasn't too terrible, but I think that there shouldn't have been more checks to make sure that students understood the lectures and the chapters in the book.",
    "flipped is great, but class time should actually be spent on more time problem solving and less time having to reexplain things that should have been known from watching lectures. shankar's lectures\/textbook aren't really helpful. (conceptual or problem solving)",
    "I really liked the way class sessions would run. My table worked well together, and I enjoyed having the same group to work on problems each week. I also liked how we went over key concepts at the beginning of class. One thing I wish we'd done differently would be doing more basic conceptual questions for each unit, before jumping into complex calculations. I also wish we'd spent more time on the conceptual part of relativity.",
    "I really enjoyed this course. It was a little bit hard to get used to at first because of the flipped classroom style but I think we learned quickly how to do well in the class.",
    "I personally did not like the flipped classroom format, but I think that is a matter of personal preference. I felt like the class lectures were not really connected to the Shankar lectures.",
    "I felt like this course worked well when the topics were slightly easier, but once we got to challenging topics there was too much of a jump between the problems we solved and the information we were given. Instead of having some intermediate problems, we went from very basic problems to ones so confusing we did not know where to start and ultimately would just ask a teacher to solve it",
    "One of the course's strengths was the variety of ways that students could get help\/feedback from teachers\/TAs. I was very grateful for different avenues like the study halls and Piazza. One weakness was the only minor review we did in class on the material before jumping into problems. I understand that the discussion of material is really meant to be only a review, but if we are at all confused it can render the class-time useless.",
    "The strengths of the course lay almost completely with the online lectures: Shankar is a fantastic lecturer, very entertaining, and very informative. Shankar's book prepared me for the exams more than anything else. As for the class itself, I found the structure to be unfulfilling. Because the classroom was flipped and there were a reasonable number of students in the class, I did not form any connections with the professors or the teaching fellows that enabled me to always find someone to ask for advice or for help in learning the material. We were told that we could either watch the lectures or just read the accompanying textbook, but the midterm and final proved that the lectures were in fact not adequate (there were things not in the lectures, but in the textbook, that we were required to know and in fact did not go over in class). Lastly, we were supposed to work on challenging problems during the class period, but in reality we were given rather simple problems to work on in groups, resulting in substantial time sitting around and waiting (as the class could only move as quickly as the slowest group). I also found that the instructors did not have good demonstrations or explanations ready about the material, and this often left very important questions unexplained. All in all, I feel as though this was a poorly coordinated course that had the potential to be much more.",
    "The strengths of this course are that, in its flipped classroom setup, there are TV screens and whiteboards lining the entire room as well as a TA that walks around to help your table out with problems. Also, Study Hall on Wednesdays proved to be a major lifesaver. The weaknesses for this course, I believe, is that upon answering questions incorrectly during the lecture quizzes, it does not tell you why that answer is wrong; only if you get the answer right will it tell you why it's right...which can be redundant. Also, the professors sometimes tended to speed through problems in class which may have confused some students. The midterm also did not mirror the difficulty of the problem sets (or the candor of the problems) which confused a lot of people.",
    "I feel as though the course was not fully taught in a flipped-class style; instead, it was more of a homework and then a lecture review session with a couple of problems added in. I think that if it was more focused on problem solving, with perhaps more organized office hours (though as I never attended I cannot speak to their organization) then I feel that the class would be more truly \"flipped\" and also more effective.",
    "My response would be best divided into material and format. The course material seems entirely appropriate. The syllabus moves deftly through the founding principles of physics. It maintains coherence, fluidity, and well-thought-out organization. The material also strikes a balance by being more in-depth and perhaps more interesting than the standard physics option (PHYS 180) but by including a bit more breathing room than intensive physics (PHYS 260). Meanwhile, PHYS 200 has all of the often-discussed strengths and weakness of an introductory survey course. The more striking case of strengths and weakness are from the flipped format. The strengths are flexibility in deciding when you want to learn a new lesson (although class times are fixed), the ability to review material often, and the numerous opportunities to ask peers, teaching fellows, or instructors questions. It goes without saying that the burden of responsibility to stay current in the online lectures falls on the student, but the main weakness might be consistently insuring class time is used well. There also is the faint feeling that the instruction has been pre-packaged is now being delivered piece by piece. (It's a striking contrast to an adapting seminar discussion.) Yet the good news is that the course has the feeling of any rough edges being rounded off by successive teachings. And, in all fairness, the path of introductory physics is well-worn for good reasons. There would be two small suggestions for improvement. First, while the problem sets aways seemed bespoke to the course material, the small reading quizzes sometimes seemed to miss the mark. Some didn't correspond particularly well with what was in a particular lecture and sometimes their over simplistic approach was confusing. The second suggestion would be to incorporate more demonstrations. Since students are watching the lectures outside of class, there appear to be plenty of time to add some small activities and still have an hour of group problem solving. (Such demonstrations might be more useful than the short material reviews.) Maybe too often an instructor would mention that there would be an interesting demonstration to be made if the materials were in the TEAL classroom."

    "Only if they are extremely interested in Physics and like learning physics for the sake of learning physics",
    "I'd recommend it if you are okay with a flipped classroom. I thought the material was interesting and the class engaging, but a flipped setting is not for everyone.",
    "Yes, if you want to take future physics courses, but it isn't the most engaging class in itself.",
    "Most students who take this class do so as a major requirement. I would recommend this class to a student interested in physics, but not taking it as a course requirement. I would warn them though that it is rather challenging if physics is not a high interest.",
    "This course is very good and very effective, and it is challenging in a good way. If you're looking to get a very strong background in introductory physics, then this course is a great and interesting means to do it.",
    "No, I would not. I instead would recommend that they take PHYS 260 or 180 because it is lecture-based.",
    "I would highly recommend it, but just know that this class is really hard. (I took it never having done Physics with calculus before, only IB SL Physics, so it can also depend on what you've seen before) It's a requirement for many people, so if you have to take an intro physics, I'd recommend this one. I personally loved it, but I know people who didn't. It's a flipped classroom, so you can really take your time and rewind the lectures if you don't understand something the first time. Then you can ask any lingering questions when you go to class. In class you work on problems that the teachers put together, and these problems are a very good representation of the types of things you would be expected to be able to do with the material (eg on an exam).

I would highly recommend going the the study halls and office hours, because there are so many people who are so happy to help you, and they realize how hard the class is. Don't be afraid to ask questions in or out of class. So in summary I'd say depends it's a super hard class with lots of great support systems in place to help you through.",
    "Take either 180 or 260. If you cannot, then take this class with the knowledge that going to class itself will be very much like going to an optional section for any other lecture class.",
    "No",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student. While not everyone likes the flipped classroom model, it worked out well for me. I liked that we had so much time to work on problems with the help of professors. Watching the lectures outside of class can be difficult to keep up with sometimes, but I think it's worth it. It's a lot better than spending class time on lecture and not having as much exposure to different sorts of physics problems. It makes the problem sets go a lot more smoothly as well. I think I learned how to approach problems better than I would have in a traditional lecture setting.",
    "I would recommend this course in terms of content, but in terms of organization and execution, it was quite lacking. I'd say if you want to be a physics\/engineering major and you have some decent background in physics, you kind of have to take this class.",
    "If you can get used to the somewhat unorganized format, it's a good class for problem solving skill development and a little bit of physics learning. Don't have too high expectations for deep physics learning.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone with a good background in mechanics or lots of motivation to work hard!",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class to anyone. The material is extremeley interesting and the instructors are great. The psets are difficult but the TAs will guide you through them at office hours and make sure you understand everything. The only thing that detracts from the course is that psets are due Thursdays which makes woads a bit difficult to make time for.",
    "As a requirement, yes. Otherwise, no.",
    "I would not reccomend this course as a flipped class or to a student who has not taken AP physics or a Yale course already.",
    "Yes! If you've taken AP Physics or the equivalent, and feel like \"What could I possibly learn anew in an intro physics course,\" but also don't want to take 260, this is the course for you. I can't say how it is if you come in with minimal physics background as most of my friends in the course were like what I said above. Shankar is a great lecturer, but watch on 1.75 or 2x speed always. Also, if you're self-motivated, you really don't need to go to class. Just be sure to: 1) watch the videos or read the book if you're not already 100% rock solid with the material 2) test your understanding by doing the in-class problems (posted after every class) and 3) start on the psets early and work with a group on them. Would recommend taking notes on the lectures starting with oscillations and relativity.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone who really wants to learn the basis for a deeper dive into physics but don't have an advanced understanding of multivariable calculus.",
    "Definitely.",
    "would recommend for someone who would be bored in 180 but doesn't want 260. you still do learn and the flipped classroom is fun, but it definitely has its kinks",
    "Yes, I thought that this course was excellent, and I would recommend it to any student interested in learning more about science. I would make sure they have a solid physics background prior to the class, probably AP physics or some equivalent in high school.",
    "Yes I would recommend this course to anyone looking to study physics.",
    "Only take this class if you are positive that you have the discipline to keep up with the flipped format. The workload is manageable, but it is easy to fall behind. The instructors and TAs offer a lot of resources to help if you're proactive.",
    "I would probably recommend this class to a student who wants to take intro physics and has taken some physics before. I can't really compare it with other intro physics classes since I have obviously only been in this one.",
    "I'm not sure if I would recommend this course... if you're really on-top of your own learning and making sure you understand what's going on, then I would recommend it. If you fall behind easily or you don't work well in groups, this might not be the best class for you.",
    "I would not recommend taking this class, unless you are good at learning by yourself. The \"flipped classroom\" did not work for me, and I found it extremely difficult to cover challenging topics by myself and some online videos. I don't find it to be a helpful method especially for this topic. The way the class is taught makes topics overly complicated. Although the professors were often unclear when going over past lecture videos, the TAs were very helpful",
    "I would not recommend this course to another student should they not like the style of flipped classroom. I was forced to fend for myself for the majority of the time, and gained no personal or helpful connection with any of the professors or teaching fellows (despite my frequent attendance of extra help sessions).",
    "All I can say is know what you're getting into. Although you will learn Newtonian mechanics, special relativity, harmonic oscillators, waves, and heat\/gases, it is a flipped classroom which means you'll be watching video lectures at home and then taking short graded quizzes on the lecture before you go into class. Once in class, you will sit at a circular table with other students (who you will get to know for the rest of the semester, so choose your table wisely-- you will get a few class periods to switch around) and you will do problems with them that pop up on the TV screens that line the room. The two professors will usually summarize the lecture material on a whiteboard in class, so all I can say is make sure to ask any questions if you have them because that's the only chance outside of office hours and Study Hall. Study Hall is every Wednesday and it's a godsend if you need to do your pset (which is due Thursday in class) because a TA will usually be there to help you through the problems. Anyway, let me just tell you that I think the course is not completely organized but you won't notice it at first. At first in class, you'll be doing Newtonian mechanics problems, and having probably taken an AP Physics course in high school and understanding how to solve these problems, you'll be soaring through them without noticing the fact that the professors often provide vague answers to questions asked in class, write equations with different variables as those used in lecture (or might even bring up a different equation), tell you what they're trying to do, struggles to answer a question and then just jumps to the answer, or may even erase the board immediately after writing a solution with minimal explanation such that you don't have time to write it down (they usually post the day's solutions online so this is fine, but it's still kind of annoying). Also, some of the in-class problems have Comic Sans font and can have spelling mistakes, so if this irks you, you've been warned. (And don't let this fool you, the problems done in class are hard!) Likely, you won't finish every problem done in class and you'll have a notebook full of incomplete problems. Lastly, the way that Shankar (the guy in the online video lecturer) teaches is different than the way the professors in class do. Anyway, I learned a lot and made new friends through the struggle, so here's what I recommend if you want to take this course: 1) Shankar will spend most of his lecture deriving an equation from F=MA (Newton's Second Law), whereas in class we will often just use the final equation to solve our problems, so just try to understand where the derivation came from but don't dwell on it- this class really becomes just about making sure you know all the proper equations, of which there are a lot. 2) You get a one-page handwritten formula sheet for the midterm and final, so put all those equations on it and maybe even some example problems! 3) Get to know the people at your table; make a Facebook group with them to arrange times to study! 4) Go to Study Hall on Wednesday if you're struggling on the weekly problem set! You will get the answers you seek and the TAs are amazing and so willing to help. Anyway yeah so overall, if you feel very confident in your ability to do physics and enjoy the flipped classroom style of teaching, then take this course! Otherwise, do 180 or the next one up for the more conventional experience.",
    "Yes, as I very much enjoy physics and despite any qualms I have I do believe that it effectively conveyed what it meant to and was enjoyable as well!",
    "I imagine for the vast majority of students considering this course they have already decided to take an introductory physics course, and now the question is which one (180, 200, or 260). From being in a suite were three of us each chose a different option. The consensus seemed to be that the material of PHYS 200 is a healthy mid-point between the other two. The mathematical burden might be slightly more than PHYS 180 but is definitely lighter than PHYS 260. The material would be more intellectually challenging than 180 (particularly through the additional work in special relativity and simple harmonic motion) but not that of 260. Nevertheless, the key determining factor is choosing PHYS 200 must be the course format. If you are uncomfortable with a flipped classroom, this course is not recommended for you. But if you are a proponent of learning outside of class time and then engaging in problem solving and group work during class hours, then this course would be a good option. Indeed, PHYS 200 is a flipped classroom format executed better than most. The strengths and weaknesses of a flipped classroom are pretty easily deducible if you know what the format involves."
