    "I learned huge amounts about the different viewpoints surrounding Zionism and the development of ideas around this topic.",
    "This class provides great historical background on an issue I always considered to have started in the late 19th century with Theodore Herzl. Stern gives excellent background to numerous Zionist thinkers.",
    "I learned a lot from this course about the background of Zionism and its historical evolution and branches. The material was quite interesting.",
    "I can't say I can think of anything in particular.",
    "This course not only introduced me to a world of history and thought which I had no previous exposure to but made me rethink the entire nature of power itself. Undoubtedly the best course I have taken in Yale College, to summarize what I have learned in HIST 216 would be to give its all-encompassing awesomeness short shrift.",
    "I learned the history of the creation of Israel. This is such an important thing to know in the present day. I also learned how to analyze philosophical\/political writings. This class was very enlightening.",
    "Zionism from a theoretical perspective. A mixed subject including ethnicity, history and Jewish study.",
    "General overview of the Zionist movement and of the United States' relationship to the movement",
    "Learned a lot about the philosophical and historical trajectory of Zionism, examining key complicated social, political and religious issues.",
    "I gained a strong understanding of the changes and differing opinions of the zionism movement",
    "I learned about the history of the Zionist movement, as well as how Zionism affects the current conflict in Israel. I also developed skills for writing a history research paper.",
    "Basically an introductory history course, with a primary focus on intellectual history. I learned quite a bit about the roots of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and found out that Zionism has a long, intellectual history, very intertwined with the overall development of 19th century European nationalism. Reading and understanding the different varieties of Zionism was most interesting.",
    "Learned so much about the origins and leaders of Zionism. Gave me much more insight into the Israeli-Palestinian conflict today and helped me understand nationalism in general.",
    "Learned a lot about not only the history of Israel, but also the ideologies that contributed to the state's establishment."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I think Professor Stern could have been more organized in his lectures. Providing a Power Point, or at least writing names and terms on the board, would have been helpful as well. If I didn't have a background in Jewish History or Hebrew, I think it would have been difficult for me to keep up with the terminology just based on Stern's lectures.",
    "Lectures were great, and the content\/reading was really interesting. Unfortunately, we didnt always stick to the syllabus, so that made it difficult to know what to read in a given week. The three assessments also all were rather nebulous, with little in the way of guidelines or suggestions, so that was frustrating.",
    "In terms of strengths, the subject matter was interesting. Some lectures highlighted interesting tensions between the Zionists. In terms of weaknesses? Professor Stern's total lack of organization really decreased the quality of this class. He didn't teach according to any set syllabus, so it was impossible to do readings for much of the course. He also seem to forget what he had and had not already lectured about, resulting, unsurprisingly, in gaping holes. I think the course also suffered from the fact that he cancelled lecture three times, and while he planned to make up those missing lectures with evening sessions, never got around to it. It was also frustrating that he cancelled office hours the week before the midterm was due, because he was leaving early for Fall break (although he did reschedule them the previous week, it was too early to be helpful for the essay). The lectures were pretty hit and miss. Some were interesting, and in some he kept returning to emphasize a distinction between two thinkers, without giving enough context (or making it clear what reading he wanted us to do). There wasn't really clear continuity between many of the lectures.",
    "I really enjoyed that the lectures built on the readings but not simply recapitulate them.",
    "This class was awesome. Perfect organization and curriculum. Only thing I would mention is that Stern could do a little better job of posting due dates via classesV2. No assignment was ever a surprise, but would be nice to have a clear look at the exact due dates of each assignment.Otherwise perfect curriculum.",
    "A good introductory course to the topic but the lectures are not well-organised and there is insufficient learning support.",
    "Strengths: Prof. Stern knows basically everything about the topic and is a fantastic lecturer. The readings are interesting, and his lectures are great. Weaknesses: The syllabus was often confusing, and it was hard to know which readings to do. I think either a more clear syllabus or an email before each class would fix this.",
    "The material is fascinating and Stern's teaching is highly engaging. I was excited to attend lecture each day. There is also no discussion section, which is great, as there is always plenty of space for questions in lecture and office hours.",
    "More interaction with the reading",
    "This course thoroughly explained the evolvement of the Zionist movement. The readings were all extremely interesting, and the course was very well taught. The only weakness of the course was that it seemed a bit disorganized at times (especially in terms of what readings were due when).",
    "I think that the lectures could be a bit more organized. Stern comes in with no notes and just talks, which oftentimes is fascinating, but other times gets bogged down by 30-minute long explanations of what primary sources are. While some students might need that, most don't, and it would be better to hold a separate class for these more logistical issues like twice a semester rather than use class time for them. I also think that a little more needs to be done to clarify writers and thinkers chronologically--like who responds to who, who is a precursor to who, that kind of thing. Also focus more on what happens at the ground level of Zionism--I understand that it was very much an intellectual movement, but ultimately it was those who \"got on boats\" who made it all happen.",
    "Love the small lecture format, the readings were detailed and useful, and the papers were fun to write. Would like greater feedback and more interaction within students.",
    "Excellent course, honestly such interesting material and so well presented"

   "comments": [
    "Definitely, Stern is an engaging lecturer with lots of new ideas to share.",
    "I really enjoyed the subject matter of this course and enjoyed Stern as a lecturer. It didn't take long for me to realize, though, that this course is a total gut. There is no section, so you don't really have to do the readings, and there are so few assignments that I didn't feel like I was investing very much in the coursework. It was a pleasure to sit in lecture twice a week, but you won't get much more out of it.",
    "Alright, heres the deal: the material in the course is really interesting. Professor Stern is really smart and a really engaging lecturer, so thats interesting. However, he unfortunately doesnt care much about the logistics of the course. We weaved our way around the syllabus at times without much warning, and readings werent always even posted online, which could make preparing for class difficult. Sometimes hed lead semi-discussions that suggested that we ought to do the reading. Sometimes hed give a lecture that was interesting but had little to do with the assigned reading for the week. The midterm paper topic was super open, with only a few odd guidelines, and also given to us later than we had been told. The grades themselves also came back later than anticipated. The final paper was super open-ended, but with weirdly specific instructions that made it quite an ordeal (especially since its worth 50% of the grade). And the take-home final, which we had to push him to move earlier so it didnt go past the deadline for submitting assignments, came with virtually no guidelines at all. So yeah, if youre interested in the topic, youll learn a lot about it. But be prepared for logistical frustration; if that seriously bothers you, Id advice not taking the class.",
    "As I said before, the subject matter is interesting, but Prof. Stern didn't teach it well. I would take if it a professor other than Prof. Stern takes over the class.",
    "This is a great course for anyone interested in 19th and 20th century Jewish history. No prior knowledge is necessary.",
    "Yes, great course that evaluates the various types of Zionism.",
    "Absolutely. It is interdisciplinary offering something to lovers of history, philosophy, Judaism, and language.",
    "No brainer yes. This was one of my favorite classes at Yale. Insanely talented lecturer, important course material, very relevant, knowledge of this field is applicable in everyday situations. Take this class!",
    "YES",
    "I would recommend this class to anybody interested in learning about the history of Zionism from a really smart professor who abstains from political dialogue in the classroom. He gives a fairly unbiased and factual account. The workload is pretty manageable with two papers and a take-home final exam. The readings are helpful to supplement lecture, but you can get away with skipping them.",
    "Its relatively low workload and interesting concepts. Would recommend but not my favorite history course Very backloaded work wise",
    "I would definitely recommend Zionism to another student. It is one of my favorite courses that I have taken at Yale. All of the material and readings were extremely interesting, and Professor Stern was a fantastic and engaging lecturer.",
    "Absolutely everyone should take this class. Eliyahu Stern is a riot. He is one of the few professors at this school who isn't afraid to tell it to you straight. He's disorganized, oftentimes schizophrenic in his lecturing, has little regard for political correctness, but is fabulous, and I learned a great deal from him. You will be shocked by how little you knew about Zionism before taking this course. One of my favorites during my time at Yale. It is basically an intellectual history, but the readings discuss some of the most important issues facing humanity today--mainly, what does it mean to be a \"nation?\" You will learn about America, Europe, and the Middle East, and come away with a much better understanding of the modern Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Could not recommend enough.",
    "This course is a great way to learn about the history of Zionism, various movements in Jewish national politics, and the origins of the Israel-Palestinian conflict. Not too much work, but the final paper can be challenging because it can be about anything involving Israel or Zionism, but Prof. Stern wants it to be focused on one specific thing. Be careful when scheduling classes immediately after this one. Prof. Stern often goes over the time for this class.",
    "Absolutely yes! Possibly the best class I've taken at Yale.",
    "Absolutely"
