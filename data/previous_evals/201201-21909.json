    "This course was a great introduction to biochemistry techniques, though there was not much biophysics. It is very well structured. You have a pre-lab quiz before each lab, but that will keep you on top of understanding why you are doing the lab\/each step, and why different reagents are used. Usually you do leave lab about an hour or two earlier, which is good. This lab has a heavy workload, with 4 total lab reports in addition to 2 days a week in lab. The lab reports each cover several days in lab, so don't wait until the last minute if you can. If you do wait until the last minute, which many of us did, it will likely cause you to pull allnighters.",
    "Yes, I'd recommend taking this class. Best lab I've taken at yale. Lots of work, but I enjoyed talking with the people around me in the lab. My adviser tried to tell me to opt out of the course, and I'm really glad I didn't listen to her. I learned so many things, and more importantly I learned them in a low stress environment where I wouldn't feel (that) bad if I messed up an experiment.The lab reports take up basically an entire week of working nonstop and working on nothing else. DO NOT PROCRASTINATE. Most unpleasant couple of all nighters I have ever pulled.",
    "This course is a lot of work. I know it may seem daunting to take a twice a week lab, but the majority of the time for this class is spent in the lab. There are four projects that need to be done, and each of them take an (estimated) 10-15 hours if you do them thoroughly. I mean, take it if you want, but if you can opt out of it since you are doing independent research, why not?",
    "It's a requirement. Don't take this course if you can place out of it.",
    "Good",
    "This lab is worth one credit because it meets twice a week for about 3-4 hours, depending on the experiment. There are four major projects and hence four major reports. There are also daily quizzes that cover procedure and concepts.I would not recommend this course to another student (at least for now) because the lab manual is very confusing and needsre-writing. Unlike Organic Chemistry Lab where you knew exactly what you were doing and why you were doing it, this lab seemed like a bunch of students going through the motions without really understand what was going on until they had to write a lab report.",
    "The course is actually really fun and you learn a lot. The in class quizzes though are bit ridiculous and lab reports take and eternity. Start them early and you will be fine.",
    "A very intensive lab where you learn a ton and meet new people. I'd say take it if you are looking for some lab experience or interested, but be prepared for the work. The lab reports often run well past 20 pages.",
    "This is probably the best lab class I have taken at Yale. Even though you probably have to take this course for the MB&B major, you will learn a lot. The worst part of this class is the amount of time it takes: 8 hours a week, quiz before every lab, and 4 massive lab reports (do NOT put them off, they take a lot of hours). It's ridiculous that it's a one-credit class. That being said, I learned a ton about lab skills and definitely had some fun while doing it. Suggestion: make sure you understand everything you're doing in lab while you're doing it. Don't wait until the weekend before the lab report is due to ask questions.",
    "Biochemistry Lab is a great course that teaches you a lot. The teachers and students in are amazing, and the weekly workload is not much. The quizzes, depending on the TAs who make them, can be a nuisance or easy, but as long as you read the lab plan (a few pages) well and take a few notes you'll be fine. A major downside to the course are the lab reports. When one of these comes around, your workload spikes dramatically and you end up spending a few days on the report, topping it off with a solid all-nighter (unless you can actually manage to not procrastinate). Meet with other students for those and you should be fine.",
    "It is a one-credit lab, which means it requires a lot of work. Full lab reports may require a few nights to finish, but the course itself is quite rewarding if you stick to it until the end. For MB&B majors you can waiver the lab requirements by doing research in a biochem lab. I would recommend taking the course if you want a comprehensive review of lab techniques before you start research, or take it if you need it for major requirements.",
    "You are not going to take this class unless it is required for your major (MB&B B.S.) or you need it for an inorganic lab class for premed requirements. Do keep in mind that there are many ways to have this class requirement waved in the MB&B major. The class definitely teaches you a lot of techniques in molecular biology and biochemistry, at a fairly fast pace. We did a lot. That said, rarely were we in the lab the whole time alotted to it. Many experiments were pretty short. The material is also never too conceptually straining. If you put in the work, you will understand.That said, this class is a lot of work. The lab reports are very long and involved, but they are not in any way useless or frivolous. Two of them are written in full Introduction, Methods, Results, Discussion scientific format. Though I particularly hated one of them, I have to say that writing them helped me grow as a scientific thinker, even when the experimental results we obtained were poor. Once each one was completed, there was a certain sense of peace. I had done a hard thing. Really, those reports stretched me to my limits in terms of my overall semester time crunch. But they got done. I'mthankful for what I learned in MB&B 360L.",
    "This lab is a lot of work (I wrote 70 pages), but it is a good introduction to biochemical techniques that many labs use. You should take it if you plan to work in a bio lab or for your major.",
    "Not much fun. But you have to go for it if you want the BS and haven't dome much work in research. But It will teach you some techniques you need even if you have.",
    "A LOT of work. While this is a great class, you probably shouldn't take it unless you have to. 5 hour labs twice a week (for the whole semester) and four lab reports (2 big ones, 2 smaller ones) took at least a week to do well.",
    "This class was a huge disorganized mess, and we never knew what was going on. Most of what I learned was from deciphering the poorly written lab manual, but so much of what we did is still a mystery.More accurately, they switched the first and second halves of the course for some reason. The first half was painful and the second half was boring. So we did the hardest two labs first and struggled to understand what we were doing, then we did the two introductory-like labs in the second half and \"properly\" learning about techniques we'd already learned painfully.But even if it had been in the right order, the lab manual is riddled with mistakes, and changes to procedure weren't always made clear. Nobody knew why we were adding any substance to anything else until we finished the month's work and wrote up the report at the end. Most of the learning was done during the all-nighters before each lab reports was due.Some students were taking notes on the manual chapters uploaded to googledocs so maybe they'll fix it some. If you notice any mistakes in the manual maybe they didn't incorporate it - you might look for someone who took the class for the googledoc?",
    "This is a course that should only be taken by students serious about research or premed. There are daily quizes (2 times a week), which are very tedious and terrible to prepare fore as they are so specific and picky. The labs are long and the reports are worse, but it is a rewarding class.",
    "A LOT of work. All of my lab reports combined totaled over 70 pages, and we were in lab an average of 10 hours\/week. Only take it if you have to. Yes, you learn a lot, but I think you'd be better off learning this stuff in an actual research lab.",
    "Expect to spend a lot of time in lab--after all, the course is two lab days a week. Still, it's not too bad and can actually be pretty fun sometimes. You get to know your fellow labmates and end up learning a variety of techniques through the four projects you do during the semester. Just be wary of lab reports because they are very long and take A LOT of time, so make sure to give yourself plenty of time to do them!",
    "Take only if you're an mbb major."
