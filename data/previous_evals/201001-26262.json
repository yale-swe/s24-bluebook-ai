    "YES take it if you are interested in studying terrorism\/political violence. The course covers several periods and appealed tomany different students this year--the readings are great! Prof. Gage is an excellent and challenging teacher, and leads a great discussion.",
    "History 162J has a large amount of potential. Frequently it reaches it, but too often fails to live up to it.Professor Gage is amazing. She truly knows how to lead a seminar and coach students through the paper-writing process.Most of the readings are fascinating.The class just needs more structure, and the separate weeks need to be tied together better.",
    "Yes--it will definitely force you to reinterpret your views.",
    "Seminar on terrorism that is great for discussion \/ getting a background on current events. I would recommend this course to anyone - history major or not.",
    "Great class if you are interested in terrorism. The readings are great and Professor Gage is even better. Absolutely recommended.",
    "Definitely. This class is spectacular- useful information that you can use everyday.",
    "Broadens your preception of American experience and terrorism. Great seminar. Take it."
