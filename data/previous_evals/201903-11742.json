    "The courses timetable was well spaced out. I think meetings in the Religious Studies building rather than in WTS would be better. More time for 1-on-1 feedback would be welcome, and clearer documentation in advance about what each submitted component is supposed to look like would have been good guidance. Available samples would have been super.",
    "There isn't a ton of structure and it has a very casual atmosphere.",
    "The class was very structured, which forced me to make my deadlines and make progress on my thesis.",
