   "comments": [
    "No unless 1) you want a good grade 2) you don't care about learning.",
    "Relevant material for intellectual discourse, definitly useful for anyone pursuing long-term goals related to Chinese life, politics, economics, culture, etc.",
    "A great class for advanced learners. All materials are in traditional characters, but it's easier than it seems. Su Wei makes it great fun. TAs were very helpful this semester. Take it, you won't regret it.",
    "This is a good class to maintain your Chinese. You won't get lots of speaking practice, but Su laoshi is a very fun teacher. You'll learn a lot about Chinese culture through his stories.",
    "I highly recommend this class to upper-level Chinese students. The seminar-nature of class means that students can practice speaking frequently in class (in addition to during TA sessions). It certainly helped me maintain my spoken Chinese while making major strides in my written Chinese. Also, Su Laoshi is possibly the most enthusiastic and friendliest member of the Chinese department at Yale, and he infuses his classes with his passion for the subject and for teaching.",
    "Very well taught, albeit lacking a bit of structure (prof likes to go off topic quite often), but herein lies its greatest strengths also - hearing Prof Su's lifestory and how it intertwines with China's history (and believe me he is involved in so many important historical events) is probably the best part of the course. It is his commitment that we not only learn what was technically necessary but also relevant to day-to-day conversation and a deeper understanding of the rich cultural background of China that makes this course such a great course. He's also really laidback with work - no specific deadlines as long as you make sure to hand it in eventually. Take this!",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. Su Wei is a pleasure. This is a high level course, but the Chinese levels vary. Because of this Su Wei has different expectations in terms of writing from those with stronger and weaker Chinese. If you are a heritage speaker, do not expect to be able to skate by easily.",
    "Great class for improving listening, reading and writing. Your speaking ability will not improve, however, because the class format does not provide much in the way of speaking opportunities."
