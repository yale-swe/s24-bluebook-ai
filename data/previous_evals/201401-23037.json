    "A bizarre but intriguing course about lewin and the role of the listener in analysis. Would definitely recommend!",
    "- rich topic- well-organized course- great professor- adequate time to develop a solid research project",
    "I found the workload to be quite appropriate, though sometimes highly variable from week to week, and would recommend the course toother students because it covers topics that are of very timely concern to the field currently. The course involves some very close reading of central texts and in adequately completing reading assignments multiple readings were helpful."
