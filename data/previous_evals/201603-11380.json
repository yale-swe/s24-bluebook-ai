   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The course wasn't as structured as it could be",
    "The strength and weakness of the course is its breadth. The topic is noise. Many senses are considered: noise as irritating, destructive sound, noise as that which interferes with signal, noise as ontological fundament. Students from many academic backgrounds took the course; there was something interesting for everyone. In pursuing so many topics, however, it was impossible to dwell for too long on specific contexts in which noise appears.",
    "The class was a very strong discussion seminar. We always had more than enough to talk about for two hours, and the class never dragged. One of its only weaknesses was the size. There were too many people to have a discussion in which everyone could participate the entire time, and I often felt myself holding back because I wanted to give everyone else time to talk. I'm glad the class had such a diverse group of students, though, because I really enjoyed hearing everyone's perspectives (particularly those of non-undergrad students).",
    "Seminar sometimes felt like lots of small individual discussions with a few members of the class and Kane, rather than a full circular discussion. Overall I thought it was good - on weeks where reading was dull discussion made it much more interesting. It only really works if you buy into the meta aspect of the class - i personally did and enjoyed the intellectual process but I know other students were tempted to call BS on the whole thought process in which case it can all feel sorta trivial."

    "Yes, it was interesting and a lot of fun!",
    "Noise was an outstanding class, due in no small part to Professor Kane. The material itself is fascinating (if often very complex and goes over your head), and Kane does an excellent job of both breaking it down and providing ample space for exploring students' thoughts. Do the reading - it's not bad if you start it early in the week, and you get good returns on it during class discussion. The paper assignments are totally reasonable (two 5 pagers, one 10-15), but you should give yourself time for them, because they aren't papers to bang out quickly. There was a wide range of people in the class, from music undergrads to STEM majors to art and business grads, all providing very valuable perspectives.",
    "Noise was a great discussion seminar. Each week you do reading (anywhere from 50 to 200(? possibly 300) pages), most of which was difficult, philosophical, and interesting, and then discuss it in seminar. The two hours flew by each week, and we never ran out of things to talk about. Professor Kane talks a lot in seminar, and he always had fascinating points to make. The three papers (around 5, 5, and 10 pages long) all had very open prompts, so I got to write about things that really interested me. I feel like I now have a very good background in sound studies and its important texts.",
    "Yes, but with the disclaimer that it isn't about noise music and more about philosophical matters."
