   "comments": [
    "Best econ class Yale, take it. If you're not an ECON major I suggest you take it Credit\/D.",
    "This is a great class. Definitely take it if you are curious about economics and the real world. Be ready for a LOT of work, however.",
    "If you want to be able to read and debate about anything in the Economist after a semester and hate math but love econ and current events you will love this class. HIGHLY RECOMMEND.",
    "One of the best classes I've taken at Yale so far. I learned so much about a lot of different topics, and I can now articulate my opinions with much more confidence and evidence. Be prepared to come into class with opinions though; random people are often called on to offer what they think about a particular topic. Can be helpful for finance interviews.",
    "I would absolutely recommend ECON 185 to another student. One of the best economics lectures you'll find at Yale.",
    "Absolutely. I would highly recommend this class the another student. You learn about salient issues in a more rigorous way and get to decompose what terms you hear in the news--QE, fiscal consolidate--mean and their impact on the real economy. The content is extremely well curated and at times takes a social-conscious approach to issues, which I find very rare for economics classes. To add the professors are incredible (so is Nic, the TA). They create a collegial environment, actively solicit students' opinions, and are incredibly fun to be in the presence in.",
    "Very cool class if you're interested in the field's unresolved debates, in getting two smart + cool profs' opinions on the debates, and in being able to speak conversantly on issues facing the global economy",
    "If you really like economic phenomena in the world, this class will be enjoyable by you. Don't let the fact that it's a 100 level course mislead you, you do need a strong understanding of basic economic principles in order to understand whats going on. make sure you remember what you learned in intermediate and intro macro. Very informative course with a multitude of empirical papers being studied. There's a lot to learn in a short period of time which wasn't easy, but the debate style of the class helps students internalize the information by presenting both viewpoint on it. Prof.Roach has a wealth of experience and knowledge that is really beneficial to learn from because rather than speak to what economists has wrote in the past, he speaks to what they said and did, because he worked with them directly and understands their work in more depth than mere reader of their work can. Prof.Tsyvinski takes it upon himself to ensure the students are engaged and are internalizing and thinking bout the material in depth. Prof.Tsyvinski has a very relaxed and lighthearted demeanor which keeps the sometimes dense economic material become far easier to understand.",
    "If you are an econ major, I would highly recommend this class! It takes some of the boring things you learn in the core classes and applies those concepts to modern macro. This class can be a bit of work when you are writing your psets, but otherwise, very fun.",
    "Absolutely take this class if its offered again. You'll learn so much in this class about how economics actually works in the real world, much more than any other econ class you'll take. This isn't very hard but also not a gut class, if that's what you're looking for. The problem sets are lots of writing and take a fair amount of time\/knowledge of the readings, and it has standard econ department grading, even if they claim to you it's not on a curve",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. I think the material covered is really worthwhile-- well taught but also valuable in your day to day life. I approached the class with little to no background in economics and found the lectures very rewarding. The lectures give you a broad overview of the topics that are well supplemented by the readings, which go much more in depth. Overall, I think the course is challenging enough that you get a lot out of it, but not so difficult that someone without a background in econ can't understand the subject matter.",
    "Debates in Macro is an excellent course. You will learn about some of the big issues on which economists are divided (inequality, China, the role of financial markets, etc.) As with many courses, you get out what you put in. Could you do well without putting in a ton of effort? Maybe, but it would be a mistake. Do the readings, go to class, participate and you will have an incredibly valuable experience.",
    "YES! TAKE IT! Even if you aren't an econ or global? or is it poly sci? major. You learn SO MUCH about current affairs in macroeconomics which is really relevant in our world today. The readings are a lot of work and the psets do take time, but you learn so much! Plus you get 2 renowned professors and an awesome TA teaching you.",
    "Take if you're really interested in macroeconomic topics. Also take if you're a masochist. Enjoy.",
    "Lots of tedious, semi-pointless work. Aleh will cold call students for questions so be prepared. Final exam was ridiculous. Incredibly technical and not representative of the survey-style of the class.",
    "So here's the deal: you're going to learn a ton in this class. But most of that is going to be about international economics. Meaning you'll get a good primer on Japan, China, Russia, Europe, and the US. But if you're looking for a course on \"Debates in Macroeconomics,\" I'm not sure this is it. THE debate in macro right now is inequality, and this course basically avoids the topic. Ultimately, I'm glad I took it for the other stuff I learned, but the professors are really conservative and focus so narrowly on one single metric - GDP growth - that almost nothing else matters to them. They'd have half the world's population living on $2\/day if it meant we could get to 6% growth in the US. And that's not just weird economics, it's pretty blind to the way the world works outside economic models.",
    "Take the class. It can be challenging as it asks for a high level of independent thinking and in-class participation, but the broad range of topics discussed in class and the vast body of materials you would be introduced make it worth your while. By the end of the class, you would have an in-depth understanding of contemporary macroeconomic issues and form your own economic perspective, and you would also be able to apply the economic theories you have learnt in college in the analysis of real-life (macroeconomic) issues.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to all econ majors. You really gain a good understanding of many of the most important debates in macro today. You hear two often conflicting ways to approach a problem. The problem sets were essentially six page papers that you struggle with at the beginning until you learn what they are looking for. I think they should make this course a WR because it felt like that level of writing.",
    "Really engaging lectures with fun professors who love to cold call. Homeworks get easier with time.",
    "A fabulous class if you like Econ! These two professors are an exquisite combination. Its incredible to have these two in the room together. It is not as gut as you may think. Study for the exams!!! But it is basically straightforward, lots of reading economic papers. The guest speakers are an incredible opportunity, and you actually get the chance to discuss relevant topics with two incredible professors. Take advantage of the class!",
    "Definitely. No question about it. Be prepared for a high volume of material, but a lot of bang for your buck.",
    "A great class - after taking this class, you will be able to talk much more intelligently about just about any macroeconomic issue. One thing is that I wish I had taken intermediate macro before this class, because quite a bit of the material assumes knowledge of intermediate macro concepts. Aleh admitted after the class was over and some students had expressed similar concerns that he probably should have made intermediate macro a prerequisite for this class. Also, the psets actually take longer than I would have expected - they are pretty much your personal views on various controversies in economics, with empirical support, written in paragraph form. Mine were each generally around 5 pages single spaced, and some overachievers wrote 10-15 pages single spaced. I wasn't quite sure what the TAs were expecting at the beginning, so I didn't do very well on the first pset, but they got easier as I got the hang of the class.",
    "Don't take it.",
    "I would recommend this class to student who wants an overview of macroeconomics and the latest research in macroeconomics. However, the class needs more structure. There should be fewer topics that are discussed more in depth."
