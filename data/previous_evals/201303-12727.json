   "comments": [
    "It's an advanced statistics class that requires a strong understanding of basic statistics concepts, but unfortunately spends some time reviewing those concepts. Don't come into the class thinking you can pick them up as you go along - it takes time for this stuff to sink in.",
    "theoretical basis for econometrics; very little applied use; no stat package analysis conducted",
    "A good course, well taught and interesting.",
    "It depends on what the student is looking for. If they want to actually understand and work with data, I would definitely not recommend this course.",
    "Would not recommend it unless you've never done Econometrics or Statistics before.",
    "Best for students with a command of linear algebra, the course spends the early part of the semester on a theoretical treatment of estimators and quickly combines this with matrix operations at the end of the course.",
    "I would not recommend this course to anyone who wants to take only 1 Econometrics course, since the overall learning from it is low.",
    "I highly recommend this course to all who hope to do any kind of applied research.",
    "I would summarize it as a useful introduction to the subject for someone interested in applied work; slow to pick up the pace, perfectly clear for the most part but dense and confusing towards the end.",
    "Excellent course, covers topics with great depth and is truly a grad level course that is essential for those interested in statistics and econometrics.",
    "Recommended for students with no or little background in Econometrics.",
    "Parochial course that covers little in the field of econometrics. learning curve was way too steep nearin the end just because lecturer ran out of time nearing the end. course schedule could have been planned and adhered to better. Not recommended at all.",
    "I would recommend it to a student who hasn't studied econometrics previously but not to a student who is familiar with it."

   "comments": [
    "I did make progress with understanding statistical concepts, and that's helpful, but we didn't touch stata once, and I'll definitely need to build on the class a lot more before I can use what I learned.",
    "Having better command of econometric theory will prove useful as I continue to study economics; however, I will need additional coursework or independent to cover my knowledge of Econometric analysis. I feel it was not complete.",
    "Did not help one bit.",
    "Great preparation for reading papers.",
    "I learned a TON in this course--much of it thanks to the emphasis on intuition.",
    "The course taught me the correct way to approach the study of econometrics, and how it can be really interesting when viewed in the context of development issues. I only wish the pace was more even, and that more material had been covered.",
    "It provided the theoretical background for the stats tools that i will be using in my research.",
    "I think econometrics is one of the most usefulsubjects. I was however, hoping to have a working knowledge of stata and a more detailed understanding of the course.",
    "Not much, depended mostly on my pre-econometrics background. if anything, this course made me more confused and shaken with econometrics."
