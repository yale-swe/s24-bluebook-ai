   "comments": [
    "In my case, the colloquium helped me to diversify my writing style as well as manage the logistics of a long-term project in a more sustained and serious way. Aside from Professor Tran, I have been able to learn a great deal from my working group of two other students and from my advisor. Critiques are often inconvenient truths, but have forced me to examine my writing in novel ways that have changed my writing style in other contexts.",
    "I got some substantive knowledge on how to develop research projects in a way that is thorough and careful but still inventive and agile. But mostly I learned exciting new things about my thesis topic.",
    "This course was most helpful for keeping myself on track with my own project."

   "comments": [
    "The course was immersive in how much it centered collaboration, and could have benefited (at least in my case) from enforcing more structure to ensure that I and other people were working on our respective projects even beyond the context of the assignments.",
    "The course of course pushes you to work on your thesis, and your level of engagement is very much what you make it, as you can very easily only do the assignments for the class, so a lot of the work is left to you to make up. However, I will say that so many of the classes felt that we weren't do much. I feel like it would be more helpful to adopt a model that I believe some other programs use where the senior colloquium meets every other week, and on the in between weeks we're required to have a writing group meeting and report on it, or have one on one meetings with our adviser or Professor Tran.",
    "Strengths: gives a feeling of solidarity with classmates on thesis journey. Gives structure and deadlines. Weaknesses: a little hard to closely engage with readings out of a textbook that looks and seems like it was written in order to be boring",
    "this course treats ER&M majors like students who have never written a paper before. It should not be required.",
    "Overall I thought the course was useful, but I think class time could have been used in a way that was more efficient, especially since everyone's projects were so different. It would be helpful if some of the time that was spent talking about more general topics that were perhaps not as useful for anyone was instead spent working individually, perhaps setting goals together as a group and getting feedback in the end.",
    "I think this class should be every two weeks instead of once a week - it creates too much anxiety to return every week with nothing in hand."

   "comments": [
    "The course is mandatory for ER&M majors, so I would highly recommend it to them. But on its own terms, I would recommend it as well to anyone who wants to improve their writing and analytical skills.",
    "Yes! I really recommend doing a yearlong thesis in ER&M if you're a major. Having the time to really develop your own project is such a privilege and intellectual joy!",
    "Yes, I mean, you have to take it if you want to write a thesis, and writing a thesis has potential I believe to be a beautiful and fulfilling journey (also can be kinda excruciating at times!) for those who want to do it",
    "Its required."
