   "comments": [
    "This is one of the best classes I've taken at Yale. It's very hard to get in, but once you are in, you get to learn a lot more than you expect. You not only learn from the class materials but also from your classmates and Prof. Woodward, who is one of the best journalists in the country and puts a lot of effort into teaching this class.",
    "I would encourage you to take this class if you are a senior, and already have a strong sense of yourself as a writer, and if you are highly independently motivated. Bob will not hold your hand, unless you ask him to. There is a lot of work--responses almost weekly--and Bob is not an easy grader. I would recommend taking this class during an otherwise light semester. In order to do a good job on the profile and final project (as well as the other assignments), you have to devote a lot of time to interviewing. This is impossible if you are also taking other demanding classes. I was able to do a really in-depth job on my final project, because I planned my work in other classes accordingly, so I would have the time to focus on it.",
    "Amazing class. If you get in (and you don't have to have any journalism experience -- I didn't at all!) DEFINITELY take it! 100% recommend.",
    "Any aspiring journalist would be remiss not to take it. I would advise friends and colleagues to come to Yale on the basis of this course alone.",
    "A must-take. It's Bob Woodward after all! Be aware that Akhil Amar sits in on every class (this actually ends up being a con) but still worth taking nonetheless. The work is very front-loaded.",
    "An intensive class on journalism, with a heavy focus on politics and current events. I couldn't recommend the class more highly.",
    "Really great class! The worst part was probably all the short assignments (there was one almost every week) but the readings were very interesting. Class discussion often veered off from readings into discussions of foreign policy and the upcoming presidential election, but it was always really interesting to hear Professor Woodward's anecdotes.",
    "ENGL 467 is aptly cross-listed in English and Political Science. It's heavily focused on journalism in the United States, and we talked a lot about current politics in the USA and happenings at Yale, pulling from the Washington Post and the YDN as well as our planned readings. Weekly readings are interesting, and the syllabus is made available to applicants."
