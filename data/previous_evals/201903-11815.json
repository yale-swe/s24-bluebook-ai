    "As a leg of a much larger department, the class felt so rehearsed and stilted that we didn't get much out of the actual classtime. Peer conversation practice was good, but the learning happened independently in the textbook, and the powerpoints didn't do anything more than restate the learning of the previous night. Tests, too, were sent down from department heads so our teacher couldn't answer basic questions without checking in with her superiors.",
    "Strength: being taught every day is a necessity when learning a new language, and the variety of exercises definitely helped. The fact that you get essay rewrites is also a plus."
