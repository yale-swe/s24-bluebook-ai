   "comments": [
    "Tough content but a good class for people interested in ancient Chinese. People come from different backgrounds so it's hard for people who have never been exposed to ancient Chinese or even Chinese grammar.",
    "Definitely take it if you want to continue with classical Chinese- it's a great foundation, especially if it's taught in Chinese even after Prof. Kang retires. I really enjoyed the readings, although class sometimes got boring. Not too difficult. I'd take this class again.",
    "This is a great class to learn Classical Chinese. There is alot of homework, but it isn't unmanageable. May not be as great a class if you just want simple Chinese language practice, however.",
    "I strongly recommend having some kind of background in Chinese literature (modern or of any kind) before taking the class. As well as in traditional characters. A certain speed of reading comprehension level is required that will make it difficult for students who don't have as much experience reading and processing texts. There's not as much time for translating into English to do exercises, so being able to operate comfortably in modern Chinese is obviously a much. But it's a great class, and extremely challenging.",
    "Definitely a yes. You would be able to establish a solid foundation in Wenyan. The only reason why this course has been so rewarding is that Professor Kang made the subject very interesting. But professor Kang is retiring...so I don't know what will happen.",
    "Great class! A good overview of classical Chinese and a good preparation for independent reading of ancient text. Prof. Kang conducted the class in modern Chinese. Other professors probably do not."
