    "Take if you are unfamiliar with key thinkers (Kant, Du Bois, De Beauvoir). So necessary.",
    "Overall a solid course. You're not going to go into great depth for any of the theorists, but it's a nice overview of some of the most important social thinkers in human history. Because most of the theorists base their ideas on those of philosophers, you will read a bit more philosophy than you might have expected from a class like this, so bear that in mind if you have some sort of aversion to people like Kant and Peirce (you might end up finding those guys to be the most interesting out the bunch--you never know). The work is manageable, as it's mostly readings (you don't need to obsess over finishing them all in their entireties, Professor Erikson summarizes them quite well in class) and a couple of 5-6 page papers. The 5 mini-exams are nothing to stress about and are quite preferable to one or two big exams. Take the class if you're interested in getting a solid background in social thought.",
    "Nice class to get introduced to social theory.",
    "Very interesting course material. Well-taught and organized. Light workload w\/ only 5 brief in-class exams of reasonable difficulty and a few short, easily-manageable papers. Definitely recommend.",
    "The class provides a very good understanding of the fundamental theories that give birth to the modern social theory. Classwork was not bad, only two papers and 5 quizzes, which were not hard at all. Learned a lot",
    "Emily is a great lecturer. The readings are fantastic as well. And the 5 quizzes and 2 5-page papers you do aren't too bad. The questions aren't that hard for the quizzes. Just make sure you can throw down each of the theorist's major points on the questions and you should be fine. This is one of those classes where you look at it and are like \"Oh, I've always wanted to know more about Du Bois, and Marx, and Emile Durkheim. Yay, knowledge!\" but then you worry that you're gonna be bogged down with a bunch of work. Well, this class is great because it's not that much work, the grading is pretty lax, and you leave the class with a firm grasp in what all of those smart, old, white men's (shout out to Du Bois and De Bouvier!) social theories.",
    "It's a really interesting take on a lot of the thinkers and not a ton of work. It's a little annoying that it has a section but the lectures are great. And honestly, it was very easy. No reason not to take it if you're interested in the material. I hadn't studied most of the people that we talked about and I never felt at a disadvantage. It was a great intro to the material.",
    "Real survey class on the major social theorists. Also a great class structure (5 quizzes and 2 small papers) that makes the material accessible and the workload very manageable.",
    "Take it! Such an interesting class. I think everyone needs to do these readings anyways sometime in their lifetime. The workload was not bad at all. I loved that we didn't have a final exam or a midterm. There were two really fun, open-ended papers to write. We also had 5 quizzes throughout the semester that were straightforward and fair. I actually enjoyed that we had quizzes because it made everyone accountable for engaging with the readings.",
    "This is a surprisingly good intro course. The lectures are interesting - Professor Erikson does a great job of contextualizing each of the theorists and explaining concepts that can be difficult to understand on first read. The assignments - 5 exams and 2 papers - are very straightforward, and if you take good notes during lecture, you will be fine.",
    "A fun, relatively easy class. I took it as a 5th, Credit\/D class; I should have just gone for the grade. The exams\/papers are totally do-able and the readings are long but even just skimming prepares you for class (where the lecture explains them well).The material itself is interesting; it's a socialogy rather than poli\/sci class which changes the slant of the readings and makes them more interesting; even if you've read Smith& Marx in the past, you probably have read them in regards to Economics rather than sociology.",
    "Foundations of Modern Social Theory is a good overview of the different theorists that have built the understanding of thought and society. Lectures are essential for succeeding in this class, since Professor Erikson is very good at explaining the readings. Take it, especially if you're a sociology major.",
    "I would definitely recommend this section to people who are actually willing to do most of the readings and are unfamiliar with some of the listed authors we read. I wouldn't recommend it to people who already have experience with many of these authors. In my opinion, how much you get out of this class primarily depends on how much of the reading you do. Lecture gives a broad overview, albeit insightful.",
    "Great class, relevant material, a good background for further study in Sociology or Political Science. Professor Erikson is wonderful.8\/10 would recommend. Sometimes the reading is incredibly dense (read: dull). Just be sure to do them carefully before section.",
    "Great class that introduces you to some fantastic and intriguing thinkers. Professor Erikson keeps lectures on topic and relevant, and the grading structure is really nice (5 quizzes thought the semester and two papers). If you want to learn different views on societies and social interaction, and want to read some great theorists to do so, this is a great option.",
    "I would do it, since it is a course that makes you think and that provided me with the possibility of thinking, reading and get to know authors that are relevant to modern thought, thus it is one of those courses that I enjoyed.A strength is that the readings were sometimes demanding but they were very well selected so as to read what is important out of each author and with certain guide, unlike reading full books were great part of it would not be relevant for the course. This kept it focus and motivated me to read all of the readings.",
    "Yes! Even if you are not a humanities\/philosophy\/sociology major, take it! It was my favorite class this semester, one of my favorites at Yale overall (I am an engineering major). The workload is extremely manageable and the readings are well selected, so you don't have to read entire books just to understand a few nuanced points. The lectures provide basically everything you need to know for the quizzes and are also really interesting and entertaining. Prof. Erikson may seem a little out of it at times, but it works with the topic and doesn't affect her ability to transmit knowledge.",
    "This course involves a lot of philosophers, reading, and understanding theories. If that fits the bill, then this will work well.",
    "Pretty good course, but it was hit or miss with the section. My TA was great but section could be boring\/feel like a waste of time.",
    "This is a great overview of social theory. Emphasis on overview. If you are expecting in depth reviews of these theorists, you should look for another class. However, it is excellent for getting exposed to the material.",
    "YES, take this class if you want a nice intro to philosophy or sociology. You'll cover most of the greats and must reads in the field",
    "Yes, absolutely take this class, regardless of your major...",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. Even though my major is not sociology, I could apply the theories that I learned in this class for many different fields of study. This class will broaden your perspective enormously.",
    "This is a really useful class. The readings are so interesting and are things that everyone should read as part of a liberal arts course of study: Marx, Weber, Rousseau, etc. As a nonsociology major who didn't have much experience with social theory or philosophy, I still found the class accessible and interesting. Professor Erikson's lectures are so helpful, it's really difficult to understand the material if you don't attend class. If you go to lecture, the class is quite easy. The workload is manageable, five quizzes on the readings and two papers. Take this class, it's a great way to get a broad overview of important concepts in social theory!",
    "Modern social theory is a very broad survey of the sociology canon. The reading list seems very interesting but i wouldn't recommend it to a fellow student. It is too broad to go into any depth. I realized I don't like sociology at all, but maybe somebody else would like it.",
    "Yes, if you're looking for an introduction to sociology.",
    "This does what it say on the tin: provides a clear and basic foundation for modern social theory. The class is not enormously challenging: five two question in class quizzes (30 mins), two short papers comparing two theorists, and section. Most students aren't super engaged with the material, and Professor Erikson summarizes so well as to make only reading unnecessary to do well in the quizzes - but if you read, it will be a lot more rewarding, and section will be a breeze. The structure of assessment also pushes you to remember the key elements of every reading, so that you really do walk away with a foundation of theory; the fact that you read them out of chronological order also means that you make unusual, interesting comparisons between theorists along the way.",
    "I thought this class was a great introduction to sociology and social theory. The readings and theorists we covered were definitely impressive, and I learned a great deal about the different perspectives of many important thinkers whoseideas and works continue to shape our understanding of society today. Professor Erikson I also found to be an excellent instructor, very kind, patient, and highly approachable. Her lectures were interesting and engaging, and she was clearly very knowledgeable about all the social theorists we discussed. She welcomed questions and participation during lecture as well as questions after class and even offered to read rough drafts of our papers, which I found very thoughtful. The work was nicely distributed over the course of the semester with readings assigned for each class, five quizzes (each worth 10 percent of our grade) in place of a midterm or final, and two very reasonable 5- to 6-page papers (each worth 20 percent of our grade). If you're looking for a good introduction to social theory and a chance to read and discuss the works of some really great theorists you've always wanted to read, I'd definitely recommend this class.",
    "Absolutely. You LEARN, which is obviously satisfying! The in-class experience is very laid back - there's no onus to participate, but Professor Erikson invites questions and sometimes it really helps to pipe up. Honestly, the five quizzes policy is actually genius, as it forces you to go back and review, and not just slide through the works without \"checking\" yourself. The five quizzes are a VERY good idea, as they force you to go back and hold yourself accountable. It is a VERY laid back course, and the workload is TINY. Because the lectures are so comprehensive, the in-class experience sort of disincentives reading on your own - obviously good and bad. I wish the class would have been a BIT more rigorous."
