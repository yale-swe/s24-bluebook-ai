    "FORMAC is a good class. It's not as interesting or as well-taught as the Matthew Jacobson's FORMAC, but overall, I would recommend it. The readings are enjoyable.",
    "If you're into cultural history and the Gilded\/Progressive ages, it's a solid class to take. Prof. Agnew delivers whirlwind lectures that show how the nation's culture formed post-Civil War and how the trends developed then resonate today.",
    "This course is a great overview of the cultural events in a tumultuous and crucial period in the development of America's national identity. Professor Agnew strings together literature, history, and art to form a comprehensive cultural understanding of the period. While this multi-dimensional approach can hinder a student's ability to understand the underlying historical chronology, it provides a great opportunity for students to study a great swath of American literature from a concentrated period, without having to take a seminar. I would absolutely recommend this class to another student, even if they have no interest in American history.",
    "Absolutely take this class! It will change you. Professor Agnew delivers lectures like telling a story. He is both a pleasure and a privilege to listen to in class. This class was interestingly and creatively organized. I left class learning something new, and thinking about that lecture for the rest of the day every day.",
    "I would recommend FORMAC to everyone. For history majors, this class is a great way to learn about this time period while also developing new skills in the use of cultural artifacts in crafting historical arguments. I'm a junior, and I learned so much from FORMAC in terms of content and skills, so I would especially recommend this to underclassmen who are interested in the history major and want a solid foundation for other courses. That said, it's pretty different from other history lectures I've taken-- much more interpretive, and sometimes Agnew makes claims or implications that seem not fully borne out by the evidence, or maybe overstated given the evidence he's presented. I loved that though because I found it challenged me to try to think in similar terms in other history classes, to see what kinds of connections I could find between people and events (this might not make sense but I promise if you take the class you'll see what I mean!). Because FORMAC is pretty unusual, I think it would also appeal to a non-history\/AmStud major. The readings are literature, essays, and speeches from the time period, so generally it's a lot of fun to complete them. I also enjoyed writing the papers and even taking the exams. Both the midterm and the final had some components that were different from your standard IDs and essay questions, so they were actually an opportunity to do some creative thinking instead of just regurgitation.",
    "Take this class! Agnew's lectures are wonderfully insightful and the material is extremely interesting. As someone who has never studied this period before, it was a great way to be introduced to it. The workload isn't bad at all - Midterm, 2 papers, and a final! Prof. Agnew gives you so many exciting prompts that the papers are actually fun to write!",
    "A harder version of 1920-Present FORMAC. Definitely better suited for a HIST or AMST major because he does do the lectures by themes and sometimes flies through topics very quickly and can be hard to follow. You do need to do the readings in this class, more so than the later formac, and they consist of more primary sources instead of secondary sources. That being said, Agnew is a great lecturer and is clearly very knowledgable but I would definitely recommend taking the later FORMAC first to give you a better idea of the class format.",
    "This is a fantastic course: from the readings to the lectures to the sections, all aspects of it were fascinating. I found the exams pretty fair and representative, and the essays were fun ways to explore the primary sources in more depth. The readings are not a huge workload, and I would highly recommend keeping up with them: the essays are based on your understanding of them, and they're a great way to better understand and connect with the material.",
    "Although Professor Agnew's lecturing takes a while to get used to, this is ultimately a breathtaking and wonderful course. Each lecture weaves sharp analysis with vivid images, and is a joy to attend. Overall, the syllabus is pretty easy: two 5 page papers, a midterm, and option between a take-home and in-class final. 9\/10 would recommend.",
    "Take this class!!!! It will make you fall in love with American Studies!",
    "This class is alright. It's interesting and provides an interesting method of historical analysis. I found it to be a bit dry at times, though. Also, it could be difficult to follow because he speaks fairly quickly. He does make outlines for each lecture, though, which are very useful. The reading list is great.",
    "AA ForMAC is a must-take for anyone thinking about American Studies or History. Agnew is an amazing lecturer - one of the best at Yale - his lectures draw out the important themes of the course and ensure that students understand the thread that he is pulling through all of the names, pictures, songs, and movies that are shown in the course. Every lecture is like a symphony. The papers are pretty easy and the test questions are broad so as long as you've been attending lecture you should be fine. It seems like a random time period, which turns some people away from the class, but a lot of extremely important events and cultural movements happened that are the basis for how America is today.",
    "Standard history course with a little bit more of an emphasis on cultural study in the latter half of the course.",
    "A really eye-opening course. It can be challenging at times and there's a lot of reading to keep track of but overall I think I came out of it with a completely new way of looking at documents as cultural documents and with a new method of analysis. Would recommend. Would recommend for people who haven't taken an AMST\/History class before to maybe start it off as CR\/D\/F.",
    "I would recommend this course.",
    "Awesome course",
    "This is an amazing course, and it really changes the way one looks at American history and history at large. Professor Agnew is an amazing lecturer, and the work load is more than reasonable. Absolutely take this course!",
    "I am neutral about this class. Its okay if you want an AMST credit, but I didn't love it.",
    "This is an essential class! The time frame covered was ideal. The themes for the lectures were ideal. And the style of delivery was ideal. My only complaint was in the readings, a bit too diverse to pick up on common themes. Take it! You will gain a new appreciation for American society and its history.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course - the material was extremely interesting and relevant to understanding current American culture and politics, and will certainly inform my other studies in the arts and humanities.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. It's a way of looking at history that's not normally taught, and it's really effective at giving a new lens to my time period of focus.",
    "Yes, I definitely recommend this class to anyone at Yale! The readings are diverse and interesting, not heavy at all--I looked forward to reading them, as much of their content regarding culture during the turn of the 20th century still apply in America today. The class was fascinating, and I am looking forward to taking the second half next year."
