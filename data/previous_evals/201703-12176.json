    "Selection and variety of inscriptions was good. Discussion of epigraphic and paleographic issues was good. Could use a bit more discussion of grammatical issues and topics.",
    "A strength of the course was the way that we went through the inscriptions, usually word by word, to discuss the meaning and significance. Going through the grammar like this is helpful for me to understand how the grammatical aspects work in context. I do think that the class could initially benefit from either a grammar text book, or some references to early grammar\/how it changes throughout time."
