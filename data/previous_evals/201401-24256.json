    "TAKE IT! Amazing course without too much work. You learn a LOT!",
    "Yes, unequivocally! This course is 100% worth taking. Janna and Jessica are effective instructors and two of the greatest people you will ever meet!",
    "Yes, I would absolutely recommend this course. I think it is extremely important for EVERYONE to understand the child care system in the US and how we can change it. The professors are absolutely wonderful, and you will learn so much from the course. It's a collaborative experience and such a great class. Take it!",
    "YES TAKE IT IF YOU CAN GET IN. I really enjoyed this class as I learned so much and thought the material we covered was extremely interesting. Fantastic course. Probably one of my favorites at Yale.",
    "This is definitely my favorite class I've taken at Yale. Definitely take it if you can get in! Getting to learn from Janna and Jessica who have so much experience in the field is an amazing opportunity and they're also both wonderful professors. I found myself looking forward to this class every week and the readings are almost all very interesting. My entire group of friends knows the entire syllabus of this course at this point because I talked about it so much. This class has changed my outlook on education so much and everyone should take it!",
    "BEST CLASS EVER. If you care at all about child care, education, women's role in families\/the work place, public policy, economics, child development, psychology, life, etc., TAKE IT IF YOU CAN! Janna and Jessica are the sweetest professors ever and are SO knowledgeable about these hugely important topics. The reading load is challenging but manageable if you don't leave it to the night before, and the opportunity to visit child care facilities around New Haven is incredible. I learned SO much from this class and wish I could take it over again. Could not recommend more highly.",
    "Relaxed atmosphere, not too much work. Jessica and Janna want you to do well and don't want to stress you out. Daycare site visits we're AMAZING. A topic Yalies should think about more often.",
    "One of the best courses I have ever taken. The readings are fascinating, the students are passionate, the professors are wonderful, and the assignments are applicable and fun. Plus, it's a topic relevant to everyone. If you can get in, TAKE IT.",
    "This class is an incredible introduction to the childcare system and its flaws in the United States. It will make you think about something that you may have never considered before. The teachers (Jessica Sager and Janna Wagner) are superb and could not be nicer or more helpful. The workload is totally manageable (basically two short papers and a final paper 15-20 pages) and the weekly readings are totally engaging. Take it take it take it.",
    "I would recommend this seminar to another student, even if you do not know anything about childcare! The readings are very eye-opening and the instructors are great resources!",
    "Jessica and Janna are the nicest, smartest and most innovative professors around. They're so helpful. MY favorite part of the class was the final project, where it really felt I was coming up with something that could make a difference.",
    "Yes, go and get your mind-blown about the necessity and importance of early childhood education!!"
