   "comments": [
    "I would highly recommend the class. The class is not easy by any means. We read on average about one book per week. The class is intellectually stimulation and Prof. Engelstein is a very tough grader who will not except anything but excellence.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course --- it's small size is great for teacher-student interaction and the reading list is really great.",
    "Take this class, especially as a seminar follow-up to any lecture on 20th century Europe! As Prof. Engelstein says, you're not going to remember everything from college, but you are going to remember the great books you read. The reading list is impeccable, and Prof. Engelstein is both caring and extremely knowledgeable. There are only two five-page papers and a final ten-page paper, which is the lightest workload I have experienced in a junior seminar. For some reason, this class was overwhelmingly undersubscribed this semester, which is a shame. She'll be on sabbatical for the 2013 calendar year, but don't miss out when she gets back!",
    "This is a great course. It draws on a wide variety of primary sources to view important events of the twentieth century through the eyes of gifted writers. In addition to some well known writers (Nabokov, Levi), it includes some lesser known writers who are truly memorable and whom you might not find any other way. You will also get great feedback and coaching on your writing."
