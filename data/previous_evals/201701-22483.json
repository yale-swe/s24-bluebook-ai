   "comments": [
    "I got great exposure to pathology through the different blocks: cells and tissues, hematology, gastrointestinal system, renal, and cancer. This was a good course to take before entering medical school.",
    "In this course, you learn about what happens when various systems in the body get injured. In theory, this sounds very interesting, but since we covered 5 different systems in one semester, with 5 lecture periods taken up for tests about each block, the knowledge I gained was very broad and shallow. I would rather have gone into one system in depth instead.",
    "I learned all about disease pathology with specific examples from organ systems.",
    "Great class on different pathophysiological pathways. Lots of theoretical background and clinical cases about diseases.",
    "Normal function of a number of organ systems as well as disease systems. Disease pathology and what happens when something goes wrong and why that happens.",
    "A much better understanding of the systems of the body and how they respond to injury on a cellular level",
    "I gained a more complete understanding of many biological mechanisms covered briefly in lower level biology courses.",
    "I developed a new context to look at disease in the human body. Understanding how and why all types of disease, including, the body's response to cancer occur and in what way.",
    "I learned about the molecular and cellular basis of biological injuries and how they manifest themselves in various body systems and diseases. I also learned the diagnostic features of biological injury that allow physicians to identify diseases and prescribe the correct treatment, and I also learned the role of various diagnostic tools, such as gross appearance, light microscopy, and diagnostic tests."

   "comments": [
    "All 5 professors are great instructors who are experts in their fields. I'm glad I took this class. Dr. Hudnall is a great course organizer. I'm surprised that more students don't know about this course.",
    "Pros: As a hopeful-doctor, I learned a great deal about mechanisms of human diseases at different levels. As you learn the diseases, you will naturally learn the anatomy\/physiology without focusing on memorizing them too much: the logical thought process of tracing the disease back to its etiology made me learn anatomy\/physiology naturally. This was not only helpful for the MCAT but also for thinking like a physician\/diagnosing diseases, a skill you probably won't find in other undergraduate classes. There weren't any review sessions offered for exams but the teaching assistants made study guides and power points which actually answered most of my questions and reduced the need to set up a meeting or email to ask. Grading was also reasonable and predictable as they set up a definitive cut-off for letter grade distribution so collaborative environment can be fostered if you have\/make some friends in the class. If you happened to bomb one of the test, there was an optional 10-page writing assignment that could replace your lowest test grade- but this may or may not be offered in the future. Cons: The fact that you have an exam every 2 weeks meant that there's an exam just around the end of the reading period. Missing a single lecture could hurt a lot on the exams (it's 25% of a test!) if you don't have friends to thoroughly explain the slides. Although the switching of the course instructor every 4 lecture was slightly hectic, it was worth it as they were experts in their respective fields. However, this was problematic in weekly discussion sections as it was hard for a section to prepare you for an exam. This made the course almost impossible to be organized as well as other big intro classes. This was somewhat compensated by the teaching assistants' study guides\/notes and accessibility by email.",
    "The strengths of this course was that the material was very interesting and most professors were great. However, there was little to no coherence between the separate blocks, and lots of time was wasted giving tests every 2-3 weeks. I believe the course could be improved by having more coherence between blocks and fewer tests. Also, it was extremely disrespectful of the TAs in the course to take a month to grade each of our exams.",
    "I think that the tests varied widely in difficulty, and adding points to the top of the grade doesn't really account for a class where most of us were getting 80s but one person would get a 99\/100. The grading itself was also very opaque. I would probably take this Credit\/D if I were to take it again, even though it does fulfill an MCDB req.",
    "can be dull, vary topics",
    "I loved this class! Wouldn't change anything about it. It was fascinating, lecturers were great, and I liked the grading setup. One change: get better TAs.",
    "The format of the class made it really relaxed - 5 non-culmulative exams from which you get to drop one, with the option of writing a paper to substitute a different grade. Really generous policy and grading. Most of the lecturers were phenomenal and engaging, although obviously some were better than others",
    "Great to have a few great guest lecturers who are very knowledgeable in their field and were able to break it down for students. Lots of information, but broken up into 5 different blocks was manageable.",
    "The five exams was a great format, and I liked how we jumped from unit to unit. The multiple professors made it difficult to develop a rapport with the lecturers, and some were much better than others.",
    "I appreciated the opportunity to interact with and learn from medical doctors. This course increased my excitement for medical school.",
    "I loved this course - I felt that I gained a lot in terms of thinking of the body's responses systemically, and was always engaged by the lecturers. The grading curve was extremely generous, and the optional paper provided an opportunity to explore one topic in depth if you wanted to replace an exam score. The worst thing about this course was honestly Piazza, because the emails are super annoying and it just gave students who wanted to complain about exams and ask for grade boosts an outlet. The information itself was awesome, and the 5 non-cumulative exams (allowing you to drop 1 and replace with a paper for a 2nd) were not especially difficult or unreasonable.",
    "The strengths of this course relied on the different topics that were discussed being separate from one another to get a flavor of the manifestation of disease in all different types of systems. However, it would have been beneficial to have a building overall arch to the structure, building up on previous information in a new way.",
    "The course is very well taught by all of its professors, and the exams and grading are very fair. As a class that is taken primarily by premedical students, it did a great job of tying the biochemical and clinical aspects of diseases. The variety of systems offered made the course even more interesting."

   "comments": [
    "The workload can be heavy but it's a good course .",
    "It's a great introduction to a variety of topics in pathology, and I feel confident going into the medical field after having taken this class.",
    "Yes. NO FINAL. If you're MCDB, take this class. You learn a lot. It's 5 tests over the term. Drop the lowest test (this means if you do well on your first 4 exams, you don't have to show up to class for the remaining 3 weeks at the end of April\/start of May). Good deal, low stress, and you can shadow your teachers (all of whom are MD\/PhDs and practicing physicians).",
    "Pros: I took this class as a premed MCDB junior. To be honest, I was initially enticed by the policy of having no final and dropping 1 of the 5 exams. Despite my wrong motivation, taking this class ended up being one of the best decisions I made during this academic year. As a hopeful-doctor, I learned a great deal about mechanisms of human diseases at different levels. As you learn the diseases, you will naturally learn the anatomy\/physiology without focusing on memorizing them too much: the logical thought process of tracing the disease back to its etiology made me learn anatomy\/physiology naturally. This was not only helpful for the MCAT but also for thinking like a physician\/diagnosing diseases, a skill you probably won't find in other undergraduate classes. Also, if you have a lot of finals from other classes, then take this class and ace the first four exams- it wasn't really hard to do as memorization of just 4 lectures was usually sufficient. I know some students did this and just went to class for an entire month without the pressure of taking the test- definitely a refreshing experience. There weren't any review sessions offered for exams but the teaching assistants made study guides and power points which actually answered most of my questions and reduced the need to set up a meeting or email to ask. Grading was also reasonable and predictable as they set up a definitive cut-off for letter grade distribution so collaborative environment can be fostered if you have\/make some friends in the class. If you happened to bomb one of the test, there was an optional 10-page writing assignment that could replace your lowest test grade- but this may or may not be offered in the future. In these regards, I think it is a very good class for premeds who are grade-conscious, want a leg up on the MCATs and learn medicine- doesn't this apply to all premeds anyways? Cons: The fact that you have an exam every 2 weeks meant that there's an exam just around the end of the reading period so make sure to go to all lecture from the start. Missing a single lecture could hurt a lot on the exams (it's 25% of a test!) if you don't have friends to thoroughly explain the slides. Although the switching of the course instructor every 4 lecture was slightly hectic, it was worth it as they were experts in their respective fields. However, this was problematic in weekly discussion sections as it was hard for a section to prepare you for an exam. This made the course almost impossible to be organized as well as other big intro classes. This was somewhat compensated by the teaching assistants' study guides\/notes and accessibility by email.",
    "No. The lectures are very disorganized. The TAs are not willing to meet, consistently cancel sections, and the exams are graded very arbitrary by TAs because most of the professors do not give them answer keys. Overall, in comparison with cell bio (I took both this semester), the professors are much more unorganized, the TAs do not facilitate learning, and the exams are not fair reflections of material learned.",
    "I would recommend it to a student who is interested in Pathobiology. I would recommend not taking this course for a letter grade.",
    "yes, interesting but in depth",
    "I would recommend this course because you will learn a lot and the material is generally interesting. However, some of the lecturers are much better than others and the course was not incredibly well organized.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS. IT IS AMAZING! I'M SO GLAD I FOUND IT. I HOPE MED SCHOOL IS LIKE THIS BECAUSE I ABSOLUTELY LOVED THIS. THE PROFS WERE 10\/10, THE MATERIAL WAS SO SO INTERESTING, AND THE GRADING SYSTEM IS PERFECT.",
    "Definitely. Great and really interesting class, not very high stress. The biweekly exam does cover a lot of material, but its all extremely doable. The slides\/notes from each section were all organized really well.",
    "I found this course quite interesting as a biology major. I was at a point in my yale education where I was able to have enough background to understand most topics presented after review. Lecturers were great and pretty relaxed and approachable. The structure of the class was also very manageable and is set up to give you good chances to get a good overall grade.",
    "Good course, interesting material. Only 5 exams for the format which was awesome.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone interested in pursuing a future in medicine.",
    "I loved this course - it's one of the few courses at Yale undergrad focused on human biology. The grading curve was extremely generous, and the optional paper provided an opportunity to explore one topic in depth if you wanted to replace an exam score. The worst thing about this course was honestly Piazza emails. The information itself was awesome, and the 5 non-cumulative exams (allowing you to drop 1 and replace with a paper for a 2nd) were not especially difficult or unreasonable. The expectations for the class are extremely clear, and you know how you're doing in the class the whole time, which is really helpful. It's not graded on a bell curve, so don't worry about competing with classmates. As a second-semester senior, I found this class very laid-back and much easier than my other MCDB classes. Highly recommend.",
    "I would recommend this to any bio person of any major. It does need some understanding of physiology to help with the contextualization of the material but it is not necessary. It is just overall fascinating to learn about all different cancers and just how and why pathology is central to biology.",
    "Excellent course for the premed or anyone interested in learning about some interesting systems in the body. It has 5 midterms, which actually doesn't come out that bad in terms of studying and preparation, and all of the professors lecture pretty well and provide notes for their presentations. Unlike other biology or biochem courses, the professors put a lot of effort into tying the molecular and cellular injuries to clinical manifestations, making it feel more like a real pathophysiology class. I greatly enjoyed it."
