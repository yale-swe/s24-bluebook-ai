    "I would definitely recommend this course. A great way to hone programming and math skills simultaneously.",
    "It is very useful. Yes, definitely I will.",
    "A really good course for students doing computation or data analysis.Yes, absolutely. They will really learn something useful and not easily lost.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to a fellow student as it would teach important numerical methods in a rigorous fashion.",
    "YES",
    "ENAS 747 01 is an introductory class in Numerical Methods. It deals with some of the main topics in Numerical Methods (root finding, linear systems, integration, interpolation). I would surely recommend this course to another student. The subjects are explored in depth and in a very clear manner, and the homework assignments ensure also the acquirement of a practice knowledge of the methods.",
    "Sure, I will recommend this class to other students whose major is related to math calculation. It will pave the way for your future research to some degree.",
    "I would recommend this class for students wanting to learn how to write programs, but I would let them know its a hard course."

    "It is good supplement dealing with complicated equations that I dealed with in other courses. I could use the programs in the homework to figure out the answers to these equations.I",
    "The course gave me an good introduction to computation and coding. It helps me a lot with my research.",
    "Numerical Methods are routinely used in my research, and sometimes in the past I maybe used them without having an appropriate knowledge. This course gave me many instruments to evaluate a method and to understand its eventual limitations.",
    "Itdeepens my knowledge of discipline mainly by providing me with the numerical thought to handle my research data.",
    "This course helped me learn a how to program in matlab, which will be useful for producing models."
