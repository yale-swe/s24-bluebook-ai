   "comments": [
    "This course helped me gain a clearer understanding of what constitutes a \"poetics\" versus poetry in general, and gave me a better handle on how to articulate a poetics, as well as talk about poetics.",
    "There are many English classes at Yale that teach and celebrate the teaching of how to read poetry. ENGL 476 both rejects and radicalizes this model: Rather than the how or what of the poem, the fundamental object of study is the why, and only from this root inquiry do the other interrogatives gain meaning. The poetry discussed is resistant and unwieldily and, to some, perhaps, treasonous, blight and betrayal of a literary heritage. But value judgements aside, the contemporary poem has a certain intelligence; it is constantly questioning itself and its language, and it demands a particularly active and meta-poetic approach. To appreciate is not to be lifted off by lyric legerdemain but to engage, with sweat and difficulty, at the poems ground level. Ultimately, this, as skill and worldview, is what I found most valuable. ENGL 476 encourages a kind of critical patience, an unremitting poetic and meta-poetic attention a commitment to examine not only the poem but the terms of the poem. And to take up these terms with a centripetal force: indivisible from the poetry itself.",
    "The class provided a useful survey of the theory and techniques behind much contemporary poetry. I became more aware of the artistic and philosophical missions and practices that drive the work of many contemporary poets. This knowledge has a made me a more skillful, open-minded poet."

   "comments": [
    "Some conversations could have been a bit deeper and more involved, given the significance of the material. But I suppose this is always a gamble in student-led discussions.",
    "We read great stuff and met great authors. What we did with this material was ultimately constrained by the structure of the seminar. It was not the best group. As Professor Deming mentioned repeatedly, we were a \"quiet bunch\". When we did get into discussions, we often got hung up on what felt like minute points of grammar. While such things are often important to talk about, I would usually sacrifice them for the sake of discussing larger elements of theme and structure. This was my first english seminar, so maybe I'm missing the point. Regardless, within the discussions of small things, we often drifted into speculation and abstraction. Prof. Deming did well to push back on us."

   "comments": [
    "If you're looking for a course that focuses more on writing poetry but has no application, I recommend Reading Poetry for Craft. That course also has a broader but less focused reading list. This class is better for looking at entire collections of specific authors and analyzing poetics specifically. Professor Deming was great but it really depends on the other students in the class. I enjoyed it but sometimes found it a little heady.",
    "If you have a standing interest in the subject matter, you will really enjoy this course. Professor Deming is a really excellent instructor and discussion leader, and meeting the poets you read is pretty special. I would advise that it certainly isn't an introductory course, so probably not a great fit if you're not already excited about poetry&poetics.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course! Professor Deming is so invested in helping his students learn and the reading list is excellent; the class visits by the poets we read added an incredible dimension to the learning experience.",
    "The search for form and purpose in contemporary poems can be frustrating. This really course helped me make sense of this art form (and not make sense of it, which, as we discussed, is sometimes just as important). The discussions with poets whose work we read were great opportunities to trace the connections between the poems and the thoughts from which they arose. The seminar form could be frustrating at times, but Professor Deming worked well within it, and I ended up learning and enjoying myself a lot."
