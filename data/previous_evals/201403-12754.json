    "In general a cool class. But don't take it with Kim Dang! She is incompetent, not doesn't have regular office hours or the like, and has zero committed\/doesn't seem to care about the class at all. Take it with Coifman, but don't take it with Kim Dang. Worst teacher I've ever had!",
    "As one of my friends described it, it has the highest ratio of material learned to effort put in of just about any class I've taken at Yale. We had no problem sets, and presentations in place of exams, though I think if the class had been larger we would have had a take home exam or two--still pretty chill. But I also learned a ton. I'm a physics major, and I would recommend this class if you want to learn more of the math behind quantum mechanics, e.g. Hilbert space, square-integrable functions, orthogonal polynomials, and the general treatment of functions as vectors. Also anyone else who wants an easy but interesting QR credit.",
    "Yes I would recommend this course as a more casual math course, that really allows students to explore some areas they may not have seen before in a stress-free manner. You'll get out of it what you put in, so if you don't spend time reading through lecture notes or thinking about this material you probably won't learn as much (since there aren't any problem sets). The presentations are a nice change from other math courses. They also let you catch a glimpse at teaching, which should be helpful to students considering PhD programs.",
    "Take this course! I came in only with some rusty math from Phys 301 and was fine. It's a low-stress course that you can get a lot out of. Prof. Dang is an excellent lecturer."
