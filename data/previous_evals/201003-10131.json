   "comments": [
    "Would absolutely recommend this for anyone interested in the Civil War, American history, race relations, memory studies, film studies, etc...",
    "Good hard look at the way Americans remember the civil war and teh different ways they choose to use it in history.",
    "Great class! Take it if offered again. I'm a bit biased--I love the Civil War--but the class would still be fascinating otherwise.",
    "Absolutely. Best class I've taken so far at Yale. Workload was manageable and the readings were great! If you have any interest at all in the Civil War and how it has influenced American culture and national conscious since 1865, this class is perfect.",
    "An overview of the different ways that the Civil War was remembered from Appomattox onward. Starting with reactions to the conflict immediately after it ended and going all the way to present day.I would definitely recommend it. Not only is the subject matter good, but Sam teaches the course. That's all that really matters.",
    "Take this course. It covers a fascinating topic and offers the chance to read some very interesting material (Blight, Horwitz, plenty of primary documents) and watch some historically-related movies (Birth of a Nation, Gone with the Wind, Glory) in a comfortable setting with students from across Yale. The workload varies week to week, but only when we started the term paper did things get tough time-wise.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class to another student.It is an awesome course that gives you an excellent understanding of the significant and continued role the Civil War plays in our national consciousness as well as provides different perspectives on historical memory. The class discussions are great. The reading is interesting and very manageable and the paper is well spaced out so it is not overwhelming. If you're looking for a fulfilling and interesting seminar that it is not super demanding, this is the course for you.",
    "I probably wouldn't. Professor Schaffer is a great guy, but maybe not the best professor. The course suffers because the discussions always meandered, and I don't feel as though I've come out of the course knowing a ton more about Civil War memory, let alone even historical memory in general."
