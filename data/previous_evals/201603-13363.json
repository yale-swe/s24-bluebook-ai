    "Instructor: Ralien Catootje Bekkers \u00a0Ralien seemed tasked with organizing pretty much every aspect of the class, and appeared to be overwhelmed as a result. The way she ran the class made a lot of sense to spread out the work and discussion leading across the students, but I think there needed to be a stronger lead. Often times it seemed like the class didn't go in the right direction or lead to major takeaways at the end. Though she did make a good effort, I don't think Ralien had the experience necessary to teach the class in the way that was demanded of her."

The class needs permanent lecturer who can walk the students through each step of sustainable development implementation. Ralien (and Adam) covered the SDG process, negotiations and introductory aspects very well!"

    "The field trip and guest speakers.",
    "The field trip and some guest lectures (Susan Alzner, Jimena Leiva and perhaps David O'Connor) were the highlights. I appreciated the group that spelled out what implementation really is, and how the SDGs can be turned into actions. That should be kept. The lecture that reviewed definitions of goals, targets, indicators and the politics of the negotiations was also super helpful for understanding the basics of the process before the SDGs' adoption. I think the first week or two of classes meandered without much focus until that lecture clarified basic questions around concepts and the UN process itself."

    "More structure, more content, more clarity re: assignments",

    "I think that the classs might need to have more focus in the implementation tool for the SDG's and not so much in the global framework that surrounds the SDG's. In that sense, it might be important to take more time exploring implementing reports and methods: Logic Model, Theory of Change and others: Stakeholder engagement.",
    "Overall structure of class time and more guidance on final paper.",
    "There needs to be a dedicated lecturer and a more organized schedule. Also deadlines. The lack (and removal) of interim deadlines for the final paper had most of the class scrambling at the end. Despite the one on one meetings, I felt there was minimal feedback on the earlier drafts. There were a lot of readings assigned that we never covered. We also rarely reviewed the discussion questions submitted to Canvas. The only time these were brought into the classroom was during the week on business when there was nothing else to do (but I thought it was useful to discuss these questions in-person, because everyone had already put some thought into them)."

    "Not really. I now have a good understanding of the process, but there was only a cursory overview of means of IMPLEMENTATION, and what implementation really looks like within a country, city or region. These two aspects felt like the blind leading the blind in class, with most students approaching the questions from their entrenched ways of thinking and professional background (be it USAID, Monitoring and Evaluation, the UN, a think tank, etc) and not gaining much. I also would have liked more feedback on my initial draft paper. This was where I explored how implementation actually might happen, but I did so without much guidance."
