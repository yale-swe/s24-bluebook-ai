   "comments": [
    "I would highly recommend English 333 to a fellow student. It is one of the best courses that I have taken at Yale.",
    "This is a good seminar, but probably only of interest to English majors or to people with an intense interest in the Renaissance and\/or humanism. The class does not focus on Ovid as much as one might think at first. The syllabus includes some Shakespeare and Milton, but be prepared for some relatively opaque satirical drama, prose stories, and pedagogical texts. I do not have a particular interest in the time period, so I found someof the texts to be difficult to get through. Professor Nicholson is very engaging, however, and very kind. There are 3 fairly-graded papers of increasing length and weekly discussion posts.",
    "The class reviews English Renaissance texts which engage with Ovidian examples, and analyzes how they do so and to what purpose. I would highly recommend this course.",
    "This class is a way of looking at the works of Ovid through the lens of Renaissance writing. It is very much about the Renaissance. If you like the Renaissance, you will like the class. Don't take it if you really want to study Ovid, as he isn't necessarily the focus. But it is a good course, a good way to get a pre-1800 requirement done, and not too bad work-wise.",
    "This class was absolutely amazing. I highly recommend it. The reading list is lots of fun and Catherine Nicholson is one of the best instructors I have had. I had read and studied several of the works before, but found myself looking at them from a completely new perspective after our lively class discussions.",
    "I really liked this class. Professor Nicholson is great, and I would recommend her to anyone for any class she teaches.",
    "Take this class if you're interested in how Ovid's Metamorphoses influenced writers in the English Renaissance and was adapted into poems, plays, and prose. You will read some people you've probably never heard of (Lyly, Marston, Ascham), as well as some giants (Spenser, Shakespeare, Milton), and study a very specific part of a very specific period in great depth. The version of Ovid you use is the version Shakespeare read, which is worth reading just for fun.",
    "I would highly recommend this class to anyone with an interest in strange literature, or to English majors looking for a unique way to fulfill a pre-1800. Although I wasn't particularly attracted to half the syllabus, I ended up loving almost all the texts we read, and enjoyed discussing even the works I hated (Benjamin Jonson, anyone?). Professor Nicholson is charming, brilliant, and adorably enthusiastic, and leads a great discussion - although she does sometimes go on a bit too long without letting the students jump back in. She is a hard grader, but I wouldn't let that deter you; her comments are so astute and smart that you can't help but learn and improve.",
    "I really enjoyed this class, but would only recommend to someone who is interested in both Ovid and the English Renaissance. Some of the readings were dense and occasionally boring, but Professor Nicholson's excitement about the material is infectious. Overall, I think this was a good class.",
    "So wonderful, by far the highlight of my semester. Fascinating discussions and manageable work load. And please don't judge the course by its syllabus! Professor Nicholson is one of the smartest, kindest, most articulate English professors in the department -- take a class with her, any class, and you'll learn an incredible amount."
