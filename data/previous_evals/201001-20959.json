    "It is a good class to expand upon your existing knowledge base in Immunology, touching on lots of different topics and adding the most current information to them. I would probably recommend the class to a friend if they already had a real good background in immuno and wanted to expand that knowledge.",
    "This course is designed to give immunology students a more detailed look at a variety of different areas of immunology using both lectures by P.I.s, discussions and reading of primary literature.I would definitely recommend this class to anyone interested in immunology with a firm background in the basics.",
    "Short introductions to broad topics of immunology not covered in the intro class, with focused examples.",
    "A basic knowledge of Immunology is required. If anyone is looking to further their knowledge of Immunology, this is the course to take."

   "comments": [
    "It was a broad course, so chances are only a small portion of it will actually come in handy for my thesis, but it was still good to expand my knowledge of immunology.",
    "This was extremely helpful in learning different areas of immunology that I wasn't quite as familiar with. More importantly, I feel a lot more comfortable talking with a lot of the P.I.s in the department at a more familiar level, and would be willing to go and ask them for ideas or help with my thesis project!",
    "This course was invaluable and I definitely learned a lot from reading important papers in a variety of fields other than my own.",
    "For the first years, not very much at all as we don't have a dissertation topic for our research yet. However, it was very helpful as a glimpse into what certain fields of research would involveif our interests were there, and the course is well-timed to help us think about choosing a lab from our rotations.",
    "This course build upon my knowledge of Immunology and provided me with good papers for various topics."
