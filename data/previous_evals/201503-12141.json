    "I would highly recommend this class for those who are interested in intelligence and national security.",
    "Take this class if you are interested in US Intelligence structure, otherwise I would not recommend it. The work load is pretty light, only 3 assignments. The professors are very knowledgeable and inspirational, but they rarely actually \"teach\" in class or voice their opinions. Discussions are monopolized by students, which can get a little tedious. There are a lot of readings - so be ready for that. No finals though, which is great, and the final paper is a topic of your choosing - so super interesting. For the group project - make sure you get team members who are prepared to contribute their share of the work load. You will learn a lot taking this class, but it can be repetitive and frustrating with students talking all the time.",
    "Incredible, but wish there had been more debate sometimes. My favorite part was the threat briefing, where I felt like we had to really understand and defend the material we presented.",
    "So.. it's kinda tough to have a course on a topic where 95% of the material is classified. But if you're interested in the US intelligence community this is a great shot at understanding the basics with the occasional juicy anecdote from Negroponte or Wittenstein. The memos are fun to write - just 800 words - and the threat assessment briefing at the end is surprisingly enjoyable in a group..as long as you get good partners. Final paper is your classic 20 page slog so be sure to pick a topic you're actually interested in.",
    "Really disappointing, avoid taking it.",
    "I would strongly recommend this course to anyone who is interested in intelligence, specifically as it relates to foreign policy. The topics are fascinating, and the readings are a great mix of policy recommendations, case studies, historical accounts, etc. Take the class, if anything, for the experiences and personal and professional knowledge Professors Negroponte and Wittenstein can offer to the course discussions, as well as those of the graduate students in the course, some of whom have come to Yale having worked in different parts of the IC. The workload itself is not too demanding and the assignments are all very interesting, as they require you to actually analyze intelligence and simulate being an analyst.",
    "A detailed survey into intelligence and foreign policy, spanning historical perspectives and up to the minute developments in geopolitics and international relations. Taught by two highly qualified and engaging professionals with unrivalled experience."
