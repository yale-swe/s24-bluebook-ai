   "comments": [
    "Definitely take the course. It will open up your world with regards to what can be done with literary analysis and archival research, exposes you to a great deal of exciting new prospects.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course, particularly to any fellow graduate student. Even just in terms of professional development, I think this was a tremendously important course in so far as it provided a comprehensive introduction to an increasingly important aspect of our discipline. Regardless of that, though, it was a wonderful learning experience.",
    "The course is interesting, fast-paced, diverse, and different (in a good way). I would therefore definitely recommend the course to another student. Start working at your digital project as early as you can, as it will probably take a lot more time than one thinks at first. Although the course itself has a quite digital\/alternative approach, I would encourage the student to pay careful attention to Brodsky's poetry as such, so as not to get too far detached from 'the subject itself.'"

   "comments": [
    "Gave me a much greater understanding of the world of Digital Humanities and the different types of projects and ways of approaching texts that were covered in the course. I will almost certainly look to incorporate some of these methods into my further research, especially as I move towards my dissertation.",
    "I accidentally kind of answered this above, but I should also add - it was a wonderful experience also in so far as I was exposed to archival research for the first time. I felt like this course really made uniquely terrific use of Yale's resources; now that I have spent a semester digging about in the innumerable boxes of the Beinecke, I am inspired to pursue further archival research as I begin to plan my dissertation project. I don't know to what extent I will use digital tools, but, more importantly, I am now aware of so many more directions my research could take.",
    "The course definitely gave me some new perspectives on my field at large by introducing new research approaches. These will also be useful for my own research."
