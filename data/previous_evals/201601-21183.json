   "comments": [
    "This was my first experience with a flipped classroom and I was really resistant to it at first. I would have done anything to switch out of this section, but my schedule wouldn't let me. However, once I got about halfway through the semester, I realized I kind of enjoyed what was essentially a seminar STEM class. Professor Urry was really open to questions and would definitely go back and explain things again if you were confused. Study halls are super annoying if you're not having trouble with the psets, but not the end of the world.",
    "Don't take this class if Urry is using learning catalytics. Find a study group and get together to do p-sets and study. Don't go to Peiyuan unless you have to.",
    "PHYS 181 is the second half of college physics, so it mostly covers E&M topics. This section used the flipped classroom method, so students had to complete readings and questions before the lecture. I had already taken AP physics and knew most of the material, so I cannot speak to how well this style works. I appreciated that the lecture was very small, and the pre-class work was minimal. I probably spent only a few hours a week on this class. I did not particularly love the class, but I think it was mostly well-taught and I would recommend it to another student.",
    "This is a TERRIBLE CLASS if you HAVE NOT HAD AP PHYSICS. Expect to spend dozens of hours more than those who have taken AP physics and still get worse grades. There needs to be a different section of physics offered for students without AP PHYSICS backgrounds.",
    "PHYS 181 is a tough but doable class. Don't fear it, but do get help immediately if you don't understand a topic or how to solve a problem. Try multiple TAs (and the professor!) and find one who will work with you. Study halls will help, especially the one the night before the pset is due (for our class, a Thursday night study hall. Try to clear your schedule), and office hours are also probably a good resource.",
    "Last year's Physics 181 class had horror stories to tell - but I think this year they reworked the course and it was better. Reading quizzes before class will always be a pain, but they pushed me to come to class with some idea of the material already, and that turned out to be super useful.",
    "A class that is best avoided. Unfortunately, options for intro physics are limited, so you might have no choice but to take this class. But I recommend considering all of those options before settling on this one. If you have the mathematical background, consider PHYS 201 or 261. These courses might be more challenging, but they won't waste your time like this one. If you are in need a truly introductory class, consider 171. This class will teach you very little. Lectures are unhelpful and a waste of time, but are mandatory. You will learn almost exclusively by reading the text. And in the end - if you read on your own - you will get a fine grade, but this will not mean much.",
    "I would not recommend this class. I wanted to take another one and only took this one because I had a required class at the time of the other physics class. The class was frustrating more than anything else. Coming away from it, we did cover a decent amount of ground (the pace was very fast), but I'm not confident that I learned so much. What I did learn I learned from breaking my head against the physics by struggling through the problem sets with friends. If you do have to take this class, make sure you have or form a friend group that you can work and commiserate with. If Professor Urry is actually teaching, the class won't be bad like it was...but it won't be super good.",
    "PHYS 181 is a fairly thorough exploration of physics concepts in electricity and magnetism, though in terms of mathematics does not go beyond the concepts explored early on in multivariable calculus classes. Generally, the mathematics taught in Math 120, the math corequisite for Phys 181, are not utilized in class, and the most significant involvement of the corequisite in this physics class seems to be clarification of some unfamiliar concepts and the use of three-dimensional graphs. It is important to note that there seems to be very little to no overlap between Phys 180 and 181, and as a student who did not take 180, there were only one or two points in the course where a \"refresher\" of mechanics concepts was needed. I would recommend this course to another student looking to explore E&M concepts, but who lacks an advanced mathematics background.",
    "A pretty easy summary of E&M topics, although there;s a good amount of time and energy that needs to be dedicated to the class, by nature of the flipped classroom."
