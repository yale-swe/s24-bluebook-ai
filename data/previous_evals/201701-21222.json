   "comments": [
    "It was a good course but I think there are other courses offered that would have been more beneficial to my education as a Computing and the Arts major. The department should consider this when they revise requirements in the coming years...",
    "This course taught me to recognize aesthetics and beauty through practice. We practiced charcoal drawing, sculpting, assemblages, and other skills through weekly projects and critiques. In critiques we plunged into discussions about the visual elements (like color, texture, or form) of various art pieces in order to uncover what about them was appealing. It changes the way you think about the world.",
    "I learned how to approach the process of making art faster and with more deliberation. I learned to trust my impulses and work with unfamiliar material.",
    "It is useful to note that I had already taken art classes throughout high school prior to taking this class, so I already had a foundation in the discipline and not everything covered by this class was new to me. However, I did gain a stronger vocabulary for talking about formal elements as well as much more experience with student critiques that offered me new insights about my personal work.",
    "I learned how to make a 3D sculpture in the round, as well as develop my own unique textures.",
    "This was a fun class! I wish it wasn't a major requirement because I didn't feel like any of my technical or conceptual skills improved, but the projects were always interesting.",
    "I learned basic art vocabulary and that there really is no way to do art wrong. It was interesting to see everyone's artistic style through all of their projects and to learn from my classmates.",
    "This course helped me realize that 2D skills don't always transfer to 3D. I had a hard time understanding some of the 3D concepts that the teachers seemed to be keen on. I think by the end of the semester I was getting a better feel on focusing on the form of the object, and the sculpture as a whole.",
    "How to think abstractly and create what I imagined."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "This course is very good at being a low-budget introduction to a study and practice of art. It is enjoyable and illuminating in a kinesthetic way and taught by instructors who are invested in the outcome and dedicated to seeing student improvement. Students like me who came into the course with little exposure and understanding of art and aesthetics will quickly develop an appreciation for even the most abstract of works. Practice is really emphasized as a method of learning - which I really appreciated. No immediate weaknesses come to mind. I really liked this course.",
    "Some assignments did not give enough room for our creativity. I think some restrictions could be taken away from the assignments",
    "I think, whether it is a strength or a weakness of the course, students should go into it planning to have little freedom in terms of what they do but lots of freedom as to how they do it. The class is essentially a series of assignments (many times building on one another) with extensive and specific instructions meant to stretch students and force them to export the concepts about shape, form, color, etc. discussed in class. Sometimes these instructions can feel overbearing or frustrating, but they also act as an equalizer in the class that guides beginners and challenges experienced students.",
    "Some of the material felt redundant\/familiar to me, as someone with a lot of art experience.",
    "I liked how imaginative the assignments were, though they were always very time-consuming. I did wish that toward the end we could've invested more time into projects that we could keep. The projects at the end were all very ephemeral and less time-consuming, and while it was nice to not spend so much time on this class towards the end of semester (due to increasing demands from other classes), I do wish that the culminating assignment was a bit more satisfying as a final project.",
    "I liked that we got to work in different mediums and learn vocabulary surrounding them. It mainly helped to improve critiques. Sometimes projects were tedious.",
    "I really enjoyed the first half of the course; I felt like everyone, including the teachers, were sincerely interested in expanding their perspectives when it came to an art piece. The tasks given were diverse and intriguing, such as the printmaking and collage assignments. (Though, the very first in-class assignment of making a sculpture stand on a variety of number of points was, in my opinion, completely unnecessary. Till the end of class, no critiques or comments were given by any of the professors, the students were literally just told to do something for the sake of doing something.) However, towards the second half of the course, I have to say I was disappointed in how the classes went. The assignments given to us seemed to be hastily prepared and not really well thought out; they didn't seem to serve a purpose in helping us expanding our skill set. Some of the work we did seemed simply to be repeats, with a few tweaks here and there, and the critiques during class were literally identical for each task. Thus, I found the class, though it did have highlights, to be quite boring and not useful, especially towards the end. So I would say that during this part of the course, there seriously needs to be a diversity in assignments. I think a big weakness of this course is that it is made to be a core requirement for several art-related majors; I honestly think this course should not be required. Many of the students I talked with all said they took this class only because they had too, and wished they had taken something else. Maybe by making this a non-core class, students actually interested in the subject matter will be more passionate about the assignments. I feel that you could learn many of the things learned in this class in other more specific courses, such as sculpture or painting. The class in a whole is a vague concept, and because of that, it's hard to learn even one, key lesson at the end of this course.",
    "The workload wasn't evenly distributed. It would have been better to have a steady 5 hours of homework each week instead of 10-12 one week and none another week. I really enjoyed the diversity of materials we used and topics we covered."

   "comments": [
    "Yes. Even if you have no background in art and have never taken an art class at Yale, like me, I recommend that you take this class. Not only will you learn the visual elements that make things aesthetically appealing, but you will also get to practice applying your knowledge through constructing pieces in a low-pressure setting. I believe this helped to bring the most creativity out of students so we can flourish.",
    "Yes I would. Because it forces you to work with a large scope of material. I've learned that I love making sculptures more than I love painting for instance.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student, assuming that student knows and is looking for what it offers.",
    "This class could feel redundant\/familiar if you have had a lot of art education before. But you will still learn new things and will be able to push your current work further with the assignments.",
    "I would recommend it to someone looking for a fun class in which to invest their creative energy.",
    "I would recommend this course if you are unfamiliar with art vocabulary and critiques. If you have a lot of art experience, or not, you may get tired of collage. Sometimes projects can be tedious and time consuming.",
    "I have to admit, I would not recommend this course. The professor and TA were very kind and insightful, but overall this class did not teach me anything substantial, nor was it unique or interesting. Of course, because this is a core class, students have to take it in order to complete the major. I strongly think this class does not even match the standards of a foundation level course. Yes, at the beginning, the in-class discussions were intellectual and thoughtful, but as semester went on, people starting repeating the same notions over and over again. If you're seriously passionate about art, whether it be for sculpture or drawing, this course will not help you grow a foundation.",
    "Yes!"
