    "This course focuses almost entirely on primary texts, and moves forward slowly but with grace. I'd say: If you have always been fascinated by monks, or the draw of leading an isolationist life, you would enjoy it.",
    "Great class, and a really fascinating look at a time period not normally thought about. Most discussions of Christian monasticism use the Rule of St. Benedict as a starting point- it's actually the last text we read! Definitely enjoyable if you like tearing your unreliable primary sources into tiny shreds."
