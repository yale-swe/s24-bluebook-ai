   "comments": [
    "This course is an introduction to theater history from the 1700s to the present. We read two plays each week in addition to supplemental readings, so the workload is intense. I would not recommend this course unless you are very interested in being a Theater Studies major because otherwise, it is a lot of work to still receive mediocre grades. Still, thecourse definitely teaches you how to think about theater in new ways.",
    "You'll probably have to take it... so suck it up.",
    "A lot of fun, weird plays. Very theoretical. Take it if you want to be a THST major or really love theater.",
    "I would recommend it, obviously for a theater major but for anyone too. You learn a lot, and it pushes you to get involved, or at least take an interest, in the extra-curricular theater scene.",
    "Take it!! You learn so much about so many different things that it changes the way you read a play completely.",
    "A huge survey of theater from 18th century to the present. Expect to do a LOT of reading. Most people in the class are \"theater people\" doing it as a prerequisite to the major and\/or higher level classes. If you just want an intro lecture there are much easier ones to take instead.",
    "YES. This fills in all the holes you might have in your knowledge of theatre and\/or history.",
    "Take this class if you are at all considering majoring in Theater Studies. There is constant reading each week (think about 4 hours) that won't swamp you if you do it each week. The plays can sometimes be boring, but many are very interesting and are well-known culturally.",
    "The work in this class sneaks up on you. At the end of the semester the workload gets much bigger (final, paper, and a semi-useless presentation). It's a good class if you love to read plays, because you'll be glad you were exposed to this stuff. Otherwise, don't take it if you don't have to. It's not that rewarding.",
    "It is basically a theatre history course. You do have a performance aspect, but that comes at the end. The work load is very heavy at the end of the term with an essay, final, and a section performance. it gives good background on theater practices and important plays\/movements.",
    "A much better class than THST 110. The plays are more interesting and the TFs are fantastic. The workload is relatively low but picks up quite a bit towards the end. Lectures were good, much improved compared to 110. Theater Studies majors have to take the class, but I'd recommend it for strong writers who enjoy theater as well. Professor McGinley is leaving so all this is subject to change."
