    "I almost feel silly writing a rave review of this class after having read countless fantastic JBS reviews from previous years. PLSC 260 is by far the best class I've taken at Yale. JBS devotes more time to teaching this class than any other instructor I've ever encountered. You learn so much from the casebooks, study group, class time, and conversations with JBS. I came into this class having read everything I just said a million times and not thinking this class could really be as great as people said it was I was wrong. Definitely start applying to this class sophomore year so you can get it as a junior or senior. Don't be discouraged if you don't get in the first couple of times; most people with a demonstrated interested in public education will get in eventually. One note that will hopefully be helpful I think people overplay how much work this class is. Yes, there's a ton of reading, but you can really get by with a lot of skimming and googling. Also, the reading responses aren't too difficult if you've formed an opinion on that week's topic, and the grading is very fair. Plus you can keep revising until you like your grade. The midterm is an oral exam and is way more fun than stressful. And the final paper is only 15-20 pages. You obviously get more out of the class if you put in more time, but you don't need to plan your schedule around this class. I had a very heavy load outside of PLSC 260, and I was fine.",
    "This is the best class at Yale. It is a lot of work, but you are in a classroom with passionate students and an incredible instructor--it is an academic experience every Yale student should want.",
    "You would be insane not to take this if you get in. Starr is the best, kindest, most dedicated, hardest-working, most fanatically-devoted-to-teaching professor at Yale. This is the best class at Yale. Period. Apply, apply, apply again until you get in. I've learned more in this class than I have in most of my other classes combined. It's a ton of work but it's totally worth it -- everyone does all the reading, and everyone is really passionate about the material, which makes for great discussions.",
    "PLSC 260 is without question the best class at Yale. If you are in any way interested in politics or in education, start applying ASAP. The course is a lot of work and expectations are high, but you will get two times as much out of the course as you put in.",
    "One of the best academic experiences you'll have at Yale. The creative structure of the course is based off of mini workshops that force students to engage with the material in a way that is creative and informative. Def. a lot of work but totally worth it, even if you don't care for public schools, you'll be stretched as a thinker and student.",
    "You need to ask yourself two questions: 1) do you care about public schools? 2) do you want to have an academic experience unlike any you've likely had at Yale? If yes to both questions, TAKE THIS CLASS. I can guarantee this class will be worth your time and effort (it does demand a lot of both), because JBS - the professor - is a superstar and the people in the class are all amazing. Do yourself a favor and sign up!",
    "I lived in a house with a few guys who were obsessed with education reform and wouldn't stop talking about JBS's class. So finally, even though ed studies isn't my first priority, I decided to take the class. I figured it would be good, but it couldn't live up to the hype that my friends had given it. Honestly, it was better than the hype. This is the best class at Yale.",
    "Absolutely. TAKE THIS CLASS. I'm going to echo most of the other reviews, but apply early in your Yale career and apply often, and take it when you get in. JBS creates an amazing learning environment. The work is substantial, but the grading is fair.",
    "Easily the best course I've taken at Yale. His course is famous and rightfully so. It's certainly a lot of work, but I don't think it's as much work as people seem to think it is. Essentially just a response every week plus about 150-200 pages of reading, which you don't exactly have to read every word of. If you are AT ALL interested in education, this is a must-take course. I have no plans to be a teacher or really be involved in education in any way professionally, and this was a true eye-opener.",
    "PLSC 260 is definitely one of the best classes at Yale! If you're interested in education or politics at all, you should be trying to take this class. It's setup is different from any other seminar but the focus on case studies and small group discussion makes it a great learning experience. The case studies and the amount of work and time devoted to the class is heavier than most courses at Yale, but JBS is an amazing instructor who will make you want to put all the effort into the course. You will leave the class with changed views and a great understanding of how politics affects so many aspects of education.",
    "YES take PLSC 260!!! It is one of the best classes at Yale. The course gives you a chance to really expand your knowledge about a crucial area of study, while having fun and improving your writing\/speaking abilities. You have to devote a significant amount of time to the course, but it is well worth it. You also get to be part of a fantastic community that is really passionate about public education.",
    "I would absolutely recommend PLSC 260 to other students. I feel truly fortunate to have had the opportunity to take this course. This course is not only an opportunity to better understand the factors influencing education reform, but it is also a chance to better understand how to productively engage with others on issues of great concern (i.e. this course is as concerned with process as with product).",
    "JBS trusts his students deeply to learn, and so gives them the tools to learn deeply. No matter how much work you put in, he has put more work into this class. Make this your class this semester. When I applied for this class, I knew it would be great. I'd read the reviews, I'd heard my friends rave about it, and I knew the material was terrific. But I didn't know how devoted my classmates would be to education and politics, how fluent I would become in these issues, and how empowering my work would feel as I developed my own beliefs. I learned more in this class than any other, and if you apply, so will you.",
    "JBS sets out to forge a community of learners, and unlike any other professor I know, he actually achieves his mission in full by the term's end.",
    "The effusive praise in previous reviews of this class is well deserved. PLSC 260 is one of the best taught courses both in the Department of Political Science and in Yale College. I strongly, strongly encourage you to take it if you are admitted and are willing to invest the substantial time demanded by the readings and assignments. You won't regret a second of it."
