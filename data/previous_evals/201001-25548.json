   "comments": [
    "The grading is very harsh, but the material is essential for anyone going into any sort of trading or hedging. More rigorous than any other course outside of SOM. Definitely recommended, but just take it credit\/d and learn the material if you want to go into any such field.",
    "I would recommend Econ 253 to another student, but only if he\/she is serious about working in finance. Some of the topics covered in this course are very intense and mathematically rigorous. There are quite a few proofs and theorems that are not easy to understand at first.",
    "I'm not even sure if this course will be taught again. It'd be very useful to have taken financial markets or financial theory before taking this class. I didn't, and I felt lost at the beginning. This class is not so great at gaining an understanding of finance in general, since it mainly only teaches models for valuing derivatives. So if Wall Street is in your future, I guess you want to take the class. Also know that Professor Brown does not give partial credit on problems where you use the correct method but make a math mistake, so a little mistake could cost you big on an exam. Professor Brown also seems a little cold at first, but I urge people to go talk to him. He's actually a very nice guy. I guess this is all useless if this class is not taught anymore...",
    "Definitely take it. It's a great class and Prof. Brown is a good teacher. So sad he's on leave next year.",
    "This class focuses on derivatives pricing. The material is extremely useful and interesting and a nice break from regular econ. Also it is computational but not too hard so you can understand everything which is very gratifying (especially in comparision to more hard core math classes for example). Don Brown can be hard to deal with. I'm not sure whether or not he is teaching it again. I have never been so nervous to get a grade for a class. I understood all the material but with his grading and seeming vindictiveness at times I have no idea what I'm going to get on the final."
