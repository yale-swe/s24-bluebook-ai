   "comments": [
    "This class was evenly split between a midterm, a final, the lab, and the problem sets. It is not very hard work, just time consuming. I would recommend this class if you want to learn how semiconductor devices work.",
    "A good class that seems very complex at first but is very interesting once you get the hang of it. I would recommend it to anyone who wants to know just the basics of semiconductors without getting lost with too many details and equations.",
    "Good course...keep up with the reading in order to be able to follow the material adequately in class. Also, the lab component is like taking another course (for which you get no credit). I speak to friends who are pre-med and receive .5 credits for their lab, and they spend significantly fewer hours in lab on the whole. The lab time itself isn't even the real problem. Lab reports will consistently be longer than 10 pages, regardless of your staunchest attempts to be concise.Other than that, the course is a lesson in knowing which formula to use...so be sure to have a good formula sheet going into the midterm and final.",
    "I would recommend it only if you do not have a difficult course load that semester - while not incredibly difficult, completing the labs in addition to the regular coursework sometimes proved challenging. In general, it was a good overview of common devices that I certainly might otherwise know almost nothing about."
