    "The class is small but interesting. The teacher is nice and provides a lot of resources. The only thing I'd say is only take the class if you have the time to learn a new language, practice and use those resources. Yoruba can be especially difficult, especially when it comes to tone differences and pronounciation. Otherwise there is a lot of material given for practice and help.",
    "Definitely. Take this class. You will do well, you will learn, you will laugh, you will make friends :)",
    "Definitely recommended! It'll probably be impossible to find a better atmosphere in which to learn Yoruba. Professor is great and, with the right mix of students, class can actually be something you look forward to everyday.",
    "Yoruba 110 is an introductory language course that incorporates a wide range of teaching tools for the most effective language learning experience."
