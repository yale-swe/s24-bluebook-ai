    "I think it is a very important class to take as some in Biostatistics, however I think the course assumes students have taken a multitude of theory and linear algebra classes, which isn't necessarily the case for many students. Additionally, some students were thinking theory of statistics during the same semester as this class, so it's more difficult to pick up what's being taught in GLM, when you're barely digesting the material in the theory of statistics class.",
    "It provides a good general theoretical frame for widely used statistical method. It indicates that many techniques have the same base.I think this course should include more examples that illustrate how the method works.The papers for final presentations have to be different. It is boring to describe the same paper.",
    "Good. Difficult than other courses. Maybe more explanation of the equations will be even more helpful.",
    "GLM is very theoretical. So unless you are interested in learning the mechanisms how SAS obtains estimates for linear, logistic, poisson regression, etc, I do not recommend taking the class. Dr. Ma does not emphasize much applications; strictly theory.",
    "I like this course. It explain those ideas theoretically, which make me understand the models more thoroughly.",
    "Difficult class"

    "Instructor: Shuangge Ma \u00a0Professor Ma is very accessible and open to feedback which is great. However, I was not always sure of how I was actually doing in the class throughout the semester. There were no clear grades on the homework assignments and then on the midterm, I felt like the material I was tested on was so different than my experience with the material was on homework assignments.",
    "Instructor: Shuangge Ma \u00a0Good teacher. Nice and considerate.",
    "Instructor: Shuangge Ma \u00a0Lectures are very dry and dense.",
    "Instructor: Shuangge Ma \u00a0Dr Ma is a very good instructor. His explanations are clear and easy to understand."

    "I would summarize this course as primer on the theory of generalized linear models.",
    "It is a theoretical course. It does not describe applied methods. It will be useful if you are familiar with different types of regression and you want to construct a general frame in your mind.",
    "Yes.",
    "I would not recommend taking this class. It was too theoretical and it was hard to follow Dr. Ma during lecture. The final project wasn't too bad (and I actually learned quite a bit). I would recommend trying to integrate both applications and theory in the future.",
    "Must-take course. Give you the theoretical aspect of Biostat"
