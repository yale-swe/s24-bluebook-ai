   "comments": [
    "Really great course for furthering your Chinese. Often seems like a bunch of chanting and repetition but it works well for languages. You finish every lesson in roughly one week and have a written exam and oral exam every three lessons. There is not much homework every night but there is homework EVERY night. Since you meet every day you end up making really good friends.",
    "I would recommend it highly if you are really interested in learning Chinese. It is a lot of work, but it pays off.",
    "This class is a considerable step up from 120. There's a bigger workload, and the pace of learning is much quicker. If you can put in the time and effort, however, it is extremely rewarding and you will find yourself much more comfortable with reading and speaking than you did at the end of L2. If you were placed into 130, the intensity may not come as such a surprise. But for those comingfrom L2, be prepared to put in at least an hour (sometimes two) a night , and 3-4+ hours of studying for each written and oral test.",
    "More Chinese. You should take it.",
    "Chinese 130 is a great way to continue language study at Yale. The central focus on speaking and listening improved my abilities tremendously. It is important to keep in mind that although the coursework is not excessive, there is a constant stream of assignments."
