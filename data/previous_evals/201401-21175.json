    "First, take second semester DS. It's so much better than first semester; you really start to feel like things are coming together. Second, take H&P with Charles Hill. He is wonderful. His teaching style is the perfect mix of guidance and free discussion. He's also very knowledgeable about the texts you read. He really knows his stuff. I wake up at 9am just for him.",
    "A survey of the development of modern political thought; the wide-ranging effects of the Enlightenment, as well as the danger of over-rationality in government.",
    "As with all Directed Studies courses, recommending Directed Studies History is wholly dependent on a student's willingness to take all three courses. However, I can say that the material presented in Directed Studies History and Politics is both exceedingly interesting and exceedingly detailed in its design. Out of all the Directed Studies courses, Directed Studies History and Politics best examines the texts of the curriculum. It remains a detailed and vibrant course for any prospective students."
