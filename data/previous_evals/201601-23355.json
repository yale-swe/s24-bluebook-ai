    "The course needs more structure. It covers too many topics.",
    "Class could have been done as a half-semester class. Case assignments were beyond vague, instructor put no work into preparing them or he didn't know what he wanted out them or the students in general.",
    "The course needs more content and structure. The non slide deck style will be fine for one or two lectures, but a whole semester with repetition, lack of plans, lack of categorization or classification. It did not help me particularly in learning much, through first half of the semester, and then I decide to change it to audit status rather than credit. Given that the content is not super high, instructor can also explore options of offering it as a half semester course.",
    "Group work, in general, is a great way to learn material. However, I felt the instructor did not do his part to lecture enough. I personally find lectures boring, but there really needed to be more. When doing cases, all my team members and I realized that we did not learn sufficiently learn enough from class sessions to apply any usable knowledge to the assignments. I think the instructor tried to get students to realize that coming up with sustainability metrics is very difficult. After the first case, the point was clear. I wish there were smaller assignments or cases that we could read and discuss in class, particularly historical cases in which we knew what decisions or pathways companies had made or taken.",
    "I think the class was great. My only suggestion would be to spread out more the assignments so that they don't stack up at the end of the semester when things get crazy and you don't have time to dedicate to all the assignments.",
    "Concepts were not clearly explained and not so organized. In the first month students struggled understanding what the course was truly about. There was often a disconnect between the key concepts taught and the assignments. Students would have benefited more from the assignment if the instructor had provided his solution to the assignments."

   "comments": [
    "I didn't feel like we got taught enough. A lot of the learning centered around \"figure it out as you go\" in the homework assignments, but most of us seemed to yearn for a little bit more guidance on HOW to design good metrics",
    "Structure and depth",
    "The equal distribution of assignments during the semester (too much at the end), and perhaps improved communication about the different sections and structure of the course overall (it sometimes seemed very ad-hoc with speakers showing up or not - that's fine and understandable, as long as the overall structure and different parts are clear over the course of the semester). Perhaps the lecturer should also have a bit more 'confidence' instead of coming across as unprepared - even though that was not the case it does take away some authority which is not always desirable.",
    "Structure was severely lacking. The Instructor does not know what to do with this class.",
    "The instructor needs to teach during lectures. Having group sessions is a lazy way out of teaching. Instructor could have done his \"homework\" to learn material\/prep for lectures--it really showed in class.",
    "The homework is often too broad and maybe mandatory readings and field trips would help",
    "Two aspects of this course were problematic for me. The first was that I felt the class sessions relied too heavily on guest speakers and not enough on reading and discussion of literature on the topic of CSR. Although we had the opportunity to do some of these readings, they were not emphasized in class and most people did not do them. I felt that the guest lectures, taken as a whole, were disparate and not intellectually rigorous enough to stimulate very memorable discussions on the topics of this class. The second aspect was the case study assignments. Many of them were repetitive in nature and I did not feel that I benefitted much after the second case study. Furthermore, doing three back-to-back case studies at the end of the semester during finals further degraded the value of the case studies for me, although this had more to do with scheduling.",

    "Advantages: was great to get to know fellow students, learned a lot from the interaction Disadvantages: because of prominence of group work there was little incentive to engage individually with the material, which sometimes created a poor discussion environment because we hadn't all prepared adequately. Unclear assignments may have contributed to a LOT of confusion and stress within groups and overworking to then underdeliver. As a result I'm not sure we captured the key messages we were supposed to from the assignments",

    "This class was based on group work and it was very challenging. Team mates had different opinions and views about the topic and it was hard to coordinate so many group projects with so many different people. The advantage is that you don't have to do all the work alone and can learn from your group. But, I would say it was more of a negative experience than positive.",

However, it does give you good exposure to cases and business problems.",
