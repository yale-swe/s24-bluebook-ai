    "This is a good one.",
    "Senior studio is a striking change from previous semesters, requiring self-motivation rather than enforcing demanding deadlines. I would encourage students not to get swept away by the freedom and to put in the same amount of energy that they have in previous studios. Enjoy the chance to work with Adam and Turner, as it really is an incredible one, and of course, enjoy the ability to not have to work at a frantic pace--but make sure you are putting in as much as you expect to get out of the class.",
    "Awesome class! After the hammering of junior year, it is refreshing to delve into longer projects while still being able to breathe. Turner and Adam are great and incredibly supportive.",
    "Well you have to take it but don't fret because it is awesome",
    "If you are doing architecture design you are absolutely taking this. In case you are thinking about taking the other tracks to avoid more studio, this one has a lot less workload compared to junior studio."
