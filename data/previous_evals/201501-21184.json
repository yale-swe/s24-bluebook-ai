    "The people you take this class with will make or break the class. Overall, it's a pretty well laid out class with good instructors, but you'll need to interact with your classmates on a pretty regular basis, and if you care and they don't, it's pretty frustrating."

    "This course has been incredibly helpful in helping me discover a new kind of scientific thinking and a host of useful techniques.",
    "It shows the practical application of science, that builds on all the core classes we have taken thus far for the major.",
    "It did a very good job of showcasing the broad purposes of experiments with the weekly themes, and it does a good job of showing how what we learned in class was discovered or applied. My research is actually more in pharmacology and drug discovery from natural products than in MB&B, so it doesn't help my research very directly at this point, but may be useful as I get farther with this project."
