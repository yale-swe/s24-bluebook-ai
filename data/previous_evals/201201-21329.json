    "Chemical Engineering 471: Independent research is a terrific course and opportunity for Undergraduates in the Chemical Engineering department. I chose Professor Chinedum Osuji as my principal investigator and truly enjoyed my time working in the lab. The course taught me a lot about being an independent researcher and working in a team on problems sometimes beyond the comprehension of a sophomore. The strengths of the course is the independence and the immersion within a collaborative group. You are in charge of your own schedule and thus in charge of what amount of progress you want to make during the course of the semester. This means that it is your individual responsibility to read up on important articles pertaining to your field of research as well as understanding complex concepts in rheology, solar technology, etc. I recommend this course to any student interested in immersing him or herself in their future major.",
    "Yes - great elective for chemE majors and useful for those who want to go into research at a University, grad school, etc."
