    "I would definitely recommend it. It's a good gut class that fulfills a Science and QR credit and is not that difficult.",
    "I would definitely recommend Movie Physics. The material seems more challenging than a normal GUT but the tests are not terribly difficult and Professor Robinson does his absolute best to ensure that everyone does well. I really appreciate that he made sure we understood what we were learning\u0097 especially since non of us came into the class with much of a base in science.",
    "Great class for QR\/Science. TAKE IT!",
    "Yes I would definately recommend this class to any other student, especially for someone looking for a QR. I have always struggled with math and this new way of learning it made a big difference to me.",
    "Yes. This class was a great entry level course for physics.",
    "I thought this was a well paced class, especially if you absolutely suck at math. Like, if 112 would be hard for you, take this joint.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to a student that isn't a science major because it can really help solidify his\/her understanding of basic physics.",
    "A great course, I would recommend it.",
    "If you want to learn about physics in an approachable, non-traditional way, with an exciting teacher to make the entire process more enjoyable for you, then take this course. It deals a lot with estimation techniques and movie clips and helps with \"general logical thought,\" whatever that means."
