    "I don't know how it would seem to someone who has a background in Chinese history\/culture, but as someone who had no clue about East Asian culture in general, I feel like I now have a grasp of the basics at least. Of course the entire course is Chinese history and literature on steroids - 3000 years in a semester - but the course is balanced and comprehensive enough to be worthwile. The readings are nearly always interesting, especially in the second half of the semester when they become more literary and less philosophical. Also, I did not find that I had any difficulty as a science major - workload was manageable, and the three four-page essays were not too bad. No clue how the final will be but I cannot imagine that it will be that bad.",
    "It's a really great class for learning about the history of China up to the early 1900s. It really goes in depth about the thinking at each point in time; the workload is completely reasonable as long as you keep up with it.",
    "This class is pretty much an overview of the Chinese literature. If you are considering studying Chinese literature further, this seems to be a good first step before getting into detail. However, it seems that reading is sometimes too much. Given your time is limited, I suppose you do not have to read all of the reading assigned for each session in order to grasp an overview of Chinese literature. If the point of taking this class is to explore a new world of yours, you might find it too time consuming. So I would recommend that you take a look at a book on Chinese literature before the class starts and see if you are interested in it. If you like it, I think this would be a good course for you.",
    "The course was a whirlwind tour of Chinese intellectual history through end of China's imperial period. \"The Directed Studies of China\" is very much an accurate description. No course that spends so little time on individual texts is going to be life-changing, but the course provides an accessible introduction to a hugely rich intellectual tradition. I don't plan to take any more courses on the topic, but I'm glad to have a fuller understanding of Chinese history and thought than the platitudes I learned in AP World History. If you haven't taken any courses whose focus is outside of the West, you should before you graduate, and this one is as good as any.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone who is interested in China\/East Asia or who has never taken a course in the subject before since it provides a solid background in the topic.",
    "It's billed as the intro Chinese culture course for DS students. That's wrong. It's really the intro DS course for Chinese-speaking students.",
    "Definitely take this class if you're interested in any way in China. Even if you don't think you're interested in China, you should at least shop the class. It's a class that covers almost the entire span of Chinese history, from about 1000 BCE to the 1920s. Almost all readings are primary sources, which really helps you get a deeper sense of the time period, the people, the culture, the ideas, etc. It's so much better than reading a history textbook on China. This class is essentially the closest thing at Yale to the Directed Studies (DS) of China. I'm really glad this class exists! Professor Lu is a really good lecturer and is entertaining. She engages students in lectures by asking questions, which is a big plus (I'm a huge fan of \"leminars\"!). Lectures are never boring. However, readings can be quite heavy at times, which is perhaps the biggest drawback of the course. Essay assignments are fair, and exams are not too difficult. I had a great TF for this class. Try to choose the best TF if there are multiple TFs. A strong discussion section does a lot for the class as a whole. Finally, I really liked my peers in the class. They contributed a lot to the leminars and the discussion section. A group of us also made a study group together for the final exam. Cool Yalies take this class. SO TAKE THIS CLASS! It's definitely worth it.",
    "I wouldn't recommend the class unless you know that you like survey classes\/would rather learn information from a lecturer instead of reading it online",
    "I would recommend the Chinese tradition for anyone interested in a broad overview of Chinese literature and philosophy. I would recommend keeping up with the readings, which are not so long anyways, because it really helps keep all the authors and works straight, since the semester moves by quickly, and it's almost a dynasty a week. The three papers make this class a bit more work than others, but the really easy midterm makes up for it.",
    "A lot of people say this class is like \"Eastern DS\". I have personally heard from my DS friends that this is not particularly true. It is a survey course of Chinese literature and philosophy, although it does not go particularly into depth in any of the pieces of literature. What it does do is force you to engage deeply with a handful of texts that you write (three) papers on. I appreciated the class not for the vast amounts of Chinese literature\/philosophy that I will remember (remembering is questionable), but rather for the more defined concept of Chinese traditional thought I now have.",
    "I would only take this course if you really wanted to learn about Chinese history and literature on a very very broad level. There is a decent but fair amount of work -your choice of 3 out of 4 four paged essays, a midterm and a final and good amount of reading (the class won't make sense unless you do the readings). I don't think I got as much out of it as I would have wished in the sense that I only know general knowledge of each of the thinkers and dynasties, nothing very in depth. Obviously, Professor Lu warned us at the beginning of the semester that it was ambitious and a whirlwind of a course, but I still hoped that it would have been better.",
    "Great class for understanding Chinese history and philosophy. You cover all the big names you've heard: Confucius, Mencius, Zhuangzi, Lu Xun, etc., and loads of big names you HAVEN'T heard, like Xunzi, Han Feizi, Zhu Xi, Wang Shouren, Mozi, etc. You'll gain a better understanding of Chinese history, and knowledge that you can really apply a fair bit to your own life. It definitely felt more like a history class than a philosophy class, but when you do the readings (which you obviously should do, not much point otherwise for a text-based class), you can't help but think about your own effective guiding philosophies and social paradigms. Plus, you impress lots of people by quoting the Masters."
