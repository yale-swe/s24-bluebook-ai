    "A clear understanding of the dominant, mainstream Environmental history of the US.",
    "Best class I've taken at Yale so far.",
    "It was a good review of American history through an environmental lens, touching on ideas that I would not have gleaned from any typical AMST course. I've become a better historical writer for sure, and have a much more enriched understanding of US history.",
    "I learned a ton about the US's intriguing track record with the environment and learned how large a role Bill Cronon plays in the philosophy behind a lot of the environmental movement. I think any writing practice is good practice and really enjoyed writing a history paper after quite some time. I was becoming more of environmentalist before I started this course and now definitely consider my impact more in my daily habits and consumption choices. I also feel more confident in how I should criticize the environmental movement when needed because, as it often is, history runs in shades of gray.",
    "Incredible course! Well taught and very thorough...really makes you think about American politics and environmental concerns.",
    "I learned so much about patterns and events in American Environmental History that I didn't know before. This was also my first class that I ever used the Yale Manuscripts and Archives for, so learning how to maneuver that system was an important skill to gain.",
    "As someone who's never taken a college-level history class, I learned how to connect themes across time periods and significant events in history. I also learned how to improve my critical and analytical writing.",
    "The lectures weren't great. The course readings were generally pretty interesting.",
    "A further understanding of the power of ideas and narrative, thinking about the environment from many different perspectives",
    "I gained a rather extensive overview of American environmental history. Skills in utilizing primary and secondary sources to evaluate history and string events together through larger themes and concepts.",
    "I'm a better writer (really worked on my topic sentences), and have a great perspective on the importance of the environment in human history.",
    "I learned a new perspective on American history and on history in general-- that of the relationship between people and their environment.",
    "This course helped me reorient my position in the American historical narrative in an incredibly fascinating and productive way.",
    "I developed insight into what we define as the \"environment\" and the history of interactions between humans and nature in America. I learned about conflicts that have arisen between humans over the environment and how American's interactions with the environment has changed over time.",
    "A better understanding of the environment, human's role in it, the politics, culture, and other factors involved."

   "comments": [
    "This course was great in that it covered much of the mainstream, white US environmental history. This stuff is important to know if you want to have a grasp of US popular culture and history. This class could benefit from having larger sections on environmental justice from the beginning. Include more perspectives of black, latinx, indigenous, asian, and queer people. They too are a part of the US that has played a huge role Environmental history, but is hardly covered.",
    "Strengths: Sabin's decision not to post notes online and ban on technology really means you have to stay engaged for the full 75 minutes, undistracted. I picked up on a lot of minute details I may not have otherwise, and those 75 minutes go by very quickly when youre as engaged as you are! Weaknesses: nothing prominent!",
    "While some may argue that the series of deadlines for the final paper can be annoying, breaking it up into smaller goals is helpful in making sure you don't procrastinate on your paper. I really enjoyed the historical exploration of it all. Lecture can be hit or miss depending upon the interest level in the topic. Sabin can also seem a little all over the place when he is lecturing, but it comes from his vast knowledge of the topic. He can end up stumbling upon ideas while lecturing because of it. My only qualm with the course really is how his full lecture notes were not shared. I am a big fan of simply listening and questioning. While the note skeleton he offers is helpful, I end up writing a lot of extra details on top of that, distracting me from listening to the stories he offered.",
    "Very in depth...makes you think about a wide range of issues and how they all relate to each other. Sabin is a really good lecturer, very engaging.",
    "On one hand, I think a strength of this course is its content. There's so much interesting content covered in this class. On the other hand, I think the class's content could be improved by including more narratives of women and people of color. As an environmental history class, it's very traditional in its portrayal of white men (usually wealthy) as the main drivers of change for the majority of the content covered. Another plus of this class is its organization -- every day Prof. Sabin gives a handout detailing the organization and content of his lecture, which is very helpful in understanding what's important in the lecture and studying afterward.",
    "I thought this class was fantastic. I learned a lot while overall improving my ability to think critically. With that in mind, I just have two small complaints first, I thought that the research paper process was a little too structured. It might be helpful for people who haven't had to write a paper in college before, but it had the potential to disrupt people's workflows who know what they are doing. I like writing papers by setting aside a week or so near the deadline, diving in, and immersing myself in documents for a continuous period of time while thinking about the connections between them. Picking sources one or two months in advance then setting them down for a while threw me off a bit. Second, I thought the synthesis question on the final exam was a little too broad and the expectations were a little unclear.",
    "Lack of structure in course lectures. Handouts were helpful, but because of this, it was very clear how much of the lectures weren't necessary. Part of this could be solved by condensing into a 50-minute lecture (which is a much better length for lectures in general). Feels frustrating to not engage at a higher level on lectures, which often felt like regurgitation of facts. The Warren reader was pretty dry and boring, for the most part. Also, it should be made more clear that the Booth Craft of Research book isn't actually that relevant to the class. Maybe the chapters could be scanned, rather than making everyone purchase the book.",
    "Strengths: encompassing, intriguing lectures, straightforward exams Weaknesses: 1\/3 of the lecture is supposed to be interactive and discussion based and that never happened",
    "Definitely the most engaging section that I have participated in at Yale so far.",
    "Fairly balanced material, but I believer the course was way to focused on the white actors of history, without emphasizing in amy way the role of people of color after 1600 aside from environmental justice.",
    "Strengths: This class was well organized and was easy to follow. Midterms and tests were very reasonable Weaknesses: The class didn't really look at the US's global impact very much. There was also not a lot of diversity, in terms of women and POCs",
    "I actually really liked how we weren't allowed to use our laptops in lecture. I was forced to hand write my notes and felt that the act of writing it down kept me more engaged. On the other hand, I think that a number of the lectures did not have to be 75' long but instead could have worked better in 50'.",
    "While all the blogposts may have seemed like overkill at the beginning of the course, & found that they helped me become a more attentive reader.",
    "Super interesting class, more time to choose essay topic would be helpful.",
    "I think the title of the course is misleading. The course is called \"American Environmental History\" but the material covers United States environmental history. Most importantly, the course failed to include women or people of color narratives. Women were only emphasized in the Audubon society and grassroots segments and people of color were presented in the last few lectures. I think if Prof. Sabin continues to shape the course this way, he should at least have a conversation with the students discussing why these groups are not prominent in environmental history. Who writes environmental history? Are women and people of color narratives important to environmental history? These are important conversations especially in the present moment."

    "This class was great! Paul cares that you learn and understand what's going on and is readily available to meet up to discuss ideas and topics. The tour of New Haven grounds you in understanding the history of where you are living and is a good way to see living history. The paper lets you delve into a topic you're interested in. The readings are interesting and important. Take this course!!!",
    "This was my favorite class I've taken at Yale. Paul Sabin is absolutely amazing and wants all of his students to succeed.",
    "Absolutely! If you have any interest in environmental history, take it. Lots of pertinence to general American history, markets, policy, etc. Really makes you think. Weekly blog posts, one paper, midterm, final. You have to go to class, or you'll fall behind very quickly. Some weeks require lots of readings (100+ pages), some weeks not as much.",
    "I was a non-history\/EVST major taking this course Cr\/D\/Fail and thoroughly enjoyed it. Since I enjoyed it so much, I also did very well in the class and slightly regret not taking it for the grade. If history is not your forte but definitely an interest, this is a pretty cool survey to get you into the US's environmental background and how it shapes contemporary policies and thought. I'd recommend this also for anyone looking for a gateway course into EVST because it provides a good foundation for anyone without any environmental experience. If you're an HSHM person not as into agriculture, environment, or tech, I would say shop another course. Otherwise, keep this on your shopping list.",
    "Definitely take this course if you are looking for an in-depth, low commitment course.",
    "I would recommend this class. The lectures with Sabin are usually really engaging and the content is really interesting, especially if you're interested in the environment and its legacies in the U.S. The readings in this class are fantastic - I always enjoyed doing them and they never felt like a chore or a repetition of what was talked about in class. With just a midterm, a research paper, and a final, this class is really manageable and enjoyable.",
    "Great class, Id recommend it. Its a survey of American history with respect to the environment from colonial times to the present, and really makes you think critically about the relationship that humans have with their surroundings. Sabin dissects the notion that humanity has some vague moral obligation to ~save the environment~, and through questioning that idea, you gain a deeper level of appreciation for the natural world around us and think about objective ways to make this planet a better place. You also learn a lot of factual environmental history from the past few decades and become fairly literate on current political debates surrounding environmental issues. Between the reading, blog posts, section, paper, and exams, its a healthy amount of work that keeps you engaged throughout the semester without being overbearing. Keep in mind that Sabin is the kind of professor who dives into his interests and skims over other things, so accordingly the beginning of the course is a bit dry while the latter 2\/3 of the course (roughly 1840-present) is phenomenally taught, but it's overall an engaging class to sit through. The grading is fair it's definitely not an easy A, but if you put in the requisite time\/effort, you'll do well.",
    "Pretty good class overall. You learn a lot about environmental history and the various influence and themes associated with it. It's not a gut but it's also not terribly demanding work-wise. It's a good way to pick up a writing credit, especially if you're at all interested in learning about people's relationship with the environment. It's a solid 4th or 5th class - I took it as one of my two less demanding classes in my most demanding semester and it was a good decision.",
    "It's fine as a fifth class, but don't expect to be wowed or learn much new material.",
    "I think this class leans more history than environmental studies. As a history class, I think it functions very well--learning about context, narrative, etc. The readings were all fairly relevant and interesting. I also liked that the class focused more on ideas and a diverse cast of actors as opposed to just the men in power of the day. As an environmental studies class, I would have preferred more focus on how the natural environment affected Americans and not vice versa. Same amount of writing as most history courses, but with a WR credit.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course. You learn a a ton about American History through the lens of Environmental history. Anyone interested in the environment should take this course.",
    "I would recommend this student as a great background to American (really strictly American) environmental history to use as a basis for discussion of current environmental challenges.",
    "Fantastic class, professor Sabin is really amazing. I thought environmental history would be so boring, but Sabin really teaches the course well. I really came to care a lot about the class by the end of the semester and I learned a lot about the trends that underlie human interactions with the environment. If you care about the environment at all and want a better perspective on how to fix environmental problems and see what people in the past have done, you should take this class.",
    "Great course that engaged with both historical and present day issues, great class for EVST majors",
    "I would probably recommend this course; the workload is manageable and the professor is pretty good. This class gave a really comprehensive view of American environmental history, and the information was presented in a logical and understandable way.",
    "Yes, I really enjoyed it and learned a lot.",
    "Absolutely!!",
    "Definitely take this class!",
    "Yes, I would highly recommend this course. Even a survey of environmental history is worth taking because it covers so many concepts and issues that are becoming increasingly relevant (environmental justice and climate change for example)",
    "Great class, great prof. Take it if you're interested in the environment!",
    "Yes, this course is a good overview of important developments in American natural history. The lectures are pretty interesting and the readings are decent. Anyone with a passion for the outdoors will find this class engaging, as you learn about the national parks, conservationism, westward expansion, and many other interesting topics.",
    "I loved this class and would recommend to anyone interested in the environment, history, or doing a research project."
