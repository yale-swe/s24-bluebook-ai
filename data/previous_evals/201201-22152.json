    "I would recommend this course in the highest possible terms to any Yale student- one of the best experiences I have had at Yale!",
    "This class is rather pleasant and easy, though at times too easy. One memoir a week, one critical essay, one autobiographical essay, and one longer that's either critical or autobiographical. Stepto is one of the kindest and sweetest professors I've encountered here, but the structure of the seminar made it so that there was literally no incentive to do the reading. I have no doubt that many in the class just didn't do it. I'd definitely say take the class -- but don't expect to have a rigorous academic experience.",
    "Yes, definitely.",
    "This class is good if you're interested in different autobiography-writing techniques. The reading list covers several different kinds of texts, and it's a good chance to read books you might otherwise never read.",
    "Don't have to do the reading and it's mostly just a lecture in seminar form, and the assignments are really enjoyable. You also get to read some classical autobiographies and some more modern ones, so the breadth was really good, take it!!",
    "WORKLOAD:-one \"critical\" essay (5 pages) on a book from the class-a short personal\/autobiographical essay (5 pages)-a longer personal\/autobiographical essay (10 pages)Other than that, you just have to read and discuss in class once a week (but the discussions are always really relaxed, so there's no pressure). You might have to do a short, informal, oral presentation at the beginning of one class, but it's not a big deal. Overall, the workload was pretty light compared to other classes. Great fifth class.GRADING:-pretty generous (you'll probably get an A if you complete the assignments)OTHER THOUGHTS:-books at the beginning are kind of boring and historical (e.g., Frederick Douglass)-later in the course, the books get more interesting (e.g., we did a graphic novel)-because the assignments were so open-ended, they're pretty fun to do (when else do you have a class with papers like, \"Write five pages on any story from your life\"?)",
    "memoirs!! i love the genre so i loved doing my reading for this class and i found the papers to be enjoyable and interesting to write.",
    "Take it if you want an easy senior seminar or can motivate yourself; there's no incentive to try and discussion is minimal, nonexistent.",
    "I would recommend this class. I would tell English majors that Autobiography feels more like an American Studies class than a typical English class",
    "Yes."
