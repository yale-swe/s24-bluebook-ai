    "I would say take it, if you have an interest in LGBT history. It's a fair bit of reading, but the material is fascinating, and you're allowed a lot of personal freedom in your final archival research project to explore whatever you want.",
    "Urban Sexualities is a very good class. The readings are extremely interesting, though often lengthy, and Professor Stewart-Winter is brimming with enthusiasm. The discussions were stilted at times, I think partially because Professor Stewart-Winter is new and a little nervous. He is, however, very available to his students and quite knowledgeable about his topic area; I think confidence will come with time. I really enjoyed the trajectory of this class and it got more interesting as time went on.",
    "Great seminar! Even if you've never taken a humanities course or a seminar before (like me), this is a great place to start as long as you're interested in the subject matter. The workload is manageable and the readings\/material are very interesting!",
    "This class was amazing. The readings and professor really inspire great discussions. I would definitely recommend this class to fellow students.",
    "Definitely recommend it even if you're not sure you know what \"urban sexualities\" means. I'm still not sure what it means, but definitely did a lot of thinking about how sexuality (normally not considered place based) and urbanity (normally considered JUST a place) intersect and structure each other. So that was really interesting.",
    "I would recommend the course."
