    "This is a pretty enjoyable class. Even if you don't love writing poetry, the discussions are interesting and the workload's light for the writing credit.",
    "I don't recommend this class to someone who already knows a lot about poetry.",
    "Take this class if you can! It's really nice to read this much good poetry but with an interesting unifying theme. I thought I'd hate the writing-poetry part but ended up enjoying it a lot. But if you don't feel like doing any creative writing for a non-\"Creative Writing\" class, DON'T take this. You'll have to write a poem a week - doesn't sound like much but can feel like it if you don't want to write it.",
    "I'd recommend the class highly to anyone interested in American poetry and poets, place, nature, landscape and literary form. Great, small and interactive seminar which attracted a good group of students--including a couple of older students and graduate students--across disciplines.Take the seminar, you won't regret it.",
    "This class is mainly valuable as a way to expose yourself to poetry you might not come across otherwise, as well as to learn about the biographies and backgrounds of the poets you read. The theme of the class, poets and landscapes, means you get a cross-section of poets and poems that you won't necessarily find elsewhere. The class is much less successful as a workshop of student work. We critiqued three student poems a week, but the critiques were fairly polite, mild, and unenthusiastic because a workshop atmosphere is never established. The poetry writing exercises also place a large emphasis explaining aspects of meter and structure, so if you're not familiar with those things then youmight find them pretty helpful. Otherwise, you won't get much out of the critique, so you'll probably be disappointed with the writing and workshopping in this class. Basically, if you haven't written much poetry and you want to read some great poets, this could be a great class for you. If you're looking for a place to write and discuss poetry, you might want to check out a different class.",
    "Dolores Hayden is living testimony of the incalculable value of the one-to-one format of a seminar. Her love of the subject matter was infectious and you got the sense that she genuinely enjoyed sharing these poets and poems with us. Put simply, Professor Hayden is a skilled educator who made the act of learning new poetry forms effortless and even pleasurable. Each week was devoted to a specific type of poem, and we read and discussed examples of that poem type and then tried our hands at writing one (we wrote ballads, rhymes, couplets,open form poems and villanelles). Definitely take this class if you can. The work load isn't overwhelming, you'll learn a lot, and Professor Hayden is inspirational."
