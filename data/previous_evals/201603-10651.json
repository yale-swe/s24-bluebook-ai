   "comments": [
    "Excellent overview of econometrics with practical and applied emphasis.",
    "This class is hard, probably one of the hardest classes I've ever taken, but so worth it. I feel like I better understand what economic research actually is and feel like I could possibly do my own research.",
    "I got good with Stata.",
    "An extension and more detailed version of Econ 131. Harder and more thereotical.",
    "Basic but very useful econometric models, STATA",
    "I learned some very useful skills for working with STATA. I also gained some a deep understanding of the theory behind all of the concepts.",
    "the econometric thought process in determining relationships between variables and how that applies to the real world",
    "How to do regressions.",
    "This class teaches you the ins and outs of econometric applications. You will learn about an estimation method and then immediately apply it to a data set for your PSet or read an econometric study that uses it. I think this class really brings to light the beauty of the subject and just how useful the subject is for empirical research in the future.",
    "We covered multivariate regression methods, briefly reviewing statistical concepts (t-tests, F-tests, etc.) and jumping into the mathematical assumptions behind OLS regression, heteroskedasticity, weighted-least squares, difference in difference, instrumental variables, and logit and probit. Along the way, we went through many examples of each of these econometric strategies in academic papers."

   "comments": [
    "Lecture is hard to stay focused in but if you have Mohit Agarwal as your TA you're golden. Without Mohit I don't know if I would have enjoyed or done as well in the course.",
    "Super helpful TA and professor. It goes really quickly and packs a lot of information in, so it's easy to get behind, but it's not that bad.",
    "The course moves a bit more quickly than is comfortable, especially over topics not covered in ECON 131. The final exam was really hard.",
    "Strengths: Interesting material. Very straightforward. Great structure. Weakness: It's just an overall hard course. Fast paced (strength and weakness) If you didn't listen to the first few minutes of lecture you might be lost for the entire duration of the lecture.",
    "The course is very intensive and informative, can learn a ton from it. However, sometimes the materials are not taught in a quite systematic way to help build an overall picture and understanding of the subject.",
    "The lectures aren't the strongest. They aren't very engaging and they cover difficult material. When it's time to do the Psets, they can often times be very difficult.",
    "Good overview of most regression techniques used in economics currently; helps a lot in understanding and reading papers in the literature (e.g. for other classes\/seminars). However lectures went a little fast (especially when going through all the proofs\/math which didn't seem very relevant but which we were tested on a lot - exams and problem sets could have emphasized a bit more on applications) and sometimes hard to understand. Papers in the class were relevant and interesting. We could have had more practice with STATA and working with empirical data though.",
    "This course is quite well organized by week, covering the topics as they are clearly listed on the syllabus. Though challenging, the problem sets definitely drilled certain proofs and techniques into our heads so that we better understood them. The lecture slides were generally very well explained and easy to follow. And the readings chosen were often very interesting. The book was also tremendously helpful. The one potential shortcoming is that lectures often didnt seem to add additional insight to the slides posted or the assigned reading in the book. There also didnt seem to be an incentives to read the papers as they were assigned (instead of just reading them before the mid-term and final). It might be possible to have some discussion of the papers in section (like a seminar-style discussion, not just a lecture about the paper) to encourage students to do the readings."

   "comments": [
    "It's definitely more practical than 136. Again, if you have Mohit as your TA you should definitely take it, he makes the course really great.",
    "Yes, take this class if you actually want to learn something. 131 teaches nothing in comparison. psets aren't that bad and there are only six of them, plus the professor and TA are both very helpful in answering questions about them",
    "Highly recommend if you know you'll need statistics in your life. Low workload, but that workload is pretty hard.",
    "Yes! Take it if you're interested in econometrics and data analysis. You'll have lots of great papers to talk about, and you'll be able to read and understand academic papers (and even have the foundational knowledge to produce your own)!",
    "Yes! Even though it was a very difficult course, I am very glad I took it. I learned so much in this class! At the end, we each wrote 14 page research papers. I would not have been able to do any of it without taking this class. It is far more difficult than Econ 131, but extremely rewarding.",
    "ECON 132 is very important if you want to be able to read\/understand most of the economic literature; it helped me a lot with my other classes and seminars this semester and is very useful if you ever have to write a paper involving empirical data (131 barely teaches you anything). Lectures are pretty understandable but Altonji goes very quickly so you really have to read the textbook before class in order to stay ahead. Also unfortunately you need to know the proofs and the math he goes through as well, even though it isn't all that relevant in my opinion. Problem sets were really long and quite mathy instead of application-based (except the last 2) and most people didn't know how to do them - go to the TA for help. Exams are hard and the curve won't save you. But still it's a very important and useful course, I learnt a ton and Altonji is a really great guy as well.",
    "100%. Definitely take a smaller course load when you do because you will want to devote as much time to this course as you can to get the most out of it.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course for anyone who is interested in becoming more comfortable with Stata or wants to be a research assistant for professors in the economics department (since some of them want to see that youve taken this course)!"
