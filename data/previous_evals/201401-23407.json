   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend this class. It was very interesting and a lot of fun.",
    "AMST 013 is a good course. It is a good way to get one's feet wet in the documentary and anthropology fields. The course also changed the way I thought about certain cultural and racial issues. I would recommend this course, but be wary that doing all of the reading is very difficult and every Monday night requires 2 hours of your time for screenings.",
    "This class is a really great mix of film, anthropoogy, american studies and all the departments it's listed under. Sometimes attending film screenings every week got tiring and the movies weren't always super interesting, but in the end you can say you've seen a lot of great documentaries and it can really change your views and make you question a lot if you're into that.",
    "There are essentially two aspects to AMST 013. First, we study the process of creating a documentary and the strategies used by documentary filmmakers. We talk about common problems when it comes to documentaries, and whether or not the solutions are ethical. Secondly, we talk about the content of each documentary we watch. In this sense, it's a class about cultural encounter and cultural difference. Each week you watch 1-2 films and have readings on each film. I would absolutely recommend this class to another student. This freshman seminar was an amazing course.",
    "This course was super interesting, even if you are not primarily interested in film.",
    "A great class for a basic overview of documentary films (and some learning about global issues). Very interesting, and not overly demanding. The weekly screenings are a bit of a time commitment, but very worth it.",
    "AMST 013 was a fantastic seminar. It covered really interesting material and let me think deeply about a lot of ideas and topics that I have not or will not talk about in my other coursework.",
    "Wonderful discussions on well-chosen films, a solid amount of reading, and a few papers. Zareena is a fantastic teacher in a seminar, take a class iwth",
    "This is a great class. Take it because you want to reevaluate preconceptions and open up your mind.",
    "The best class I've taken at Yale hands down. The best class I've taken ever. Zareena is absolutely amazing. She's the coolest, most engaging, most fun, most intelligent professor I've ever had. She made such an effort to establish a relationship with each of her students, and you could tell that she was super passionate about the course and her work. Zareena is what made this class. Take this class!!",
    "I would recommend this class to literally anyone. It's actually so fun and you learn so much about the world, and the way you perceive yourself\/your role in it will probably change.",
    "Documentary Film in Global Age is an amazing introduction into the world of documentary film. The documentaries that we watched were fantastic and extremely broad-reaching in terms of content. The class definitely developed my budding interest in documentary film and inspired me to explore the field more in the future."
