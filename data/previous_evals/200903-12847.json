    "You...will...work. That's the only way you'll learn the language, but you will definitely be able to string a couple of sentences together come the end of the semester. Sometimes I think in Spanish now, because this class was so intensive. It meets everyday, so you're always on your toes. I would recommend it to anybody who wants to learn a new language, but who particularly wants to learn Spanish. You shouldn't take it if you're just lukewarm about it, because the amount of work you put in may not be worth it. Great class though.",
    "Good introductory class. Homework everyday but it's not too bad.",
    "you have to take it so get it out the way early but make sure you stay on top of the work because you can easily fall behind..research the teachers because that can make all of the difference in the world",
    "It was great, I would recommend it.",
    "This is a good introduction class. It's not too difficult, but as a teacher, I would say that Lourdes is a more difficult grader than some of the others. I would say that it's worth it though, as she is easy to understand and explains difficult concepts well.",
    "If you just want to take a language to fulfill the requirement, take French. I heard everybody gets an A in French, but Spanish L1 doesn't even curve."
