    "ds lit sem 2, exactly what youd expect. but probably a little more fun because the prose gets more modern and interesting.",
    "Spending winter break reading \"Don Quixote\" and spring break reading \"War and Peace\" is 100% worth it! These two novels were the highlight of my DS Literature experience, but the other works we read this semester were equally inspiring (Wordsworth!). Great lectures, Levin is a fabulous section leader (sections are focused and interesting, and she is extremely kind and approachable for help), and an exciting continuation of the journey started in the fall.",
    "The main draw of Professor Levin's section is her unbounded enthusiasm for Directed Studies and for all the books you read. She will get you pumped to read some of the best things you'll ever read in your life, and her section welcomes your every contribution. She's not particularly challenging as DS professors go, and her section rarely heats up to the point where there's an actual debate going on. She also tends to hold very orthodox positions on the works and their place in the canon. Still, she's a knowledgeable and lovable professor, the books themselves are fantastic, and you get to have dinner at the President's house in the end, so all's well.",
    "The syllabus rocks; however, I think the second semester Literature course is the one that suffers most from the rapid, survey nature of Directed Studies. Professor Levin is a total sweetheart. She does a good job at trying to provide a more or less comprehensive treatment of the books (considering the time pressure) but the class can sometimes feel a bit high school-esque, in that she rarely (never) challenges anyone's comments.",
    "If you're reading this, you're probably going into you're second semester of DS, so I don't need to explain the details. Professor Levin is very friendly and she leads discussions smoothly. I don't know exactly how she compares to the other lit professors, but I'd assume she's near the top.",
    "A great introduction to some books. Don't expect it to redefine your view on history or western civilization.",
    "Yes."
