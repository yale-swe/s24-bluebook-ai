    "It is very good. But if you do not have the preliminary background for nuclear physics or quantum physics, you will have a tough time to keep up.",
    "The course itself is required, both literally and ideally, for the study of physical chemistry. Just don't fall behind on the lecture, do the HW, and practice exams. Cross is an excellent instructor for it. If you are looking for more advanced study, he can guide you to more advanced materials."
