    "A furthered understanding of the nuance of the Japanese language and culture.",
    "I learned how to read, write, and speak beginners level Japanese. My memorization skills were developed. I realized that learning Japanese was going to take a lot more time and effort than I had expected, but the rewards are definitely worth it. It was also really fun, working with my classmates every day.",
    "This semester, I learned more knowledge on Japanese language, which now seems to me a language that I can use in real life.",
    "I developed a basic knowledge of Japanese writing, speaking, reading, and listening as a result of having taken this course. Additionally, this course allowed me to gain some insight into some aspects of Japanese culture in addition to learning language skills.",
    "I learned a lot more Japanese. I got better at reading, writing, and speaking.",
    "Japanese is a lot harder than it seems, but the language is a lot of fun and worth learning."

   "comments": [
    "This course is very interactive and makes sure that students stay engaged. However, there may be too much material in this course, as it moves extremely quickly and some topics feel skipped over.",
    "This is a great class. All of the Sensees are nice and willing to help the students. They are also really funny. There is a lot of work, but it is all really helpful and varies in style. I felt like the class went a little bit too fast. It was hard to keep up sometimes and to absorb everything we were learning. Overall, this class could be improved by slowing down. Also, it would be really fun if we had a project where we had to make a song or media assignment. Otherwise, I really enjoyed it.",
    "I think this course is very intriguing and I can see my progress every day. Most of the classes are fun, unless sometimes teachers want to squeeze too much into one class. Homework is a little too much though.",
    "I really benefited from how engaging this course was; Japanese language classes have been the most immersive classes I've taken at Yale. This course is very strong at giving students confit fence in their Japanese language ability despite the short amount of time and the relative difficulty of the Japaneae language to native English speakers. The amount of time and work spent in this class really reflected in the results; I felt like I learned as much Japanese in L1 and L2 as I learned Spanish throughout the entirety of high school. I legitimately do not believe this course had any weaknesses.",
    "It's a lot of work but you learn a lot so I think it's worth it. I don't have many criticisms, the program is set up really well in my opinion.",
    "The course often goes so fast that I cannot internalize as much of the material as I would like. Constant activities and projects help but also seem to bog down the workload a ton at times."

   "comments": [
    "Yes; the class is enjoyable and challenging all while being manageable and fun.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class if you are interested in learning Japanese. However, if you are looking for an easy language credit, this is not it, if you don't have any Japanese experience. Overall, it is an incredibly rewarding class that is a lot of fun. If you put in the work you will have a great experience and learn a lot. I loved this class and the friends I made. The sensees are great too.",
    "I think it is a great course for who students who want to start with Japanese language, get to know more about Japanese culture, or want to take some language course aside from very difficult math or philosophy to switch to a different area of their brain, but keep in mind: the work load is huge - around 15 hours per week, so students should make sure that they have the time to work on this.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to any student looking to learn a new language. I was tentative at first given my complete lack of experience with East Asian Languages, but the professors do an excellent job of teaching. This was a great continuation of Japanese 110.",
    "I would recommend this to anyone interested in the language and willing to put in the work to do well in the class.",
    "The Japanese program is very well put together, and while it is a tough workload, it is manageable if you make the time."
