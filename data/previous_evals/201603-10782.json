    "I had never done playwriting before (I'm a fiction writer) so this was a good intro course to the subject. The reading list was pretty great, so my scope of knowledge about different authors and styles definitely expanded.",
    "Writing scenes with objects in them, raising stakes, figuring out 'why does this scene happen on this night?'",
    "I had virtually no experience writing drama before this course. As such, I found it deeply enlightening and a great experience.",
    "A comprehensive understanding of the successful techniques great playwrights use. A deeper awareness of the kinds of stylistic devices we can use in writing plays, as well as the necessary conventions for a well-made play, i.e. the presence of an event, urgency, drama.",
    "I learned new and unconventional ways of storytelling."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The semester I took the course, Professor Margulies was experimenting with having us write and workshop 5 page scenes from different prompts every week. Although this was useful in the first half (especially since a lot of us didn't have playwriting experience and were able to try out new things without worrying if they worked in a large context), at a certain point I would have liked to have been pushed to write something longer. I also would have liked for there to be a way to get more feedback specifically from Prof Margulies.",
    "It needs a culminating assignment; otherwise, the exercises feel pointless, like they're not working toward anything.",
    "This class is really special. I can think of no ways that it can be improved. It's clearly the result of many years of refinement, and it's a great learning opportunity.",
    "Strengths: a great reading list, stretching across time periods and themes. I loved that the reading list included plays by contemporary playwrights of colour. Weaknesses: perhaps more feedback from Professor Margulies himself on our individual writings.",
    "I found the conversation and debates in this class to be fascinating. To improve, there could be an assignment that the students are working towards. It sort of felt like the weekly scenes were not leading up to anything",
    "I LOVED THIS CLASS. The writing exercises were varied and always fun."

   "comments": [
    "I'd recommend this course for people looking for a basic intro to playwriting.",
    "Only if you are an independent learner and are going to seek Margulies out in office hours.",
    "Take this class, if possible! Even if you're not planning on being an English major or doing a writing concentration. It's really great: the reading is fun, the work is a blast, and Professor Margulies is one of Yale's greatest resources.",
    "Yes! It was an honour to be in Professor Margulies' class, learning from someone so successful in the industry as a Pulitzer-Prize winning playwright. Also a great way to increase your repository of great plays you've read.",
    "Yes!",
    "This class is fun, low-stress, and interesting. Definitely one of my favorite writing workshops at Yale."
