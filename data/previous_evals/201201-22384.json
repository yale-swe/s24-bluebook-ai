    "219 is a continuation of 219 with harder and more harmonically complex examples. Take it! Sarita is ok, but she is definitely overrated as a teacher (probably because she is VERY nice and everyone loves her) so definitely shop both sections.",
    "Great course, highly recommended for absolutely all music majors or serious performers\/composers\/arrangers.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. It was very fun and you learn how to listen.",
    "It's a fun class with a very light workload (keyboard lab can be a little daunting or little to no work at all depending on your experience). Take it with Sarita! She's awesome.",
    "A good way to work on your skills for sightreading and analysis - take it if you've taken 218 and are interested in it. But only take it with Sarita - other instructors (I've heard) tend to be not so great\/helpful.",
    "Great course, be prepared for MUCH more challenging material than 218, in general.",
    "Very necessary for the major or anyone who wants to improve their ear. Take it with Sarita!!"
