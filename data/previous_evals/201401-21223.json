    "If there is anything you can do -- truly anything at all -- to avoid taking this course, do it. As an EECS student, I never should have taken it. This is far and above the worst course I've taken at Yale. The material is dull and completely irrelevant to my interests (so let that be a warning to EECS students looking at this elective!). There's no textbook. The lecture notes printed out for you are nice, but they're not available online, so you had better hope you never get sick and miss a class. Problem sets aren't available online either. A syllabus was given on the first day, but I found out a couple weeks into the class that there were typos on it about how the grade was calculated; I still don't know how the grade is actually calculated, because the syllabus isn't available online. Lectures are dull, and Narendra talks at the chalkboard the whole time. First day of class he told us that his research comes first, which really should have warned me not to take the course. If you need to take this course because you're an EE major, be sure to take advantage of the TA outside of class; he's pretty fantastic at explaining things. Better yet, look at MIT's online lectures for signals and systems, because MIT is actually an engineering school. But really, don't take this class. Just don't. Walk away, change your major away from EE, and enjoy your life.",
    "This is a good class. Lectures are usually well given, and professor Narendra is awesome. Get to know him personally. There is no real textbook, so all the course materials are notes handed out in class. The notes are usually pretty good, but can be confusing. I didn't find the material particularly difficult, although there were some tricky conceptual issues, especially later in the term. Overall, I learned alot about signals and systems.",
    "This course covers many aspects of signals and systems (like determining stability of a system, for example). Professor Narendra's notes are a very useful resource, as they follow the lectures very closely. I recommend the course if you are interested in learning more about the topic.",
    "A great class with interesting material. Prof. Narendra oftentimes talks to the board, but the assignments are good and the exams fair. Expect to put in a good amount of time though. Prof. Narendra loves talking to undergrads so be sure to take advantage of office hours and also meet with the TAs for assignments. You'll need the TA's (Prashanth) help. If you're interested in the systems track of EE, you should definitely take this.",
    "The first week of class during shopping period I was so excited for this class. Don't be fooled. Unfortunately it went downhill from there. The class material is extremely useful and essential; this is evinced by the fact that non EE majors take this course even though it is a 300 level EE course. As is somewhat typical of classes with very fundamental material, this class is an above average work commitment. The p-sets, even though they are only 7, are long, especially the first 4. The problem is that the professors teaching style is not the best and is poorly organized. Although there is a nominal official textbook, Narendra follows his own notes which are fairly technical and not easily digestible. He is essentially a scatter brain so there is not as much organization to class. Also, there was one TA for 16 students each with long psets, so he could not keep up. Problem sets were returned late. Midterm was returned in the second to last week of class. One positive to the class: Midterm and Final were both much more fair than expected (based on the difficult psets) and actually tested material that was part of the curriculum. If you are an EE major you will take it, learn a lot of essential information, but not enjoy it. If you are EECS you should consider taking it because the material is fundamental. If you are a physics or other major, I do not recommend EE310, take EE 202 with Sekhar instead.",
    "Lots of work per PSet. Get them done quickly, and the class won't be that bad. Go to lecture, even though they're rather dry. Seek outside materials and get to know Narendra personally. EENG 310 is a fascinating class - only if you actively engage.",
    "EENG 310 was one of my least favorite courses at Yale. I recommend you stay far away. Prof. Narendra is a very nice fellow, but I cannot say he is a good instructor. I was particularly displeased when he cancelled class two days in a row toward the end of the semester for no apparent reason. He then cancelled the makeup lecture he had promised. While I understand every professor is busy, I felt as if Prof. Narendra did not give this class his best effort. I was particularly unhappy when he failed to uphold his promise to teach the practical applications of the subject matter.",
    "I took this class as an Applied Physics major and found it very interesting given my interests in sound synthesis and acoustics. Most students have taken the EE 200,201,202 sequence before joining this class, if you don't have those there will be some EE specific concepts to catch up with. Many concepts (as opposed to \"math\") in this class were new to me as a Physics major. Linear Algebra is not needed, but you would be wise to have taken ENAS 194 Differential Equations. The concept of a Laplace transform will be extended a lot in this course and the class in general is very theoretical and mathematical. Professor Narendra sides on the theoretical aspect of systems and the material is interesting - Systems analysis, stability, system response. His lectures can be a little slow at times, but you should go to talk to him in person in his office. He is wonderful at making time for undergraduates and is very very good at answering questions making you go \"aha!\" He is one of the few professors who really really cares about his undergraduates! Also, you will get lecture note handouts, but the textbook is also very helpful.",
    "I only took this class because there was no other alternative EE class that I could take for my last elective as an EECS major. The professor is good to talk to outside of class but is horrible at teaching. He is very disorganized and keeps skipping from topic to topic. The course also does not follow a textbook. I would not recommend taking this class but if you do\/have to, be ready to do a lot of self learning.",
    "The psets are long and a lot of work, but the class is super interesting and i'm glad i took it.",
    "Yes I would recommend it to EE majors"
