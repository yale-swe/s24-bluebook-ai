   "comments": [
    "I enjoyed the course and material, but I think the section you choose has the potential to make or break your personal experience.",
    "Multivariable calculus is pretty straightforward. I hadn't taken math for four years, and I found the class to be a lot of fun and very doable. If you're going to take the class, you have to take it with Michal. He's an excellent lecturer, comprehensible, and very helpful in and outside of class. (And it was his first time teaching the course; I'm sure he'll be even better if he teaches it again!)",
    "Math 120 is like any other math class you've taken--except for a few things. There's a solid textbook and lots of practice problems, but the whole course is founded upon these inimaginable concepts that I couldn't wrap my head around. You learn to think in three dimensions. You take surface integrals and line integrals without really knowing what they mean. The computation is not difficult, but knowing what you're doing is the real challenge.",
    "Almost a dozen sections of about 20-30 students each. Figure out which T.A.s are good!! Basic multivariable calculus- probably not too different from any other school, except our textbook was built for this course at Yale!",
    "Anyone looking to take a Multivariable Calculus class without proofs should take this. If you did well in calculus in high school and you pay attention in class, this shouldn't be too much of a hassle. Beware, however, that the final is much tougher than the midterms. Study hard.",
    "Math 120 is a basically average course, with an emphasis on developing problem solving techniques, the workload is sometimes frustrating, and sometimes boring, but regular and always manageable. Michal is a devoted, enthusiastic teacher, and his section would be well worth staying in (I switched out of Yen Quang Do's section, and was much happier for it, I think.)",
    "A standard introductory math class. The material wasn't fascinating, but if you like math or need Math 120 for your major, you'll probably take it anyway. The most important thing: make sure you find a good TA!!! Shop different sections until you find one. Michal Tryniecki was really good - he explained things clearly, gave lots of examples, and was super available for help outside of class (even outside of office hours and on the weekends).",
    "Generic multivariable class.",
    "Yes I would. Math 120 is the foundation for higher mathematics, and I found the course to be very fun. The extra help is there if you need it, and the exams are very fair.",
    "I would recommend this course. I took AP Calculus BC in high school and this course was the next logical progression. Be careful which professor you get; it does matter, although regardless I found it best to always read the textbook before class, otherwise some of the new material would go over everyone's heads. The 2 midterms are relatively fair, but the final is completely unexpected.",
    "The class was very difficult, and most people who were in it had already taken some form of multivariable. As someone who had not taken it before, I had a lot of trouble understanding it. I would recommend the class only if you have to take it.",
    "Most of you probably don't have a choice when it comes to taking Math 120. If you're going to take it, take it with Prof. Tryniecki. He is extremely helpful and well-organized, and though he might seem to go a bit fast, he is always available for office hours, often at your convenience. Despite the boring material, he manages to keep you awake, which is more than can be said of most professors. And unlike other foreign professors, his accent isn't so bad that you can't understand him. Probably the most important thing to know about him is that he really likes what he does; he genuinely likes Math and teaching. That being said, be prepared for hard course; Math 120 is no joke.",
    "It is a rigorous course, but then again it is a high level of math. Would not recommend for anyone that really does not need to take it. Econ majors take 118. Besides that it is a great course and very straight forward.",
    "Take this class-but only if you have one of the the awesome instructors . Don't just take any section.",
    "Math 120 is a much harder version of Calculus BC. You will need a strong background in derivatives and integrals, as well as an ability to visualize different graphs\/equations. If you intuitively grab most math concepts, you should be fine. If not, it's still possible to do reasonably well, but it will take a good amount of work and effort to fully understand the material and apply it to all sorts of curve-ball questions. Don't fall behind because material is covered extremely quickly. But overall, I would recommend this class to people who genuinely love math or are willing to put in a lot of work for it.",
    "Math 120 is definitely a good course to take. The material is challenging, but not unmanageable. My professor was very good at teaching in a manner that would allow me to understand the material better. The biggest weakness of the class is that I felt unprepared for the exams; I felt as if the questions asked on the tests did not necessarily correlate to what we had learned in class. Many times, when I looked at practice exams, I would not understand how to even approach the problem, despite having done all of the problem sets and understanding the sample questions given in class."
