   "comments": [
    "Definitely take this class. It's one of the best science classes that you can take if you are a non-science person, an its the best way to fulfill the science requirement. It may seem like a lot of work at first because there are weekly problem sets and reading quizzes (plus class on Friday), but do not get intimidated by that. This class has a really manageable work load, and you can definitely do well if you work hard.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class, especially for someone looking for a science credit that isn't too much science. I am not a science person, but I was interested in every topic we discussed, and really have an understanding for how the earth works now.",
    "I have recommended this class to everyone I know!! The class is very very interesting and a joy to take.",
    "Take it.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. The professors are great and explain all the concepts very well. Class was lots of fun. One of the best courses I have taken at Yale.",
    "An interesting science class, with a bit more math than it would suggest",
    "Highly recommended for non-science majors, especially any meteorology\/earth science geeks like myself who do not plan on majoring in the subject.",
    "Take it if you are slightly interested in the material. If you are taking it for a science credit, I would look at other options. If you don't mind Friday lectures and weekly reading quizzes, then take it. The material is not hard and the midterms and finals also focus on the general themes but it just takes up a lot of time with classes three times a week, reading quizzes and weekly P-sets.",
    "This is not an easy gut. You will have weekly Psets and 2 midterms and a final. If you are prepared to put in a good amount of work, then this class is for you. If you want to get an easy science credit, i'm not sure i would recommend this class. However, if you find you do like this class, Bercovici will take a group of about 10 kids on a Spring Break trip to Hawaii or the Caribbean.",
    "It was a great way to get a science credit without taking a gut or being way out of my depth. I enjoyed the class, and I learned a lot about how the world works. If you take it, go to class on Friday--then the homework is no problem.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. Problem sets, while challenging, are not difficult to get through, and the lectures are always really informative. Simple test format. A great science credit, highly recommend.",
    "it is a great class, especially if you are not a science person. it is very interesting and well taught.",
    "Yes - take this class. It is the perfect class for non-science majors and definitely worthwhile.",
    "If you need a science credit take this class. It is pretty interesting and not that difficult. Problem sets can get a little long but just go to your TA's for help. If you are a sciency person you will coast through this class.",
    "Amazing. Take this class. It's not difficult, it's interesting, and you get a chance to go to Hawaii and play with LAVA.",
    "Yes absolutely take it. Great professors and not a hard science course if you are looking to fulfill a requirement.",
    "I do not recommend this class. The instructors may lead you to believe there will not be much math, but there are problem sets due EVERY WEEK that are math intensive. Besides for that, the class is quite boring and intellectually unfulfilling.",
    "YES - all of my friends took Intro Bio Anthro and the night before both of our finals I was reading about hurricanes, tornadoes, volcanoes and asteroid impacts while they were cramming the specific names of endless evolutions of monkeys into their heads. The best part about Natural Disasters is that you interact with the environment everyday and are constantly reminded about the concepts we learned in class. It might be simple - but it's always interesting.",
    "Yes. Interesting and a great way to fulfill a science credit.",
    "Natural Disasters is a must-take for science and non-science majors alike. It covers material that everyone should know about the Earth: power sources (solar, geothermal, cosmological\/gravitational), the disasters themselves (quakes, volcanoes, tsunami, severe weather, meteors, fires), processes integral to understanding them (tectonics, magnetic field, etc), and some great related content (climate change, extinctions, brief history of the solar system, rise of life).Minimally quantitative and has very little technical terminology to memorize, but simple \/= bad; the instructor is incredibly conscious of the takeaway and what is most important to know, and this is the only class I've ever taken where I really expect to retain at least 80% of the material 5 years out. Incredibly lucid (best lecture slides I've ever seen), and Bercovici (the head of G&G) obviously loves the subject and is amazingly accessible. Don't be put off after the first lecture by the lack of dynamism in his voice as I almost was; sit closer to the front.",
    "If your looking for an interesting science class that is somewhat challenging then I would take this.",
    "Take it!! It's wonderful",
    "Its a great course that everyone should take. I doubt there is a more interesting or well taught course at Yale",
    "Take it if you need a science credit. There's more work than you might expect, and it gets trickier as the semester progresses (there's definitely more math than they lead you to believe at the beginning), BUT Professor Bercovici is great if you have any questions, and the exams aren't bad at all--just make sure you actually study and review your problem sets. But seriously, way less painful than most alternatives for fulfilling a science credit.",
    "A very fun, easy science credit where the exams come off the lecture slides and the p-sets are mostly easy physics. The class is basic earth science, at it's core (pun intended) because in order to understand disasters you have to understand how the earth operates normally. And disasters, of course, are only \"disasters\" insofar as there are humans in the way. They are more accurately natural events that maintain the state of the world over millions of years.The professors are also great and Prof. Bercovici might take some folks from the class to Hawaii or the Caribbean to see volcanoes, over spring break, if you're good.",
    "Good science credit. I would recommend it to anyone who wants a basic understanding of the way the earth works. Be prepared to put in some work though.",
    "Great class to take, especially if you need a science credit.",
    "Disastrous, naturally.",
    "Very interesting. Different than anything else offered. Harder than expected.",
    "DON'T TAKE THIS CLASS AS A GUT. The actual material isn't very hard. But the TA's grade SO hard for no reason. They just inexplicably take away points."
