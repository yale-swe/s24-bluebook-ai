    "I would recommend this course to anyone interested in photography.",
    "This course examined the use of photography in geological, political, economic, and aesthetic practices. We studied both stand alone images and photographs used in publication contexts. There was significant opportunity to engage with original materials in Yale's special collections. I would definitely recommend this class to others."

   "comments": [
    "This class encouraged me to think deeply about photography in ways that differ from my past experience with the field. I was already quite familiar with much of the history, but Professor Raab's framing of the course into two thematic sections made me reconsider familiar materials in extremely productive ways. I have no doubt that this will contribute to my dissertation research."
