   "comments": [
    "Don't take this class unless you've loved other WGSS classes. As an EAS major, I was way over my head in -isms and politically ubercorrect terminology. Prof. Chanda is intimidating, unhelpful and thinks only her opinions should count. On the other hand, some of the readings were quite interesting, and the other students in this class made discussions very lively and eye-opening. I enjoyed writing the papers for this class, but dreaded sitting through the actual seminar.",
    "This is not a bad class. The readings are interesting, the discussions have their positive moments. That said, I have to be reluctant in recommending this course to another student. My main issue was that I feel like the coursewas mis-advertised. The course really did not have much of a focus on comparing and contrasting American and Asian cultures nor the formation of identity within these cultures. It was very much a course on abstract theories regarding identity formation, and while this can certainly be interesting to some people, it is not why I took the course.",
    "Despite the title of the class and the fact that it's listed as an American Studies course, this course was much more focused on topics related to WGSS and Asia than to American history or culture. In other words, the emphasis was on \"gender\"and \"Asia,\" not so much culture, family, or the US. Also, sometimes the readings and discussion felt one-sided. We talked a lot about women's rights and the role of women in society, without focusing on men. This was the overarching theme throughout, but other then that, there was not much cohesion in the syllabus. With that said, the discussions and debates in the class were fascinating and often pretty heated, in a good way.",
    "This has been my favorite class at Yale. I thought the Professor was wonderful, the readings exciting and the discussions stimulating! I would definitely recommend this class to another. I did not like the guest lecture at the end too much and found some of the movies a bit over the top, but I absolutely loved every other aspect of the course.",
    "I would not recommend this class because it fails in its attempt to specialize in the comparison between Asian and American cultures. Instead, I would suggest a student take an introductory course in WGSS or a different class that specializes in the field.",
    "Take this class if you're even remotely interested in the topic. Professor Chanda is great, she will make you think hard about what you say in class but the discussions are always interesting. The readings\/films are cool for the most part, and the workload is manageable, so take it!",
    "If you are interested in Asian culture in any way, I recommend taking the class. Professor Chanda is absolutely brilliant and provides great insight to every reading or film screening involved with the course. However, if you're expecting to be mollycoddled the entire way - think twice before taking the course. Your thoughts will absolutely be challenged, and it can seem intimidating at times. However, you will be a much stronger thinker and writer because of it.",
    "Take it if you're really interested in the way that gender and identity shapes our world. The issues we talked about in class were incredibly applicable to daily life\u0097 it wasn't all abstract theory and bizarre WGSS vocabulary. You gain a different lens through which to view the world.",
    "This is one of the best courses I have taken at Yale, maybe the best. We had the type of engaging discussions I haven\u0092t seen in other seminars and discussed issues which are directly applicable to everyday life. While some of the reading was jargon-ey, other readings are very accessible and some will change the way you look at the world and family dynamics.I\u0092m a straight white male and this class has had as much impact on my viewpoint as any at Yale. Don\u0092t feel like you need to be Asian or a WGSS major to take this class\u0097it has something for everything. I discovered a lot about how the way I look at the world has been shaped by forces outside my consciousness and gained insight into my own family dynamics-- you can\u0092t ask for much more from a course.Professor Chanda is an absolutely dynamic professor, and tough in the best possible way. She takes the class as seriously as any teacher I have seen\u0097thus she takes it personally when you fail to fulfill class obligations. She personally responds to all the comments on the class discussion board and is excellent at leading class discussion. If you want a class to think your teeth into this is the right one\u0097you will be really rewarded. Try to stay on top of the reading, as it is much more interesting (for yourself and others) when you set aside the time to engage with it before class."
