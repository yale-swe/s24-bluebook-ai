   "comments": [
    "This course broadly covered 19th century Chinese immigrant labor, Japanese internment, and the 1992 Los Angeles riots as topics of study. While I had briefly learned about the first two topics before, I was really able to go in-depth and understand them on a deeper level. Professor Lowe cultivated a great list of readings for us, and also made sure to include movies\/fiction to help us understand from various angles. She also taught us the importance of placing Asian American history in its national\/global context, examining Asian Americans and their racialization in relation to other minority groups rather than solely against white Americans. The seminar itself wasn't as great as I hoped it would be, I think part of it was because we had a larger class at around 25 students. Professor Lowe is extremely kind and a brilliant thinker, but this course at times felt like a confusing mix of a lecture class and a seminar. At times, I felt like I learned more from the readings than actually being in class.",
    "Knowledge about significant Asian American events in history and how they represent relational race frameworks. Taught me a lot about how to think about race in America and how history is represented.",
    "Even though this was my first ER&M course (and my first course on Asian American history), I felt that I delved deeply into the topics covered in the class because of the way the course was structured. It wasn't just a cursory overview.",
    "Relatively thorough study of three major events in Asian American history. Critique of historiographical methods and a reevaluation of what \"knowledge production\" might mean -- how it operates through fiction, documentaries, plays, etc.",
    "I had never taken an Asian American Studies course before, and like many ER&M classes, it proves that it has universal implications despite popular depictions of ethnic studies fields as 'particular' and 'niche.'",
    "SO MUCH. Through examining Asian American history through local, national, and global contexts, I learned so much about American immigration history, politics, and foreign policy as well a broader global history of colonialisms, migration, and race\/gender\/class. It really changed my perspective on how I approach these topics in my other courses as well.",
    "This course teaches a very in-depth overview of the racializations of Chinese Americans, Japanese Americans, and Korean Americans each group is also read relationally with African Americans throughout the course. We had one visit to the Beinecke, where we were able to view archives as a starting point for our midterm papers.",
    "We examined three periods in Asian American history--Chinese immigrant labor, Japanese and Japanese American internment, and Korean American conflicts in Los Angeles--through an interdisciplinary frame. The course emphasizes a relational race studies bent, so these histories were not studied in a vacuum but were placed in local, regional, national, and global contexts to study converging while diverging processes of racialization alongside other marginalized groups including Indigenous, Black, and Mexican American peoples.",
    "I learned a lot about Asian American history and how it has contributed to shaping the American imagination. I developed an appreciation for the role that Asian Americans play in the American racial order.",
    "I learned about the history of anti-Asian American discrimination, racial triangulation, the positionality of Chinese Americans as coolies in 19th century America, the positionality of Japanese Americans returning from internment post-WWII, and the framing of the \"Black-Korean conflicts\" in Los Angeles. I gained the ability to conduct Beineke research, and the skills to effectively discuss these topics.",
    "A critical and relational look at (East) Asian American Studies. The papers emphasize working with primary materials, which can be a good starting point for people unused to working with archives, and which Prof Lowe is always careful to contextualize and interrogate.",
    "I learned much more historical context about the three case studies of Chinese railroad workers, Japanese internment, and the LA riots. I got some great examples of relational race theory work."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths: Great reading list, a kind\/compassionate\/brilliant professor who is one of the best thinkers of our time, includes cultural history (films, fiction) as opposed to just research papers. Weaknesses: Seminar wasn't run especially well, discussion could be dry at times if not awkward. I also wish that the course contents included South Asian and Southeast Asian narratives, it focused entirely on East Asian ones. This can be a common problem in \"Asian American\" courses.",
    "Lowe allowed about 25 people in the course. This is great because all of the people that wanted to take it probably got in. However, this made discussion awkward and not great. Many people had to sit in an 'outside circle' behind people who sat at the table, making an obvious in and outgroup. Lowe is extremely insightful and so kind, but that was my one complaint.",
    "The strength of this course is that the material is interesting. I enjoyed all of the readings and thought that the subject matter that we were dealing with was fascinating. The main weakness of the course is that there were too many people in it for it to be a good seminar. 25 people is simply too many for everyone to be able to be able to participate in a good discussion, so my engagement wasn't as high as it could have been. On top of that, Professor Lowe definitely lectures more than most seminar professors I've had so it wasn't a discussion heavy seminar.",
    "This was one of the best classes I've taken at Yale. I especially appreciated the level of intellectual rigor the professor expected from us. We were challenged in the very best way.",
    "Strengths: The course is a great introductory study of Asian American Studies and historiography, hinting at what Yale sorely lacks and desperately needs. Weaknesses: The course's title has a huge breadth and Professor Lowe limits the subject in practice to three major events\/topics in order to balance breadth and depth. However, I feel that this made the course very East-Asian-American-centric, and entire swaths rather than discrete areas of Asian American Studies were left out (critical refugee studies may be one example of many). I would hope to expand the course to maybe five or six events, or instead focus on ideas (i.e. \"migrant labor,\" \"militarism,\" \"incarceration\") to talk about multiple groups, periods, and locations in a single week.",
    "The course centered around student discussion in a way that was deeply informative and telling of the depth of others' prior engagement with Asian American Studies from the perspectives of multiple fields. As of now, I cannot think of many weaknesses that stand out.",
    "I really enjoyed the visit to the Beinecke, where we got to speak with librarians and view different archival materials. The readings were also very interesting, and I enjoyed the films that were assigned. My first impression upon reading the course title was that it would be a more comprehensive course on Asian American Studies the inclusion of \"colonialism\" and \"empire\" especially evoked Vietnam and the Philippines. However, we only learned about East Asian Americans, which was quite limiting.",
    "In terms of content, the course was really rich and was structured in a way that allowed the materials to make sense in terms of narrative. We started off with a useful framing on Week 1, then progressively had readings that allowed us to link each unit together, rather than studying them modularly. Of course, the cohesion of the syllabus was only made possible through Professor Lowe, a high-powered facilitator who begins most of the seminar sessions with a mini-lecture\/synthesis to help frame and kickstart the conversation. In addition, it's important to note that Professor Lowe is a super generous facilitator who really cares about her students and what they have to say. She is great at recapitulating and synthesizing students' points, while also bringing in other voices normally occluded by those more dominant.",
    "The course was really fascinating and discussions were well facilitated. Reading were fantastic and papers were fun to write.",
    "I really enjoyed the readings for this course, and our discussions about it always deepened my understanding. I loved that Professor Lowe would ask questions, and then build off of our answers to facilitate discussion. I don't have complaints about this course.",
    "The course is currently structured in three units: Chinese exclusion, Japanese internment, and 1992 LA disaster, all of which are paradigm shifts in AsAm Studies and East Asian American-centric. Shortening these units, adding material about Central\/South\/Southeast Asian Americans, and perhaps turning this seminar into a 2x a week seminar could improve it.",
    "The readings were excellent and Mary Liu is clearly a brilliant scholar. However, she often gave 30-minute lectures at the beginning of seminar that, though useful, weren't generative to seminar discussions. Also, for some reason, the conversations were stifled partly because of how large the group was."

   "comments": [
    "If you're interested in going more in-depth to Asian American history and have a primer in it, yes. It gives you the space and time to delve deeper into topics that you might be interested in, and the readings were really wonderful. If you're not already interested in Asian American history or really value engaging seminar discussions, this might not be for you. I treated it as a space for me to read deeply and chose midterm papers\/final papers on topics that I wanted to learn about on my own time, which made it worthwhile for me.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone interested in Asian American history and race theory. Professor Lowe is so knowledgeable on these subjects and the readings are all fascinating on these subjects.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. In my opinion, it is one of the best classes Yale has to offer.",
    "I 100% would. No matter if you are Asian American, if you are a History or American Studies or ER&M major; a course like this is essential to understanding how knowledge has come to be produced in order to create and maintain a social hierarchy (in this case a racial hierarchy). To contest not only the material relations of the hierarchy but also its logic and knowledge -- I feel that this is the aim of the field of study in general, and one that this course very effectively puts across.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone, not simply out of interest but as a means of further understanding the history of U.S. imperialism and its political economy, border security apparatus, and systems of racial formation.",
    "Absolutely! A must take course with a phenomenal, legendary professor who is an expert in this field.",
    "Yes, if you already have interest in the topic and are self-directed to an extent. Because it was a fairly large seminar, it was easy to zone out and be disengaged. However, there are reading responses but everyone is sorted into three rotating groups, so you have to either pose discussion questions or respond to discussion posts every two out of three weeks. The workload is very fair, and Professor Lowe is brilliant!",
    "Absolutely, whether you're in ER&M or not. The course is a great, in-depth exploration of fields pertaining to Asian American Studies, and is especially salient given its comparative basis. The assignments (combining archival analysis and secondary literature) are straightforward and really open to the writer's interests.",
    "Yes! Lisa Lowe is amazing! The readings are great and discussions are fantastic. You will learn so much!",
    "I would recommend this course to any student who has already had some background in American Studies\/ Critical Race theory but who wants to know more about the history of Asian Americans.",
    "Yes! Prof Lowe is brilliant, and if the course improves, all the better",
    "If you want an overview of Asian American history, I'd recommend taking Prof. Mary Liu's lecture course instead. Even if you're looking for a more in-depth examination of Asian American history, I think this course falls short. I'd best describe the course as a collection of lenses by which to examine Asian American history. While we often returned to the idea of relational race theory as a grounding theoretical \"lens,\" I often felt that the course was unstructured. We didn't have any common-ground theoretical language to discuss readings (and the class was quite large), so discussions felt stifled. I'd say only take this class if you aim to deeply pursue Asian American studies long-term (as a PhD, for example) and if you have a lot of experience with the subject matter. For someone who has done a lot of ethnic studies classes although not with an AsAm focus I felt very out-of-the-loop, and I wasn't able to take much away from the class."
