   "comments": [
    "The absolute best course I have taken at Yale. Every week I was left filled with thoughts and with a changed worldview.",
    "I didn't particularly enjoy this course. The different topics were barely connected, and I feel like after a semester in the course, I still have no idea what grand strategy actually is. I'm not sure the professors know what grand strategy is. The professors were also sometimes unapproachable and played obvious favorites.",
    "A comprehensive course that delves deeply into the great books in an attempt to broaden students' world view. A great survey of some of the philosophical and strategic minds that have forever altered the course of history.",
    "GS has many obvious strengths, such as its distinguished professors, the outside events, and the summer funding. The readings are great for the most part, but I wish they could be better integrated into the discussion. Nobody seems to do the reading because a) it is so much and b) you don't have to. I also liked the diversity of the student body, I think this really brought a lot of different perspectives to the table. Sometimes people can be a bit tense though, as if afraid to say the wrong thing, so discussion sometimes doesn't really got off the ground.One caveat though: Reconsider taking the course if Peggy Noonan is still among the professors in your year. She is a bad teacher, an arbitrary grader, and she is completely inaccessible to the students: no feedback, no answer to e-mails, nothing. I cannot remember having had a worse teaching experience than by Peggy Noonan.",
    "Yes, this is a great course--it's good to have a good background in history and politics before the course because this really takes the basics to quite another level. That said, you manage to cover a lot in one semester.",
    "I would certainly recommend this class.",
    "I would describe the seminar as a weekly treat - an afternoon of great works, compelling analysis, and statecrafting adrenaline. GS overall offers another level to your Yale experience. The workshops, dinners, and panel-like discussions are Yale moments like no others. I would definitely recommend GS to another student.",
    "yes",
    "Grand Strategy is an amazing class for anyone looking to pursue a career in foreign service, military, politics etc. If not, GS is still an amazing class experience.",
    "GS is a great course to take to get an understanding of how to deal with any issue\/manage any problem. It really makes you think critically about how decisions are made at the top level under pressure and with little to no information.",
    "Grand strategy is a course designed to equip you with tools for looking at once broadly and narrowly at situations. It provides experience in cross-comparison of historical events, with the understanding that this practice can be applied to current situations.I would recommend it for any student who wants to work hard, who wishes to read an amazing list of books, and who wants a better understanding of how the world is interconnected in order to apply that understanding to their future work."

   "question_text": "How did this course deepen your knowledge of your discipline\/profession? To what extent did this course contribute to your dissertation\/research?",
   "comments": [
    "This course allowed me to gain a broaden philosophical grasp of the world. Now, I am more comfortable extracting theory from texts and applying them to my life.",
    "I may have stumbled across my senior thesis topic, so that's awesome! In general this course is everything I love about the Humanities and I've enjoyed immersing myself in my discipline over the course of this term with GS.",
    "This course has definitely deepened my knowledge of and interest in\/curiosity about the Humanities (my major) and its relevance to statecraft, history, and the way the world works (or doesn't work).",
    "I am still discerning my own profession moving forward, but in terms of my discipline at Yale (religion), I found the course helpful. It did not directly address religion's role in the world except tangentially, or at a cursory level, but the course was still amazingly helpful. I took the class to gain experience in cross-discipline application of information, to learn about historical situations and how strategies were created and implemented, and to deepen my understanding of how to approach different situations I will face. The course provided all three.In terms of research, I will be spending the summer doing research on strategy in the developing world around energy issues. The research will be part of this class, and so I feel the course contributed a great deal in preparing me for the summer and giving me financial support for my research."
