   "comments": [
    "I do recommend this course. This course is really good, but because the lecture is purely a lecture, sometimes it is hard to keep focused. Despite this, Professor Kalyvas is brilliant, knows his stuff, and provides anecdotes that make the analytical lectures very interesting. The weekly memos can be a lot of work, but the mid-term and final paper are manageable - if you work hard on the memos the final paper won't be too bad.",
    "Do not take. The syllabus appears easy but its a drag. Weekly memos are easy but a waste especially if you have a TA that does not appreciate or understand your ideas. Professor Kalyvas is intelligent but not a good lecturer as there was too much material to cover and relatively little time to dwell and understand major concepts of the class. Learn about civil wars on your own time and do not waste a semester at Yale taking this class. The midterm is graded relatively hard. Few people dominate discussion - yet 30% of your grade is participation which makes no sense as to how Professor Kalyvas allocates this given that it is a lecture course full of people where only few talk. And the final requires time and work - DO NOT TAKE.",
    "no, not really. it ended being dull and open ended",
    "I would recommend this class only if professor kalyvas is teaching it",
    "If you're looking for an interesting class at Yale, this is it. It's fun (you study a civil war of your choice for the semester), it's new, and you learn a lot.",
    "Take this class if you are interested but be warned it is a lot of work.",
    "I wouldn't take this class unless you are really self-motivated in doing independent research that doesn't matter until the final paper, interested in the political science aspects of civil war and civil war history.",
    "NA",
    "Yes this class is very interesting.",
    "Good course, interesting, but hard to do well. Requires a decent amount of work each week for the weekly memo, and he likes to call people out in class- so be aware.",
    "Definitely take this class... I didn't even go to the lectures and just put the class on my schedule on the last day of Reading Period--and I never regretted it. The workload is very reasonable, with only one required reading, which is very interesting about the War in the Congo. By the end of the class, I've become an expert on one civil war, but at the same time, I know all the general theories of civil wars and a little about many well-known civil wars as well--the class was great in terms of depth and breadth.",
    "Solid class. Lectures were really valuable and expanded my ability to conceptualize and analyze conflict in a serious and thought-provoking manner. Take it if you're interested in civil war and violence. In my opinion, the weekly memos get really redundant after a while.",
    "It's an interesting course. It is a lot of work, but as the semester goes one, the weekly memos doesn't seem too bad. If the subject interests you, there is no reason not to take it. It is well-presented and the course is well-organized.",
    "Yeah, it's a really interesting and well-structured class if you're interested in the topic. I really liked how we all had an individual case to study throughout the semester. Though I don't think you need to buy the Prunier book, because we totally didn't use it.",
    "Really interesting material and Kalyvas is an allstar. Pick a case you're interested in and can really dive into, because it is only your passion for the material that will determine how much you get out of the class.",
    "Yes. It's a great and up-to-date overview of the study of civil war. Using our own case is also what makes the class particularly accessible.",
    "This is a great class that allows you to analyze one particular civil war in-depth. The weekly memos require you to use examples from your case to prove or disprove the theories you learn about in class. Know that these memos require a significant amount of time if you want to do well on them. I personally lost my Sundays to writing the memos. The lectures are generally good, although be aware that the teacher won't give out lecture notes, so you'll have to rely on someone else in the class if you miss a lecture. If you are interested in learning about civil war, which is becoming more and more prevalent among wars, then you should definitely take this class",
    "No, it is A LOT of work, memos every week (basically 4 page paper per week) and bad TAs. The professor also isn't the friendliest.",
    "Violence and Civil Strife is the Platonic form of a poli sci course. It's also easily the best class I've taken at Yale. The material is absolutely fascinating (why do neighbors inform on each other? Why does the Taliban succeed? Will we win in Afghanistan?), the workload is perfect, and the Professor is top-notch.Keep in mind that Yale is one of the best places in the world to study Civil War, so it has attraccted top talent. If you don't take this course, you'll be missing out on one of the greatest opportunities Yale can give you.A few words more, if you're still in doubt: the homeworks are organized to allow for variation in the amount of work you need to put in, so if you have a busy week, you can scrap by without devoting much time to the course. The first few lectures during shopping period are not representative of the absolute awesomeness that is the rest of the course. The lecture slides are not posted online, so you need to come to lecture, but you'll be thankful for this afterward.Overall, I HIGHLY recommend this course.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class unless you're not interested in civil wars. You have to be willing to really study your case and be able to answer questions about it as Professor Kalyvas likes to discuss theory and then ask students about how it applies to their case. I loved this class, but I would say that you have to be committed to it to really enjoy it.",
    "I would not recommend this class unless Professor Kalyvas changed it to a different format. As it stands, the class is a weird combination of lecture\/seminar. However, the material is great and I like the idea of choosing one case study to concentrate on for the entire semester (ex. I studied the Bosnian War). I came away knowing a ton about the mechanics of modern-day civil wars, and now I won't feel uncomfortable when people want to talk international politics at the dinner table.",
    "Yes but its definitely not an easy class. The memos every week take a lot of time and research, the midterm is tough, and the final report is also challenging.",
    "I would not recommend INTS 324 to another student. The grading is arbitrary, the structure is silly, and the reading can be very dense and difficult.",
    "Yes, definitely.",
    "Good class, pretty interesting especially if you care about your conflict. Very theoretical although you do get to apply it to your case study. Weekly memos, midterm exam, takehome final -- pretty manageable. I recommend.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to anyone who is interested in civil wars and\/or human rights. Although, this class is a lot of reading and writing since you get to study a particular civil war, it is very rewarding in that you learn so much when you come out of it that you can apply if you are working in the international relations or human rights fields.",
    "Yes, as long as Prof. Kalyas is teaching it.",
    "I recommend this class; it can be demanding, but in a good way. It helped me become a better researcher and writer. It helped me learn how to conceptualize; I ended up explaining a lot of things concisely and learned about wars in countries I knew nothing about.",
    "Highly recommended. Kalyvas is a great lecturer with a pretty amazing breadth of knowledge. He'll lecture about the big trends and social science research of civil wars, and then you'll spend the whole semester doing an in-depth \"case study\" of one civil war. The approach works really well - you get a good macro-picture of what the literature says while at the same time learning one conflict in pretty good depth. Just pick a good one early - you have to spend a whole semester on it, so you should definitely be interested in it.",
    "This is NOT an easy gut class. It looks like there's not a lot of work but to get good grades you have to put in a lot of time. BUT if you are interested in the subject you HAVE to take it. Kalyvas is the only one to learn this material from.",
    "take this! it's very straightforward, and the material is very interesting. you're presented with theories in class, and then you apply them to the civil war that you're assigned at the beginning of the semester in weekly memos. you can write the memos very quickly, so don't be intimidated. you really get out what you put into the class. if you pay attention, you'll do well.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. This was one of the courses I've enjoyed the most. The workload is very reasonable and the curriculum is engaging. The lectures focus on theory, and each student has their own case that they simultaneously research in the context of that theory.",
    "Worth taking it: A valuable class that requires a lot of independent research and does make you think on your own.",
    "Take the class, yes, but if it's not seminar style, then beware.The class was advertised as a proposed 30-person seminarish class that had a 30% participation component. What wound up happening is that nobody was cut from the class, and we were so large that we had to move to a lecture hall in WLH. This really cut down on the class conversation we could have, and I was somewhat disappointed because I felt like I could have gotten so much more out of the class had it just been smaller. In any case, Professor Kalyvas is fantastic and beyond intelligent; he's a pretty good lecturer, so you'll want to attend classes (this is good, because you will have to - there is pretty much no assigned reading, so all of the information that will appear in the midterms is from lectures! Very important!). The weekly memos are kind of annoying, but you'll be glad for them by the end of the semester.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to anyone even mildly interested in the subject matter, psychology, war, politics, womens' studies, sociology, research in general, history, area studies and many other fields.",
    "One of the best political science classes at Yale. The professor is a very charismatic and engaging lecturer and an authority in the subject of the course, so you will get out of this course knowing a lot not only about thetheory of civil wars, but also about comparative political science. Also, each student works on a civil war case study throughout the semester, writing weekly memos on how the aspects and theories examined in the past week apply to his\/her case study. It allows you to go into great depth researching your case study and it will be very fulfilling at the end as you will have mastered one war case, but it is a lot of research and writing if you want to do a very good job.",
    "Care to learn everything about the framework of civil wars? This class is for you.There is a lot of intuitive stuff in here, but the layout of the class allows you to see the entire progression of what happens during a given civil war. Sometimes, the style of class gets repetitive and boring (slides, slides, slides, ...) but the teacher is funny and engaging. Kind of a baller, really.Watch out, because it is near impossible to participate in the class because there are so many people (~50), but your grade is 30% class participation. I realized this too late. Unfortunately, not everyone realized this as late as I did, and there were a solid, reliable few students who incessantly gave their unwanted opinions to the whole class.You will have to choose your own case study, and every week you write a memo relating your case study to the material seen in class. It is really annoying to constantly find reading material on your case study, and near impossible to read new books every week. The memo is not hard to write, but it's rather grating.",
    "I would highly recommend this course, as it is unlike any lecture or seminar I have taken - I thought the format was really neat, and it allowed me to engage in detail with a case study I really wanted to learn about. The details of violence itself are horrifying, and in studying it like a disease, it is easy to discuss patterns across cases with emotional remove. I would caution students taking the course to figure out how much time they want to dedicate to it and to choose a case study that truly interests them. Although I'd rate the course as a lighter workload than others I have taken at Yale, it required a lot of engagement and thought."
