    "Classes with Susan Clark are an interesting material because they are so unlike anything else you will probably take at Yale. What's expected of you and what you should be doing are never clear. There is no set plan for the semester and each class is incredibly flexible based on what comes up in discussion and what Susan feels like doing that day. However, the material itself is interesting and it will open you up to a new way of thinking you may not be exposed to in other classes. You learn some concrete information about Yellowstone, but this class is much more broadly about policy sciences in resource management more generally in the US. If you can go on the field trip, you absolutely should. Sometimes this class can be frustrating, but people are generally invested and interested and so discussions and presentations can be very good. Take it if you're interested in policy and resource management. Be prepared for a totally new experience that is sometimes frustrating but eventually interesting and eye opening. Plus, the work load is very light and the paper is very open ended.",
    "Think carefully about taking it. Some classes and guest lectures were interesting, but you need to be okay with ZERO class direction and no clarity on assignments. Also may be able to go to Yellowstone. I definitely thought I'd learn a lot more than I did, and a lot more specifics on natural resource management. I came away with a couple of good points, but not at all what I was expecting.",
    "This class is more about problem-solving and what Susan calls \"the social process\" than anything else. A really interesting introduction to the theory behind environmental policy and management of resources in protected lands. Also, we went on a freaking FIELD TRIP to Yellowstone over spring break, paid for by Yale. It was incredible. I highly recommend this course if you are interested in learning more about the culture and political climate of the West, wildlife management, or problem-solving in national parks. Susan has a very theoretical, big-picture approach to looking at how problems are dealt with in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem. It's a bit confusing at times, and most of the lectures were just Susan asking rhetorical questions and rambling, but I still think I got a lot out of it. Course work: readings, atlas presentation, 600 word op ed, 15 page paper.",
    "I would recommend this class if you plan to go on the field trip over Spring Break. If not, I don't think it is worth it because the field trip made everything in class come to life and had I not had the field trip experience, I would have thought the class was pretty uninteresting. If you are interested in the issues surrounding Yellowstone and\/or the National Park Service in general, it gives you a really interesting perspective on these issues. There are a lot of problems that I had never thought about before or realized were a problem, but this class was very enlightening in this regard. There were interesting guest lectures but the general discussion was not necessarily super interesting very often.",
    "This class was a hot mess. It was changed from a seminar to a lecture at the beginning of the semester, which meant the professor completely threw out the syllabus. Nobody--including the professor and TA, I suspect--had any idea what would happen in class until a couple of days before. We were often told that there would be an assignment, reading, or discussion that was later dismissed or disregarded. Class usually amounted to an interesting guest presentation or a painfully languid \"discussion\" that was basically our professor asking the same questions without suggesting many answers. Not worth it.",
    "EVST 348 is highly recommended if you are interested in environmental studies or ecology. I think the material can be dry for a lay person. However, it is a great topic to know about and a great class to take if you feel stuck in the Yale bubble mindset.",
    "Yellowstone is a very interesting course. It is definitely unique. It really gets you to think critically about a wealth of issues and it's certainly a chill and thought-provoking class that provides you with many lessons that can change the way you look at the world. However, it was the most disorganized class i've every taken. You had no idea about what was expected of you or what the deadlines were or even what the assignments were. Susan and Josh were both there to help and every time I talked to them, they were very helpful and supportive, but I had to do so often. This class would seriously benefit from being a smaller class as it was last year. This year, we had like 40 students, whereas last year there were 8. I think there really needs to be a cap at 15 students to make this class the best it could be.",
    "You will get from this course what you put into it. It's a great introduction to the policy sciences framework and a fascinating look at issues in and around Yellowstone. Although disorganized at times, the course is truly worth taking for all interested in environmental policy.",
    "This class needs to be smaller in order for it to truly be a great class. There were too many students in it this year, and it's really meant to be a seminar. Workload is really light until the final paper which required a lot of energy, so you get as much out as you put in like many other Yale classes. If you're interested in land management policy, good class to take. The class needs some fine tuning however, and definitely, has to be smaller.",
    "I think that the theory taught by Professor Clark is essential for any one who wants to pursue and created sustainable, systemic change to create environmental conservation. That being said, the class can be excruciatingly unorganized and the lectures can be rambling and hard to engage with.",
    "It really kind of sucks. But there's not much work."
