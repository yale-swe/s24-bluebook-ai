   "comments": [
    "It's a very unique class, that you won't get anywhere else at Yale. Professor Blackhawk has experience with this material and does a great job identifying how people have interacted with American Indian law.",
    "Great course for learning history of the American Indian that they don't tell you in high school. Great and fascinating materials. Might have to put up with not so great lecture but it's worth it.",
    "Yes, if you're interested in the history of American Indians. It's not so much law and policy as a history of the governments relationship with Indians. In that it is fascinating. Readings are great! Lectures can be a little long and disorganized but if you like the topic it's worth taking.",
    "History 134 is a fascinating look at American Indian History. It engages students in legal issues, policy measures, and a historical narrative that isoften forgotten in the rest of Yale's history department. I would definitely recommend it to any other student who wants to be more knowledgeable about America's (often bloody) past. It is really an eye-opening class!",
    "A very important history to know, a decent course, but not out of this world or incredibly engaging. The readings are very good, lecture is mediocre and section was good.",
    "take it! worth it!",
    "I would recommend this course to another student because I think it gives great insight on American Indian history in the United States and the ways in which the US has interacted with Indians.",
    "Engaging course overallLectures I really looked forward toDiscussion sections I really looked forward toRigorous reading materialYes, highly recommended",
    "American Indian Law addresses a fascinating body of casework, namely the sovereigntyof Indian nations. The course requires you to review a text covered in class in a five-page paper, take a short midterm, and write a ten to twelve-page research paper. However, lectures are scattered and do not match the readings. Shop and decide for yourself.",
    "American Indian Law and Policy is a good class to introduce students to Indian Law, if one really wants to learn. The lectures are a little dry and sometimes stray off topic and in many events, students would skip lecture because they weren't really learning anything and would attend section instead. It is easy to understand the class by doing the course readings and actively participating in section. Bear in mind that the 12-14 page research paper is due at almost the very end of the semester, so don't leave it until the last minute or else you'll be stuck packing AND writing which may affect your grades. I would recommend if you are willing to learn more about American Indian law and its history.",
    "I would recommend this course 100%"
