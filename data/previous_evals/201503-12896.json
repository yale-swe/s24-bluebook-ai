   "comments": [
    "I would not recommend this class unless you are a PSYCH major fulfilling the requirement.",
    "This course is going to make you work. You'll be spending 20+ hours on each paper and revision, no question. It's somewhat daunting at times (especially when you get 60+ comments on your first drafts), but you'll definitely feel more confident in your writing after you complete the course.",
    "A solid class, I definitely learned how to critique psychology research, and how to do my own (especially the writing part). Angie was really supportive and gave A TON of feedback on each paper. The first half of the semester is a little more intense with the daily quizzes (which are really easy if you skim the chapter and\/or read the chapter summary) and the group research project. The second half of the semester is really laid back, and focused on the individual research project. Just try not to leave it all to the last minute, especially if you have a tough finals period\/reading week. This class will help you improve your writing, especially for future psych classes and research papers.",
    "I would recommend this class for someone interested in research writing. You truly will improve your writing skills. But be warned, this class is extremely time consuming. In the end, I feel like it was worth the work.",
    "The obvious strength of the course is that it is good to have a thorough introduction to the parts of a scientific paper and it is a great opportunity to have to chance to complete two reports using that new knowledge. That being said, I disliked everything about the way the course was organized. Everything was too rushed. Obviously it is a psych requirement and therefore inescapable for a group of students, but be sure you have a decent amount of time to devote to the class and reach out to your instructor as much as possible for extra help or your grade will suffer."
