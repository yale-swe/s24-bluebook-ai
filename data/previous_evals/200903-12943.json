   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend this class. Especially in the capacity that it serves as a great survey introduction to ancient philosophy.",
    "This is a tough course but also extremely interesting if one puts in a lot of hard work. Professor Harte is a great section leader who keeps everyone engaged. I would encourage students to visit her office hours in which she is also very helpful.",
    "Philosophy is the best directed studies section first semester.",
    "Great overview of western philosophy. Definitely recommend it.",
    "Directed Studies is an absolute boon to any student who wants a solid dose of the Western Canon (and didn\u0092t already get it in high school). Otherwise, the course offers some serious contact with some seriously amazing professors. Professor Harte will really slam you in the grade department, but you will certainly learn from it. Don\u0092t try to switch out of her section!",
    "DS Philosophy was excellent... I would def. recommend it. The material is challenging but incredibly rewarding. The papers get more and more manageable as the year goes on. Verity Harte is a hard grader. Nonetheless, you will learn a lot especially when it comes to Aristotle.Take DS!!!",
    "You read mostly Plato and Aristotle -- the rest are some lesser known philosophers that you zoom through. I'd recommend it if you enjoy reading ancient philosophy, picking apart small sections and doing philosophical analyses in which you outline the premises that lead to a certain conclusion and try to prove\/disprove the logic of the philosophers (most people have never done this kind of writing before... can be difficult if you're like me and have a more flowery, creative-writing approach!). This class definitely made me dislike DS as a whole, so I don't think I would recommend it.",
    "Philosophy is a challenge for many, though I think DS does a good job in terms of the material. Lectures are a hit-or-miss. What matters most is the section professor, be sure to switch into a good section.",
    "Taking a class with Professor Harte was wonderful. I'd never even picked up any Plato before, and she really gave me a foundation for understanding philosophical arguments. I would highly recommend taking Directed Studies with Verity Harte. The amount of reading is reasonable, the essays are difficult but manageable, and the seminar discussions were always enlightening."
