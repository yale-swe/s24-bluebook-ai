    "Take it. If you're interested enough in sculpture to be looking at an advanced level course, you're probably familiar with the kind of work involved. Of course, without Daphne, the class might be very different. Shop it and see.",
    "Yes. If you feel the need to produce art on your own, this class is a great way to start.",
    "Definitely an advanced sculpture class. I would recommend it to another student if they were self motivated to some extent-sometimes we go a while between critiques.",
    "I would recommend Advanced Sculpture only to students who have advanced skills working with various materials and who already have definite desires and intentions to pursue projects in sculpture.",
    "Yes. Because it rocked.",
    "An interesting way to evaluate your own work. Very self directed."
