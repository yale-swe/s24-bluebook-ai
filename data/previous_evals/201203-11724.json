    "Only take it if u have to. It's manageable but miserable.",
    "Physics lab is better than gen chem lab, worse than orgo lab. At least you get to sit down! It won't really enhance your knowledge of physics or help you in the lecture. The final is horrible. Try to take it with a friend so that you can have fun working with your lab partners and so that it will be easy to meet up to talk about the reports if you have questions.",
    "If you are considering taking this course, it is probably because you have to take it anyways. Not bad for a lab course, but tedious at times, TA grading can depend on your TA, and lab practical at the end isn't bad, so overall an average course. Only weekly work was a one page summary of what you did, which wasn't too bad of a workload at all.",
    "Relates to the course and attempts to teach students to perform physics experiments. Presents many interesting, different types of apparatus. Grading requirements were unclear and could be better.",
    "Take this if it is required",
    "I found physics 165L to be an easy class in which we were allowed to play around with different equipment while learning various principles about physics. I would recommend this class to another student, as it is not a terribly large amount of work and suffices a lab credit while remaining somewhat fun.",
    "This lab course is fine on a weekly basis. It's not great. It's not terrible. However, I did put in a TON of time each week into writing up the reports in the lab notebook and completing the one page report at the end of each lab. It's really clear thatthe professors have tried to make this class somewhat interesting. This has been moderately successful, but by no stretch is this lab enjoyable.By far, the absolute WORST part of this lab is the practical exam. The practical is TERRIBLE. I can't believe that this is how professors try to test our knowledge of physics lab. It's honestly the worst indication of my physics lab capabilities.",
    "Your standard introductory physics lab that deals with the classical Newtonian experiments. The lab reports varied in difficulty based on TA and the final practical was a little stressful but still fairly doable.",
    "if you have to take it, then take it.",
    "Yes",
    "I would recommend this course for anyone wanting to take an introductory physics laboratory. Though I'm sure higher level courses are more intensive if you are a physics major, this was the perfect course for me to take as a pre-med. Many of the demonstrations even elucidated the physics behind medical techniques. The workload was just right; you only have to type up a one-page response in addition to your lab notes. The lab reports took me roughly 3-4 hours each week, including the time it took me to write up my notes (since I rarely took the final version in class because then they would be terribly messy). Lab quizzes are easy. The final was definitely very challenging, but I think the entire class felt so.",
    "You're probably considering taking this because you're premed. If this is not the case, don't take this lab. It's boring, and you don't get graded on your ability to do physics in the lab or understand it. Rather, you're graded on your ability to remember to label every minute detail in your reports exactly like the instructor wants.",
    "I would recommend it to someone who needed to take it for pre-med, otherwise I would not recommend it.",
    "I mean if you have to take it, then take it. Not too bad.",
    "It's a good supplement to the physics lecture class, and helps with conceptual understanding.",
    "no, if you dont have to take it but its ok for a premed course. The write up are not bad",
    "Physics 165L was a great experience for me. The TA's are great about giving demonstrations and showing the related math to compliment the concepts. I recommend 165L for anyone that needs to take a lab and wants to learn something while their doing it.",
    "not really - too much time and grading it too harsh",
    "Yes if you have to take physics lab",
    "Great course, experiments are instructive. TAs are helpful, choose wisely though I must say. Also, the Final is very very long. Be warned.",
    "Not bad - not very time-consuming on a weekly basis, got out early about half the time and the professors are eager to improve the course, so it should get better and better. Each lab report is 1 page and takes about 1-2 hours. The tricky part is the lab practical, which involves performing 3 short labs (1 hr each) that are different but related to what we did in the course. It wasn't easy, but it wasn't as bad as I thought and the course is curved. The material was interesting most of the time, except we'd often get bogged down in trying to figure out what the instructions in the handouts meant, what kind of calculations we needed to do and how to propagate error. Overall not a bad lab experience, but (if you're premed) not as fun or straightforward as orgo lab with DiMeglio.",
    "I would definitely take the class with Phys 180 as the lab helped clarify concepts in the class",
    "Same as every other review. Definitely less work that General Chem lab, but not a total gut. Lab reports are only a page long and the lab itself generally let out before the 3 hours were up.",
    "Yes, actually. It's a light workload and easy concepts but it does convey some interesting and important stuff. They try to make it as bearable for pre-meds as possible, which is nice (ie they show how things are applied) but perhaps annoying for others.",
    "Don't be wary of it. Sign up right away, because it filled up quickly this semester. The professors really try to make it as relaxed and fun as possible for a pre-med\/other majors and pre-professional programs requirement. The lab will take the whole three hours, but it doesn't go over either; it's well designed to take the exact amount of time. The lab reports are one page and take just a few hours to write; it's as fair of a half credit lab as Yale offers. You probably have to take it if you're reading this, but don't dread it. It's nothing like gen chem timewise.",
    "Physics lab was often frustrating with arbitrary points for \"insight\" on lab reports that were often shot-in-the-dark attempts. However, the concepts weren't difficult.",
    "Yes, if you need it for a requirement.",
    "Pretty good as labs go. Not too much work, experiments are kind of fun, nice not to have to wear a lab coat. I was worried about the final practical but it was not too bad and also bordering on enjoyable.",
    "It's great because they try to make it more reasonable work wise. The reports are only 1 page, and that really forces you to understand the material to be able to summarize the lab in so few words. Not nearly as awful as other gen. labs. The demos are fun, and the instructor is a really nice guy who loves his subject.",
    "DO NOT TAKE IT UNLESS YOU NEED IT. Although you are probably taking it because you need it. I've never met anyone in their right mind who has taken this course for fun.",
    "The labs are long and you have to work on your notebook at home, but the one-page report is a godsend. Physics is so cool! If you're a premed, you need it, so why not enjoy it? The TFs and lab managers are super-helpful.",
    "This lab class seems to be at the same level of understanding and difficulty as the PHYS 170 lecture, which I'm currently taking. I would definitely recommend this course to any student in PHYS 170 who needs to take a physics lab.",
    "Yes. Manageable, intersting lab.",
    "Physics 165 is a pretty standard lab course. The lab reports are not too bad, but the lab procedure itself usually takes a while and can be unclear at times.",
    "It's ok. Some of the labs are seemingly useless, but not too painful. Also short - the lab is a maximum of three hours long. Take good notes during lab, and then a one page lab writeup is due the next week.",
    "Your experience in this course depends heavily on your TA. In my section, we spent many, many hours working on the reports. It was a tedious, stressful experience.",
    "No. Although if you're taking this class you probably have to for pre-med or a major, so I guess you don't have a choice.",
    "Frustrating. Some of the labs were actually quite useful in understanding class concepts a la rotational motion. However, the emphasis on uncertainty was really annoying. You need to always include units and uncertainty, they WILL take off points for it. Overall, it's not bad, just frustrating that I have to do this to be a doctor. The worst lab was the uncertainty one towards the beginning where we FLIPPED COINS FOR 2 HOURS.",
    "Absolutely not recommended, but you have no choice, right?",
    "This lab course isn't too much work. Read the lab handouts prior to each lab and learn from the errors you make on each lab report so you don't make them again on the next one.",
    "Chances are, if you're taking this class, it's because it's a requirement either for your major or because you're pre-med (although my lab partner, incidentally, was taking the class for the sake of taking it).I appreciated how the instructors would connect the basic physics experiments that we did in lab to medically-relevant topics. They were sensitive to the fact that many pre-meds take this class because it's a requirement. The beginning labs are necessarily dry - measuring gravity, error propagation - but they become more interesting throughout the semester.Do not worry about the quizzes (usually four multiple-choice questions), which are sometimes given before lab. As long as you read the handout (or have prior physics knowledge), you will get a full score. They are not meant to trip you up.The lab reports are limited to one page. That being said, I had a lot of friends who spent an inordinate amount of time the night\/morning before a lab report was due working on lab notes that they could have finished during the actual lab. Don't just speed through the experiment. Take the time to actually understand the questions being asked in the lab handout. It will save you much grief in the end.It is possible to just follow instructions without understanding the concepts; however, as I saw from some fellow lab-mates, this would make the final practical very difficult. It consists of three mini-experiments, each an hour long, during which you collect data and draw a simple conclusion. A lot of people complained about the time pressure for the final but I personally felt that if you took three minutes at the beginning of each to actually skim everything and think about what exactly the aim of the experiment is, you can proceed through data collection and analysis very quickly.",
    "Honestly, physics lab is a pretty cool class. It makes you understand the physics material a lot better. They recently re-did the lab, and they truthfully did a great job. The work is straightforward and you do it all within 3 hours once a week. Then you go home and resummarize everything you've done with data, conclusions, and error in under a typed page. This takes about 35 minutes a week. Not too much work, the way a lab should be, but where you still learn great lab skills and physics concepts. I liked it.James was my TA. He was flawless. Truly helpful. Would walk around all during Lab and help you with anything. The head TA was Rona and she was honestly also flawless. The TAs are very very smart and were able to explain anything in ways that made sense (James and Rona at least).Read your comments on lab reports because I realized later on that I kept losing points for the same thing over and over again.Read labs beforehand! There will be about 5 surprise quizzes, and they are usually straightforward on topicsand equations from the lab manual.",
    "Short 1 pg lab write-ups and manageable quizzes, but error calculations can be tedious. Experiments were generally pretty interesting and demos have lots of real world applicability.",
    "Don't take this course if it isn't a prereq for something. The experiments are pretty simple and not a course you would take to learn things for fun.",
    "If you're taking this, it's probably because you have to. Overall, it is not that bad; improvements to the course in recent years have made it easier. There aren't any lab reports, only one-page summaries each week, and the occasional quiz. The labs themselves are not that difficult either, and the practical isn't too challenging if you've kept up and understand the physics behind what you are doing.",
    "Classic lab class. Expect normal physics labs",
    "Do it only if you have to. Physics lab is not particularly enjoyable, but it does reinforce some knowledge learned in the PHYS 180.",
    "This is a terrible course.",
    "Only take physics 165L if it is required. Otherwise you may be stupified as I was by the ratio of the level of work required to the amount of new material learned. Granted, this lab doesn't require too much work, but the work generally requires little thought and is not that instructive. I decided to take this lab rather than 205 because I only need the lab for medical school (my lecture course was 200), but in retrospect that may have been a mistake, for I feel I would have learned much more in the more advanced lab.",
    "If you're going to take a physics lab because you're interested in it, I think 205 might be a better choice. But if you're taking lab because you have to (pre-meds), then this is a good option. You explore a lot of physics concepts and it's really not hard.",
    "This lab isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t fun. I dreaded it every week. The one-page lab reports essentially made you jam way too much information into a small space and forces you to leave out important information that you wish you could include. But I suppose if you have to take a physics lab, at least this one allows you to keep your lab notebooks after finishing an experiment, so in case you weren't able to finish writing something down neatly in your notebook, you could just take scratch notes and fill everything in later.",
    "This was a great class- I really liked learning how to use the different measurement tools, including LoggerPro. The lab reports were sometimes a bit thorny, but once I picked my way through the reports I felt like I knew more\/understood better. The lab is focused on understanding concepts and measurement concepts versus mindless data collection for the sake of writing a report. The lab professors\/my TA really seemed invested in the lab and in students' understanding. I wish I had taken this class alongside my physics class, since it really helped me understand some concepts that I had had trouble with in the lecture course. The lab practical final was not as impossible as some people make it out to be- if you get the 'difficult' question first, just be sure to keep your head, do your best, and be mentally prepared to do your best on the next ones. I would take this class again, overall.",
    "This class was a thoroughly banal experience, one that will remind you of your high school days of busywork. If you are remotely interested in learning physics rather than simply churning out reports with variations on the theme of \"this is why our data was off\", take 205 instead.",
    "As far as labs go, it's okay.",
    "Physics 165L is the best way to learn about physics lab techniques if you haven't had background before. You need to be willing to put in time into the lab reports. They may only be a page but you should spend time really understanding all the techniques you used because the final practical not only tests those skills but challenges you by using a completely different setup. Make sure that you're not just letting your lab partner do everything or you'll end up in trouble on the lab final.",
    "No. If you're considering this course, you probably don't have a choice though.",
    "I would not recommend taking it if given the choice.",
    "The experiments are helpful for reinforcing material covered in lecture. The lab report summaries are only a single page plus the lab notebook and graphs, but the expectations for these reports are really unclear at first.",
    "If you need to take lab, then take it. Even if you need to, the out of class work is pretty minimal and the labs are pretty straightforward",
    "Phys 165L is really a worthwhile investment of your time if you need some help with the concepts taught in lecture. Also, the reports are reasonable and feasible, and help for them is easy to find. The instructors and TAs were great and I really don't think this is a class to avoid. The experiments were fine, often pretty interesting, and they make an effort to do cool demonstrations. The only downside was the final which was pretty tough and not quite in tune with the way we did things during the semester.",
    "If you are premed, this is a great lab course for you.",
    "PHYS165 is a challenging introductory lab course that will require time and dedication if you want to perform well. It is important to ask questions whenever in doubt or confused about a procedure and assignment, and to cope with the initial frustration that might arise when you are still getting used to the course and its demands. However, the more you put into it, the more you will take out of it!",
    "It is what it is. Not too painful, very well organized. Just a one-page write up for each lab, and you usually end a little early. It kind of helps you see the laws of physics in real life.",
    "Painful experience, wonderful TA (James). Get a good lab partner and suffer through it together.",
    "I would recommend this lab to anyone needing to fulfill a Physics Lab requirement for whatever reason.",
    "Straightforward physics lab. Learn a lot, but it is correlated to the lecture. The practical was the hardest part of the course.",
    "An evil necessity. You just have to take it if you are pre-med or a science major, but a word of advice: shop the sections. Some TAs are better than others, and I'm not taking about being easier graders because in the end that doesn't matter (they have a system). Find the TAs that care, the ones that are genuine and friendly. They can make\/break your experience because GOD knows the instructor, DICK Casten, will be there anyway and you cannot get anything from these lab professors. Good luck.",
    "Stay away. If you have to take it, I am so sorry. They ask you for a one page lab report and expect the content of a 10 page. They literally said: you guys are doing great, so we are going to make a harsher standard of grading.The lab manuals are not written coherently and were very confusing. They want you to 'figure out' how to do the lab with as little information as possible but what actually ends up happening is us calling the TA every five minutes for help. The final was insane- the manual wording was confusing and the fact you had to figure out 3 experiment each within an hour was really rough. As someone with no physics background or lab experience from high school, I worked so hard for this lab and still fell really short.All this for only 0.5 credit.",
    "If you need a physics lab for your major or for your pre-med requirements, this is not a bad class to take. The experiments can sometimes be challenging and very long, but it's the type of lab where the amount of effort you put in during lab will make the lab reports easier to understand.",
    "Your standard physics lab course. It's not too bad, and will probably be more interesting\/enjoyable than you think. One page lab reports are fair , and the experiments don't take terribly long.",
    "As someone who already dislikes physics, this was a very boring boring lab. If you're looking for something to engage you into the world of physics, don't take this lab. If you're looking to get a lab requirement out of the way, this is probably the easiest way out.",
    "Manageable lab, especially if you are premed",
    "It was fine for the most part. They try to reduce the stress level as much as possible but you will be taking it with mostly premeds or engineering majors so there isn't much they can do about that. Lab was fine and usually interesting.",
    "This is a good lab, take it if you have to. The reports aren't too bad.",
    "165 is definitely geared towards premeds. Expect your lab mates to be as so. One-page write ups had to include specifics to appease your TA's mysterious grading rubric, and if you figure it out early on, you're set.",
    "This is a good lab. The lab reports are only a page long and there is a greater focus on learning the material than on doing unnecessary work.",
    "This class is an introductory lab that incorporates topics from physics lecture. A lot of the lab is calculating error, which can get tedious. This lab isn't the best, but the good news is that the professors are trying to make improvements, so it should get better in the next couple years. If you're taking it, you most likely have to fulfill pre-med requirements, so you don't have much of a choice anyways.",
    "Definitely do not take, really hard and competitive and not fun.",
    "Needs more structure, otherwise students struggle to play catch-up on including the right material and calculations in their lab notes and reports. Hopefully the labs will be more structured in the future- from standardized lectures across TAs, to samples or rubrics for proper lab notes and reports, to grading overall.",
    "You're taking itprobably because you have to, right? It's not fantastic but not terrible either. Find a good partner who's down to do lab reports together and you'll have a good semester. The lab practical is the most challenging aspects... for my year, at least, it was a bit different that what we had done during the semester. Also, the course depends on the TA you get. Take Ge Yuan. Best guy ever.",
    "Take it if you have to, but definitely the most tedious pre-med lab. The lab reports are sweet and short.",
    "YES.",
    "The reports are short but doing the labs can be stressful. Just work diligently and you'll be fine.",
    "You have to take this if you are pre-med. Try to get a good TA, though I think grades are all curved at the end. Make sure you actually understand the labs as you are doing them. Otherwise, you can go through and do well on the lab reports but then flub the practical, which will really mess up your grade. Once you acknowledge that you will be there for the whole three hours, it becomes easier to actually pay attention and try to learn concepts rather than rushing through just to get the data down on paper. As far as pre-med labs go, I thought this was way better than organic, and probably on par or a little worse than gen chem. Probably will correlate with how you feel about the courses\/subjects themselves.",
    "Physics 165 is what you should take if you are pre-med and need a physics lab that is not too advanced.",
    "Take it if you have to. I took it because I needed to for my pre-med requirements, but the course was not all that much fun. The labs each week often seemed like a waste of time. The one page lab reports prevent students from writing absurdly long reports for simple experiments, but the one page limit often became a burden when trying to include enough information to receive a decent grade. Grading was sort of annoying since there were \"insight\" points that were nebulous and difficult to earn. When I asked me TA about them, he said that you would get all the insight points if you mentioned something he had never thought about before with this lab, which to me, seemed potentially impossible and more than a little unreasonable. Overall, this lab was fine. You ultimately figure out the system and just get in, get the lab done, and follow a formula for your report. Totally doable and probably the best option for pre-med students looking to fulfill their pre-med requirements. Just be prepared to be frustrated with the lab at various points in the semester.",
    "This is an introduction, not just to physical concepts and their real-life applications, but also to experiment designand data analysis. I would certainly recommend this as a lab, and, if you are pre-med, this is an incredibly refreshing course after Gen Chem and Orgo labs!",
    "I would recommend this course if you need it for credit or if you are truly interested in physics mechanics. The equipment we used was fun to work with and the course was well structured.",
    "I would not recommend this class to anyone, but if you are looking at this class you are probably a pre med who has to take it. Ultimately it is not a hard class. Write ups took me only one night on the night before the lab. And the quizes are extremely easy if you skim the instructions and have a basic knowledge of physics. Hope you get an easy TA because some TA's are definitely stricter than others.",
    "Not too much work - 3 hour labs plus an extra 1-2 hours outside of class to finish up calculations and write up the 1 page lab report. My main critique is that there aren't really clear guidelines for the lab reports so I often got points deducted for vague reasons. The labs themselves are bearable - my TA was obviously not thrilled to be there, but then again neither were we. But overall I thought it was a decent lab course that wasn't my favorite but also didn't cause too much stress.",
    "Take it if you have to, I suppose.",
    "You probably have to take this. It's physics lab, it sucks, it's not too much work as lab reports are short and labs themselves are not difficult, but it's a painful three hours every week. Looking at things moving, surrounded by premeds. Pretty helpful for internalizing different physics concepts, though. Definitely helped me learn angular momentum.",
    "This was probably the worst class I have ever taken at Yale. The learning to work ratio was way off. I ended up taking some physics out of the class and some lab skills, but this was not worth the hours and hours and hours spent on the lab reports. Some of the labs were just too long, and they expect you to write up so much. Take it ONLY if you need to.",
    "A reasonable lab, with one page write-ups that are pretty quick each week. Plus most labs took around 2 hours (some less!).",
    "Its an okay lab course. Not as much write up as other labssuch as Gen Chem, Orgo, Bio etc. The final is not too bad if you prepare well for it.",
    "A necessary, boring, but not overall terrible class.",
    "Only take this course if you have to. Honestly, it is a complete waste of time, especially for getting absolutely nothing out of the course. The TA was unhelpful, Professor Casten spent three hours stomping around and ignoring the students, and the lab set-ups were antiquated and better explained on YouTube or KahnAcademy.",
    "Rather tedious and boring labs, but I could see how the things we did were related to the physics concepts learned so it can't really be helped. The workload is not bad though and the practical is a good experience to go through if you haven't had one before.",
    "Only if you have to take it. Ties in well with PHYS 170. However TA grading fluctuates wildly and you're very much worse off with a 'harsh' TA.",
    "You probably have to take it, so whatever. Not my favorite lab. Writeups aren't awful, but the three hour time slot for lab can feel pretty miserable. Can't even count the number of times I felt like banging my head against the table: when our TA couldn't answer questions or gave awful explanations, when the lab procedure was just ridiculously unclear, when we had to do enormous and absurd error calculations. Practical wasn't too bad, and overall I did fine in the class, although the grading seemed pretty random at times. Wish so badly that two semesters of lab were not required.",
    "My physics lab experience is unlike most. I had a bad partner, an awful TF, and I am generally just not very good at lab. I cannot stress how important it is to choose your partner well, he\/she will make physics lab a good experience, or an intolerable one. Furthermore, pick your TF well. If you see signs that you may not get along well with him\/her, approach the lab manager and let them know ASAP so that you do not suffer in the long run. It sucks that premeds have to take it, but that's how it is. Though, to be fair, it really helped me think as a scientist, and physics lab taught me how to take good lab notes, a skill that I had never really learned prior to physics lab.",
    "This lab made me miss orgo lab, which is not a thought that should have ever entered my mind. The experiments were less interesting and the course was way more disorganized. But if you're looking at this it's probably because you have to take the class. It's not horrible, just annoying. The lab reports are fairly short at least.",
    "Very fair and reasonable lab. If you put in the required time and effort (which isn't much), you'll get a fine grade. I recommend it if you need a physics lab credit",
    "It's not too bad in terms of the workload, but try to stay on the same page as your TA because you may be surprised by the final grade. Its a good lab though.",
    "Lab once a week, a one page report due each week, several pop quizzes, and one final lab examination. Even though the one-page reports seem short, they take longer than you'd think. The lab manuals often contain obscure, offhand questions that are easy to miss, and if you don't answer them in your lab notebook then you'll lose points. As part of your report grade there's something called \"insight points\" that are very obscure, and are basically awarded for whatever the TAs decide is creative\/insightful as it relates to the lab's concepts.",
    "Take if needed as a requirement. Seems like little work, but lab reports still require effort to include everything expected.",
    "Pretty good conceptual introduction to physics laboratory, and I really liked that they were conscious of not trying to take up all of our time with a 0.5 credit course by making it just a one-page write-up after each lab. I was disappointed in the way the final grade was evaluated, though, in that we had to create our own experiments, which was something that we'd never had to do as yet in the course and hadn't really been adequately prepared for, I didn't think. We had all of the conceptual basis to know about concepts that we'd covered, yes, and to use the experimental set-ups that we'd had, yes, but I don't think ever before in the class were we asked to create our own experiment (maybe once, the week before) and the fact that creating our own experiments became such a huge part of our final grade was a bit disappointing because of that fact.",
    "It's a decent physics lab. The reports are short, but, depending on your TA, grading can be picky. It tends to not take too long to complete either the labs or the assignments.",
    "It's not a huge workload, and you will learn how to apply the very basics of physics in a lab setting. If you're premed or have a lot of other things on your plate, this is a great way to take care of that requirement without killing yourself.",
    "Pretty typical lab. You probably have to take this, but it's not too bad. Depends on your TA, but check what they want for the report. The reports are 1 page write ups, not a huge deal. However, there are NOT clear instructions for what the reports should include. The lab is much more fluid and less specific than orgo lab, for example. Spontaneous quizzes that are super easy. You spend most of your time making graphs and manipulating data rather than actually doing anything. Avg time for lab was about 2.5 hours. The topics match up decently with 170. The practical was harder than the rest of the course.",
    "I would say take this lab if you have a lot of time to devote to writing out extensive, perfect lab notes.",
    "I would say that this course is a basic physics lab that is manageable. It's fun if you're interested in seeing physics concepts being applied. I would recommend it to a student for that reason.",
    "Yes I would recommend it because it is not too difficult or time intensive, but the TA you're assigned to makes or breaks your semester pretty much.",
    "It's not the most exciting class you'll take, but for a lab course the workload is very manageable and low-stress. A lot of the experiments supplement class concepts well and I found the lab very helpful overall.",
    "The class is very disorganized. Avoid if you can. The final was stressful and you don't get much out of the course.",
    "It's a basic Physics lab. I liked it",
    "It's the worst. They pretend to care but don't. Don't take this lab.",
    "Yes. You should take it over other labs, get to know your TA and what they expect from your write ups. Good luck! They are trying to improve the course!",
    "No - do not take this unless you have to - WORST lab experience at Yale so far for me.",
    "It was fine for physics lab.",
    "Physics 165L met all expectations of an introductory physics laboratory course. The workload was manageable and the final practical exam was clear and direct. The weekly reports were concise, yet often pedantic. I would recommend this course for fulfillment of premedical or major requirements. In sum, this class was an interesting and challenging introductory course.",
    "You have to do it. It is not too hard but it is not mindless either. No real formal lab reports, and error analysis isn't that bad. The demonstrations are great fun too!",
    "very annoying. took this as a senior, feels like such a freshman course. the course, and the peole in it, remind you why you hate premeds. the course is all busy work, that doesn't really enlighten you at all. you are pretty much completely fine if you took something like AP physics in high school.although, to be fair, theinstructors ARE actually doing their best to make the class as worthwhile as possible (a tough task). they listen to student feedback extremely attentively. they ask for your input, and the course gets better and better every year. it is much more bearable than gen chem, and even orgo lab, for me at least. the instructors also do all sorts of statistics to try and grade everyone as fairly as possible (they check grade distributions in each section, they compare grade distributions across sections, look for any outlying grades that you may have, etc)perhaps about 1\/3 of the weeks, you'll have a short mostly multiple choice quiz (very easy, ~4 questions) at the beginning of class. the lab runs about 2.5-3 hours, and they try to include some fun demonstrations. some people actually write all the lab notes in lab, but some write them outside of lab, like me, which can be very time-consuming. the following week, your lab notes, printed graphs from the last session, and a one-pg write-up, in which they want you to include any explanations not in your notes, as well as some \"insight\" or enlightening analysis or application that was not directly in the lab. at the end of the semester, there is a practical, that is bearable, if you understood each lab as you did it.",
    "Only take it if you have to. That being said, the labs are fairly short but a few are pretty tedious."
