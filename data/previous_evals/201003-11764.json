    "I would absolutely recommend this class. It gave me a thorough and broad understanding of grammar.",
    "Spanish 130 is nice class. You start with very, very basic spanish that you definitely know already if you were placed into L3, but it is a necessary foundation for what is to come. This structure is very good, especially because you probably haven't taken spanish in at least a few months. Senora Alexandrov is an awesome teacher, and you should try to get her (even though you have to wake up early in the morning every day). I thought the class was too easy for me for the first few weeks, but it eventually gets sufficiently challenging. There's homework every day, but it usually only takes around 15-45 minutes. It's also a great way to get to know people, and I recommend sitting next to a different person every class until you find someone you like, because you work with a partner quite often, and it's much more fun if you guys get along well.",
    "Yes; if you want to learn Spanish and you place into L3 or L3 is the next logical course for you to take, you should. It will help you develop your Spanish reading, writing, listening, and speaking skills. Plus Pan's Labyrinth is awesome!",
    "It will probably help with speaking, certainly with grammar, and the movies are entertaining to say the least. Take it with Alexandrov and be eternally happy walking out. The professor really makes a difference in Spanish, and Alexandrov made it an enjoyable and painless experience. A good review of high school Spanish and a good way to practice speaking. The work is manageable, but the exams can be difficult to do well on. Overall, I'd recommend for a language requirement or if you want to start working on fluency.",
    "Spanish 130 was a great class for me, in terms of the fact that most of the grammar portions were review and reinforcement, but the amount of speaking we did was new for me, and it really helped me to improve.I would encourage another student to take this class, especially if they want to work on their speaking abilities.",
    "I would recommend it, I really enjoyed the course. There is a continuous workload that can be a little exhausting at times, but the work is actually rather enjoyable. The readings were really interesting and the short films were so great.",
    "Spanish 130 was great. I don't think I got an A, which used to be my usual expected grade in high school, but Yale taught me not to care about this so much, and look instead towards what actual knowledge I gained from a class. Compared to every other Spanish class I've taken, this one outshines them all in terms of what I learned and what I took away from it. Talk about worth it, Agrade or not!",
    "You learn Spanish but in a too grammatical way"
