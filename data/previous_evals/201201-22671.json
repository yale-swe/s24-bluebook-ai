   "comments": [
    "This course is a great intermediate course. The novel is very interesting and the conversations are helpful in learning to speak spanish on a daily basis.. The ponencia project is also very interesting. I would definitely recommend this course to any student.",
    "great course if you want to feel more confident speaking spanish and bring it to the next level. perfect transition from intro courses to more advanced",
    "It's a good intermediate course that sharpens up your grammar, speaking, and writing skills.",
    "Solid course if you wanna learn spanish writing. At the end of this semester, you will be able to write essays in Spanish fairly well, and most of the grammar and conjugations will be easy for you. If you want to be fluent though, you should probably take L5.",
    "There isn't really much I can say beyond that you should really go for this level if you've just finished L3. I sincerely encourage people not to stop at L3 because L4 is when things really start to pick up and Spanish becomes not just a bunch of vocabulary and grammar but a language by which you can access new cultures and people. I started Spanish here at Yale and I can confidently say that this class is worth it.",
    "It's pretty similar to L3 in terms of grammar (with more hw during the first half), but then there's a unit where you read a novel which is a lot of fun! It's probably silly to recommend this because most people are taking it for a requirement, so take it if you must, or if you're interested in L5 courses.",
    "L4 emphasizes conversation and application of vocab and grammar. I would definitely recommend it if you want to be able to speak with more ease. Worksheets at the beginning of the semester are nightly but after midterm you read a novel and do presentations on a topic of your choice.",
    "Definitely take it.",
    "a basic review that works on speaking and writing.",
    "Take it with Profesora Ame Cividanes!! She's terrific. The 140 program is so well structured and as a student who usually does not enjoy taking Spanish classes, I loved this one. The material was fun and engaging and Profesora Cividanes is awesome. I was surprised by how much I loved this class. I highly recommend it.",
    "If you have to take Spanish L4, take it with Professor Cividanes! She's very nice, completely approachable, and she keeps class fairly entertaining. I found L4 quite a bit harder than L3, but my Spanish improved correspondingly. A good course, especially if you have it with a good professor!",
    "Spanish 140 is an extension of the Spanish track. It does meet every day, and has daily homework, which can be exhausting. In addition to the homework, we wrote compositions and presented projects in which we discussed artwork and examined different aspects of Mexican culture to the class. At the end of the semester, there is both a written exam and an oral exam. Some of the grammar is tricky, but there are interesting readings and videos. If you're looking for a section, Ame Cividanes is an excellent professor with a great knowledge of Spanish literature who still keeps class accessible. Overall, I recommend this course to anyone who needs to complete a language requirement or who wants to improve their spoken and written Spanish.",
    "Great course! Definitely worth taking if you've already put in the effort to get to L3 because it will enable you to communicate effectively with native speakers."
