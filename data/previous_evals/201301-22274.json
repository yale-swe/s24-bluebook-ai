   "comments": [
    "Fairly easy class but valuable stuff. Also a good way to familiarize yourself with Shakespeare without reading every single line.",
    "Yes! Not too much work for a seminar and you learn a ton.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student, especially if you are interested in Shakespeare. This was an excellent class. There's a great variety of plays\/films and the discussion was always super interesting! Professor Walsh is amazing. He really faciliates discussion and encourages you to think about interesting new ways to look at the films\/texts.",
    "Yes! It's a fun and engaging seminar. It's also great to work with Walsh.",
    "This class is really more about adaptation theory and how Shakespeare is adapted into films rather than the intricacies of Shakespeare's language. It's a fascinating look into how Shakespeare is staged, interpreted, and filmed by other artists, and I left the class personally believing that we can learn a lot from watching adaptations of Shakespeare, especially if they diverge wildly from our own interpretations.",
    "Excellent course. Professor Walsh is a smart, kind professor, and the plays are of course terrific. Even when the films are less than stellar, the discussions about why there are that way or about adaptation theory and practice in general are always interesting.",
    "I would definitely recommend it- it's a great senior seminar and great experience in analyzing Shakespeare's plays. It will depen your knowledge of adaptation theory and Shakespeare's works themselves. Highly recommended.",
    "Absolutely. One of the few pre-1800 classes I'd take without even needing to",
    "This is a great course to take for your senior seminar requirement. 1 movie a week, and its corresponding play. A new look at stuff you've been reading forever.",
    "Yes."
