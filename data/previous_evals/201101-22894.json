   "comments": [
    "Take it, but if you're deciding between this and something more interesting go with the other class.",
    "It's a pretty good course if you're interested in the collective action. It's a bit dull at points, but the work load is manageable.",
    "Absolutely take CASM! It has been one of the most inspiring classes I have taken here. And Elisabeth Wood is one of the most interesting people that I have met.",
    "Yes, if you're interested in the subject matter. If you don't like putting theory to people then don't take it... there's a lot of that",
    "This was a fantastic course, and probably the best one I've taken at Yale so far. I really enjoyed and feel I learned a lot from the combination of theory and case studies. I think the subject matter is fascinating, which is the main reason I loved the course. I absolutely recommend taking it.",
    "Definitely. Good polisci course if you choose an interesting topic to focus for the final paper -- wraps the class up nicely. Otherwise, rather unfocused.",
    "If you are interested in small-scale social movements, definitely take this class. If you're not interested in the material, it's obviously not for you. It's a lot of reading, but you can get by not doing much of it (though I wouldn't suggest doing so).",
    "If you are involved in activism in your life, take this course for an excellent survey of the types of social movements in the world, as well as theoretical groundings for how people get recruited for these movements. There is a lot of opportunity to ask questions, and question exactly what we mean when we say \"collective action.\" Fascinating!",
    "You learn about a bunch of different interesting social movements. I'd recommend it. The subject matter is really interesting, even though Prof. Wood is a pretty dry lecturer.",
    "Collective Action and Social Movements is a terrific class--among my favorites I've taken at Yale. The readings are interesting and generally manageable, and the case studies are all varied and therefore together complete a comprehensive picture of the ways in which people engage in collective action. I particularly enjoyed the second half of the semester which focused solely on different transnational movements and no longer included theory about social movements. However, the theory, though sometimes dry, gives you a useful terminology for talking about the movements and constructing your final paper. There are four reading responses which you pace for yourself throughout the semester, which is manageable. And the final paper is wide open--you can write about anything you choose that can be considered a collective action movement. Professor Wood is a wonderful lecturer and the class feels more like a seminar than a lecture, partially because the workload is more than your average lecture, but also because there is always discussion and Professor Wood really tries to get to know the students. Take this class!"
