    "If you get a spot, take it. This class is serious stuff.",
    "Take this class! You'll read some great primary literature and (even greater) secondary literature. In fact, I found the essays we read for LITR 348 to be the most thought-provoking and well-written secondary sources I've ever read in a Yale class. Peter Cole of course is funny and smart and engaging and rigorous. Your fellow students will (also, probably, mostly) be smart and funny and kind. The class is almost impossible to dislike, and almost impossible to dismiss. Even if you don't do all the reading (it happens!), you'll get so much out of this seminar\/workshop.",
    "If you can get in, take it. Don't pass up the opportunity to learn from a man who is brilliant and motivated. He's an incredible teacher that will always be around to help and critique your work.",
    "This is by far the best class I've taken at Yale.",
    "TAKE IT TAKE IT TAKE IT!!! If you are passionate about literature, poetry, and\/or criticism then this is a must-take.",
    "ENGL 456 takes the manifold topic of translation - and, so, writing in general - and continuously surprises students with what it can be. I would recommend this course to anyone, regardless of their major, interests, or past experiences. There is so much to be gotten out of the course for so many different kinds of people. It will make you wonder what else might have as much depth to offer."
