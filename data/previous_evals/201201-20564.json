    "- the course material is repetitive- moderate workload- interesting topic if you haven't learned about it before- many undergraduates",
    "Difficult for PhD students. Reading requirements difficult when carrying full term load added to this is the cost of buying books, which are now non-returnable.",
    "One of the best courses at Yale - highly recommended for undergraduate and graduate students.",
    "This class covers health disparities by focusing on the confluence of gender, race\/ethnicity, and social class. It is a great choice for anyone studying health, especially women's health, but should only be taken by those who enjoy reading and discussion."
