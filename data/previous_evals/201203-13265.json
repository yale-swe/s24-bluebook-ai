   "comments": [
    "This is (unfortunately) a required course - the professor is distant and disinterested, little to no instruction is provided, and written instructions are extremely unclear and frustrating. Really amazing material, which makes it even more sad that this is so poorly taught.The TAs are really nice people, but that doesn't take away the fact that the written instructions aren't helpful at all.",
    "Only if you have to take it.",
    "This class could have been very interesting. However the professor is never there to help you learn the equipment. The labs also do not always work, which is very frustrating and time consuming. I only recommend this class if you have to take it for your major.",
    "You'll only take this if you're a BME major since it's required. The grading is super easy, but the labs are really frustrating, time-consuming, and you spend most of your time troubleshooting faulty, old equipment rather than learning the concepts.",
    "Requirement for BME, so you don't really have a choice. Lab topics are interesting, but at least this year we had a lot of equipment issues, and LabView is a pain. Lab reports aren't too much work. Overall not the best, but not terrible.",
    "The lab has so much potential, but it is arguably the most poorly organized and executed lab at Yale. You'll have to take it if you're BME, and hopefully they'll have fixed some of the problems. But be prepared to have no idea why your experiment won't work, no one to help you, and to have no idea how to answer some of the lab questions.",
    "Don't take this course, but if you do it's probably because you are required to. It's confusing and not what you would think you would do for a physiology class. It just works on a computer with a poorly taught computer program and if you work in groups and don't actively take part on the projects, you will learn nothing, which is not much less than what you will learn if you contributed to the group.",
    "This lab actually supplements the material you are learning in BENG 350, more so than any other lab I have taken at Yale (orgo lab comes close). The labs are initially frustrating, but you are given plenty of time (two weeks per lab).",
    "Very bad organization of the course, but work load isn't bad. Labs are 2 week long, so if you finish it early, you don't have to come back the next week. Working in groups is great, helps to split up the work. Equipment often fails and is very frustrating though.",
    "This class has the potential to be really great, but it falls short. It could be great because it teaches you about really interesting things such as dialysis, ekgs, and nerve conduction. However, this class is SO frustrating because the equipment often doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t work, the lab instructions don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really tell you what to do, and then when you get stuck because you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t understand what you are supposed to be doing the TAs don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t help because they don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t understand either. The only good thing is that this lab has many \u00e2\u0080\u009ctwo week\u00e2\u0080\u009d labs that you can finish in one week and so you often get lab days off.",
    "Overall the course is one of the most frustrating labs I have ever taken. While it was nice to have two weeks to finish a lab more often then not that time was needed due to technical difficulties. Although I have to admit the labs were fascinating to do once everything was up and running properly. So I guess one must be prepared to deal with these difficulties (although sometimes it can't be helped-but the TAs did help the best they could) and be patient with the results (since sometime since the lab didn't work properly one couldn't exactly answer all the lab report questions).",
    "Physio lab is kind of rough, but isn't too bad. The TAs really know what they're doing, so ask them as soon as you run into an issue. I can't stress this enough. There were countless moments during which we (you work in groups) would try to figure something out for like an hour, then would finally quit and ask one of the TAs, after which they'd resolve the problem in a jiffy. Most of the labs are 2-week labs, so the second week is usually light, if you even have to come in at all. I think our group had like 2 weeks where we didn't have to come in, and 3 or so weeks where we left early, maybe around 2:30 or 3. You might feel as though the software is really old\/out-of-date, which it is, but the TAs know the stuff pretty well, so just ask them if you get stuck. The reports don't take too long...maybe 3-4 hours on average, but they usually cover 2 weeks of lab work, so it's pretty light. Basically, if you're a BME major, you have to take this lab. If not, you might consider it for a premed bio lab, but you'll probably learn a lot more relevant techniques in other labs, so I wouldn't recommend it.",
    "No, but if you are looking at this course, you are probably BME and have to take it anyways. The lab procedures are old and outdated, noone really cares what is going on in the class and there is an overall sense of black magic: you get results then try to figure out how you got them. There are better labs that you can take. This is not one of them.",
    "Its not that bad of a lab. The labs themselves are pretty interesting when they work. The only issue was that most of the labs had issues with them that were due to old equipment\/equipment that just didn't work, resulting lots of wasted time and really bad data.",
    "This is one of the few labs that's actually not too much work for half a credit, although it is consistently frustrating. The instructions are unclear (and filled with broken links, including one to a Geocities page, which tells you how long it's been since the lab instructions were written), the equipment is old and often broken, and the TAs are apathetic, although they can be helpful when asked. Half the time was spent fiddling witth outdated software on ten-year-old computers. The lab reports aren't too bad, but they can be vague and unclear. This could be a good class, but it needs to be significantly revamped and modernized."
