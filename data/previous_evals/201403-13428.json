    "If you can spend hours and hours each night painting, you may grow a lot in this course. It's certainly an unforgettable experience. That said, it can at times be very frustrating, disheartening, and even sometimes insulting. It's a constant test of self confidence and perseverance, and if you can't commit completely to the course it's results may be disappointing.",
    "More work than probably most other art classes, but it's really more of an experience, than just class. Take it if you are ready to invest the necessary time (you will need a lot of it), because otherwise you will never be happy with where your work is, and just getting by in Robert Reed's class is sacrilege. That being said, be prepared that you might not be happy with your work even if you put in all the time you might possibly have, but Robert's feedback is usually very helpful, once you figure out how he operates. It can also get kind of pricey.",
    "This class is definitely a lot of work, but if you are really committed it's definitely worth it."
