    "This course helped me build on the vocabulary and grammar I had learned in Elementary Portuguese. I learned pitfalls, slang, and the culture of Lusophonic cultures. The class improved my reading, writing, speaking, and comprehension skills in Portuguese. I am much better at holding conversation, listening to news reports, and reading higher-level Portuguese texts.",
    "PORT 130 definitely builds on earlier courses, in that students continue to improve their abilities to read, speak, and understand spoken Portuguese. You continue to learn about Brazil and the lusophone world, build your vocabulary, and increase your ability to differentiate the unique sounds of Portuguese.",
    "intermediate level of Portuguese speaking, comprehension, and writing. i also learned a lot about Brazilian culture.",
    "I learned to have deeper conversations in Portuguese.",
    "This is definitely a course designed to improve your speaking skills in Portuguese. While I'm not sure that my writing necessarily improved, this course really helped me develop more confidence with the language."

    "Strengths: amazing instructor, consistent activity, engaging material, warm classroom environment, entirety of course conducted in Portuguese, regular partner discussions to improve speaking skills, routine feedback. Weaknesses: N\/A",
    "Strengths: If you engage with the class, you will see tangible improvements in your understanding of and ability to use Portuguese; fun, energetic environment to learn in; cool projects Weaknesses: While our textbook led to some great discussions, by nature it is repetitive. I liked it when we mixed in other literature, like poetry and outside short stories.",
    "The work is very manageable and actually enjoyable. The textbook is a series of cronicas, which lead to interesting conversations. I really really enjoyed all the projects we completed."

    "This is a great opportunity to build your Portuguese skills beyond simply knowing vocabulary and verb tenses! You will find ways to express yourself in Portuguese and develop an appreciation for Lusophonic cultures. It was a very fun class and I am so glad it was part of my Yale experience!",
    "Yes! If you've taken PORT 110 and 120, you pretty much know what to expect :)",
    "Yes! My Portuguese improved so much between L2 and L3.",
    "Yes! Marina is an amazing instructor, it's a beautiful language, and the course is great.",
    "Take it! It meets everyday, which is a struggle. However, getting up for this class was enjoyable. You become friends with your classmates and Marina is amazing."
