   "comments": [
    "It's not too hard. Decent class.",
    "I think there are more interesting econ seminars out there. It wasn't bad though.",
    "Yes! Great models that will help your understanding of macro.",
    "The subject matter is not the most interesting, however the workload is not terribly bad.",
    "Great senior course. Not a lot of work, decently interesting material. Some of the Guest lectures are probably the highlight of the course, tho some weren't that great. Still, if you are looking for a chill, but still somewhat interesting senior course, this is it. I liked that it was a mathy enough but not too technical.",
    "I would not recommend this class (for your information, this is not at all a seminar; the only thing that makes it appear to be a seminar is that you sit at a table, but that's about it; it's a lecture) to a fellow student. I truthfully do not think this is a good course at all, although it does have the potential to be good. The material could be interesting, especially given how relevant it currently is. However, the professor does a terrible job of connecting the models and concepts we learn to current events. In fact, he does not even try. More time in class should be spent exploring important events in international finance, such as the Asian Financial Crisis or the European sovereign debt crisis, and discussing the insights that the models and concepts we learn give us into these events. Instead, the professor stands in front of us and reads off powerpoint slides that summarize boring concepts and models about international finance, most of which we have already learned.",
    "Don't expect to learn much finance, it's mostly an overview on international trade and current research on macroeconomic topics...",
    "To be clear, this class is not a seminar, as there is no in-class discussion among students; it is a lecture. The two problem sets are not difficult, especially if you have gone through intermediate level micro\/macro.",
    "Great class that taught me a lot. I would definitely recommend it.",
    "DO NOT TAKE IT!! It is an awful class!",
    "Yes, I definitely recommend ECON 407.",
    "I would summarize Economics 407 by saying that it was a course on international economic integration and its many facets and consequences. I would recommend this course to an individuals who do not necessarily like focusing on the economic situations of specific countries or regions but rather like looking at the general picture.",
    "This is a high level course but with very little work load. You don't have to do the readings, the concepts are not at all hard, the homework and midterm are also reasonable, and there's only one final paper in the end. The professor is nice and is always willing to help. The topics are somewhat interesting, but sometimes it feels like we never reach any real conclusions because we spent too little time on each topic."
