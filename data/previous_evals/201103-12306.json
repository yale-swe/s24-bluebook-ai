    "YES! DO IT! Because developing black and white photographs in the darkroom always feels like magic.",
    "I would definitely recommend ART 136 to anyone even vaguely interested in photography. It is not a \"gut\" class - it is extremely time intensive, having to shoot pictures, developing your film, making contact sheets, and going though the entire printing process. It's not necessarily difficult, it's just busy work (but very fun nonetheless). Professor Kereszi was amazing, she is very chill, and never even checked that we shot the assignments on the syllabus - just that we had the required 35 rolls. A fun, pleasant, small ( my section had 7 people), interesting art class, with an excellent professor.",
    "Why wouldn't you take this class, you fool? You'll come out with a new appreciation for black and white photography and a new set of skills! You'll also establish a sort of sad but endearing codependent relationship with the darkroom and its machinery, as you will be spending more and more time there as the semester goes on. The critiques are not too high pressure, and you'll find that you care a great deal about the work you've produced. It definitely shows when you care about the class, and, as is the case with almost all art classes, you really do get out of it what you put in. So why not choose to get a lot out of it?",
    "Yes yes yes yes yes! It's a big time commitment (I'm pretty sure I spend 40 hours in the dark room over the course of a few days near the end), but it's so worth it. The assignments require you to go out and explore the world, which sometimes we forget to do while at Yale. I can't even fathom how much I learned, not only about photography, but about how I view the world, because looking at the photos you've taken can tell you a lot about yourself. I had interactions with people that I never would have just because I had a camera in my hand."
