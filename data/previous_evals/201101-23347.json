    "It is clear that Prof. Gollin is passionate about his field, and luckily for students, also passionate about teaching. He went out of his way on so many occasions to mentor students and entertain questions. For a student with zero background in agriculture, this was extremely refreshing and helped the learning process greatly. As an economist, Prof. Gollin was able to impressively communicate concepts about agricultural economics to an audience with a mixed background and experiences in economics.Looking back on the course, a few suggestions for improvement:1. More economics in coursework would have been useful. Problem sets with economic exercises would have strengthened student understanding. In fact, these problem sets might have been more useful than the quantitative assignments, or could be integrated into the quantitative assignments.2. The quantitative assignments were useful, but, could have been sharpened in terms of purpose and scope",
    "This class was excellent both in the subject matter which was interdisciplinary and useful for my understanding of the issues as well as taught by an excellent professor. The professor was clearly interested in engaging students on the topic and made time and effort include students' interests in and out of class.",
    "In my mind, this course is really worthwhile. I hope it stays around even if Professor Gollin isn't here next year. I would hope that he would stay onboard. However, I do want to clarify that I think that he is wonderfully passionate and enthusiastic about the content; however, he can take on a seemingly slow pace that I think has the consequence of losing a lot of people's attention. I often multi-tasked during this course, and it wasn't until I had to study for the final that I realized how much I had learned. I think it would be helpful for there to be a mid-term and also a set of readings that will be covered and some that are additional. This would help people know how to spend their time as would a more directed and scheduled syllabus - we often didn't know what was coming in throughout the class."

    "Excellent Professor, highly relevant topics covered.",
    "Professor Gollin is a great teacher. He is very good at stimulating discussions in class, and he successfully pulls interesting comments out of most of the students.",
    "This class fundamentally challenged assumptions about the forces of agriculture. These ideas will help shape my work and decisions in the future.",

    "The teacher is very knowledgeable and he takes his time to make sure that the students really get the material.",
    "That eventhough most students in the class had not taken economics or had experienced agricultural systems before, the professor was able to make both agriculture, policies and economics easy to grasp and discuss about."
