   "comments": [
    "This class was the best class possible for any freshman specifically but also any undergrad at Yale. I recommend this class to everyone but not too many so that the class doesn't get too big.",
    "Very fun! But not well structured - there's an incredible amount of information, and it is hard to tell what is necessary. Manassa is a passionate and engaging lecturer, but we didn't cover much of what was on the syllabus due to lack of time. The field trips were excellent, though - and I always enjoyed coming to lecture. Section was fairly useless. Overall, interesting and fun!",
    "Read the syllabus before you enroll, for the first few weeks can be a bit misleading. The class is a great opportunity to visit places on campus you might not otherwise visit, such as various art museums, the Peabody, and the Beinicke.",
    "It's a great class about the affects\/impacts of ancient Egypt on classical, medieval, Renaissance, colonial, and modern society.",
    "This class is a great overview of the ways that Egypt has infiltrated and influenced basically every culture in every time period. I would definitely recommend this class because the subject is so interesting and Professor Manassa rocks.",
    "not a gut since theres a decent amount of work. 1 paper, weekly responses, 1 midterm, 1 final. easier guts. material can be interesting though",
    "Definitely take this class. No matter what you're studying, it's one of those Yale classes that is just too cool and unlikely to be offered anywhere else.",
    "I would suggest it because I thought it was interesting. I took it credit\/d\/fail which was good because the reading responses were a lot.",
    "I would recommend this class. It was interesting, and the professor is enjoyable. There are consistent, weekly reading responses, but I found that they were not too bad and helped make studying more gradual rather than cramming.",
    "I would recommend it, however, it is NOT a gut class. although the readings don't particularly have to be done and the reading responses are easy, the exams are graded very difficultly and you cannot do well if you don't do the readings",
    "Take the course. It's a great class if you're knowledge of Egypt is only from 5th grade and you want to expand it in a more complex and philosophical way.",
    "This isn't a walk in the park. The exams were deceivingly challenging. I really liked the course though. Seems worth it. A good credit\/D without having to feel like a total waste of space",
    "Really interesting and fun class to take. You'll see just how much of an impact ancient Egypt still has on society today, which I thought was really cool.",
    "Great class. Nor particularly hard and fairly interesting",
    "This is a very good non-traditional archaeology\/art history class. Instead of focusing on the ancient civilization itself, the class looks at the cultural, art historical, and architectural legacy of Egypt through the present.",
    "I really enjoyed Egyptomania. The course got off to a slower start, but once we started taking trips to the Center for British Art, the Peabody, and the Beinecke, really got interesting. I felt that the course utilized Yale's resources quite effectively, and I ultimately learned quite a bit about a topic I hadn't been at all familiar with. You'll get both historical facts about ancient Egypt and analysis of the ancient artifacts. The exams were fair, the paper was not too taxing, and the homework assignments were usually light and even enjoyable.",
    "Good class! It's very interdisciplinary, though, which could be a plus or minus- if you're looking for a course which is primarily art history\/NELC\/etc, you might be disappointed.",
    "Yes. Arch 221 is, in my opinion, one of those archetypal \"Yale\" classes. I would recommend it to anybody.",
    "This is a great course and I recommend it to anyone who wants to know aboutAncient Egyptian influence on future cultures.",
    "Absolutely take this class if you can. Professor Manassa is superb! Not only is her passion for the material evident and contagious, but she teaches in a spectacular way that helps to solidify the myriad of historical figures, events, and artifacts studied. It is exciting to see so many of the actual pieces in Yale's Museums. The workload is certainly manageable, although you do have to study for midterms and finals. Its a great 5th class or humanities credit even if you do not know anything about Ancient Egypt."
