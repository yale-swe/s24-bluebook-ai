   "comments": [
    "Great way to become a teacher. Linda Cole-Taylor cares more about her students than any professor I have had at Yale, which is why it of course makes sense to get rid of her.",
    "Yes. If you are taking 190 just get the observation credit as well.",
    "The perfect way to work in schools.",
    "Take it if it's with Professor Cole-Taylor. If with a graduate student or anyone else who was just brought in to the education studies program from Mary Miller, then do not take - it'll be a waste of your time.",
    "Yale rarely offers practical experience in, or a practical look at, an area of study. This class offered that.",
    "This is a great opportunity to go into a New Haven classroom and see what high school actually looks like (even if it is only one perspective out of countless different experiences). It was a great complement to what we learned in class, and very valuable to get a perspective on a school we weren't otherwise familiar with, and especially to enable you to step beyond simply your own high school experience. And if you're taking EDST190, there's no reason to not enroll in this course if you could use an extra half a credit",
    "This is the half credit laboratory component to EDST 190. Its an amazing experience -- you get to interact with students enrolled in an actual New Haven public school on a weekly basis. It provides you with a grounding in reality that you can use to discuss education on a more realistic level. I cannot begin to recommend this class enough. If there is one credit at Yale College that I would describe as positive and worthwhile it is this clinical field experience.",
    "Observation paired with EDST 190, sign up for it for the extra half credit.",
    "Why not? You're doing the regular course anyway if you're doing this. Take it seriously--you'll learn a lot."
