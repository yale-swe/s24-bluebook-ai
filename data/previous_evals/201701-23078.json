   "comments": [
    "I feel like this course covered a whole bunch of topics I'd seen before in a more organized and complete way. It is easily the most valuable course i've had in preparing me for my summer work and potential case studies\/applications in the future.",
    "I learned so much during this course. Although I was frustrated at first by the amount of methodology and relative lack of true applications in R, I grew to appreciate this model as I think it really furthered my understanding of what was happening behind the scenes when I was actually analyzing data. Jessi taught me invaluable lessons about interpretation and data exploration, which definitely helped me grow as a statistician.",
    "Learned a lot about R, very little about the underlying theory. When complex statistical equations flash by your eyes in a powerpoint every 30 seconds it's hard to really absorb them. But the class coding examples were great and I'm sure I'll be going back to R lecture code for years as a reference.",
    "I feel like a lot of this course was just more in depth study of STAT 230 material. It was cool to do a project on a data set that we found on our own with a question that we thought was interesting",
    "programming in R, different data analysis techniques",
    "Some useful skills\/understanding of statistics, but less than hoped. Mostly familiarity and experience with R.",
    "I believe that my skills in producing data analysis reports has improved significantly. There was a good balance between theory and application in the course.",
    "This course definitely increased my knowledge of data analysis. I had previously taken STAT 230, but this course went much more into depth on most topics, and I benefitted greatly from that.",
    "Through this course I gained the opportunity to apply multiple semesters of theoretical statistics to actual datasets. Each problem set involved using the statistical techniques and analyses that we had learned on an actual dataset. I quickly learned how to use R to perform statistical analyses and was finally able to connect various disparate topics that I had learned in previous classes to each other and to real-world applications. I saw how messy data analysis can be, and how it can seem very simple until you actually perform a rigorous analysis of the data and are forced to make many difficult choices. In that same vein though, I also saw how powerful statistical analysis could be and how much information we can extract from different types of datasets."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Does a good job going through various concepts in data analysis. Some suggestions: 1. Sometimes the course seems to miss the forest for the trees. I don't feel like I necessarily got a good sense of generally how to approach a new data set when you're not told what model you'll fit or why whatever technique is used when it is. 2. Maybe a little less time on linear regression to allow for more in depth discussion of clustering as well as a brief introduction of some other topics that weren't covered at all. 3. More discussion of how to deal with messy data.",
    "I really like that the course covers so much, but maybe data analysis 361 shouldn't start with an in depth discussion of linear regression? At least not all of it? Like a day or two and then on to BIC and AIC? It's strange because data analysis 230 touched on regression at the end, and 242 covers it in some detail, and then there's a whole class on it. I understand it's important but as a statistics major i'm getting sort of tired of the same sort of thing at the beginning of every class. Maybe just tell people who don't take the other ones to do some extra work in the early weeks to catch up? I'm not sure, it just feels like the classes at this high a level should be aimed at people studying the discipline, not whoever wants to know a little bit about the subject.",
    "The only real qualm I have with this course is that it didn't feel like it was particularly welly supported. One set of TA office hours a week the night before the homework is due isn't super conducive to getting actual help when it's needed. Jessi's hours were also right during a really standard class time block (T\/Th 1:00-2:15) so I know I personally was never able to make those when I had questions. I also don't think that Piazza was super well supported, but that again might fall back to the fact that the only two people available to answer questions were Jessi and the TA",
    "The course covered a lot of important topics in data analysis, so I came away with at least a familiarity with the terms and uses. But, I didn't feel like the lectures substantially increased my understanding of the material. I would have preferred to have more theoretical background because that's something that is more difficult for me to learn on my own. In terms of how to run the code, etc., i think homework assignments are a more effective way to learn that and so lectures shouldn't be as dedicated to that aspect of the material.",
    "I think this class deserves to be labeled a writing credit. Professor Cisewski really does get into the nitty-gritty of how to write a proper statistics essay. Presentation often gets waited the same as the statistical processes. In total I think I wrote about 100 pages for the class. Just a thought!",
    "The material could be really interesting a cool, but I found it' presentation fairly uninteresting. The quizzes were way more difficult than expected and were difficult to study for because the lecture slides do not captain info that is helpful for interpreting R output or for understanding what the lectures were about.",
    "I wish the grading of the problem sets had been a bit more standardized and that the expectations for each problem set were a little more clear. I frequently would turn in a homework assignment having no clue whether it would get me an A or a B, and often times the amount of effort I put into an assignment had little correlation to the grade I ended up getting.",
    "Weakness: lectures tend not to be very interesting, and sometimes students don't understand the code and\/or the reasoning behind all those statistical tests",
    "The course gave good practical experience with R. However, it might have been good to integrate theory a bit more closely, as there were times when I was doing things in R without entirely knowing why. Also I still don't feel very confident tackling new datasets without explicit interdictions. But a good first crash course overall. I would also recommend speeding up the lectures. Prof Cisewski spent too much time reviewing and reiterating points. While this is useful to some degree, eventually it makes it very hard to pay attention and catch the truly new and important things.",
    "I think that the reports were sometimes marked too strictly for layout and figure captions. Hence, much of the effort spent on homework was used to tweak plots and graphs so that they appeared perfectly. Lecture slides, in general, were very clear.",
    "I thought the weakest part of this course were the lectures. I thought the material was interesting, but the way it was covered, mostly through lecture slides, made it harder to engage with the material. Some of the classes deal with R, which I thought was a much better use of the lectures. I thought the homework assignments did a good job matching with what was taught in the lectures, but I thought the first two quizzes were pretty unreasonable, if not in the material than in the grading.",
    "Strengths: The material is useful if you plan to do data analysis in the future. Weaknesses: Pretty much everything else. While the professor is really sweet, the lectures are boring, the problem sets are random, and the TF is horrible. Might as well take STAT 230.",
    "The material for this course is extremely interesting and Prof. Cisewski is a good lecturer and especially helpful in office hours. She presented the material at a reasonable pace and deftly balanced small amounts of theory with the broader goals of practical applications in the course. The problem sets were generally very useful for learning the material and getting exposure to various types of datasets. Furthermore, I thought that the final data analysis project was a great opportunity to apply the techniques we had learned to a dataset of our choice. The primary weaknesses of the course grew from the fact that it is difficult to teach coding and some of the statistical techniques in an engaging way. Thus, while the material was almost always interesting, lectures could sometimes become tedious and a bit difficult to follow. Furthermore, I think the pacing was a bit strange in regard to how much time we spent on linear regression at the start of the course compared to topics in the second half that felt a bit rushed, such as ridge regression, LASSO, or classification models."

    "Sure.",
    "STAT 361 is a core course for the DS2 and Applied Math majors, so I assume a lot of people would have to take this course anyways. Given this fact, I was expecting this class would be intellectually intriguing and give us a great foundation for data science either in industry or academia. However, I have to confess that this class completely falls short of my expectation. Here is my feedback: 1. Their grading did not make sense to me. For instance, they take points off if you do not label a figure even though it is clear which figure you are talking about in the report. Sometimes they take points off saying \"explain more.\" However, you can always explain more about anything, and simply saying \"explain more\" is not a legitimate grading comment. Lastly, sometimes in assignments, they say you have to write a report in a way that is accessible to non-stat people. In this case, you would need to write a report with a plain language without using a statistical concept like maximum likelihood. However, they also expect that you explain things rigorously; you get points off if you \"imply\" causation when talking about linear regression. This really does not make sense since you assume the reader is a non-stat person. When you ask for advice from an expert, you certainly do not expect him\/her to explain things rigorously. Too much detail oftentimes just confuses you. 2. While the grading alone was enough to make this course the least favorite course in my life, the course material and homework assignments are not good either. They use the same data sets over and over again and those data sets do not even contain many data points, which makes me feel that performing data analysis on them is not a great idea. They require EDA on every data set throughout the assignments, but EDA on such data sets do not seem too important. They could have used more appropriate data, like the ones on Kaggle. If they really think that data science would play an important part in shaping the future of the university, I would strongly recommend that they would improve upon or eliminate this course.",
    "It's hugely valuable if you're interested in using statistics, and I think it's a perfect class to tie a lot of other classes together. I would recommend it to statistics majors, but of course they have to take it.",
    "If you're interested in data analysis and want to learn some higher level skills, I would 1000000% recommend this course",
    "Yes, take it if you want to learn to write a clean data analysis report with mostly basic but (if you want) also more advanced techniques in R. It was very much get out what you put in; p-sets could take a night or multiple days if you want. Covers a lot of the same material as Stat 230, but more in depth theory-wise, and more freedom in the homework. Lecture was extremely boring and slides terrible for review, so I recommend taking notes if you can stay awake and relying on the example R code. 3 short in-class quizzes, weekly problem sets, final project.",
    "Take it! Cisewski is a boss!",
    "I would reccomend STAT 230 or 363 before this course, because they are presented in more engaging ways.",
    "I recommend taking this course, but know that the grading is much less standardized than in other quantitative courses. The psets are much more open-ended than you might expect.",
    "A pretty mediocre course, but can be useful. You will definitely get experience in R, but don't expect to become an expert on data analysis. The course moves slowly, which is nice if you are learning R for the first time or unfamiliar with statistics, but can make lectures very boring. Luckily prof cisewski is very nice and keeps the course super organized (with slides online), which helps redeem the often tedious lectures. Take it if you have to for a requirement, or if you have a specific need to develop data analysis skills (and even then, only if you are interested in regression techniques), but not otherwise.",
    "Yes, it is an excellent course to learn how to produce data analysis insights and reports. Workload is high though, even though the difficulty level is average or below average.",
    "I thought STAT 361 was a good class overall. The class goes much further into detail than STAT 230, and I think it is the better course because it is so comprehensive. The homework assignments were all totally reasonable, though I thought the quizzes were really challenging. The lectures tended to be uninteresting, but I thought the course was still a strong one overall.",
    "this was a great stat class to take if you're in the major or just for fun even. you learn a lot of cool new things about data analysis and various methods and cisewski is an amazing teacher. workload was not too tough - psets, 3 quizzes, and a final project. TAs were helpful and again cisewski is very nice and understanding and approachable. feedback and grading on homework and quizzes were quite vague but it was neat to write up our own final project.",
    "Unless there is a different TF and the lectures become more informative and engaging, you're better off taking STAT 230.",
    "Data analysis is a good upper-division stat course. It does have significant work, but it generally feels meaningful, and you leave the class feeling as though you learned a good deal. Thus, I found the class very rewarding and think that the strategies I learned will be very useful for empirical senior research. Professor Cisewski is a pretty good lecturer, but while the material is interesting, there are certain topics and coding issues that can become dry and tough to follow in lecture. Nonetheless, I definitely recommend this course for a student interested in learning how to apply statistical techniques to actual datasets."
