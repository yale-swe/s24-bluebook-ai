    "I learned a lot about the history of women and social protest, but little about writing.",

    "I learned a great deal about how to write a proper essay, including structuring my thesis, finding good evidence to support my claim, introducing evidence properly and ensuring that everything came back to the big picture of why the things I wrote about matter. Overall, I developed my analytical and argumentative writing skills throughout this course."

   "comments": [
    "The material for this course is very interesting, but the professor made it a painful course to take. The course itself has a lot of potential, and it taught me a lot about the role of women throughout social protest in US history.",
    "I think the largest strength of the class is its small size. I grew very comfortable with the other students in my section, and enjoyed hearing their feedback on my writing. I think this course is especially effective in helping YC freshmen adjust to the much higher standards of college-level writing. I was challenged to make my arguments much more clear and specific, which I appreciated a lot.",
    "The content and structure of the course was very well laid out. However, I often found myself doing more work than my peers who were taking other English 114 courses. During paper three, many of my friends who lived on my floor did not have to write as much as I had to write for the proposal or annotated bibliography. I sometimes felt as though the extra work my classmates and I had to do was menial and did not contribute to making us better writers.",
    "I thought the course was rather disorganized. I am not sure if other English 114 classes had this problem, but I thought the handling of thesis statements was quite poor. We had a very helpful workshop on formulating a thesis (led by a really great grad student, Helen Yang), but it came after already writing two papers. I think the class would have benefitted from, among other things, putting that workshop earlier in the semester."

   "comments": [
    "I would not recommend this course to another student. The subject matter is interesting, but the class itself is not worth it. My class began with 11 students at the beginning of the semester and, by the end, dropped to only 6 largely due to the professor. Again, interesting subject matter, but poorly taught, and taught me little about how to become a stronger writer.",
    "I would recommend the course to another student but I'd advise them to be very careful about the section that they take. I think the section instructor determines the student's experience with the class. I'd advise potential shoppers to think hard about whether or not the instructor's teaching style aligns well with how they learn.",
    "I would recommend that a student take an English 114 section because it does a lot to help improve your writing ability. However, I believe students should find a section that truly interests them because they will be writing essays the whole year about the same subject, and therefore would want to pick a subject that is engaging.",
    "No. I wish I had taken another course in place of this one"
