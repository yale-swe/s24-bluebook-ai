    "Great opportunities to catch up with the scientific trend in the biostatistics field.",

However, as a first year student, I felt overwhelmed by the talks, not having studied any of the topics yet. There was no point at which we got an introduction to the material being discussed in the lecture series, so every week just felt like a gigantic waste of time with no benefit.",
    "Sometimes the lectures are a little hard to understand, but most are interesting.",

    "A good way to learn about various things going on within the field. A good and necessary class."
