    "I learned about what it means to be \"Jewish\" or a \"Jew\" and why answers to those straightforward queries are so complicated and contested.",
    "This course was an amazing intellectual experience. We covered sources about American Jewish identity that I had not seen before and fundamentally changed my thinking about how we should be studying Judaism in an American context. This course was also the best seminar I have taken at Yale."

    "Stern is the man. Period. Take it for him and his fun, freewheeling but always erudite opinions.",
    "This was the best course I have taken at Yale.",
    "Prof. Stern is an incredibly engaging and fascinating professor, and I enjoyed the way he lead seminar. I thought we should have done a week on Jewish humor instead of some of the more high-brow topics we covered. But on the whole, this course was excellent and a great way to learn more about American Jewish Identity.",
    "The readings at time were quite dry, tedious, and seemingly unrelated to the course. Either I missed the point at times of the reading, or I didn't care. Not entirely the Professor's fault, but I think they could be made a bit more interesting."

   "comments": [
    "For sure! Jews and non-Jews alike, take this class! You will learn lots.",
    "This course was excellent. For a student looking to learn about American Jewish life and politics, I can think of no better introduction. Anyone interested in learning about these topics should take this course. Professor stern will expose you to new and important perspectives.",
    "Yes! This course is a great way to think about Jewish identity and politics. Very high level discussions in a relaxed environment.",
    "If you're interested in American Jewish Identity in the slightest, you will find this seminar facinating. The workload is pretty minimal, but you won't have that much time to write the midterm essay. The professor is excellent and I recommend attending his office hours regurally. Some students come into the course with more background than others, but this was not a problem in this course and students should not be deterred by a lack of background knowledge.",
    "It is an okay course -- it really depends on what you're getting out of it. The biggest problem is at times getting ahold of Prof. Stern. While his life was a bit busy this semester, it did become difficult for me at times. If you're looking for a course where you'll have super profound revelations about your identity, I'm not quite sure this is what you're looking for. If you're looking to debate with a handful of other Yale Jews for two hours a week on identity and issues, this would be your course."
