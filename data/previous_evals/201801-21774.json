    "Good foundational statistics, thermodynamics, and statistical mechanics taught from a fantastic textbook. Developed new skills in problem solving related to these statistical physics methodologies which I think will be very helpful for my future research interests.",

   "comments": [
    "The homeworks are reasonably challenging but definitely a strength for the class. The midterm was poorly executed and should have either been an unlimited-time take-home midterm or just done in-class. Meng is clearly still learning how to lecture, so I think that he could improve the class by focusing more on explaining the physical meanings of what we are doing more rather than simply grinding through the mathematics from Kardar. I think the main thing the class needs is additional physical explanations as we are going along. Often times I have found myself capable of doing the calculations but still lacking a strong grasp of the underlying physics.",
    "I cannot think of any strengths of this course. The textbook for this course is horrific, and does a terrible job explaining concepts and giving context to calculations. The lectures were difficult to follow, and also lacked any context or motivation. The midterm, which was a take-home exam, was also awful, in that it was not comparable to homework, it was far too long for the time, students didn't follow the constraints of the test, and the questions were very unclear and contained several mistakes. The final exam, which was in class, was also far too long and far above the material of the homework. The length and difficulty of weekly homework was fine. The class could be vastly improved with a better textbook, including more context for the material, and parallel construction of the homework and exams, which should reflect the teaching goals of the course.",
    "Weaknesses: 1. The take home midterm was a bit of a disaster. It was far too long, much more difficult than homeworks, had several mistakes, and many students didn't follow the constraints. 2. Homeworks were not comprehensive. That is, we did not get problems about material on which we were tested. The assignment on probability was never particularly relevant to the rest of the course. 3. Textbook was often not clear. It did not motivate methods or calculations and often skipped non-trivial steps. Strengths 1. The section on quantum gases was decent. Professor Cheng's lecture notes were very helpful.",
    "The course content itself was reasonable and well chosen. Many times steps in the derivation of expressions were skipped in order to save time, but felt important enough to be explained.",
    "Homework was easy compared to exams. Id flip it the other way around. Overall, very good though.",
    "The Kardar book isn't very enlightening. There seems to be little motivation for the material much of the time. I had to find other books to help explain things better.",
    "The strength of this course is the material -- statistical physics is a great subject.",
    "I think the course is very organized and Prof Cheng is very clear about the concepts and derivations.",
    "Rigorous math, good logic; Probably needs to be slower in the math part to let people follow, and more physical insight attached to math derivation.",
    "I found the content of the course to be very interesting.",
    "The course is well organized but it can cover more materials.",
    "It was too fast-paced, and covered too much information. Also, the tests were very difficult.",
    "Overall the material we covered is very useful"

   "comments": [
    "Absolutely. I realized that I actually love statistical mechanics and want to take the second course in the sequence now. All I would like to see is Meng continue to strengthen his lecturing skills, but overall a great class!",
    "If this course were not a required one, I would absolutely not recommend it. This course felt like more of a crash course in mathematical approximation than a statistical mechanics course, was not taught well, and lacked motivation.",
    "Probably not. It seemed to often lack motivation and context. It was also not very useful for those not interested in condensed matter theory.",
    "Compulsory for all grad students anyway.",
    "Id recommend this course to a student who has at least taken classical mechanics first. It was hard to jump in with no physics even though I had the math.",
    "It is a required course so this is not relevant.",
    "Yes this course was interesting and fun. The material fit well into the context of what was being taught concurrently in the other classes in the physics cirrculum and classes that were taken in the previous semester.",
    "Yes I would definitely encourage others to take this class as I think Prof Cheng is a very good professor.",
    "Probably... But anyway this is to a great extend a required course for grad students, most people have to take it anyway.",
    "As far as content is concerned, I would recommend this class.",
    "Detailed explain the method to calculate statistic mechanics.",
    "No, because you won't get much out of it.",
    "Yeah it's required"
