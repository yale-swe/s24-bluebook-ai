    "This course was a good introduction to anthropology.",
    "This course opened my eyes to an entirely new world. I've never before looked at medicine or my own body in the way that we were trained to during class, and it has helped me to become critical of what I had before taken for granted.",
    "Looking at different approaches through a multi-disciplinary lens!",
    "I learned a lot about the history of medical anthropology and how it effects today's medical practices.",
    "This course taught me how to think critically about the world around me, to question what we hold as universal truths, to engage with current events, and to think about the factors that shape healthcare delivery in the United States and how it can be improved to be more equitable for everyone.",
    "I learned about a lot of social issues in great depth. I feel like I can be a more active participant in social discussions.",
    "I learned what medical anthropology is and I learned about some main concerns of medical anthropologists today. I learned to analyze\/understand biomedicine and other forms of medicine as cultural entities, and my perspective about how to affect these cultures shifted.",
    "I learned how to critically think about medicine and other health related ideas\/structure.s"

   "comments": [
    "There are a lot of readings that are extremely dense in this class. Also, lectures don't really help to clear up the readings. The lectures were really confusing and ended up just being a scramble to write down everything the professor was saying. Professor Newman also uses vocabulary that is extremely dense and convoluted so it can be hard to follow exactly what she means, especially because the lectures move so fast. Section was the only way we were able to talk about the readings and understand what we read.",
    "The readings were all very interesting and important in terms of medical anthropology, but they were very difficult and there was too much reading; even though some of the readings were taken off to lighten the load it was still too much, as we had to read 2-3 long articles each class and a book for each unit. There was also weird organization around the writing assignment; we talked about it in class one day and did not get the writing prompt for weeks after, then only had a few days after Thanksgiving break to submit it. There wasn't much communication between professor\/TA and students",
    "I found this course really engaging and challenging. Professor Newman was really good at making sure we engaged with the texts we read, but I definitely think a bit more \"term\" review could have been helpful.",
    "Too much reading, but great teaching from both Newman and Minor and incredible delivery of content, material, and understanding.",
    "At the beginning, there were too many readings and theories and lectures went too quickly and made it hard to catch up with the class. After the midterm, things were better and taking the time to present the theories in different mediums proved to be helpful!",
    "This course was very interesting but it was difficult to study for and did not have a way to check information outside of lecture.",
    "The strengths of this course is that it opens your eyes to the world and makes you question it in a way you never have before. At first, it was challenging because I thought it was looking to deep into something that wasn't there, but once you start to understand the theory behind these anthropological analyses and learn how to ask the right questions, you realize that anthropologists are asking the questions that no one else is. The readings are incredibly interesting and worth looking at, but one weakness is that the course moves very quickly through the readings. For someone who is not used to so many readings a week, it can be a good introductory course to what the workload is like at Yale, but also very challenging to do thoroughly every week.",
    "The organization of this course did not really make sense. Lectures were summary of readings and some discussion of readings, discussion sections were discussion of readings, and homework was reading responses. It felt like the course was simply a presentation of an extensive list of readings.",
    "I found that the course syllabus was far too ambitious and poorly timed in regards to the progression of the semester as well as reasonable bounds for how much dense reading one could get done in a few days with 4+ more courses to take care of. The final book assignment, in particular, was assigned to be read and finished in a week - the week prior to reading week to be exact - and immediately following the course's only writing assignment. At the beginning of the semester, two entire class sessions were devoted to coming up with a question to Anne Fadiman - the endeavor seemed like a massive waste of time considering her response was brief and discussed for all of 10 minutes in class. The strength of the course definitely lies in the material itself since it is interesting and for the most part very engaging.",
    "The course covers a very wide scope of topics which I think is both a strength and weakness. While I loved that I was able to learn about so many different issues, I wish we could have gone a little more in depth with some.",
    "Strengths: awesome lecture, well-organized course plan with clear themes and progression through curriculum. Good in-class discussion, appropriate level of work assigned. Great job of responding to student feedback. Clearly focused on student learning. Weaknesses: Little opportunity to accumulate points throughout the semester. Wish we had weekly quizzes to help with this. Discussion during section felt somewhat unhelpful; difficulty facilitating deep or thoughtful discussion. Some activities felt less than ideally suited to the topics we learned about. Finally, the writing assignment felt rushed and felt like a great deal of points given that we had no prior writing assignment. Overall though, I learned in section and in class every day, and I looked forward to both each week. Favorite class I took this term!!",
    "For an intro class, it does a good job of introducing you to a wide variety of topics in medical anthropology. You will definitely develop a vocabulary to discuss these issues. Once you get the gist of it though, the material could feel repetitive.",
    "The course as an amazing mix of lecture and discussion, which I loved. The readings were fascinating and exciting to read. I also enjoyed how Professor Newman asked for our feedback and incorporated it to improve the course."

   "comments": [
    "Yes, definitely! This course was fascinating and offered an amazing level on insight into some of the critical areas of medical anthropology. Every student looking to go into health MUST take this course!",
    "I would recommend this class to another student who would be willing to put in the time and effort. There are a lot of readings that take up a lot of time because they are so dense.",
    "YES YES YES! I've already recommended it to anyone who will listen to me rave about this course. I'm so happy I took it, even though I started the last day of shopping period.",
    "I absolutely loved this course. Newman is splendid and a joy to have as professor, and she delivers the course very well. Class is very enjoyable, and she often brings in clips from TV shows and movies that showcase topics from class. Reading was a bit much, especially when we got into the more theoretical works, but Newman adjusted accordingly and took time in class to ensure understanding. Overall, one of my favorite courses thus far.",
    "take this class!! it was one of my favorite classes of all time!",
    "Yessssss!!!! Great course for anyone interested in the human condition, which should be everyone. Great for future doctors, policy makers, anthropologists, politicians,.....etc!",
    "I would but I would make it clear that it is not easy and the readings can be overwhelming.",
    "I definitely would recommend this course to another student, especially as someone who is interested in following a medical career and can gain a lot from the lessons learned and questions posed throughout this class.",
    "This class did not feel like a safe space to express opinions that did not align with the assumed majority.",
    "Yes! I already do. I loved learning the other side of medicine that we're often times not exposed to. Professor Newman is great and so was Jes!",
    "Absolutely. It will require an open mind but Professor Newman is awesome and really cares about her students. I learned a lot about medical anthropology and noticed my perspective about a lot of things has changed as a result of this class!",
    "If you are interested in this field, this is definitely the gateway course.",
    "Yes, definitely take this if you have any interest whatsoever in health or medicine. It is such a good course for any considering going to medical school. Even if you aren't premed, the course gives you a really great idea of the power of anthropology to understand something such as medicine, that is often taken for granted, in new and important ways."
