    "I would recommend this class to a student who is interested primarily in discussing music. This class is not exactly what I thought it would be; it is definitely not at all of a music history class -- I cannot say I've learned much from this class in the way that one learns things from reading a textbook. Most of this class consists of discussion of what we hear in the music and what we think of readings about the music. If this appeals to you, you should absolutely take the class.",
    "Would definitely recommend! It was one of my favorite classes this year because the environment wasn't very high pressure, everyone was there to simply learn about and talk about their common interest in music. The structure of the course was basically a listening assignment due every Tuesday and several readings due every Thursday, a very manageable amount of work. I came into the class having a background in music yet a very weak knowledge of composers and the history surrounding musical compositions. If you have an interest at all in learning more about composers and their faith \/ the faith of their listeners \/ the future implications and responses of people to a piece of music based on their faith, then I would absolutely recommend taking this course.",
    "A great seminar for freshmen who are interested in learning more about what these \"great works\" are really about.",
    "Take this class for a fun, not too challenging music course that will allow you to delve deeper into the background of some great works of music!",
    "The class was an excellent survey of music at the intersection with faith themes and themes of existence. Themes were often difficult to fully grasp, and the music analysis would sometimes reach levels of death beyond the beginner. However, work was not overwhelming at all, and I wouldn't discourage anyone from taking the class. I learned a great deal musically as well as philosophically.",
    "I loved this course! The content never failed to interest me, especially when part of my homework every week was to simply sit down and listen to music. Plus, Professor Parkes is a wonderful instructor that is always willing to listen to students' ideas and gain insight from them. Every person in my class had a musical background of some sort, so we could get into more detailed conversations about the musical aspects of the pieces. I am honestly not sure what this class would be like for someone without previous music experience, but I do trust that Professor Parkes would manipulate the content and discussions so that everyone in the class could follow along. Even if you're afraid of not having enough musical knowledge to take the course, it's certainly worth going to the first couple sections to test it out. Professor Parkes is also super approachable and I'm sure he would be happy to answer any questions you have!",
    "MUSI 030 is a seminar that covers the intersection of religion (or other faith) and Western (mostly) classical music. For those interested in religious studies and music, it is definitely an good class, but sometimes the readings can be tasking. I would recommend it to people who enjoy a lot of speculative discussion; I think the class is what you make of it, and if you contribute a lot, you will enjoy it.",
    "I would highly recommend this class. The class has a manageable workload that includes some reading and also the listening of some of the most amazing classical works ever. There is also a final paper that is quite lengthy and tedious. The class perfectly ties together music and religion and provokes students to contemplate the musical decisions of composers and the history behind the musical works. The class is absolutely enlightening and enjoyable."
