    "I learned a lot about how to conduct scientific research properly, how to present research to peers, and how to write a scientific report.",
    "Working in a research lab is more informative than any course could be. It's all good to be able to write a reaction on paper, but in order to do actual chemistry, you need to know how to set up a reaction in the hood yourself, be able to troubleshoot and think of ways to work around problems as you encounter them.",
    "Deeper understanding of the scientific method, detailed data analysis and experimental troubleshooting, ability to describe research purpose and results in a compelling and concise manner",
    "I had the opportunity to engage in research methods and present my findings to my peers and faculty.",
    "Research presentations, what other students are doing",
    "I learned how to conduct laboratory research and learned about the other forms of chemistry research being conducted by my classmates.",
    "Research, scientific writing, and poster skills",
    "This is standard independent research.",
    "The CHEM490 course provided a platform to explore independent research in the modern chemistry laboratory. During the two semester sequence, I focused on developing skills necessary for independent research, including project design and methodology, literature review, technical skills to carry out experiments, data analysis, and presentation of results in the form of a paper and poster presentation. The course also provided the opportunity to delve deeply into one small area of chemistry research much further than any course in the chemistry department does."

   "comments": [
    "The strengths of this course are that you get to experience academic research firsthand, and have a facilitated environment in which you can practice talking about your research to other students. The weaknesses of it are that you can only get one credit, no matter how much research you do. In MCDB, there is an option to do \"intensive research\" and get 2 credits per semester. I put in way more than 1 credit's worth of work into research both semesters I took Chem 490, which made it hard to do well in the other classes I had to take in order to reach 36 credits and graduate.",
    "nothing",
    "More guidance re: final thesis and poster would have been nice",
    "It was great to hear about the work of other students in my year of the chemistry major. However, meeting for 30-45 min every week at an inconvenient time could be avoided by having just two-three meetings during the semester with more presentations per meeting.",
    "There could've been more standardization of expectations across students in different labs - it seemed like 10 hours\/week meant very different things and was very differently enforced by different PIs.",
    "It depends on your lab selection.",
    "I think the presentations are fine, and a good way to hear what other students are working on. Overall, not a bad way to spend a thesis course."

   "comments": [
    "you have to do it if you are a chem bs int. if not, then just take chem 480 (research for credit)",
    "If you've done research in a lab for more than one semester, this course is the best way to fulfill the senior thesis major requirement.",
    "Definitely. Engaging research and presenting it, fielding questions, is a valuable skill that I was able to practice.",
    "Very relaxed senior requirement. The only thing you do is listen to other students' research presentations. The thesis at the end is just as long as you need it to be to get your point across, and the poster session is very chill.",
    "Yup, because you probably have to take it. Research for credit, it's pretty standard.",
    "You have to do this as a chemistry major. Find a professor and lab you like.",
    "This is a required course for the BS or BS Intensive in Chemistry. Thus, it is a self-selective class.",
    "Definitely take it if you are a Chemistry major and have a good lab and project to work on."
