   "comments": [
    "If you're planning on continuing your math studies beyond intro-level calculus, take it. It's by no means a walk in the park, and if you don't really love math and\/or physics, you'll probably be miserable at times. That said, it can be very rewarding, and certainly will challenge you if you haven't been challenged before.",
    "I highly recommend if you plan on majoring in math. Otherwise, absolutely not.",
    "Great proof-based course that ties together linear algebra and multivariable calculus. Will be challenging - problem sets are 10+ hours a week.",
    "Math 230 is a great course if you are ready to dive into real math. It is proof-based, but guides you through the process of constructing rigorous proofs. I took the course with some background in linear algebra and no background in multivariate calculus and did fine. It is definitely worth taking if you're willing to put the time into it, especially if you are considering majoring in math.",
    "Definitely recommend to anyone who likes math, and doing calculations doesn't count.",
    "If you are going to be taking this you probably took it first semester, so I am not sure this review really matters. But if you were able to make it through first semester, I would suggest continuing through to the end. Things get more abstract but also more useful. The second semester is definitely more difficult, but it does not consume more time than the first.",
    "This is an excellent class for people who think they may end up majoring in math. It shows you what higher level math is like and prepares you for what is ahead. You learn a lot about proving mathematical statements, which is really new to a lot of people.",
    "I would definitely recommend Math 230 to students who are interested in learning proof-based mathematics, or who are interested in seeing vector calculus in a rigorous framework. Math 230 involves a lot of work each week, and a lot of reading outside of class, but I found it to be a mentally engaging and rewarding class (the work, while sometimes extensive, is never tedious).",
    "Math 230 is an excellent introduction to proof-based mathematics. Do not expect an applications course. Even by the end of the course, you may not be the best in your entryway at complicated applied max\/min problems or tricky line integrals. You will, however, have a strong and deep understanding of WHY such concepts make sense, as long as (and this is a big \"as long as\") the course is well-taught. My year, we had Jayadev Athreya, who did an excellent job, but he won't be teaching the class next year. Look at course reviews (even if they're for other courses) who whoever IS teaching this class.",
    "The workload is heavy and the material is hard to understand. But if you can stick it out for one full year you'll really appreciate the beauty and simplicity of math.",
    "Very very good class, I dare say as good as any other freshman-level math class, even though I haven't taken any others. Probably one of the most challenging math classes as well. Requires motivation and interest in math.",
    "This math class goes at a pretty fast pace, covering both a lot of material and teaching you how to write proofs. Be warned however that you will not learn integration techniques\/practice a lot with integration\/differential equations, so this class is not a good substitute for Math 120 or ENAS 194\/156. However, this material may be picked up as needed in other classes such as physics.I have heard from many people that the quality of this class depends on the professor. With Jayadev, who unfortunately is leaving Yale after this year, although the speed of the class was very fast, the material was still accessible with a lot of extra classes.On the whole, for someone who was interested in math, especially competitions like ARML, this was a good experience. However, this class is a lot of work: expect to spend long hours on problem sets. It is also a challenge to get an A in the class, but at least with Jayadev, the tests and grading was very reasonable.",
    "If you want to be a math major this class is a must. If you don't, you will probably die.The psets take a long time, but they are worth the effort. You learn how to write a proof and how to study math effectively; two skills which are necessary for more upper level math.",
    "As far as I know, everyone who stuck with Math 230 got a strong mathematics education. We came out understanding why the core theorems of vector calculus and linear algebra are true, how higher maths are abstracted off of simple principles, and under what conditions we can apply theorems. We also developed a tenacity in pushing through language barriers to understand the ideas behind the symbols \u0096 an intellectual perseverance we can take with us to economics and the sciences as well.Many of the homework problems had an \u0093Aha!\u0094 moment (sometimes only after explanation by the professor, TA, or a fellow student) that justified the hours of frustration you can expect while working on the problem sets, which were much more challenging than what most of us were used to in high school. If you take Math 230, give yourself plenty of time to do the problem sets, so you can do them the right way.Don't believe the horror stories about Math 230, but do treat the class with respect. If you're not sure whether you're willing to put in the effort to stay on top of the material in Math 230, find out: start off with Math 230, and drop to a lower class if necessary.",
    "Math 230 is a challenging but very fulfilling introduction to \"serious\" math. Anyone who is interested in math proofs, and is willing to accept a challenge can benefit tremendously from this course. However, be sure to be ready to put in the effort!",
    "Good class to take if you really like math and are willing to have your schedule rotate around it. Help can be hard to understand at times.",
    "An excellent course that, while a bit abstract, is, in the end, very rewarding. You'll get out of the course what you put into it.",
    "Math 230 is an in-depth exploration of the foundations of multivariable calculus and it delves into the various fields of linear algebra, analysis, and even a little differential geometry and topology using ideas and techniques from each. Be prepared for a lot of work. I would recommend this class to a student who wants to really learn advanced math even at the expense of a great grade.",
    "Yes, it is a hard class but it is VERY rewarding at the end. Definitely take it if next year's professor is as good as Jayadev.",
    "Yes, as long as he\/she's passionate about math.",
    "Math 230 is a lot of work, and very intense. A lot of the time I felt like I was catching up, and I would really understand things after we had already moved on. I would say, take it if you are a genius or if you are not but would sacrifice getting an A for learning a lot and having a great math experience.",
    "Math 230 is an intense but manageable course. I would say that it is worth the extra hour or sometimes more each week trying to really understand the ideas behind the math before you do your homework. Just understanding the recipes will make the tests and especially the homework very hard. It was also a great way to learn how to write good proofs even though the idea of how to write a proof is never really taught it seems like everyone became very good at it by the end of the year. In summary if math excites you take Math 230.",
    "Sure, as long as the student also loves maths and covets for a rigorous, proof-based introduction to advanced maths.",
    "Math 130 is a great course choice for the well-prepared freshman. The pace of the class is good, and the grading is fair. Homeworks are not too easy, not too hard. I recommend it.",
    "If you're a math major or just interested in and good at math, take this course. It's one of the hardest courses you'll take, as it's largely proof-based, but once you've taken it everything else just makes a lot more sense."
