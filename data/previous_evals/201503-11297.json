   "comments": [
    "If it is not required DO NOT take this class. It is a ridiculous amount of reading (~600 pgs\/week) and the simulations are boring, redundant and not useful or practical at all in my opinion.",
    "GLBL 803 rotated between reading secondary sources about major conflicts in Europe in the 20th century and reading primary sources and then simulating the outbreak of those conflicts. If the above issues are addressed (better organizing\/preparing the class, providing student feedback), I would recommend the course to other students. The course has a lot of potential, but fell short this year.",
    "The course is focused on European affairs with very light treatment of anywhere else in the world. If a student has limited time in their schedule, they surely must understand the focus of the course and decided accordingly.",
    "With the tweaks to the course's format as suggested above, I would suggest the course to any student interested in Eastern European history.",
    "If the simulation structure is revised and clarified, I'd definitely suggest the class since the student will both do great readings, take part in the application part and gain hands-on diplomatic experience.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to a fellow student.",
    "GLBL803 is a lot of reading and an interesting class. It will never be a history of post colonial Africa (not that everyone necessarily will understand WHY it cannot be that) but it was showing how history builds on itself.",
    "No, I would not. It lacks a productive structure and the content is a hegemonic account of history told many times before.",
    "GLBL 803 is an introductory course to diplomatic history of the 20th century. Through the use of primary and secondary documents, students are encouraged to observe history from a different angle in order to prepare themselves for biweekly diplomatic simulations. I would recommend this course to anyone interested in understanding diplomatic relations and 20th century European history.",
    "See above - I would not recommend this class to anyone. I'm sure there's better 20th century classes at Yale to take, so this one really is a waste of time and effort.",
    "Yes! knowing history is so important for political relations and policy.",
    "I would recommend it if: you are interested in Europe; you don't care about getting feedback on your work; you don't care about getting face time with the professor; you want to read a lot and then sometimes\/never talk about anything you read.",
    "No. Do not take the course.",
    "I would recommend History of the Present to all able to get in the course. Prof. Snyder is a true master historian and taking a class with him is a treat."

   "question_text": "How did this course deepen your knowledge of your discipline\/profession? To what extent did this course contribute to your dissertation\/research?",
   "comments": [
    "The simulations did not deepen my knowledge or skills in any way. Some of the readings were interesting (Isaiah Berlin, Hannah Arendt) and I enjoyed them and learned something. Very few of the simulation texts however were engaging.",
    "Understanding diplomatic history will be key for students seeking to affect foreign policy. The simulations were an interactive way to learn about how war breaks out, and reading the primary sources to develop our pieces was a great idea, as it made us think in the mindset of people in those professions.",
    "In the area of security affairs, this course certainly broadened my understanding of European affairs. However, I am still focused on Asia-Pacific issues, and in this way some of the material felt orthogonal to my professional goals. The most relevant discussions centered on moral and philosophical questions, but in a seminar with over 30 students, the format of the course did not lend itself to robust treatment of these issues.",
    "It definitely helped me in applying academic material into real-life negotiation. I got a sense of how negotiations are run in the real life.",
    "The final simulation where we watched diplomats and experts negotiate was interesting and applicable to my career. The rest of the course does not prepare me for my discipline or knowledge as it focuses on a specific segment of the world and glorifies empires while ignoring the majority of the globe and the impact of Europe on them.",
    "It did not help - see other answers.",
    "knowing history is so important for political relations and policy.",
    "This course helped me to practice looking through primary sources for pieces of historical information, and applying historical context to a current situation. However, the subject matter was not very relevant to what I am interested in.",
    "Not sure that this will really help with my future other than it fulfills a requirement so that I can get my degree. Tough for someone with a non-Europe focus to get through this after the first three weeks.",
    "As Global Affairs students, this class deepened my understanding of historical events to a new level beyond what undergraduate and high school classes covered. By looking at these scenarios again, attention to detail brought about a new way of how these challenges were negotiated and how actors continue to cope with an imperfect world."
