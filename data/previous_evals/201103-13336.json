   "comments": [
    "Solid course to start off. I would recommend it.",
    "Yes, it helps if you are not familiar with college writing [which not many students are]. If you choose an interesting topic, this class should be fun!",
    "I would recommend this course. It is not super stressful and allows you to get better at writing while also exploring a really cool topic.",
    "This is a must take course, regardless of the major one plans to take. I highly recommend this course to anyone.",
    "English 114 on Rethinking Identity is such an interesting class. The discussions, and the topics that you examine in order to write papers and intellectually discuss identity are so amazing.",
    "This course definitely improved my writing skills. You get to hear lots of feedback on your writing from the professor and the students. The research paper was especially enjoyable - you can choose whatever identity related topic you like. It also gave me a great sense of how to write a strong and concise research paper.The workload is not too heavy. But the more you put in, the more you get out of it.",
    "I would recommend any English 114 to incoming freshman because it's a great way to transition into college level academic writing. I like my class in particular because of the topic and discussion.",
    "Writing four papers with different weight. It's not too difficult, so it's a good way for people like me (not that good of a writer) to begin learning how to write for real.",
    "If you don't care to improve your writing much but just want to get English out of the way without having to write long papers, take this course. If, however, you care at all about bettering your writing abilities and experiencing any personal growth, think again and maybe go for 120. I regret not doing so.",
    "English 114 is a great way to improve college writing skills. I would recommend this course to any college student who wants more confidence in their writing."
