    "This class was great for reviewing the topics learned in L2 and expanding upon them. Take it with Mercedes Carreras if you can, she is an ANGEL and without her my spanish would not be where it is now.",
    "Spanish grammar, speaking, listening, cultural skills",
    "improved reading and speaking skills, increased gammas and vocabulary",
    "Grammar and verb tenses through the imperfect subjunctive and six units of relevant vocabulary. Developed reading, listening, and speaking skills through biweekly readings, videos, and dialogue activities.",
    "My ability to understand Spanish was dramatically increased in this class.",
    "I developed fluency in listening, reading, and writing skills in Spanish over the course of this class, although my speaking abilities progressed very little. However, I can now almost fluently understand spoken and written Spanish, and when writing I can comfortably use almost any tense or grammatical structure.",
    "It was a good course in learning a lot of Spanish grammar and vocabulary",
    "My speaking skills improved tremendously. I found that listening to the teacher speak was very helpful in improving my speaking skills, particularly when it came to conjugating verbs."

   "comments": [
    "The supersite was great for reviewing grammar, but the literature was a little to advanced for the class to be effective, in my opinion. Without our professor the class would have never been able to comprehend them.",
    "Very fast pace and not enough time for individual grammar topic reviews",
    "very good course, lots of work to help improve skills.",
    "Strengths: tests are fair, vocabulary and grammar exercises easy to follow\/understand from the textbook, manageable workload. Weaknesses: sometimes assignments unclear.",
    "Overall, this is an excellent course. The only weaknesses were that there is practically no speaking practice at all, and the readings are very advanced and at times confusing.",
    "It was a good course in learning a lot of Spanish grammar and vocabulary. It can be improved if they incorporate more speaking into the course.",
    "My strengths in the course included speaking and contributing in class. I have room for improvement in my test taking skills and writing skills. The written responses helped me improve both areas throughout the course."

   "comments": [
    "Definitely less stressful than L2.",
    "Mercedes Carreras is amazing",
    "Would recommend to complete language reqs",
    "Yes, would recommend. Reasonable workload, sticks to textbook so tests are fair and not difficult to study for. Carreras is a great teacher who really cares that students are engaged and truly learning the material. Also fulfills part of language requirement.",
    "If you are doing this for a language requirement, I find Spanish to be a useful language to learn.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone who's going through the Spanish track on the way to fluency. Of course it is required, but it is nonetheless a good gradually paced review of L2 and preview of L4, in that you continuously develop vocabulary while reviewing and practicing grammar that was mostly laid down in L2. Overall, a pretty easy class with minimal homework, and depending on your teacher (I had Carreras), very easy grading.",
    "Yes",
    "I would recommend this course to another student. Though much of the material was review, it was reviewed in a way that was straightforward and conducive to retention."
