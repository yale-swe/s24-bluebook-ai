    "I learned many interesting topics about business and microeconomics. I have applied my knowledge from intermediate microeconomics to this class.",
    "Optimization and derivation skills for different math \/ economic equations",
    "This course is a more in depth look at intermediate microeconomics and industrial planning. We used calculus and theoretica; economic models to describe business decisions.",
    "Great course in industrial organization. If you feel confident with your algebra skills and rememember your intermediate course, it's easy. It's mostly optimization models for maximizing profit of every market structure.",
    "goes deeper into the material you cover in intermediate micro, good class for people interested in microeconomics",
    "I learned so much about industrial organization and business strategy and how to optimize just about any situation you encounter. Very useful and relevant skills for understanding the business world and industry decisions.",
    "I learned a lot about company's decisions and how the market responds to those decisions.",
    "The course teaches you the tools (models) to analyze the interplay between firms and consumers, firms and firms and the markets they function in. There is some simple game theory involved and many real life examples of how firms actually work.",
    "Strong understanding of market dynamics.",
    "This course helped me work with real world examples of microeconomic topics such as market concentration, game theory models, antitrust examples, etc.",
    "This course taught me to apply concepts from Microeconomics in new and interesting ways. I got a refresher in all of the concepts from intermediate microeconomics that I forgot and learned new topics within the same area of study. I also learned a lot about firms now and how the economic concepts we learned effect their decision making."

   "comments": [
    "Best econ class I have ever taken at Yale. The class structure is super organized and the professor is the best.",
    "The teaching style was phenomenal. Professor Chalioti was dedicated to teaching us the material in a highly productive and interactive manner. She was slow and methodical with her lectures and made sure every student left the class feeling successful and smarter.",
    "I wish there was more support outside of the teacher. There were few office hours and the TA wasn't very helpful. Also the class had limited study resources beyond the textbook, which often wasn't very relevant.",
    "Excelent course. The professor is always clear and explains every topic carefully.",
    "This course was incredibly well taught, with a great balance of theory and real world examples.",
    "The Professor explained the concepts very clearly, and workload was acceptable. The atmosphere of the class was always nice, learned a lot.",
    "I would have gotten more out of the presentations if we had adequate time for them but I understand the time crunch. The midterm was a bit long for the time but that was part of the test. Other than that, I really enjoyed the course and got a lot out of it.",
    "Prof. Chalioti is an excellent professor who really cares about the course and her students. The material is challenging, but interesting. I thought the first few problem sets were very difficult since we did not do problems as challenging as them during lecture. Because of this, I think the class could benefit from a regular discussion section.The material was very interesting and Prof. Chalioti put in a lot of effort to make the lectures engaging.",
    "The clarity of all of the material studied is something that has not been in many economics courses I have taken. Much of this is thanks to Prof. Chalioti's engagement and superb teaching. I think the only weakness is that there is a lot of menial arithmetic which could to some extent be substituted by more general concepts.",
    "Interesting material. Course could have moved faster at times",
    "This course really helped take my microeconomic skills to the next level. It pushed my mathematics skills, which allowed me to solve more difficult and realistic scenarios. The professor did a great job of giving us a basic approach to apply to a given problem. The problem sets really challenged my quantitative skills and made me understand the economic idea behind the formula I was using. Overall, I think the way the course operated was very ideal. The professor did a great job preparing us!",
    "The strengths of this course would have to be the interesting course material and the application of the concepts we learn to the real world. The biggest weakness for me was the easiness of the course. Often I felt there was a lot of hand holding through all of the algebra that was unnecessary."

   "comments": [
    "YES! Definitely take this class with Professor Chalioti: she is the best Econ professor I have had at Yale. You can also learn many interesting topics about microeconomics in real life. If you are interested in business consulting or business in general, this is the best choice for an econ senior seminar.",
    "YES!",
    "I absolutely would recommend this course, especially if you enjoy calculus and its real-world applications. This is, by far, the best economics course I have taken at Yale. Professor Chalioti is a skilled professor as well as kind person. It is well worth the time you put in to understand the material and models.",
    "Great class. If you like micro and you find it easy, go for it. The professor is super nice and gives a great class. It's a small senior lecture so if you can make it in it's absolutely worth it. There are psets every week, but not extra demanding.",
    "Yes. This was a fantastic advanced econ class. If it is taught by Professor Chalioti again, I would strongly recommend taking it. She teaches the material in a great way (combining examples with theory), and assigns clear, challenging problem sets which translate well onto the tests. 100% take it.",
    "Eva Chalioti is the best professor out there for microeconomic related topics. Hands down.",
    "The first few problem sets were difficult, but they got easier. Not a ton of work overall in the class, and the exams were fair.",
    "Absolutely. Phenomenal course. Well structured, compassionate and confident teaching. Good support\/overview.",
    "Yes, enjoyed the class and professor is very clear",
    "TAKE IT.",
    "i absolutely would recommend. The skills you gain and understanding of industrial organization and business decisions are invaluable--not just for the study economics, but for understanding the world of consumerism that exists around us.",
    "Definitely take this class! The case studies and material was very interesting.",
    "YES! If you like microeconomics and think learning about interactions of firms, consumers and markets then take this course!",
    "Yes",
    "I would recommend this course to any economics major who is particularly drawn to the microeconomic side of things. This class is essentially an advance level of microeconomics. The first half of the course involves lots of math (mostly heavy algebra -- like taking the derivative of something more complex and being savvy to simplify things to make the problem easier). I think the second half of the course is a little less quantitatively challenge and more conceptually driven (game theory stuff, case presentations). I really enjoyed this course, and I feel like it really provided me with a stronger foundation of microeconomics that will be handy in the future.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone interested in economics in a more applied setting."
