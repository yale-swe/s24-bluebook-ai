    "I would recommend this class to anyone - whether or not you're a science major, the things arthropods have evolvedare unique and extreme enough that they will interest you even while being informative as to evolution. You will definitely have to learn the material, and three tests plus a paper is rough, but if you're willing to man up and work through it the reward is so much greater than a lot of other science classes you could take.",
    "Biology of Terrestrial Arthropods, called BUGS! in Yale shorthand,is simply the best way to fill that godawful Sc credit. Each day, you learn approximately 20 amazing things BUGS! can do. Bombardier beetles, when distressed, spray a boiling hot compound to fry their prey alive. Some spiders catch their prey by plucking them out of the air with a bolas. Bees can induce fever in themselves, surround a wasp and fry it to death. In short, BUGS! are incredible.There is no molecular biology and Professor Wells provides amply background, so fear not if you're more familiar with Milton than cladistics. What is more, David Attenborough makes frequent appearances via his seminal documentary series Life in the Undergrowth, which is dedicated entirely to BUGS!. Professor Wells is funny, and she structures the class flawlessly, ending with a terrifying lecture about parasitoids. You will love her, and love BUGS!.So put down that astronomy textbook, walk to the bottom of science hill, and learn about amazing BUGS!.",
    "I would recommend it because I learned so much from the course, but I personally thought it was a difficult course and if I could take it again I may have taken it Cr\/D (I'm not a Bio\/E&EB major and was just taking it for fun)",
    "It's a good class to cover requirements for EEB",
    "This class exposes you to a world that 1) you've probably never really thought about before 2) is just about the craziest set of organisms ever and 3) gives you a whole new perspective on life on earth. The professor is amazing. I cannot tell you how much you should take this class.",
    "This is an overview course on the anatomy, physiology, and behavior of terrestrial arthropods (including insects, spiders, and other creepy-crawlers). It is a fun and interesting introduction to the most prevalent animal kingdom on Earth. Marta Wells is fun, interesting, and brilliant, and it is accessible for a non-bio major who has interest in the subject matter. The videos she showed during lectures are really amazing, and they break up what can become a lot of dry information. This class moves quickly, and you need to keep up to do well! Take it!",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS. it is hands down one of the best classes I have taken so far. Marta is an amazing lecturer, so enthusiastic and funny and knowledgeable. I enjoyed each class so much and furthermore continue to be fascinated by the subject. The videos are great, Marta is amazing, David Attenborough rule, BUGS are incredible. the workload is perfectly manageable - the test are a bit on the heavy side but if you are even slightly into the material they are not a huge deal. you will never look at spiders the same way.",
    "This class was a great overview of insects and other terrestrial arthropods. It was one of the best classes I have taken at Yale. Marta's enthusiasm is contagious. Take this class! You learn so much and you gain a new perspective on the complexity of the world around you.",
    "Yes, definitely. Take it if you want to learn something completely unusual.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS. I am a Humanities major, who was just looking to cross off her science requirement in a senior year scramble; this class bowled me over. It made me wish I could start over in biology. I had no idea how awesome bugs were. They are awesome. Mostly take it because of MARTA, who is the most fun prof I've had here. Her liveliness and excitement is contagious. Class is very relaxed. Lots of great video clips. Tests pretty fair; one research paper which was actually a cool chance to read some scientific papers and become a niche expert. And: TAKE THE LAB. I MEANT IT. The lab for this class was extraordinarily cool; I signed up for it on a bold and brash whim and it completely solidified and gratified my interest in the class. You get your own butterfly net and \"kill jars\". You get out of town and go on field trips. You make your own, beautiful insect collection in a big glass box. Crazy? Yes. Bizarrely fabulous? Yes.",
    "It was a lot of fun and very manageable as a course. There is a lot of reading and it makes sense to keep up with otherwise it will pile up before tests, but otherwise it's very doable and even if bugs aren't really your thing, Professor Wells makes them very entertaining"
