   "comments": [
    "Great instructor who is dedicated and always available for private appointments. The course is extremely thought-provoking and always stimulate interesting debates in class. The course will make you see other people and fellow Yale students from different perspective and background.",
    "I would definitely recommend English 114 19 for any students who want to improve writing. The professor does a great job to help students the way they think and write.",
    "I would definitely recommend this section of ENGL 114. Though some of the readings are longer and denser than others, they are always interesting, and make for very engaging class discussions. The course looks at \"belief\" very generally, and so discussion topics include not only actual theistic religion and atheism, but even beliefs that have nothing at all to do with religion (e.g. the beliefs and motivations behind social movements). While student workshops inspire you to look at your writing in new ways, the class discussions inspire you to look at the world in new ways. Regardless of what you might believe in, there is something for everyone in this class.",
    "It is a great course if you are willing to participate and do a lot of reading. You will really become a better writer though.",
    "I would definitely recommend it.",
    "Definitely take this class. It's a great class environment with interesting coursework and a great professor.",
    "This class helps you get used to writing college essays, providing a smoother transition. For me, who does not really enjoy writing, I found this class really interesting and I wanted to write the essays because the topics I was writing about sparked my interest.I would definitely recommend english 114 to another student, given that the topic of their section is of any interest. This class really helped me understand what critical analysis looked like.",
    "English 114 is a discussion based class that focuses on reading short articles and excerpts and constructing arguments based off of analysis. It is a writing class, but there are only four papers in the semester and you are given plenty of time to complete all of them. It is meant to be and is an introductory writing class and it is good for people who need one of those.",
    "This is a very enjoyable class for anyone with an interest in religion or science. I would definitely recommend it to anyone considering it; the professor was phenomenal and the readings, though sometimes long, were always relevant and almost always very interesting. In this class, you learn a lot about different religions and writings from a scholarly, critical perspective. The in-class discussions were wonderfully thought-provoking and the writing techniques we learned were extremely helpful. I feel much more confident in my ability to write an argumentative paper in the style Yale requires.",
    "I would recommend this class if you want to improve your writing and become more confident in writing different types of paper. The readings were interesting and class discussions engaging. I feel that my writing improved a lot as a result of this class and I now feel ready to take more advanced writing courses.",
    "I would recommend this course only if you need help writing academic papers. It is very useful if that is the case since it forces you to write a lot and spend time evaluating every essay to figure out its strengths and weaknesses."
