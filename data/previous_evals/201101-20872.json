    "a good foundations in development course--will give you an idea of all of the key contemporary development issues related to economic growth.I would definitely recommend it.",
    "It was a fun class and I learned a lot. For that reason I'd recommend it. That said, it's very time-consuming and at time feels like you're doing busy work. For that reason I would say be aware of the time you're going to have to put into the class. That might be reason not to take it.",
    "Absolutely. The material is integral for an IR student and diverse enough to hold your interest.",
    "This course would be a valuable asset for those who would like to focus more on development and growth issues thanks to its coverage of diverse and current literature on these subjects.",
    "Its quite a good course if one wishes to study economics from a more qualitative perspective.",
    "A broad survey class which is good for students without a background in development economics. For those that do, I would recommend a more advanced course.",
    "Excellent class for the IR programme students",
    "If the class is populated by great students that like to discuss ideas then it will be a good class."

   "comments": [
    "The materials covered in this course are directly linked to my own professional and personal interests and thus it was very helpful in that it strengthened by grasp of the field and the relevant issues\/authors\/academics.",
    "Should be called \"development economics\" rather than \"international economics\"",
    "This definitely deepened my knowledge of development economics. Anyone interested in the subject, whether or not it's your area of focus, should consider taking the class. And because you get to study your own chosen countries it will definitely help in understanding the region of the world you're interested in.",
    "The course and readings helped me to understand better the current discussions in the field of international economics.",
    "Broadened my exposure to the various theories on development. Little influence on my research, but will be useful in future employment.",
    "Very good course, i learned a lot and feel curious and encouraged to learn even more",
    "I learned a lot about development and growth in the countries that I focused on."
