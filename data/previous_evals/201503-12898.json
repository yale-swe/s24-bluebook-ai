   "comments": [
    "Stop what you're doing and take this class. While my friends were suffering in their research methods classes, I had the pleasure of taking my favorite class of the semester.",
    "Yes. Very useful.",
    "Wonderful class! The material itself is not particularly interesting - mostly memorizing terminology and understanding how to apply it in evaluating studies - but Professor Kazdin is one of the best professors I have had at Yale. Take a class with him if you have the chance!!",
    "You will not learn much and there's a lot of memorizing unclear concepts or obscure facts. Also the grading structure of the class is not forgiving.",
    "Psych 250 gives you a new perspective on all research studies. During class you talk through what to look for when reading studies. Homework is just reading from the textbook that isnt essential to understand discussion. There were two 10-15 page essays but topics were manageable. Tests were very fair. Overall excellent class taught by an amazing professor.",
    "Research Methods and Clinical Psychology was a good course to satisfy the research methods requirement for Psychology majors. Although all the material on methodology tends to be very dry, Dr. Kazdin made our classes entertaining with his great sense of humor and frequently engaged the class on critical issues within the realm of research. Strengths of the course: Dr. Kazdin explains the material extremely well, students had frequent opportunities to discuss research issues during class, the textbook was extremely helpful, Dr. Kazdin made sure to emphasize ethical issues of research, distributions of assignments and exams was manageable and fair, Dr. Kazdin is caring and approachable professor. I would say the only weakness of this course is that we did not get to design our own studies, like the other research methods classes. Also, the grading tends to be a bit strict. I would definitely recommend this class.",
    "PSYCH 250 is one of my favorite classes I've taken at Yale. I looked forward to going to class every day because Kazdin is just a really interesting, dynamic material and really brought the concepts to life. More practically, this class also helped me to learn many concepts about research in general that helped me in my other psych courses.",
    "Overall, this was an excellent course. Professor Kazdin made the material interesting and relevant, and I always enjoyed going to lecture. The material itself could be dry at times, but he helped to make it as accessible as possible. I would highly recommend this course.",
    "I would certainly recommend this course to any Psychology major looking to fulfill the research methods requirement of the major. The professor has a sense of humor and is dedicated to his students and their learning. No statistical background is necessary for this course, though a little knowledge of statistics wouldn't hurt. Classes are lecture-style, but with plenty of opportunities for questions and class discussion. Assessments include 2 papers and 2 exams, as well as a participation grade and optional reading responses.",
    "Psyc 250 is a good research methods course to take. If you are a psych major who needs to take a research methods course, this is a good one to take because the professor is engaging and a great lecturer. He makes the material and the class interesting.",
    "A great instructor for a boring course. Kazdin keeps it light, the grading is very fair, but not lenient. You earn what you put into it. No tricks, all straight forward. Do the readings and you'll be fine.",
    "Since you have to take Research Methods, take it with Kazdin! He's really funny and keeps you interested during lecture. He also encourages active discussion and has very engaging stories to tell. Also, there's no weekly work.",
    "GREAT intro to research methods, by far more interesting than the other research methods class I've heard about.",
    "I recommend PSYC 250 because it's an awesome course and in my opinion the best way to fulfill your research methods requirement for the PSYC major. Kazdin is truly a gem, and you won't regret taking the course with him. Just do your best, and Kazdin will see that and everything will work out fine. The workload is manageable and the exams\/papers are fair. Just do your best and everything will work out!",
    "Yes, I would recommend. If you have to take a research methods class, i would definitely recommend this one. Kazdin is an awesome teacher and makes fairly dry material interesting due to his engaging and witty teaching style. And the material covered also definitely information that anyone interested in psychology research needs to kno.",
    "I only took this class originally to fulfill a requirement for psych and I ended up loving it. Kazdin is the most incredible professor and if you get to be in class with him consider yourself lucky. He's hysterical and cracks jokes every 5 minutes, he's beyond knowledgable about the subjects, and most importantly, he cares an incredible amount about his students. Kazdin makes sure you learn for the sake of learning and understanding, not just memorizing. If you're looking at this class, let's be honest, you're a psych student and you need a methodology credit. Make this class that credit. It's interesting, incredibly applicable to psychology, and Kazdin is nothing short of awesome. Seriously, take this. You won't regret it."
