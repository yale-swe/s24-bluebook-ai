   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this course with more structure to it and perhaps less work. Over the course of the semester we were asked to do tons of readings with quizzes and a midterm in addition two separate research projects. However, the readings did slow down in the second half of the semester when we began to work on our projects. Sociolinguistics is fascinating and I think this course has potential but right now I would not recommend it to another student.",
    "Take Sociolinguistics; important topic not just for linguistics majors but for everyone",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class if it was being taught again. It was a great experience, I learned a lot.",
    "Good, if a bit dry at points. Very heavy on the socio- and not so much on the -linguistics. Should probably have been classed as a Writing credit, considering that the final paper required more pages than the writing courses I've taken here.",
    "Excellent holistic overview of Sociolinguistics, with a focus on Africa."
