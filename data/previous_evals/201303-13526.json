    "Question 6: The optional field trip at the end of the course was extremely valuable, and I hope that there will be more opportunities like this (as well as for having guest speakers) if this course is expanded to run during the entire semester.",
    "7) The field trip was a great learning experience!8) The class was much more technical\/practice-based than conceptual.",
    "Question 4& 11 go together for me. The pace was fast because there is so much information to cover in a short period of time. Because of this it was mainly lecture and no discussion. When discussions began the instruction allowed them to continue, which was great! The three-hour lecture length was perfect! The course would feel rushed if it was any shorter or split between two meetings\/week. The course could be expanded and slowed down, but would have to span more than 6 weeks. There is much more left to explore both in class and in student projects.Question 10: The instructor was incredibly knowledgeable; he talked about the information naturally and knowledgeably. He was realistic about the positives, negatives, potential for success, and time frame of successQuestion 12: The instructor was encouraging about how we as students\/the future leaders have the potential to really get in to this field and make a huge impact for the world!",
    "Professor speaks entirely too much about his personal beliefs and opinions, with little connection to the subject matter at hand, pontificates instead of teaching. Someone higher up in the administration should really sit in his class and watch him teac.",
    "This class was a great introduction to the many aspects of agroforestry. The pace was a bit fast becausethere was so much information to fit into a one-credit class that only lasted half a semester.",
    "An amazing class!!!! Not only was it practical, but it helped me to think about my future research. I would take this again!"

    "Field trip was a definite highlight,but I very much enjoyed the course content and professor's teaching style",
    "The readings were interesting and targeted, and supported the lectures well. I especially enjoyed the freedom in choosing a topic of interest for the final assignment, and the instructor was extremely helpful in providing feedback during the brainstorming process. The field trip at the end of the course was one of the highlights of the course.",
    "The field trip. The instructor's enthusiasm and working knowledge of the field.",
    "The three-hour lecture length was perfect! The course would feel rushed if it was any shorter or split between two meetings\/week.The field trip was wonderful and very hands on for something you do not get to experience very regularly.",
    "Field trip was really useful and well organized. Also, the class dealt with interesting concepts with lots of detail oriented explanation. It was easy to follow the class because lots of things were coming from the professor's experience.",
    "Practice relevant",
    "Eric was a fantastic teacher. His knowledge and incredible enthusiasm made the course educational and inspiring. The field trip organized for the end of the class was a great experience. We got to see some of the things we had been talking about in person and learn much more than we ever could from lectures by seeing how it is done in practice. Eric was very receptive to student feedback and always able to answer questions. One of the best aspects of the course was the final paper and presentation. I designed a model agroforestry operation for my family's farm, allowing me to explore a topic I was personally very interested in with Eric's feedback and advice. Although the class was a bit lengthy at three hours, it always felt fast-paced and Eric kept it interesting. He is a great lecturer with a passion that is catching. This course would be great expanded into a semester-long class with time to develop a more detailed final project.",
    "The instructor's enthusiasm for the subject and first-hand experience. The field trips, which included hands-on interaction (and tasting) with an edible garden, were worth signing up for alone.",
    "Subject matter",
    "This course was so amazing! Such a great addition to FES, and loved the broad range of agroforestry concepts covered, from tropical to temperate. Great survey course. Hope it will be extended next year.Classmates and their final presentations were fascinating.",
    "The teacher is obviously an expert on this subject. He is an excellent, engaging lecturer. I found his many suggestions as to possible careers\/research topics to be inspiring.",
    "The instructor was fantastic. For a 3 hour class, it was extremely engaging. I really enjoyed his perspective and it made me think about sustainability in a different way."

   "comments": [
    "More applied information would have been helpful",
    "It was great to have a practitioner and author provide first-hand experience as a lecturer in this course. I think that the lecture sessions could be improved if they were opened up to more discussion and interaction between students when a question was raised by a classmate. The instructor for this course has a lot of experience leading workshops where he is expected to provide an answer to all of the questions, but I felt that the discussion in class could have been stronger if he had opened up the conversation to more student perspectives.",
    "A 3-hour evening time slot is not ideal, though I understand it also depends on instructor availability.",
    "The student presentations were an excellent way to get us exploring, but it made for a very long class to hear from everyone in one sitting.I wished there had more discussion about the readings, but the short 6-week length of the class put the focus on lecture material over deeper exploration.",
    "It might be better to be offered in a longer period time for 3 credits since there are lots of things that the class can deal with. Also, the class time was not best. Concentrating on class materials at 6PM in the afternoon was not easy.",
    "The professor needs to tie his theories with practical applications. Very pie in the sky, the readings had little connection to the lectures and were not discussed in the least",
    "The only comment on this is the short length of the course - Eric had so much information and we could have learned a lot more if we had an entire semester.",
    "The instructor included some of the environmental benefits (particularly carbon sequestration) of the agroforestry practices surveyed. Given the audience (which includes many students active in carbon science and addressing the challenge of greenhouse gases), the discussion on the impacts of higher greenhouse gases could have been reduced to a slide or two, with remaining time used for more exploration of specific agroforestry concepts.",
    "As a single-credit course, there wasn't ample opportunity to explore material in depth.",
    "Would love to have more field trips and a more practical side. Eric mentioned that he teaches a practical course that is full time for about a week or 9 hours, and I would love for that material to be combined into a full semester course along with the previous material. Just because we are in an academic setting doesn't mean we are not willing to get our hands dirty!",
    "The surveys of useful plants were exhaustive in relation to the conceptual content covered. While interesting, I'm not sure if many people got a whole lot from them, other than the idea that there are many useful plants out there. With such limited time as a 1 credit course has, maybe less time going over lists of plants is better.The part of this course that needs most improvement is teacher feedback. I submitted a final project and, as of yet, have received no feedback on it. If we don't receive feedback from work we do in school a large part of our learning potential is wasted.",

    "I am studying working lands management and agriculture.",

    "I am studying environmental management with a focus on land use and agriculture so this course was an excellent addition to my program of study. It expanded my knowledge on an emerging, and important, field. As Eric pointed out to us, agroforestry is not just a topic related to agriculture - it combines aspects of business, engineering, energy use, climate change, and forestry together. I believe this would be a great course for anyone who wants to think about where and how we will use land to get our resources in the future.",
    "It is a perfect supplement to traditional forestry courses. Agroforestry is sorely needed in the school curriculum as it is a necessary tool to improve land use and make it more intelligent than just forestry or agriculture alone.",
    "Came back to this masters program very interested in tropical agroforestry. Hope FES will bring in more courses like this in the future.",
    "As someone who has done some agroforestry work before this course is a great, more formal introduction to the field. It serves well as a brief introduction; I would love for it to be followed by many more courses of greater depth on this topic."

    "No.",

    "The course was very good at describing basic concepts and introducing us to the potential of many plants around the world. What I felt was lacking and could be included in a full-semester course, potentially co-taught, was discussion ofresearch in the field and practical, commercial application of agroforestry concepts. This could include work as is published by members of the Association for Temperate Agroforestry or the University of Missouri Agroforestry center.",
