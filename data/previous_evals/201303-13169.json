   "comments": [
    "It is a great course. As someone who knew next to nothing about Syriac Christianity it has been a great introduction, and I couldn't recommend it more. The course enables you to learn a great deal about Syriac Christianity and its theological developments.",
    "I would say it's a course about the development of Christianity on the eastern fringe of (and at times, outside) the Roman Empire. It addresses individual persons important to the time and place, controversial Christological issues within the Church, Muslim-Christian-Jewish interactions, and the history of scholarship. I would recommend the course to someone interested in the origins of Christianity in the eastern part of the Roman Empire, but perhaps not to someone interested in the history Muslim-Christian interactions (as we only discussed that in the last two weeks on class).",
    "Yes I would recommend it for another student",
    "This is the one introductory course in which you will never feel like you could have gotten the same thing from reading a Wikipedia page. It is the perfect balance between primary and secondary readings, discussion, critical thinking, mini-lecture, and introduction to bibliographic tools. Even people who do not know Syriac or any Semitic language would benefit from this course.",
    "Yes. This subject is usually not covered in other classes, but it is very important."

   "comments": [
    "It really opened my eyes to the amount of scholarship that still needs to be done within Syriac studies compared to related fields. The course has allowed me to have a much fuller understanding of Christology after the Council of Chalcedon, and as someone who is interested in the Early Church this has been extremely helpful.",
    "I knew nothing about Syriac Christianity before the class began. Now, however, I'm finding myself wishing I knew Syriac so that I could work with the primary literature rather than rely on the sparse number of English translations.",
    "A deepen my knowledge of Syriac Christianity in all respects."
