    "Every course is a lecture led by a couple of students who mastered this weeks materials and guided by Prof. Schafe.I would definitely recommend the course.",
    "I would recommend it! It is really interesting and information",
    "Yes! You will learn a lot about the various subtopics within the neurobiology of emotion, how to critique a paper's methods, how to present a paper clearly, etc. The work isn't easy, but the expectations are clear and Professor Schafe is a fair grader.",
    "Yes, good class and interesting topic.",
    "Students teach the class in weekly presentations so class could be informative and lively depending the presenters.",
    "Decent seminar, students present a couple papers each week meaning you only have to present once during the semester. Some of the material is pretty interesting, some is pretty dull. You really dont need too much previous knowledge of neurobiology, everything on the tests is taken directly from the papers studied in class.",
    "Neurobio of emotion is an interesting, worthwhile, and not very difficult class. The papers we read each work are definitely at a reasonable level and are interesting. Be prepared for some boring classes, though."
