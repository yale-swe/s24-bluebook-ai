    "I'm doing it all year, so I haven't had the true senior essay experience, but I've loved it so far. I've gotten to do deep research into something I'm interested in and like my advisor.",
    "I would definitely recommend it to any Economics or Econ and Math Major.",
    "I agree with Professor Brown's opinion that all econ and majors with econ in their name should do a senior essay.",
    "Doing the senior essay is a great experience, it really is a capstone project where you end up drawing on your work from all four years. You should do it.",
    "I personally feel that the senior thesis is key to proving you've actually learned something after 4 years at Yale. It's not required, but you can earn distinction in the major if you take it, which is why I'm doing it. I think everyone should give this a try. After studying econ for 4 years, I'd like to be able to do some real economics and I think this paper is the best way to do that.",
    "Good times. I really wish I had the chance to conduct my own research before my senior year. Even though my findings failed to support my thesis, I learned a lot putting the project together. Furthermore, it was a full credit with about half the work load of a normal seminar.",
    "Econ 491 is the first semester of a two-semester senior thesis. I met once per week with my adviser and then at the end of the term you need to submit a \"progress report.\" My thesis is pretty complicated, so I have spent a lot of time collecting data; however, the course can be tailored to fit the student's needs."
