    "I absolutely recommend this course. One of the best seminars I've taken. The readings are interesting, the discussions are great, and you learn a ton. The papers are pretty standard, and can be fun if you're into them. I didn't think I was that interested in studying colonialism, but I was totally drawn in by the readings, so writing the paper was easy! The readings aren't small every week, but it's totally worth it to do all of them, and the responses aren't that difficult."
