   "comments": [
    "THis class is intense. I don't care how organized and studious you are, the likelihood of you taking this class w\/o falling behind or feeling frazzled at the cusp of every deadline is slim to none. I truly only recommend taking this class if you absolutely, positively have to (and I guess if you're passionate about P-Chem as well). It is challenging. The people who quiver in fear at the sound of the name \"P-CHem Lab\" are not exaggerating.",
    "You probably have to take this class. You've probably read about a hundred of these evaluations, which all seem to say that this class is awful and a ton of work. While the class isn't as bad as I feel these evaluations made it out to be, it was still too much work, overly difficult, and a constant source of stress. The only advice you need is to stay ahead: start lab reports early, ask lots of questions, and don't let yourself fall behind. It'll be OK.",
    "Only take it if you have to.",
    "If you don't have to take this course, don't take it. If you have to, just get it over with while taking as few other courses as possible. The class requires 6 lab reports, which each take anywhere from 10-30 hours. You have to be in lab once a week for 4 hours with a 50 minute lecture on Friday afternoons. You learn a lot, and it complements the physical chemistry lecture, but it's a lot of time.",
    "Don't take it unless you must. I was too afraid to ask TAs or Vaccaro for help, but if you're brave, I highly recommend doing that.",
    "I mean....would I recommend a thousand tricep pushups to get better triceps? Yes, but probably not all at once. That's how I feel about this class...the work is valuable, the body of knowledge you leave with is pretty sizable, and no aspect of the class is busy work...but it's a lot (too much, some might say). I can't imagine taking this class with a difficult course load (I took it in conjunction with a fairly light course load), and would not recommend it to someone trying to take other difficult courses simultaneously. I think it's rare for someone to take this class if it isn't required in their major, so I doubt anyone will be asking me, but I think it is a very strong course with an enormous workload and would recommend it with that understanding.",
    "Definitely think about your overall course load when you're taking this course because it can really take over and take away from other classes. It requires a LOT of time when labs are due and results in a lot of sleep deprivation.",
    "don't take this class unless you have to. There really is no other point. No, its not cool to have it as a \"challenge\" course. Go learn something else or watch youtube videos or something. If you're considering this class, it should be out of necessity. like actually. help me help you. If you do have to take it, i'd describe this as a really tough course because of the immense workload and the elevated anxiety levels. Definitely start early on the lab reports (at least 3 days in advance), because they'll be painful either way, but there is just not enough time in 2 days to finish an entire report, especially labs 5 and 6.",
    "Oh my god I've been waiting to write this review all semester. To be honest, you can't really prepare yourself for the amount of work required for this course. And thats just doing enough to pass-- in order to do well grade wise, you need to somehow predict what Vaccaro wants but didn't ask for. We had two lab reports due between the last day of classes and the end of reading period (for which I wrote 100+ pages of report) and then had a KILLER final at 9am on the first day of finals. y i k e s! That being said, you'll survive (or quit the chem major, but you can survive!) and learn a TON of stuff along the way. You end the semester feeling absolutely defeated but at the same time feeling like you can do anything. You also get make friends with your major class, which is nice. Absolutely don't consider taking this course if it is not absolutely required of you unless you are a masochist.",
    "An entirely adequate class. Material- A fair grounding in some fundamental thermodynamics, NMR, and electronics. I think there are various aspects of this class that make it worth taking for someone interested in chemistry, but, I will be honest, it was not a class that I was jumping up and down excited about taking and it still is not. If I knew what I know now going into choosing courses for this semester, I still would have included it. Grades- Grading is quite slow and lags greatly behind assignments making it hard to adapt and improve. Furthermore, grading is so TF dependent that it almost does not matter anyway. Overall, I think the final was fair and that if you do not sweat the small stuff, you will still probably do well in the class after the curve (I have to see however so this is an informed guess). Professor- lectures extremely clear and well planned, only a tad bit slow, good notional and theoretical understanding as a motivation behind all content. Probably the best aspect of this class.",
    "You are likely taking chem 330L because it's required for your major. It's a good lab, and you learn a lot, but it's a LOT of work. The lab sessions themselves aren't too bad--they sometimes run long though--but it's the lab reports that take up all of your time. Don't leave them for the last minute!",
    "Professor Vaccaro prepares incredibly detailed experimental plans with an appropriate amount of background and thorough procedures. His lectures are planned to the smallest detail and are abundantly clear. The class is, as everyone knows, an enormous amount of work at times, but you do learn the rhythm of lab reports by the end of the semester and they add hugely to understanding. At times the grading seems like it's nitpicking on formatting and checking boxes, but considering that the class does aim to prepare students for writing technical reports that isn't necessarily a weakness.",
    "The nominal class is easily the guttiest lab class you will take for the chem degree. If you know how to code, work excel, and boil water, you will be fine",
    "The concepts are quite manageable and you do learn them very well in the process of doing these labs and writing the reports. However, these lab reports are no joke. Read the lab packets super carefully, start early, and be efficient with your time i.e. ask for help when you get stuck, because they can end up feeling like a black hole that you cannot escape from in the couple days before they are due.",
    "If you have to take this class this semester then make sure you dont overwhelm yourself with your other classes and extracurricular activities. Start your lab reports as soon as possible. Read the report guideline at least twice and make sure you followed the rules before you submit each report. Dont hesitate to ask questions to the professors and the TAs. Dont be a perfectionist in this class. This is a hard class, but if you start working on the lab reports early, read the packets and pay attention to the lecture, you will survive it.",
    "very well organized. lectures were very clear, all required handouts and notes were posted to classesv2 in organized folders. very interesting subject matter, but quite difficult. be ready for a challenge. I highly recommend it if you're willing to put in the time and are interested in chemistry.",
    "Mentally, this course will beat you into the dirt. I logged the time I spent working on labs in libraries, and it came out to be 245 hours. This number does not include breaks. This number does not include time wasted on distractions such as Facebook. This number does not include time spent in lab itself (which worked out to be about 40 hours). Assuming a productive day consists of about 11 hours of work, this class consumed almost a month of my semester. I went through each of my labs so I could figure out exactly how many words I had written in total. Excluding redundant captioning and appendices, this number came out to be 30,024. Assuming a double-spaced page contains about 260 words, I figure I completed about 115 pages worth of text. Before this class, I'd composed perhaps 90 pages of text during my time here at Yale. Then there were the quizzes, programming, and final exam... Lab sessions went for the full four-hour period on almost all days, and then there were the 50-minute lectures every Friday. As for the benefits of the class, it will teach you how to effectively navigate through massive amounts of course packet text. The lectures are also very well done; Professor Vaccaro is extremely approachable and charismatic. You'll also pick up quite a few fundamental equations and definitions, whether you like it or not. But that's to be expected when you're made to write bloated reports on a few minute phenomena. This class may very well ruin your semester.",
    "This course is a lot of work, but if you keep up with the course material and start your lab reports on time, it's manageable. In the end, I learned a ton from this class. It ties in well with the lecture course, and Vaccaro is a great teacher."
