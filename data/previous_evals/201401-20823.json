   "comments": [
    "I enjoyed the readings for this class. Lectures were a bit dry but this class is a decent survey course.",
    "I would recommend this course if you're really interested in Chinese history. If not, I think it could get a little dry.",
    "I would recommend this class if you want an overview of Chinese history from 1550-2000, but it's not a class that delves in depth into any specific topic and the pace is pretty fast. The readings were substantial but pretty interesting for the most part and while many people don't do all the readings, I think you'll get a lot more out of the class if you do (and probably enjoy them too). The papers were graded pretty toughly but overall, you get the grade you deserve--and that goes for the class as a whole.",
    "Take it if you are at all interested in China. Fascinating survey of Chinese history.",
    "This class requires the self-discipline to keep up with readings even if they aren't necessary to progress in the class. You really get what you put into it.",
    "If you enjoy history at all, this is a great class to take. You will really understand how China evolved from the empires of old into the state it is today. Perdue is a great professor and the books are interesting. I think this should be a part of any study of East Asia.",
    "This course is a broad survey course from 1550 - present of China. It is chronological, but otherwise poorly organised - Perdue just seems to throw in a mess of events and figures without drawing a clear narrative or giving us a good picture. Because of his utter lack of a thesis and completely uninspiring lectures, it feels like we are just learning about a whole bunch of terms and figures in isolation. Take it if you just want to familiarise yourself with some terms of Chinese history, otherwise, this is one of the worst History classes I've taken at Yale. The reading is a lot, but you don't have to do most of it to get by. Faizah is a wonderful TF, she has fun activities, she really comes into section with a good plan, and she completely knows how overwhelming things can be and is very helpful. Thank you, Faizah!!",
    "Good intro course to History of China, no more no less."
