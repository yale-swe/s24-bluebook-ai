   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend it, if you love English. Obviously it's required for the major, but for non-majors who love to talk about life and great literature, this is the course for you! Take it!",
    "I would highly recommend Prof. Nicholson's section; she engages everyone, and turns even the duller parts of the syllabus (eg Alexander Pope) into fascinating and useful experiences.",
    "YES",
    "English 126 is the second half of the English major prerequisites. You also don't need to take Eng 125 before this (although it certainly would be helpful). Overall, the course covers Milton, Pope, Wordsworth, and Eliot and you get the chance to look at how each poet's techniques and style led to the next poet's style. It helps you learn how to analyze poetry, and provides a solid background for any future English coursework. I would recommend to any potential English majors or anyone interested in English poets, but otherwise, you would probably be better off taking a different English course.",
    "Definitely take this class if you are interested in reading poetry. Don't take this class if you aren't interested in thinking about poetic form. I can't speak for how the class is with different professors, but if you are considering taking the class with Catherine Nicholson, I would definitely recommend it.",
    "It's a very goo english course to take and can be taken even if you're not an english major.",
    "If you're interested in learning about poetry through Milton, Pope, Wordsworth, and Eliot, go for it. The discussions are interesting, and you get a good sense of how poetry has evolved in the last few centuries. You don't need to have any background in poetry to get a lot out of the course. It's not a mind-blowing course, but it does a good job of putting some fundamentals in place.",
    "I would recommend it even if you don't have to take it as a prerequisite. It is a hard class; the readings take a long time and high quality writing is expected from you. But it really improves your reading and writing, and that I think is valuable enough. If you have even the slightest interest in poetry or literature, it will be highly enjoyable. Most importantly, it helps cultivate your sensibility: you learn to notice things in your reading that perhaps you would have not noticed before.",
    "As a prospective English major, I really enjoyed this class. The readings were all quite good (though Milton and Eliot were definitely the most fun) and my writing definitely improved. Professor Nicholson led the class with an impressive mix of erudition and geniality. Discussion was always productive. Nicholson tended to lead discussion with a somewhat strong hand, which sometimes gave the class the push it needed and sometimes felt limiting. Overall though, Professor Nicholson and ENGL 126 were excellent.",
    "It's a fine class with a seriously flawed syllabus. Take it with Catherine Nicholson if you must take it for the English major -- but if you're not required to take it, get your writing credit from something more interesting and valuable.",
    "This was an amazing class. I really felt like I learned so much about the English canon. When I spent enough time with the poets, I enjoyed all of them. My biggest struggle with the course was that I didn't always put enough time into my reading and as a result, I didn't always have the best grasp of the material before class. However, it's an important course and I would absolutely take it with Nicholson. She gives you an incredible amount of attention and helps reveal so many things about the texts.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS WITH PROFESSOR NICHOLSON. She is amazing. Our discussions were great, never dominated by just a few students, as so often happens. They were above and beyond any seminar discussions I've had at Yale. She is a very fair grader. I also loved reading Eliot, so I was glad that she chose to teach it."
