   "comments": [
    "I was excited to take this course because I wanted to learn about emergency preparedness as it relates to hospitals; we did not really discuss hospitals. You spend a lot of time completing formal trainings on the FEMA website with regard to command structure, hierarchies, and relevant frameworks to preparedness; these trainings largely serve as your background for the course but sometimes the trainings were dry and hard to understand. We did go through some of the same information in lecture, but I still found it rather dry. Applications of this knowledge were achieved through the profesors talking about their experiences in disasters and participation in creating a brief about the Philippines disaster, but I did not feel that I had a real chance to apply what I was learning in a meaningful way.",
    "Very different from other classes. Pulls on different strengths. I really enjoyed it. Great skill builder.",
    "Strength=real world applicationsWeaknesses=no instructor feedback, no idea what i'm being evaluated on or where i stand in the class. Course is very disorganized",
    "I have the most \"feelings\" about this course over any other course I have taken this semester. I believe it has the potential to be a great course, but as is, stands as an OK course. The strengths are that it has the experience of two incredibly qualified lecturers. It teaches about the fundamentals of planning for public health disasters which is incredibly relevant today as many people do not understand how to prepare or react to disasters. However, there were many issues with the course which subtracted from the incredible potential. There was a lack of organization in the course which seemed very ironic. Homework and projects seemed to have very little planning behind them. I would have loved to have grading rubrics on something- some sort of way of knowing I was going for what you wanted. Half the time I just put something together in the hopes of it being anywhere close to what you wanted, given the vague instructions. I also had\/have no idea of where I stand in the class. It is a little worrisome ending the class with no idea if I am getting an honors or failing. I know that Joanne and Sandy care a lot, but sometimes it seems that their care is directed towards 2-3 students and therest are just filler. Don't get me wrong, I love the course, but there is a lot of room for improvement.",
    "Strength: we learn to work with peers, the FEMA material is interesting and real life applications are fun to hear aboutweakness: one of the instructors didn't really teach. The other one seemed a little to focused on her related obligations than the actually learning part of the course. We might be spending an excessive amount of time creating the VMOCs for Joanne to share, and it could have been more clear from the begging how these are done. It was a little worrying that we are not really trained to do such important reports, when really lives are dependent on the information we could gather and disseminate.It would have been really helpful if we could have a set date for the finals earlier in the semester. I couldn't set a date for my flight and had to just buy a ticket for the last day of finals week (because I can't afford to wait until December and pay much higher prices). Some of our peers had a really hard time scheduling time later on in the semester.",
    "This course was poorly planned and executed. The lecturer (Joanne McGovern) did not follow the syllabus and the entire class was extremely unorganized.For example, she assigned an assignment to be due in the following class. When the class came with the finished product the next week, she decided that she did not want that assignment anymore and made the class re-do the assignment with different instructions.There was also an unfair distribution of work. I was the editor for the Typhoon Haiyan briefs, which meant that I had about 5 times as much work as the rest of the class. She did not really notice or seem to care that students had different workloads. For example, I had to edit PowerPoint slides every night (7 nights a week) and then every other night for 3 hours a night starting at 10 or 11 pm (they were not available to edit at an earlier time). I do not think any YSPH student has 20 hours outside of class to dedicate to one course. Joanne repeatedly guilt tripped the class into doing work for her because she would let us know how little sleep she was getting.Furthermore, during my final group presentation, Joanne stopped my group in the middle of our presentation and berated us in front of the entire class. She said that she could not bear to hear any more of our presentation and told us to just stop and sit down. Later, she came over to our group (still in front of the entire class) and said that she was ready to fail us all since our final presentation was the \"biggest part of our grade\" (according to the syllabus, it was 25% of our grade). Joanne asked us to do a final presentation different from everyone else in class because she wanted a product that she could use to teach future classes. She held us for nearly 3 hours after final presentations had ended and rudely criticized our presentation, right down to the quality of a JPEG image on one of the slides. It was not constructive and very threatening. She essentially threatened my group with failing the course so that we would produce a presentation and handbook that she could use for other purposes. After she finished criticizing our presentation it was nearly 9:30 and she asked my group to return the catering supplies (coffee canisters, trays, etc.) to Nica's Market the following day because she had to go visit her brother.I feel used and humiliated by Joanne. Her actions are both unethical and inappropriate for a learning institution.",
    "I really wish that I did not take this class. I thought I would learn some practical skills, and although participation in the VMOCs was really interesting, it didn't teach me much.On top of that, lectures were dry and basically a summary of the weekly FEMA trainings. Class was very conceptual, and it was hard to understand how what we learned could be translated into actual practice. Finally, expectations about assignments were very vague and came at the last minute(ie, if the point of the final project is to provide a tool, then why didn't Sandy clearly state that in her instructions?). We were not given instructions about the final project until the 2nd to last week of class, and I thought it was unfair to even assign a project when we had all been working every single day for the preceding weeks on publishing the Haiyan VMOC reports.",
    "Strengths: skills learned through the emergency preparedness course are unique but can be of use in many health topics discussed in other courses\/fields.Weaknesses: receiving feedback regarding our grades and class progress for this particular subject was difficult, and after several attempts there was usually little to no response regarding the goals we were expected to accomplish.",
    "This class was very interesting and I enjoyed how it focused on the practical application of public health in emergency settings, rather than being mostly theory-based. It filled in a knowledge gap I would not have gotten otherwise. At times, it was difficult to follow the acronyms and specialized government\/military terminology. A better or slower introduction into governmental organizations may have helped smooth out some confusion. Additionally, providing rubrics or clear assignment guidelines may have helped avoid some setbacks when producing classwork.",
    "This class was extremely disappointing. I was really looking forward to taking this class and it ended up being my least favorite of the semester.The topics covered were interesting but the format of the lectures taught me absolutely nothing.Every lecture seemed to cover the exact same thing in a different way (but in manners that confused rather than added to each other.)Joanne has incredible experience and it is fun to hear her talk about her past. She is also overall a very fun person and makes the class exciting with her energy.However, her teaching style is all over the place. She has no clear sense of organization. Coordinating the VMOCs and who would do what was an exercise in futility. Nobody had really any idea what they were supposed to do initially.In addition, nobody had any idea what they were supposed to learn by the end of the class or what they would be evaluated on. The online FEMA lessons were completely useless.We all worked really hard on the VMOC but there was no way of actually showing your effort and I have no idea what grade I will be getting in this class.The final project assignment was so poorly defined that every group did something different and nobody had any idea what we were supposed to do. We were given the assignment about a week before it was due, with very vague instructions. What Joanne expected on the day of the presentations was very different from what was initially told to us.This assignment was a microcosm for the overall structure of the course: very poorly organized, vague instructions, and no information on the specifics of how we would be evaluated.",
    "This course was interesting but the FEMA trainings were overwhelming and often the students were lost on what was expected of us",
    "Homework assignments consisted of online trainings that provide certificates that can be used after the class ends. Lectures were a little scattered. There was a lot of real world \"hands on\" experience involved which was extremely helpful. However, the final project would have been more interesting and useful if we had clear expectations. The final project was very disorganized. Clear, written instructions should be given in advance.",
    "Rather than just covering institutional and government organizational structures, I would've enjoyed more case-experience from both instructors--Sandy and Joanne have a wealth of real world experience and the most memorable classes were always about their involvement in response efforts to events like Katrina. I think by tying these organizational principle lectures to real world cases would make them stronger and increase student understanding.",
    "This course was extremely beneficial in a practical sense particularly for anyone going into global health. I will definitely use this new knowledge in my career.",
    "Homework was weekly and consistent which made it easy to keep a schedule. The class is one of the most relevant of all offered in regards to public health emergency actions. It is introductory in nature with reasonable assignment expectations."

    "Instructor: Sandy Bogucki \u00a0Joanne and Sandy seem very knowledgable, but I don't feel like I learned much in this class. I wish we had some instructor feedback and were told clearly what we should be doing.",
    "Instructor: Sandy Bogucki \u00a0I would have liked to see her lecture more. I feel like she has a lot to say, but I rarely heard her give a presentation. She fell asleep in class once or twice...",
    "Instructor: Sandy Bogucki \u00a0She didn't really speak to us much : in the first class she talked about the course for a few minutes. She also asked us if we are learning from the VMOCs at one point, but when we indicated that we think we learned as much as we could doing them and would like to learn more about other concepts there was little response or changes in class.assignments are poorly described, multiple requests for clarification usually goes to waste, occasional they would email weeks later with specificsThe other person who talked more is Joanne. It was fun to hear her experience, and she highlighted some important concepts to us. The guests are invaded to teach some major portions of the lecturing parts as well. A large amount of time in and outside of class was spent on VMOC. Unfortunately she didn't really teach us about these, aside from referring to some earlier examples and telling us the important agencies that benefits from them. We went through a VMOV, but that was when she had us choose as we go along which slides we would like to be responsible for daily updates. So most students are asked to do extensive research and make slides daily since November 8th when Haiyan hit, and work through weekends and thanksgivings. It wasn't clear how help it was to learning to be plunged into this. Unfortunately our group was also asked to do a \"guide to VMOC making\" instead of our project of choice. We pieced together what we can to present under a 30min time limit. Joanne stop the presentation in the middle of one of our member's sentence. And with great emotional expression, with arms waving, said loudly \"I can't take this any more, you obviously did not rehearse, your sections are out of order, just sit down, Sandy would you like to go against that and hear the rest of this?\" Sandy just shrugged. Sandy then had to leave in the middle of the other final presentations, and Joanne walked over to us between presentations, sat on the desk in front of us and said \"Sandy and are both about to fail all of you\". And our peers are forced to witness all of this. We weren't granted a chance to talk in private until one of us asked. She then kept up in another room after speaking about some changed she would like to see. We stayed 2 hours after class (until after 9pm) while she tried to explain what she wanted us to put together. Which exact slides from different presentation in the past she wanted, in what exact order and format. She commented at the end that she should have met with us after assigning this to us, and that she stopped us because Sandy was mad, and that she is going to \"deal with Sandy, and see what they can do\". We were also never asked if we are able to stay well into the night on campus, or whether we felt safe walking back home. She actually asked us to take 2 coffee dispensers and various catering utensils back to a cafe in East Rock (non of us lives close to that, but she only asked if we had a car and then requested that one of us takes it there for her). We spend additional hours to put together a 70 slides presentation and a 37 page report that was finally able to meet her needs (for a original project that supposed to be presentable under 30minutes). We received an one line long email from Sandy stating it's better and well done. And Joanne sent back feedback and said that is it now \"a practical product we can use\", and proceed to ask if they can use it for classes in the future. I feel that we were publicly embarrassed, treated unprofessionally, threatened, and now taken advantage of to make some product that they can use. Neither one of them even attempted to explain or acknowledge what happened in class. It is telling that they want to use material from us (who apparently were too terrible to even finish presenting in class) to teach future classes. When all of the class could have benefited from learning about VMOCs this semester since most of us spent near 100 hours working one them.",
    "Instructor: Sandy Bogucki \u00a0Sandy, although the primary instructor, did not actually teach the course. She probably talked once or twice the entire semester. Most of the time, she would show up to class half way through and sit in the back.When Joanne berated my group in front of the entire class Sandy looked shocked, but let Joanne continue her abuse. As the actual professor for this course and YSPH, I feel like her passive actions are also questionable.",
    "Instructor: Sandy Bogucki \u00a0Joanne: She's kind of intimidating, and it didn't help matters when she would call out students for poor performance (ie, when she didn't like their VMOC slides or during the last class, she stopped a group of students in the middle of their presentation and told them to sit down because she thought their presentation was terrible). It's really not an effective teaching method to publicly humiliate your students.Joanne was also late to class 50% of the time and it also seemed as though she played favorites.Sandy: She doesn't really do any of the teaching, but just provided random insights throughout the semester or covered for Joanne when Joanne was late to class.",
    "Instructor: Sandy Bogucki \u00a0She didn't teach any classes so do not know much. most of the classes were taught by Joanne Mcgovern.",
    "Instructor: Sandy Bogucki \u00a0It is clear that both Sandy and Joanne have lots of experience and expertise in the subject, and I enjoyed hearing their input based on practical life experiences. As mentioned above, a slower introduction into government terminology may have helped prevent some confusion in the lectures.",
    "Instructor: Sandy Bogucki \u00a0Sandy is awesome. I wish she had done more of the lectures. She is much more put together and organized than Joanne.",
    "Instructor: Sandy Bogucki \u00a0Sandy made the material very easy to understand and is very approachable",
    "Instructor: Sandy Bogucki \u00a0Sandy and Joanne are both extremely knowledgeable and bring a lot of real world experience. It would be helpful if they gave more feedback throughout the course.",

    "This course teaches you the formal structure, entities, and regulations surrounding disaster response. You have a chance to participate in the creation of a slide that is part of a report on an ongoing disaster, which is supposed to give you a sense for what needs to be considered in disaster response. You also do a final project on course material. This course is good for anyone who thinks they will be on the ground managing a disaster, but is not as useful for those who will be in industry (like hospitals) and want to get a sense of what their organization should know about disaster response. I did not feel I got as much practical knowledge out of the course as I had wanted. You do have certifications from FEMA on various parts of disaster response once you complete the course, which might be helpful for some.",
    "Fun, exciting, I want more!",
    "Great course, but has issues. Take it if you want to learn about emergency planning, but expect it to be a bit hectic.",
    "DON'T TAKE IT. The chance to be USED to make \"practical products\", that the professors then send to their colleagues and post internationally is high. The course offers in exchange, a great selection of stories about emergency response, FEMA certificate that can be done completely on your own, and a few readings of outlines you could find in these FEMA courses online anyways (aka lectures). The only thing you cannot get without taking the class is the personally experience of these instructors, the actual experience of working without pay, weekly updates on how little the instructor has slept which caused their bad mood, and a small change to be publicly humiliated but then asked to do more favors. It's frankly not worth it. Yale is an amazing institution, so it is a shame that experiences such as these must mar our permanent impression of this school. The course challenges our understanding of wether certain instructors possess the fundamental ability to teach and wether they truly want to teach.",
    "This class is the most humiliating and terrible experience that I have had at YSPH or any academic institution. I love YSPH and I believe this course really tarnishes everything I love about this place.No instructor or professor should be allowed to humiliate students in front of the entire class. Also, the lack of organization and clarity made this class even worse.",
