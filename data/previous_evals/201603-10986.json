   "comments": [
    "I learned about how media influences the portrayal of medicine and how medical authority is perceived in media in America.",
    "This class really made me think critically about the types of media I consume in a way no other class at Yale has. Now every time I see an ad asking for donations to St. Jude's hospital or a trailer for a movie about doctors or anything even vaguely related to the topics in the class, I immediately start analyzing them. This is the kind of thing that Yale INTENDS for every class to make students do, but this is the only class that has actually made me really do it. That's the highest recommendation I can give.",
    "I found this course really interesting as the material was applicable to many aspects of our lives that most people never even think about (and many that we do). I learned to engage with media and advertisements with a critical perspective, allowing me to really understand the message behind any media relating to medicine or health.",
    "HSHM 202 goes in depth with analysis of the dynamic interactions between medicine and science and the media throughout the last two centuries.",
    "I learned about various public health campaigns and the successes and failures of each one. The varying degrees of advertising and ways of publicizing information.",
    "I learned a lot about propaganda and the use of media as it relates to medicine in America. I didn't know anything about the history of medicine before this class, but I ended up truly loving the course!",
    "I learned a lot about, as the title suggests, medicine in media over the past ~century or so in all its mediums. I also learned how to write -- a lot -- in the 50 minute midterm block.",
    "Learned about the influence the media has on the medical world.",
    "I learned about various media sources and how they impact the public's understanding of health and medicine.",
    "Media and Medicine was one of my favorite classes this semester. Topics for the class were incredibly interesting, and especially as a pre-med student I found the information very relevant for my future career.",
    "I learned new ways to conceptualize and think about how media impacts public health and vice versa.",
    "This course was a broad overview of the intersection of medicine and media and how it has shaped America today.",
    "I learned a lot in this course! Its hard to summarize it all. I learned about the strategic use of stigma in public health media campaigns to change public behavior and implement policy changes. I learned the evolution of the American publics perception towards doctors and biomedical researchers from 1880 to the present. I learned about a ton of key biomedical researchers, their findings, and how they were portrayed int he media. I really enjoyed engaging with ethical debates surrounding abortion, designer babies, IVF, disability rights, the portrayal of sex workers in the media, the portrayal of people with disabilities in the media, the use of poster children in public health campaigns, the anti-vaccine campaign, the anti-psychiatry movement, and the widespread phenomenon of blaming mothers for all of the health problems their children experience (mental illness, poor nutrition, homosexuality, autism, etc). I loved the use of film and images throughout the courseit made the material so much more interesting and memorable. Since I am pre-med, one of my biggest takeaways from the course was the importance of doctors considering the cultural, socioeconomic, and mental health challenges patients may face in addition to their physical health conditions.",
    "I learned a lot about how the media has influenced medicine since the late 19th century. It changed the way I thought about media, advertisement, healthcare, and medicine.",
    "I learned how the public perception of the medical profession can change over time and how that perception is influenced by the media. As a premed, I look forward to keeping things that I learned in mind as a practicing physician who will interface with patients and the public. I also learned how to critically analyze primary sources.",
    "I learned so much about U.S. medical history and how the ever-changing media influences American perceptions of medicine. Very fascinating!",
    "I learned how to connect overarching themes of how media and medicine have interacted throughout the past century.",
    "I learned a great deal about media and medicine and their interactions and relationship from the 20th century onwards.",
    "The class provided a unique perspective to many health issues by providing historical context and focusing on the influence of the media.",
    "drawing themes from historical events",
    "You learn a lot about the media in a very interesting way. A lot of what you learn pertains to real life, which I enjoyed because you find new perspectives on things you wouldn't ever think about. It's also very interesting learning about medicine and how media has affected how people viewed different illnesses and how it empowered people. I'm a STEM major, and I really enjoyed this class, so I'd definitely recommend it if you don't mind much reading.",
    "I have learned the historical role of the media and its influence on relaying information and shaping public perception. With the classroom material, I was able to answer questions about the tactics used and the degree to which they worked on obtaining their desired output, as well as the benefits but also dangers these tactics posed to society. I also was able to read into health images in order to understand them on a much more analytical level.",
    "We learned a lot about how different forms of media have been used successfully (and unsuccessfully) in certain health campaigns to shape health behaviors in the past and in the present",
    "I learned about the kinds of techniques the media has used and continues to use in shaping public opinion about the medical industry. Specifically, I have learned how to be critical of pieces of media, focusing on what the message of a specific advertisement is and how it is likely to be interpreted.",
    "I learned how to write better and faster, and this course serves as a special brief overview of some interesting aspects of US history.",
    "I developed an understanding of the history of medicine in the U.S.",
    "Interesting biew on role of media in medicine.",
    "I learned a lot in this course about the history of the medical establishment and media advertising since the 1880s, as well as how to understand history and how to analyze media campaigns. I really appreciated that this course provided me with both contentful and methodological insight.",
    "We learned about how media and medicine influenced and used each other starting in the mid 19th century to around now.",
    "I found this course to be extremely applicable in my everyday life, allowing me to think critically about medical television shows, advertisements for medications, breakthrough articles in newspapers. it was great to learn about the history of health movements and how they have been portrayed in the media and why as a way to now understand current media relating to media. I found myself in an uncommon position in class as I am not interested in any career involving healthcare. Instead of viewing this class from a doctor-like viewpoint, I found myself drawn to understanding the role of journalists in cultivating the image of medicine the public sees. I learned about the ethical and moral struggle between these two industries and how they continue to effect the public today.",
    "I enjoyed analysing film clips and advertisements as a way to support the information and concepts presented in lecture.",
    "Writing skills, critical thinking and analysis skills, knowledge of importance of the media.",
    "Learned how to properly identify media's relationship with medicine.",
    "As a student entering medical school next year, I have learned to contextualize modern practices of medicine through a historical lenses. In seeing how our perceptions and treatments of illness have been shaped by 19th-21st century media, I anticipate using this knowledge to direct how I interact with my future patients.",
    "Critically thinking, contextualizing historical events",
    "Wonderful course on media and medicine in america",
    "media and medicine",
    "Learned about history of medicine, where I got to understand how to be more conscious of medicine and my body",
    "I learned so much from this course, especially how to contextualize medical history from different time periods and analyze how media and medicine simulatneously shape each other throughout the years.",
    "How to be aware of the media and the reason they do certain things",
    "I learned a lot about advertising techniques that were used by healthcare companies. I would now like to write about this topic for my thesis.",
    "Analyze the relationship between media and medicine (as the course title suggests). This class actually really opened my eyes how interconnected media and medicine are. It gave me the tools to better understand the underlying assumptions and implications of media beyond the intended effect of medical media.",
    "Learned a lot about the history of the medicine from the 1880s to modern times. It provides an interesting perspective on medicine in a culture that otherwise presents a very idealized version of medical practice. I learned about the complex politics and different forces that drive medical treatment and the perception of medicine.",
    "I gained an understanding of the relatively recent application of modern media tools to medicine and was able to discuss whether or not this was ethical. I learned how to analyze a piece of media more in depth. This class made me think critically about public health campaigns throughout the last century or so and some themes that are similar throughout them. It also made me realize the influence of media on government and the medical field and vice versa.",
    "This course does a great job at discussing the intersection between media and medicine, both currently and throughout history. The class is taught by two professors, one a historian and one a practicing physician which allows for two very different perspectives. In addition to the course material and the professors, Media and Medicine in America helped me better prepare for essays, by strategically organize my thoughts and thinking critically about structure and composition.",
    "I gained new insight into how the media has and continues interacts with medicine within the United States. I learned how the medicinal community has used media to communicate with the public as well as how the media, as its own entity, plays a role in how the public understands and builds expectations of the medical community and its work. In addition, I learned how the reporting of historical medicinal events shapes their legacies.",
    "How much the media affects the medical world.",
    "The syllabus was accurate in the information that learned.",
    "I learned a lot about how much consumerism goes into the medical treatments and pathways we experience today, and how marketing and the media have influenced the stigma and expectations we see in hospitals.",
    "This class helped me develop my analytical skills by teaching me how to critically analyze media campaigns. Additionally, this class developed my ability to place content into historical contexts.",
    "This course taught me to think about the role of media in shaping expectations in the context of medicine and pharmacology. I have been able to look more critically at advertisements and journalism and see how these forms of media contribute to the general population's understanding.",
    "We learned a lot in this class. There were big picture ideas (like Golden Age of Medicine, power of celebrity, impact of \"breakthrough\", etc.) as well as more specific events\/situations that were discussed. I also think that my writing improved. My TA was really good about helping us with our essays (especially creating thesis statements and following through with our arguments).",
    "Critical thinking of advertisements, images, commercials",
    "Skimming skills and taking notes.",
    "Learned so much about the advertising of medical campaigns in history up until the present.",
    "I gained a greater background knowledge of how the public has perceived medicine in the past. It was many topics that I had never heard of before and that were really interesting.",
    "I was afforded the opportunity of retaining information that transcended anything I could memorize. It took mere sense to put information into context and build an argument off of it.",
    "Gained knowledge of how to analyze different forms of media, from tv commercials to poster propaganda from the 60s. Lecture offered thoughtful reflection on historical events relevant to health in America today"

   "comments": [
    "Really interesting topics covered. A little confusing going monday with historical lecture and wednesady with a modern lecture. I think it would have been easier to understand if it had been presented more in a time line. A lot of times the monday vs wednesday lectures had no connections.",
    "It's very interesting and easy. Lectures are unengaging and it's not important to do all the readings super thoroughly.",
    "Strengths: Good size, variety of interesting topics, relatively straightforward assessments, good guest lectures, interesting sources Weaknesses: SO MUCH READING!!!!!!!!! John was straight-up wrong when he said that this course had a light reading load dude.",
    "The information we covered was vast and interesting. However, the number of readings and the sheer time it took to read everything detracted from the material they were conveying. Often they were very redundant. Had the readings been more focused, I think the class would have been better.",
    "I wish the slides were posted online, because a lot of the stuff shown in class revolves around images or video clips, which you can't really access in your notes when you're trying to study for exams.",
    "I enjoyed the format of this course- one 7 page paper, a midterm, and a final, but I wish that I would have known more of my grade before the end of the semester. Most is tied up at the very end. I also love the alternation in lecture-- definitely kept things exciting. I also love the use of video clips!! Always so fun to see!! A weakness was the medical library section-- I didn't get that much out of it.",
    "Strengths: great lecturing, lots of good examples of media\/medicine, being able to go to the medical school library for a section to look at posters\/other media was really cool",
    "It felt like the class made the same point every lecture and if you'd done the readings, it felt a bit repetitive.",
    "The two different instructors with two different lecture styles. Perhaps one lecturer.",
    "I really enjoyed the lectures content but I thought the 3+ hour final exam was far too long. Half way through my hand cramped and I felt that the questions asked in 4 image format compare\/contrasting was too many to analyze in one question. I would have rather had two questions with only two images rather than one 4 image question. I feel like I obtained a large amount of knowledge that did not get displayed because of this. Additionally, for students moving forward it would have been nice to have a list of potential images for the image ID question. I attended every lecture and paid attention but for a few of the questions on the final, the image was a complete surprise. I didn't remember seeing it before and couldn't tie in a theme making it hard to write a comprehensive essay.",
    "The lecturers do a great job of telling the story of how media has developed throughout history in an interesting manner.",
    "The course was well structured and engaging.",
    "Great, interesting lectures that always kept me very engaged. It would be perhaps more helpful to try and keep the course more in chronological order, as that would definitely make studying for exams much easier.",
    "If you're going to have a class that focuses (at least partially) on patients' experiences and brings up disability often, how can you not include writing by disabled individuals? There's so much to draw from, and we read none of it. We also never talked about the disability rights movement, which is essential when talking about the subject of this course. It added insult to injury that we spent time talking about Jerry Lewis and Jenny McCarthy, who have done more to set back the disability rights movement than most.",
    "Perhaps the course could focus on fewer topics but more in depth.",
    "This course had so many strengths!! I thought that all of the lectures were engaging and interesting. The integration of media into lectures was masterfully done: not too much and not too little. The course also had many weaknesses. The structure was VERY disorganized: there was no understandable order to the lectures: they jumped from time period to time period and we would often suddenly go back to topics we had covered months prior. The readings assigned for this course were so extensive that almost no one completed them or even attempted the majority of them. Had the readings been shorter, many more people would have completed the readings and gotten a more comprehensive understanding of the course material. The course packet was so huge that I only saw 2 people in the whole course dole out the money to buy it. I think students are much more likely to complete the readings when they have a hard-copy of them, but that would require cutting a lot of the readings. Many of the assigned readings were WAY too long and superfluous to the course material. I think the professors wanted to give the students are very comprehensive understanding of the role media has played in shaping medicine in the US, so they included as many readings as they possibly could. This turned out to be an ineffective strategy because so few students actually completed the readings. Moreover, one didnt need to do the readings in order to perform well on the tests or the final paper. I think the discussion sections for this course could also be improved to facilitate more open-ended discussions that students are interested in instead of trying to fit so many activities in a short amount of time. Personally, I enjoyed Professor Bertrands lectures much more than Professor Warners. Professor Warners lectures are less organized and engaging. His thoughts are all over the place, and its hard to grasp the key messages of his lectures. He jumps around topics instead of following a coherent progression of ideas. I think its too bad that Professor Warner was the head professor and taught more lectures than Professor Bertrand.",
    "I liked this class, but it depended entirely on your section. Some of my classmates had discussion sections that were not engaging at all and very easily graded and the opposite. The lectures were consistently great however.",
    "The course was very interesting and well taught. I really enjoyed taking the course, but the lectures being in an auditorium without a writing surface was difficult to deal with.",
    "This class is great in that its engaging and interesting, and the lessons learned about interactions between the public and the medical system are helpful to future medical professionals. I just have two small potential improvements first, with the team teaching format and the structuring of the course mainly around themes instead of going chronologically, the course seemed a little jumpy and it was sometimes hard to step back and get a broad perspective on the material. Second, the grading is based pretty much completely on very open-ended essays, so expectations are sometimes a little bit ambiguous.",
    "Strengths: lots of visuals Weaknesses: needs clearer structure guidance (ex: no prompt given for essay)",
    "Very engaging lectures and sections. I wish there was a second midterm in between the first midterm and the final exam, as there was so much material covered in between that time.",
    "The class is extremely interesting, well-taught, and engages students well. The only possible negative was that sometimes the readings were a bit long to digest well.",
    "The course work covered lots of interesting material. Due to the large spam of material that was covered, most of the material was not discussed in depth. I feel like the class might be improved by examining less topic but in greater detail. It oftentimes felt oversimplified and therefore less challenging and engaging.",
    "Dr. Warner's lectures were extremely well-structured. He normally began the lecture with a thesis statement and proved it through the rest of the lecture. On the contrary, Dr. Berlin's lectures were a bit more scattered, and often seemed to lack much argument or interpretation.",
    "It's hard to get adjusted to how quickly the lectures go because most of the content you need for exams comes from lectures, so you need to be able to pay attention and write down notes with limited words. I liked that each lecture alternated teachers, but it also is sometimes hard having two slightly different teaching styles. I think its structure was great though, and I enjoyed analyzing clips to support what they were teaching. One thing I don't like about classes like these is that TAs determine your grade and grade everything, so I can't say grading is consistent. If you have an easy TA that's great, but if you have a hard TA you're screwed. I know they have things they're looking for when grading, but I'd prefer if i was more uniform how were were graded, especially since what we write in papers and on exams may be an A to one TA and a B+ to another.",
    "Not a strength of weakness, but just a suggestion. The professors of the course should check out Next to Normal, a musical from the mid 2000s, and see if they want to incorporate it at all into the mental health units of the course cause it could be really interesting to study.",
    "I thought the material covered was all very important. Sometimes chronology got confusing simply because material was presented by topic and not in order of events. I also enjoyed the section held at the Yale School of Medicine Library; it would be great if more \"field trips\" like this could be incorporated.",
    "THIS IS AN AWESOME CLASS. I loved every minute of it. We got to see a lot of really interesting techniques and learn what impact they had on American Society. I loved that we got hands on access to several examples of such media, and that the readings bolstered the analysis of much of the media we saw in class. The only critique I have would be that the powerpoints were not put on classes so that we could review them before exams. Other than that, I loved it!",
    "A strength of this course is the wide variety of topics that it covers and connects. The information was all very interesting. A weakness is that, although I enjoyed hearing the perspectives of each lecturer, it often felt like there was little connection between each of a week's lectures. Furthermore, going back and forth in time and switching focuses could be confusing.",
    "Strength: Engaging the history through a medical context can bring many insights. Weakness: Some lectures are rather less interesting.",
    "Strengths: I thought the material was very interesting. Weaknesses: There was too much unnecessary reading.",
    "Nice perspective",
    "The strengths of this course is that the content itself is extremely engaging and both professors do a great job at presenting it in an engaging way. It is easy to pay attention in lectures because they are genuinely enjoyable and the professors are truly experts on the subject matter. One of the most successfully co-taught classes I've ever seen. The biggest weakness is that lectures are not delivered in chronological order, so it can be difficult to fully understand and causally analyze change over time.",
    "One strength of this course was the readings. I liked how a lot of them were advertisements so they were really interesting and fun to read. They also often weren't too long or repetitious of what was said in lecture. One weakness was how we didn't get to watch a lot of films or ads we talked about in class. We often watched clips or short ads, but I had hoped we would get to see more since the class focuses on media.",
    "Excellent lectures that I actually enjoyed going to.",
    "The material in this class is incredibly interesting and something I think everyone would be curious in learning about. Everything from Tuskegee, to the Jimmy Fund, to medical shows such as ER are integral parts of the American identity, for better or worse. They are topics that should be taught and continued to be talked about today. I found the concept of themes such as gender stereotypes or stigmatization to be somewhat trial as they were fairly overt in the examples we studies. I was more interested in understanding the details of histories of events than connecting racial stereotypes throughout time. Though I do think that these themes are important in understanding cycles throughout history, I don't think they needed to play such a central part of the course. I also did not quite understand the purpose of the final paper as studying one particular piece of media. I think I would have found the paper to be much more effective as a sort of culmination to the course if it allowed me to explore one particular event, such as Willowbrook, rather than spend seven pages discussing one single image, which included observations that I didn't feel thoroughly engaged with past course material.",
    "Weaknesses: The lectures were very disjointed from one to the next and there was seemingly no logic to the way the coursework was presented. This made it difficult to study for the mid-term and final because there weren't clear themes running through the course. More organization of the flow of the course is needed. Strengths: Lecture was always very interesting and so were the readings. Section was really enjoyable.",
    "I really enjoyed learning about the role of media in public health information.",
    "Good professors, unique topic.",
    "The strength of the course is that the lectures are given in a very consistent manner, and the TAs are extremely willing to help the students. The weakness of the course is that there is minimal content provided through classesv2, such as the powerpoint lectures or images\/videos presented. This would help any student who had to miss class for some particular reason or simply wanted to review the lecture if the lecturer had presented the material too quickly.",
    "Teaches very objectively about marginalized groups in medicine, hard to find in other courses. I appreciated how dedicated the class was to create a sense of inclusivity.",
    "Very engaging, brought in outside speakers",
    "lecture style",
    "Good lecture and enjoyable section",
    "This course was always interesting and engaging and truly enjoyable to take.",
    "It is an interesting lecture and a very fun class to be in. I really enjoyed my section activities.",
    "The information in lecture is always really engaging, but you must be in lecture to get the information! Slides aren't posted. While there are a lot of readings, I do feel that the they were not integrated into the course material as much as I would have liked. Lectures and readings were related only by topic, and the readings provided good background for the lectures. However, there was little interplay between the two.",
    "The course material (readings, lectures, films, themes, etc) is fascinating but the order and way in which it is taught is so frustrating. I understand why the class is organized by public health campaigns\/concepts, instead of by chronological order but the order of the lectures is disorienting and often unnecessarily repetitive. I know history is difficult to teach because there is so much happening at once but it would be helpful to restructure the class in a more logical order, or at least explain why we are studying the topic we are. It felt like we jumped around from topic to topic and then would randomly find ourselves back on an earlier topic but in a later decade.",
    "This class was amazing in the sense that it was given by two professors. One taught lecture Monday and gave us a historical perspective on that weeks topic, while the other taught Wednesday and gave us a modern view. This was incredibly unique, and made the class more engaging and enjoyable. Also, since this was a media based class, we got to watch some pretty interesting clips.",
    "TF KATIE HEALEY",
    "The material was interesting, but the professors weren't that engaging. They also don't upload their slides, which makes studying hard.",
    "I thought the course was a strong survey lecture, which covered a large range of historical events and issues regarding the United States and the medicinal community. The focus on media provided me with a new understanding of historical medicial events that I had previously learned about in other HSHM courses. I thought the structure of lecture was well suited for the material, but sometimes I felt that we had to rush through topics because of lack of time. The assignments and assemble were fair and they were a good reflection of course material.",
    "Strengths were relating to many readings and discussions we had in class and in lecture. Weakness was definitely keeping up with the readings because there are about 7 each week.",
    "A little bit more student involvement in the lectures.",
    "The class was very enjoyable with great lectures. The class had lots of reading and I felt as if it was a little too monotonous at times.",
    "I enjoyed the course and felt that each lecture was important in the development of the curriculum. However, it was at times difficult to follow the train of thought in this class because one lecture every week was pre-1960's and the other referred to material and events within the past 50 years. It might be interesting to teach the course in chronological fashion, and I also think the discussion sections could have been more discussion-oriented rather than focused on review of the lecture material.",
    "I enjoyed the lecture and the assignments. I'm not sure about other TAs, but our weekly reading assignments were definitely manageable. In terms of improvement, some of the week's readings were hard to understand (like the tobacco week). I felt that the midterm and final exam were fair.",
    "The lectures were often repetitive, using the same examples over and over to illustrate a common point.",
    "This course was awesome! The use of primary sources is incredible, and going through different time periods was awesome as well. Maybe it would have helped if the class and lectures went chronologically through time.",
    "Strengths: interesting content Weakness: Too many readings",
    "I really liked that the final paper was open-ended. It was the first paper that I have really enjoyed writing in college. I wish the sections were more standardized. Other sections had more preparation for the midterms and finals, and I wish that I had had that. Also I wish the grades were out of 100 instead of letter grades for all assignments. It would be nice to have the powerpoints available after class, but not necessary.",
    "While the lectures and material was interesting, it was at times difficult to follow because of the two different lecturers every week. I would have preferred having everything in chronological order. The readings were really interesting. The essay assignment for the course, though, was too ambiguous and different teaching fellows outlined different expectations which made the assignment really confusing. I think there needs to be more of a prompt for that assignment.",
    "Switching off between professors on Mondays and Wednesdays made lectures feel a bit less cohesive, and content was not necessarily chronological despite exam questions based on timeline"

    "Yes, I would recommend! Interesting and not too demanding. The final paper really always you to explore what you are interested in as well.",
    "Yes definitely!! It's really interesting and I always found the readings engaging. Lectures are a bit boring but discussion sections were always very interesting and fun. It's a great course and it's also really easy.",
    "HELL YES, I absolutely would recommend this class. I absolutely loved everything about it -- even going to section was fun. Even though I hadn't thought critically before about most of the topics we went over, it was taught in such a way that it just came naturally. 10\/10 I liked it as much as I liked Minds and Brains in America (which is a high recommendation because I am a Henry Cowles fangirl)",
    "Yes! The topic is very interesting and will change your perspective on medicine and media.",
    "Absolutely would recommend - it's so applicable to real life and gives you a great perspective on the interplay between media and medicine.",
    "Yes, great class and very interesting. Great professors and interesting content.",
    "Absolutely take this class! The workload is very manageable- one 7 page paper, a midterm, and a final, and the material was always so interesting. I learned so much in lecture, and always thoroughly enjoy it! The readings could be a lot, but my TF never made us do them all. I think this class is a great fifth class. Very fun! I'm a poli sci major but I will now be taking more HSHM classes for fun. Must take!",
    "This was a great course! Material was interesting, it wasn't too much work, and there were enough different topics that I found quite a few that were interesting.",
    "Take it! It's engaging, readings supplement the lecture discussion, and it's a really fun class in general.",
    "It's a pretty easy and generally interesting class, so yes I would. Not a life changer though",
    "Yes, it is an excellent course that is not only interesting but relevant. It is a very pleasant class that you actually enjoy being in.",
    "Yes, I really enjoyed the course content. Lecture was enjoyable to go to.",
    "This course is really interesting and makes you think about the role of the media in your own life, whether health related or not. It's very interesting and I would definitely recommend!",
    "Absolutely take this class!! It's engaging, insightful, and Dr. Warner is a great lecturer!!",
    "Yes! It's super interesting, and the work load isn't crazy.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course!",
    "I would recommend this class. It provides an interesting lens through which to view public health. Plus we get to watch lots of movie clips and commercials in class, so it is very engaging. The workload is not particularly stressful either.",
    "I think the course was quite good. Interesting, engaging, the mental health lectures were particularly cool.",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend this course to another student. It's not tough (midterm\/final\/paper), but very engaging. I have taken many HSHM classes and this one has stood out in particular because it covers new material and also looks at it through a very unique lens: the media. It was definitely interesting analyzing some of the material in section particularly when it touched upon modern topics like the abortion debate or obesity epidemic.",
    "I would recommend this course to students who want a broad overview of media and medicine.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to another student looking for a class is not too difficult but still very interesting. Of course, if you choose to do all of the readings, the difficulty spikes. I would recommend taking this course with a friend who is interested in the topics of media and medicine so that you can discuss the course material over meals or to study together, since discussion sections dont provide a conducive atmosphere for real discussion and debate.",
    "Yes I would recommend this class to any student. It is a great way to learn about the history of media and medicine.",
    "Very interesting and not too difficult. Definitely take the course (especially if you are STEM \/ interested in medicine).",
    "Yes! Very interesting course.",
    "Its a good class. I wouldnt say it challenged me intellectually very much, but its interesting and you learn some cool stuff. If the subject matter sounds attractive to you personally, then Id definitely recommend it. A lot of the readings are secondary sources that just echo the lectures, so you can sort of get away with not going to class if you do all the readings (this is not advisable though, Dr. Berland and Dr. Warner are both good lecturers and class is enjoyable). A lot of people have said that the grading is a little unexpectedly harsh, but thats not necessarily true if you treat this like a gut and blow off class\/readings and wing the exams, then yeah, youre not going to get a good grade, but if you engage with the material and put some thought into your assessments its not hard to do well.",
    "It's a pretty easy class. Not the most insightful class you will take but certainly not boring. The grading was not too harsh but not easy either. You can get by without doing the readings if you go to lecture, but your section leader may ask for reading responses.",
    "Yes! This was my first history course at Yale, and I enjoyed it very much. The workload is very manageable and looking at medical advancements as portrayed by the media was very interesting. Overall great course.",
    "I would 100% recommend this. The lectures were unfailingly super interesting, especially with the media element, the sections reinforced the concepts really well, and the workload wasn't bad at all. Amazing class!",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone who is interested in learning more about media's role in medicine through the 20th century. This course is great for all majors and you really learn a lot about the interactions between media and medicine and how that has shaped today's use of media as well as the structure of our medical establishment today. Readings are interesting and there is only a midterm and final along with a paper.",
    "I would recommend the class if a student is interested in the material. It's low workload and interesting.",
    "The course material is really interesting. To get a good grade, just do one reading a week really in-depth so you have stuff to talk about in section and on the exams, and read the other articles for fun. (Seriously, most of the reading is pretty light and interesting.)",
    "I definitely enjoyed this course; however, I would not take another course with this much reading. Many of the articles are quite interesting, but it is a lot, and for a slow reader it could easily take 6 hours to do half of the week's readings. Some people don't read, but I do think it's important to at least read some of it. I did enjoy the content of this course, though. It's an interesting topic and something I had never thought about before. I'm a STEM major and took this as a humanities. Although I wouldn't want as much reading again, I am glad I took it. I enjoyed learning about media and medicine because it pertains a lot to life now and gives you something to think about in a new way. If you don't mind reading, I would definitely recommend. Even if you don't like reading, I'd still recommend it because it is definitely an interesting topic that I thoroughly enjoyed.",
    "Yes absolutely!",
    "I would definitely recommend this course! The material is really interesting and the medical history side is really good information to know as patients of the American Medical system. The marketing and media aspects on the other hand are cool to look at from the perspective of a consumer.",
    "Yes, I would recommend. I ended up taking this course as a senior as a last minute decision, and I actually really enjoyed it. I am pre-med, so its material was useful towards my education, but this kind of material can be useful to anyone, especially when regarding the powerful role that the media plays in shaping public perception. Also, it is not an overwhelming amount of work, and most of the readings are interesting anyways.",
    "I WOULD 10\/10 RECOMMEND! I LOVED THIS CLASS SO MUCH. Dr. Berland and Dr. Warner prepared highly interesting lecture presentations, with distinct examples that were easy to remember. The workload was't bad at all. We simply had readings for section, a midterm written exam, a final paper (7 pgs) and a final written exam. It might seem like a decent amount of work, but it is worth it. The paper is open ended where you chose a piece of health-related media and analyze it. It was really fun to write. If you are at all interested in the health field, or more generally in how the media shapes our thinking TAKE THIS CLASS.",
    "I thought the content of the lectures and readings were all very interesting and relevant to everyday life, as we are constantly surrounded by media that is trying to persuade us to change our opinions. Readings were generally very interesting, so doing them didn't feel like a chore, and I always had plenty of things I wanted to discuss in section. I would definitely recommend this course to another student.",
    "Definitely! As an international student, I often find US history unfamiliar. After this class, I learned so much about history and about the interaction between media and medicine!",
    "Yes def take it",
    "Yes! If you are at all interested in the subject matter, it's a great and enjoyable course.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student because it merged two topics you wouldn't normally think of, which was really interesting.",
    "If you enjoy public health in America, you can't go wrong with this class.",
    "I definitely would recommend this course to students of all interests and backgrounds. This class covers material that is applicable to everyday life of all types of people. The course material is stimulating and I actually looked forward to doing the readings for this class every week.",
    "A great overview course with a light workload. A great fifth class. Take it if you're interested in the way the media has portrayed the medical industry over the past 100 years. Don't expect it to change your life or be groundbreaking information. More like fun trivia facts you can spout out impressively at a dinner conversation.",
    "Yes I would recommend this course to a student interested in the media and the medicine",
    "Yes, it's interesting and fun.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone who is interested in an introductory or survey knowledge of understanding medicine from an historical context.",
    "I would recommend this course to other students, given the pervasive role that media plays in our lives. Consideration of this role in relation to medicine is critical for understanding of the healthcare we receive, its origins, and the medical products we consume.",
    "Yes!!",
    "Take this class! There's nothing else like at Yale. You get a very unique sense of media and its use to mold people's understanding of their own health.",
    "Yes",
    "Yes I loved it. Very interesting",
    "yeah it is easy and simple",
    "Fun course... Very interesting perspective and take on medicine",
    "I think this is a fantastic course for anyone who has an interest in the history of medicine and how media influences it.",
    "Yes! Definitely take this class because the material is so interesting. The section leaders are also amazing and over all teach very well!",
    "Cool class -- show up to lecture because the material is interesting!",
    "Yes, this class should be taken by anyone who wished to be informed about medical history. Especially for current premed students, it provides a great perspective for future medical practice. It's not too much work, and the material is very engaging.",
    "Yes if you are interested in medicine or media (or both). If not it might be boring to you. I found the material fascinating and relevant and the workload totally manageable, so I enjoyed it despite the fact that I think the class could be taught better.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class to another student.Because of the film component of the class, it was incredibly unique, making each class novel and exciting.The professors were amazing, passionate and well versed in their field, and the subject matter was pretty interesting. Overall, a great class and great semester.",
    "Absolutely! This course was very interdisciplinary and highly applicable to many different majors and the material was so interesting.",
    "It's an interesting class, but not a gut.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to any Yale student because in focusing on the media and its uses, the course provides an accessible way to understand significant medicial events and controversies from US history. I would note, however, that the topics may repeat from other HSHM course. I would still encourage HSHM majors to take the course because its historical lens is unique and provides new insight into previously learned topics.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to anyone. It is a really interesting course and all the lectures and great.",
    "Yes",
    "Absolutely. Very fair in terms of workload, and you can get a ton out of it through just the lectures! There's also a ton of variety in the readings that you can get even more out of it you find the material more engaging. I also like the switching of lecturers each weak.",
    "Yes! This class was engaging but very fair. The exams were very fair and expectations were made very clear.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student to learn about media's role in shaping expectations and behaviors of the general public in the context of medical breakthroughs and events. The lectures were all engaging and the course was well taught.",
    "Yes! Not only would this course be great for a HSHM major, but it was interesting knowledge that is pretty applicable to our everyday lives. I loved learning about history while also reflecting on the consequences seen today. It has changed my perspective on media and medicine for sure.",
    "I would definite fly recommend this class to another student. Media and Medicine was a wonderfully entertaining class! Each lecture was very interesting and I now feel infinitely more aware of how the media's portrayal of medicine, health, etc. shapes and reflects the public'a opinions on these important topics. A great humanities class with copious visual examples from the past century and a half.",
    "I love the material we read for the course. I would definitely recommend the course to someone interested in HSHM, psychology, or history in general.",
    "Yes, I found this class interesting.",
    "Really fascinating course material, great class even if you're not pre-med",
    "This course is great -- easy workload, interesting subject. Definitely take! A great 5th class.",
    "Yes, the content is amazing and keeps the students engaged. The readings are very interesting too.",
    "Yes I would. This class was so interesting, and I think any type of student would also think so. It also talks about important current issues.",
    "Yes I really enjoyed the course. I actually feel like the information will help me navigate the medical information available to the public even if I weren't going into the medical field.",
    "I absolutely LOVED this class. Please take it if you're interested in medicine or media in any way.",
    "This was a decent class that was not too much work and was interesting. Definitely do the readings as it makes class more interesting. The tests aren't that hard but the grading at times is a bit unclear. The essay was too ambiguous so make sure you understand the prompt. Make sure you like both lecturer styles and find the material interesting before committing.",
    "Yes. The Lectures are interesting and the sections are engaging.",
    "Yes"
