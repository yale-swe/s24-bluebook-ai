   "comments": [
    "I gained a general overview of what Monetary policy was like before, during, and after the Great Recession.",
    "This is really a great class as it allows you to apply the content learned throughout core economics classes in a more practical setting. This course gives you both exposure to a more sophisticated macro model (the first portion of the course is definitely more technical), as well as major issues policymakers are contemplating as they make decisions. You also gain a bit of economic history, and get a thorough background of the crisis from someone who got to see the crisis response first hand.",
    "Insight into practical monetary policy setting",
    "This course was excellent for learning how to write focused economic policy papers. The learning curve was a bit steep, but the feedback was constructive. Overall, I learned a great deal about the Federal Reserve, the 2008 Crisis, and the current economic outlook.",
    "How the Fed makes economic decisions, what risks face mon pol, how academics are solving various macroeconomic policies.",
    "Learned A LOT about the Federal Reserve system and how central banks in general operate. The class is basic enough for a beginner's introduction and comprehensive enough to get a good, deep understanding of the topic.",
    "I learned about modern macro models and important policy issues."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strength: professor is very knowledgeable due to experience at the FED Weakness: Mathematical rigor is a bit lacking.",
    "I thought this course was very well taught. It might be helpful to explain the mechanics of the various financial instruments that appeared throughout the course, but these were also easy enough to look up outside of class.",
    "Overall, the class was very well organized and didn't have any real weaknesses. The only issue at times was that Prof. English moved very fast during some lectures and there wasn't much time to copy down notes for certain slides. The slides are on Canvas though and contain most of the lecture information so not too much of an issue.",
    "This course had top-notch guest lecturers. The material was interesting but the instructor read his slides.",
    "Really excellent course; probably the best econ class I've taken at Yale. A stretch around the end of the first third \/ middle of the course (a month in or so---different targeting rules, the Excel spreadsheets, etc.) got a little repetitive, and it would have been nice to have more of the quantitative modeling (e.g. beyond the Short Run Fluctuations text) continued in the second half of the course. Also, maybe sections focusing on the optional reading, particularly on the methodological details. Relatedly, around the paper assignments, it would have also been helpful to have sections go over the kinds of datasets that might be useful to look at; it was edifying to try to figure it out from looking at papers \/ the material in class, but I often felt like there could've been canonical (or creative) things to look at that I just didn't know about.",
    "The material is actually really cool, and English is really witty and funny; however, sometimes the class lectures were very dry which made it harder to really appreciate what we were learning. Still a great class though. Also, the paper prompts were interesting, but really challenging too."

   "comments": [
    "Good writing credit.",
    "This class will teach you valuable skills in writing short and focus economic policy papers (how to take a stance, write with precision, evaluate pros and cons of various policy recommendations, and back up claims with data). Overall, I thought this course was well taught, and I feel I have a much better understanding of the economy and current monetary policy issues following the 2008 Crisis. The workload is not easy, but Professor English was fabulous and his experience added a new dimension to the course.",
    "Yea. Great course if you're interested in Monetary Policy or Central Banking. English is a nice guy and cares about teaching.",
    "This is definitely a great class if you want to learn more about monetary policy, the Federal Reserve, and central banks in general. Prof. English's first-hand knowledge of the Fed really shines through and adds to the course. Be wary though, if you have only a casual knowledge of the economy (i.e. you don't know about different types of securities, financial entities, and government agencies) there will be a SHARP learning curve. Would strongly recommend taking Prof. Metrick's class on the 2008 financial crisis before if you can help it. Also, be ready for the possibility that others in the class are more familiar with the topics than you are. The problem sets for the class are almost guaranteed 100s and are easy to do without truly understanding the concepts, but DON'T FALL INTO THAT TRAP. The essays for the class are no joke and really require you to look for compelling sources, understand the concepts, and think critically. They're only 5 pages, but be ready to write well. The final exam mainly requires you to have an extremely good recollection of the class material. Not much critical thought involved except for the essay section.",
    "I would recommend the course to a student who is very interested in monetary policy, as the material and guest lecturers were very interesting. The papers we read in addition to lecture were also valuable.",
    "Highly recommended, particularly for students interested in economic policy, or curious about what the Fed really does, particularly during\/after the crisis. Prof. English is phenomenal: he's a great expositor (he spent 20 years at the Fed figuring out how to clearly communicate this stuff) and genuinely cares about his students (his comments on papers are extremely thorough, he's very approachable and generous with his time in office hours, etc.). The reading (even the \"required\" reading) often feels optional since the lectures are so thorough; however, doing it (even\/especially the optional papers) will get you so much more out of this class."
