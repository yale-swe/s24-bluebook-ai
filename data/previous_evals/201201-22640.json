    "Only for architecture majors.",
    "This class' learning curve can be very daunting. You are expected to learn to how to use the woodshop, laser cuter, AutoCAD, Rhino, Photoshop, Illustration, and InDesign in a very short amount of time. Get ready for late nights in the studio. However, don't be scared, studio can be very fun and people can get very interesting at 4am in the morning. Also, you will get cool models out of this class. Also, this class can get very expensive. It will be challenging but Ariane and the TAs are very helpful, especially the TAs. Use the TAs as much as you can and don't afraid to ask them questions.",
    "If you want to be an architecture major, you will figure it out pretty quickly between this and Victor's drawing class. This class is super long, and know that you're going to be spending a lotttt of other evenings doing tutorials\/orientations in addition to class time. Model building is fun, you're kind of thrown into the deep end with it but they definitely improve over the semester. By the end of it, you're really tired of looking at one house for the entire class.",
    "A fantastic course. The expected production in the course is very high, and hard to meet but a great course.",
    "This and Arch 154 put together will be the entirety of your life. You will gain skills at a surprising rate, but this will mean that you will have time only for these classes. And even after four all-nighters in a row each week after spring break you will feel like there is no way that you can finish all of your work. Honestly, only take this course if it is imperative to your dreams.",
    "I would recommend this course only to students who are seriously committed to pursuing the architecture major and who understand the time commitment. I am hoping to double major, and scheduling has been very difficult. I feel like a lot of my other classes have to become secondary to architecture classes, and if you would be unhappy about that you might want to consider other courses. There is basically a new model assignment for the critique every week, plus an evening desk crit with TAs and sometimes an evening tutorial. You have to start early to be able to finish the assignments, and it sometimes seems impossible to finish anything to the level you'd like to. If you know that the major is what you want to do and are willing to sacrifice many other academic and personal commitments, then the class (and major program) could be a great thing for you.",
    "Wonderful class with a very steep learning curve\u0097you're exposed to almost every tool a grad student in architecture would use by the time midterms hit. Is probably my favorite, or second favorite, class at Yale. Perfect mix of analysis, physical construction, critique and thought process, revision. Took over my life, my dreams, my shower thoughts, etc... Definitely recommend it, but IT'S A LOT OF WORK. At least an all-nighter every week toward the end. Totally worth it. You end up with a body of work that you'll cherish like a herd of galloping babies. Deepens your understanding of your building, your architect, your own studies.",
    "The Analytic Model is meant to introduce you to thinking about architectural projects and different methods of representation for your analysis. Due to the fact that you have a ton to learn in one semester- not only in how to think about the house you are given but also how to use equipment, computer programs, and assemble models, the first half of the semester includes a lot of trial and error. That can be frustrating, especially towards the end when you have to generate enough concrete usable material for the final review. I would only recommend this class if you are going to major in it, not because it's not enjoyable, but because you have to be very interested in the material for the time spent to be worth it.",
    "An insane amount of work. Expect many all-nighters. But if you love architecture, you'll love it.",
    "I would only recommend this class to those interested in pursuing architecture, as it is a lot of work.",
    "This class is a ton of work. The class itself is 3 hours long in addition to desk crits with the TAs, and time in studio actually making models and using the computer. You also have tutorials to learn all the rendering programs, which is hard to learn in such a short amount of time. A lot is expected of you.",
    "I thought this class was awesome. A lot of work, but necessary and almost all enjoyable. From the analysis of the building and the diagram making to the model building, I thought we covered a lot of ground for an introductory class. The AutoCAD, Rhino, laser cutting, Illustrator and Photoshop tutorials were extremely helpful and now I think I've gotten a long way up the learning curve on all these programs. Our TAs were the best-- Christine and John were soooo helpful, and Christine was so supportive and enthusiastic about everyone's project. Ariane was super supportive too, and she and the TAs all had good ideas about how to take each model a step further."
