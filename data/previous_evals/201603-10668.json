   "comments": [
    "In this class, I was exposed to many new forms of art and learned how to be more mindful and present in my daily life.",
    "We had tons of guests and got to learn about various art industries because of it. We also talked about a lot about the value of taking time for ourselves, which was awesome but weird because that's not a thing that happens in many Yale courses, at least in my experience.",
    "I learned a lot about different artists and ways in which art can shape a person's identity and sense of purpose. The class also made me think critically about the importance of holistic development of the mind and body in addition to cultivating the intellectual mind. The two focuses are not in contradiction, but are in a harmonious pairing.",
    "This class helped me develop much more on a personal level rather than an academic level, which I think was a good thing for me this semester. I became better at opening up to new experiences and engaging with my own thoughts.",
    "This course focused on how to escape the cycle of stress and violence in our society. I learned about ways different art practices do the work of advocating for change in the systems that perpetuate that violence. The course itself was practice in finding ways to escape the stress that comes up at Yale. Finding ways to reflect on experience and really commit to taking time for oneself. It was an unsettling experience at times, but it was very helpful because it challenged me to learn that skill that is often very elusive."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The strengths of this course were the diverse range of experiences that students were exposed to. I genuinely looked forward to class each week, and unlike any other seminar, the class was broken into theory and practice each week. One possible weakness is that perhaps there could have been fewer experiences given; I would have liked to engage in some of the experiences for more than one brief hour.",
    "More people should take classes with Prof. Lee tbh",
    "This class was strange, and unlike anything I had ever done before. It took a long time to get used to the style but by the end, I realized what a gift participating in this class was. Though it was not difficult in a traditional sense, but it was a new kind of challenging learning experience. Professor Lee pushed us to be more mindful and conscious of the world around us and forced us to develop our own appreciation for the art we were doing. It is a class I will never forget and am so glad to have been a part of.",
    "The strength was definitely the guests who came to talk, though some were more valuable to the experience than others. A related weakness is that we always seemed to be running out of time, especially with the best guests, which is a good feeling to have in a 2-hour seminar. Another weakness is that we never talked about the readings in class so it felt like there was no reason to read them.",
    "I was so impressed with the speakers (with the exception of one) and really appreciated the opportunity to engage with the arts and spirituality in a classroom setting. However, I would've liked to learn more about theories of arts education and learn more about its implementation in classrooms. I also would've liked more discussions that were based in the text.",
    "The variety of experiences we had in the class was wonderful, and I felt like it was through these, Professor Lee's small lectures, and my own journaling that I grew the most during the course. The weakness, I think, was in the link between the academic sources we read and the rest of the class - as someone lacking a strong philosophy\/humanities\/education background, a lot of the readings went over my head a bit, and I didn't really get a chance to process them in class.",
    "This course was strong in that it practiced what it preached. The journal and other assignments focused on giving students space and time to explore what they wanted. I think it could be improved by focusing on one or two maybe three art forms. The \"experiences\" that were central to the learning of the course tended to be too broad ranging and weren't real experiences of the art form. Additionally, I think it would have been interesting to blend the theory into class discussion more. To provide a greater theoretical basis for the experiences."

   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this course, although it was academically less challenging, it was very difficult to allow myself to engage in different art experiences. The grading was unlike any other classes that I have taken which was at times a little unnerving",
    "ABSOLUTELY!",
    "Absolutely! This class will take you out of your comfort zone and force you to really think about the way you approach learning.",
    "This is a tough one. I always left this class feeling refreshed and more excited about life, but I'm not sure what I learned exactly, but I also think that was the point?? It felt at times like a weird experiment about what would happen if you gave stressed out Yalies zero expectations and had cool people come talk to them for two hours and sometimes they got to dance and paint and sing. (When it's put like that, I guess I would recommend it.)",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. However, it's not for everyone - if you are a very traditional learner, you might be discomforted by the class format. For me, though, the class opened up a lot of areas for personal growth.",
    "While we had very pleasant conversations about the arts themselves and the role they serve in our personal developments, I was hoping to have more of a clearer picture of how the arts influence society with explicit examples. It's a new course so it has the chance to develop, but I hope future versions will have a more concrete answer to the question of how exactly the arts can be used for social change.",
    "Yes. With some improvements in the experiences each week it could be a really great course. And it is a much needed breather from the hectic often crazy workload of Yale courses. Professor Lee is brilliant, creative and very thoughtful about her students."
