    "It is a challenging but excellent course. I have learned a lot from this course. No weaknesses at all. I will recommend it to others.",
    "overall the course is very good. The only problem is the homework is to much and need a long time to learn it by ourselves.",
    "it covers theory of survival analysis, but I think the structure of this course needs improvement",
    "This course covers many classical topics in survival analysis, introducing the theoretical framework behind the frequently used methods, which helps students to understand those methods in depth. Lectures are interesting and go into necessary details. My advice, if any, would be balancing the frequency of homework before and after the midterm so that students can maintain the same level of engagement.",
    "This course offers us a relatively comprehensive view of theoretical survival analysis. Most of the content in this course is quite hardcore and a thorough understanding requires solid stochastic process background. The pace of this course is a bit fast and requires a lot of after efforts to keep up with. Also, assignments from this course are mostly further extension of lecture, which makes this course even tougher. So it takes quite some efforts and time to be in this course, but it is also rewarding if you could make it."
