   "comments": [
    "Learned some new math (on the fly; kind of wish I had taken more math prior to this course) and how to think about things on the quantum level.",
    "This course gave me my first introduction to quantum mechanics, going from the origins and building up to the quantum mechanics of atoms and molecules, which is a whole new world.",
    "Made me a lot more comfortable with operator algebra. I now understand orbital theory on a much more profound level.",
    "Deeper understanding of a quantum mechanical view of the world\/atoms",
    "I learned about where atomic orbital theory comes from and all of the theories needed in order to get there. I also learned how to work hard and how to get absolutely crushed by exams.",
    "By the final, I had a thorough understanding of the mathematical construction of the molecular model. Really cool stuff.",
    "There is a lot of quantum physics as it applies to chemistry as expected.",
    "Knowledge: Failures of classical mechanics such as UV catastrophe, crystalline solids heat capacity, photoelectric effect, atomic model Quantum physics problems: free particle, particle in a 1D\/2D\/3D box, particle on a ring, particle on a sphere, perturbation, variational theorem Real chemistry models: hydrogenic atom, multi-electron atom, atomic orbitals, spin orbitals, spin-orbit coupling, molecular orbitals Skills: Linear algebra and differential calculus applied to advanced chemistry problems: operators, eigenvalues, eigenfunctions, basis sets, commutators, Slater determinants, secular determinants Extreme algebraic manipulation Visualization of complicated functions, graphs and 3D systems Ideas from probability and statistics: expected values, uncertainties Time management and hard work Insights: Classical mechanics is wrong and only works in extreme limits Everything is a wavefunction and everything you want to know about everything can be derived by using mathematics on the wavefunctions Identification of orbitals and quantum-level phenomenon from nodes and incomplete information Thinking of chemistry in terms of electron clouds, densities and uncertainties Many things are quantized, not continuous",
    "I learned that quantization of energy is needed to explain several experimental observations that classical physical science fails to explain, including the stability of the atom, the hydrogen spectral lines, and the temperature dependence of the heat capacity of a crystal lattice. This energy quantization is achieved using quantum mechanics. The state of a quantum mechanical system is defined by a wavefunction. The wavefunction will be a linear combination of eigenfunctions of any quantum mechanical operator (such as the energy operator H). The eigenvalues associated with each eigenfunction represent the possible energies of the system. Unconstrained systems (like a free particle) do not have quantized energies, but quantization is imposed through the imposition of boundary conditions (such as the need of the wavefunction to be single-valued in the particle-on-a-ring). I then learned how to apply quantum mechanics to understand simple atoms and molecules. Some (like the hydrogenic atom) can be modeled exactly. Combining some simplifying assumptions (like the Born-Oppenheimer approximation and the central-field approximation) with perturbation theory or the variational theorem allows us to extend the hydrogenic atom solution to understand multi-electronic atoms and simple molecules. I have thereby gained a better understanding of certain properties of chemistry. For example, I now know why no more than two electrons can occupy the same orbital (the total wavefunction must be antisymmetric) and why the lowest energy state maximizes spin multiplicity (a symmetric spin function implies an antisymmetric spatial function, which minimizes electron-electron repulsion).",
    "I learned basic concepts in Linear Algebra, namely operators and their arithmetic, in addition to the funadmental principles of quantum mechanics. This course changed the way I viewed Chemistry, and elucidated my understanding of basic chemical behavior.",
    "I did not gain much skill from this class because I was constantly overwhelmed by the sheer amount of material assigned. I was unable to properly learn anything because I was always trying to catch up, as I could not take a 3 course semester necessary to actually have time to succeed in this class.",
    "Learned how to push my studying to its limits. Also learned a lot regarding quantum mechanics, though still confused on how to apply them to chemistry in a meaningful way.",
    "This course allowed me to develop a deeper insight into physical chemistry, specifically the quantum realm. Additionally, I strengthened my problem solving skills as well, and was able to think through more challenging problems in a more precise manner. At the end of the course, I definitely feel like I have accrued quite a bit of knowledge about some of the model problems of quantum mechanics, as well as physical intuition behind the chemistry, particularly the electronic orbitals."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Would be useful to maybe go a little slower through the learning about eigenfunctions and dirac\/bra-ket notation -- by the time I had these really figured out I was already behind",
    "Strengths: detailed, but not too math-oriented introduction to quantum mechanics, with applications in chemistry. Very dedicated professor and TAs. Weaknesses: it was very frustrating that the things on the problem sets were only covered in class AFTER the due date of the p-set. I feel like I could have learned a lot more by applying knowledge learned in class to the problems, instead of trying to learn it myself and having no clue what was going on until after I turned the homework in.",
    "Strengths: Very thorough treatment of quantum mechanics for an undergraduate level. Even things that are not derived specifically in class (slightly more complex treatments) are described in separate handouts. Weaknesses: P-sets are sometimes too long when they involve tedious, long algebra and calculus.",
    "The material is extremely interesting, and intriguing, but the organization of the class could be improved. I think it would be helpful to make linear algebra a prereq for the course because linear combinations, eigenvectors and values, as well as inner product spaces are major themes in this course. I also think that it would super helpful if after the presentation of a type of solution (i.e. particle in a box, HO...) there was a quick summary of what the equation is, what its energy eigenvalues are, and for things where angular and spin momentum can be determined include those as well. Just one slide, or something where all of the information is concise and not hidden over multiple equation filled slides, or packets. Also just a day at the end before the final where a general overview of the material covered is given, because I have walked away from this class with a super disorganized mess of equations, and ideas. Reading week has helped slightly put them into order, but I struggle knowing what I should study because the material seems infinite. If a finite boundary (perhaps one of infinite potential) could be put around the material that would help. However, the course is amazing and has made me think about the world in a whole new way.",
    "I think problem sets would be more useful if we learned the material beforehand, rather than learning bits and pieces from the questions followed by a full explanation the next class.",
    "The first half of the class was engaging in its presentation of the difference between explaining natural phenomena using classical vs. quantum mechanics In general, material was covered too quickly and with too much background knowledge assumed. Basic ideas were not explained clearly, and as a result, complex topics built on these basic ideas were incredibly difficult to understand.",
    "You learn a ton from this class and Vaccaro is a pretty good lecturer, but the only problem is he covers way too much material in the given time such that it's pretty difficult to have a solid grasp of anything. Workload was fair - problem sets were long and they kept covering material that wouldn't be covered in lecture until after they were turned in. Exams were actually pretty reasonable (I thought); the only problem was that since there was so much content it's basically impossible to study all of it. Overall a solid introduction to quantum chemistry but really could have been a lot more manageable if we went slower and cut down on some of the content.",
    "There are MANY ways in which this course could be improved. Though the professor is very dedicated and a clear lecturer, he has organized the course in such a way that hinders student learning rather than helps it. For example, though the lectures are useful, it is immensely more helpful to read his lecture notes for each subject (especially because the textbook for the course is completely useless, so we have no other way to access the material). However, lecture notes can only be accessed on CLOSED RESERVE at the CSSSI (for a maximum check-out time of two hours with a fine of $1 per minute if we go over), and there's only one copy of each packet in the single binder containing course materials (with no photocopies or pictures permitted). Although students are generally collaborative and work well with each other, it is unfair to create inter-student competition for access to the lecture notes; for example, multiple students may need to read the same packet at once (and it takes hours to read a single packet) and we end up having to wait hours or rush to the CSSSI ahead of everyone else before the library even opens so that we can be first to get the binder. All of this, just to have access to course materials and read the notes! This is ridiculous. I understand that the professor wants to retain access to his intellectual property, but the point of this class is that the students learn, and this is hindering that aim; at the very least, he could put up multiple binders or multiple copies of each packet, if he doesn't want to put course materials online. On top of this, the CSSSI is open at hours inconvenient to undergraduates (for example, doesn't open until 1 pm on Sundays and closes earlier than other libraries) and is as far as it gets from student dorms (especially since there isn't a reliable shuttle on weekends). At a certain point, I had injured myself and had to limp my way up science hill with no shuttle just to study for this class, and my friends couldn't send pictures of the material because this isn't permitted. Additionally, though the problem sets are helpful for learning the course material, they are given in advance of the corresponding lectures instead of afterwards. This also hinders student learning because it forces us to learn the material from the TAs ahead of time so we can actually complete the assignments, then by the time we go to lecture on the topic, the lecture just feels useless. This class is a requirement for all chemistry majors, and none of us would be here if we were afraid of the difficult course material. We're not afraid of it, and we're excited to learn quantum chemistry. What makes this course difficult, especially since it's a required course, is all the logistical factors that get in the way of actually learning the material.",
    "The sheer volume of information was ridiculous. Each lecture was 5 or 6 pages worth of notes making studying ridiculously hard. Cutting out some of the side topics and tangent would be helpful in streamlining the important information and not overloading people.",
    "This class is way too tough. Material should be better outlined and a new textbook should be assigned. The exams should not be as long or detail-oriented. I did not feel as though the exams accurately tested my knowledge or understanding of the material.",
    "I think there should be a better way to make sure students are getting the material. There are many resources but for some reason it is not as effective as I would think.",
    "This course was excellent and probably the best chemistry course I have taken. As you might expect, however, it consumes your life. Instructor: Professor Vaccaro is phenomenal and my favorite professor at Yale. First of all, he is a structured, clear and reasonable lecturer. He has extensive notes and has taught this course enough times that if you listen attentively in class, you will understand everything pretty well. He is also exceptionally dedicated to the course more than any professor I have ever met. He produces a range of complicated hand-outs on major questions in the course that are too complicated to discuss in class; each is formatted so perfectly that it must take hours to write and make. He has written all of his lecture notes in a massive folder available in CSSSI that you can access before exams. He personally checks all the exams and gives a lot of partial credit and tries his best to make sure everyone does well. He also has office hours every MWF for 1 hour after every lecture and makes himself accessible at other times too. He genuinely cares about the class and students. He reaches out to people who dont do well in exams and is always encouraging about difficulties you face. He challenges you but in a very reasonable way. The exams are fair and very conceptual. The problem sets are much harder but he guides you through every problem in the assignment itself. He trains the TAs to teach in specific ways and makes sure the quality of the course is high. Course content: The course is hard and not hard at the same time. It just takes a lot of time. But if you put in the hard work, spend a lot of time reading his materials, go to him to ask questions, religiously complete all the problem sets etc. you will certainly do well. The course rewards hard work and dedication. In general, however, if you are a pro- at linear algebra and differential calculus, the course should be quite easy for you (I didnt know any linear algebra and the course teaches you everything so if you are not familiar, no worries) The material is very interesting if you give it a chance. It seems mechanical and overly mathematical sometimes (there are very few fun molecules, colors, chemicals etc. in this course) but it makes you think about fundamental ideas and first principles. You really start from scratch in this course and by the end, everything you learned in chemistry classes before makes a lot more real sense (more sense than someone just telling you that chemistry is a bunch of facts) Course assignments: The problem sets are long and somewhat painful but the best part is that they can be completed without any additional study\/note-taking. All the instructions for finishing the problem sets are in the p-set itself. You can often refer to the notes to check some answers but this isnt always clear and not always necessary. They take 8 hours on average (one or two are much harder and take 10+). I must say that the problem set due during reading period is still quite ridiculous and drains an unfair amount of time from other courses. The final exam was also too extreme for the time duration. There shouldnt have been TWICE the amount of True and False. Moreover, each question was longer and worth more points! The entire exam was twice the size in less time. It was quite pointless to try to understand the material and finish it all.",
    "Prof. Vaccaro is one of the most dedicated and hardest-working professors Ive ever had. He is meticulously organized, and is willing to spend a ton of his own time preparing course material and meeting with students. The material is well-presented, and although it is quite difficult, it is explained very clearly. Many of the handouts (such as The Schrodinger Equations and pretty much all of the later handouts, especially Time-Independent Preturbation Theory, Nodes in the Big-Phi Functions, The Variational Theorem, and Variational LCAO-MO Approximations) were incredibly helpful. The homeworks were generally interesting, but I would recommend making them a little more conceptual. Many of them, especially the early ones, essentially walked us through the problems. I think its good to have a walkthrough when it enables us to stretch the material weve learned to do something cool, like modeling a molecule using 2D-particle-in-a-box. However, it shouldnt be possible to do most of the problem set unless you really understand why you are doing what youre doing. (If you make the problems more conceptually difficult, you may want to make the problems computationally easier or shorter to compensate). I would also recommend doing something about the fact that many students really dont know linear algebra\/math. I had previously taken linear algebra\/multivariable calculus, and I think a lot of my friends were really hurt on the exams because there were certain basic concepts they missed (operators, basis sets, Eulers formula, etc.) Otherwise, I dont really have that much I would change. It would be nice to have an extra copy of the class notes in the library, as often there werent enough copies to go around before exams. (That could be in place of the handouts\/projected materials, which we can get online anyway).",
    "This course would be greatly improved by providing better support and study materials for the exams. Having no practice exam for the final, in addition to having relatively little time between studying for the second midterm and the final, made exam preparation very difficult. Moreover, exams differed greatly in difficulty and format from the challenge of problem sets. Despite extensive studying and successful completion of problem sets, I felt unprepared for the second and final exams.",
    "You will learn a lot in this class but it will also take over your life. The class is taught very well but it expects a lot out of you but if you put in the work you'll learn a lot. The class could be improved by having a textbook that goes along with the class or if the notes for the class were posted online instead of checking them out from the library. The class also has 4 hour midterms which doesn't seem necessary.",
    "You learn a ton from this class and this is great if you love pchem. However the workload is way more when compared to any other class at yale. If you don't love pchem the class takes over your semester.",
    "Unreasonable class, poorly taught, would have dropped it if it wasn't required for my major. Prof Vaccaro is practically sadistic.",
    "This course is so much work! While I did ultimately feel satisfied with the knowledge and perspective I had gained, I found the only real way to prepare for the grueling midterm exams was to read Professor Vaccaro's notes which he kept in a library on reserve. While these were great, it was annoying that this was the best way to begin understanding material on my own. This course is very thorough, and therefore is an incredible amount of work. The problem sets will all take numerous hours and a lot of hair pulling. The biggest weakness of this course, by far, is that there is a problem set due during Reading Period. The large amount of work is somewhat understandable during the regular semester, but the reading week problem set ensured that I had no ability to prepare for any of my final exams thoroughly, including my final exam for this course! During an entire semester of feeling like Professor Vaccaro cared about his students this one final blow was shocking.",
    "The greatest weakness of this course is the enormous and unacceptable amount of work assigned to this class. Professor Vaccaro expects students to be able to dedicate over 15 hours a week (not including lecture and section) to learning the material and over 25 hours a week attempting to solve the problem sets. This results in the students being stressed and barely able to learn anything. Additionally, it is unacceptable to assign psets on material not yet covered. Without a solid textbook (the one assigned is frequently criticized and rarely mentioned by Vaccaro) it is impossible to understand any of the psets until maybe the night before it's due, even though with understanding it would take over 15 hours. In my opinion, I was so stressed and overwhelmed by this course, there were no strengths.",
    "The course required a huge amount of time. Additionally, it would be nice to have more, less heavily weighted assessments because two four-hour midterms and a final meant that a few nights determined your grade in a class that basically consumed your semester. The course was well-organized and section was helpful.",
    "The biggest strength of the class is that it is very logically organized to go through quantum mechanics in an efficient manner that makes more sense. However, there were a few weaknesses with the class, particularly in some of the math that was used along the way. It always felt like there was quite the information overload, and it felt like I had to really focus on every resource handed out for the class in order to be able to answer exam questions. Exams were definitely designed with students having full mastery in mind, and that was quite the difficult feat because a lot of the math was reliant on linear algebra, which is not a pre-requisite for the class. In addition, information to solve problems was often found in handouts rather than in main lecture notes. However, there was a good overlap between the type of question asked on problem sets and on the exams, which was a good source of preparation for exams."

   "comments": [
    "Solid course with a really dedicated professor -- hard work but there's definitely a lot of support available.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone interested in the inner workings of chemistry. Knowing quantum mechanics is integral to understanding the structure and behavior of small particles, atoms, and molecules, which is applicable to almost any part of chemistry or biology. Although tough at times, you learn a lot in the course.",
    "Would definitely recommend; however, if you are looking at this course evaluation you most likely have to take it anyway.",
    "I would recommend this course because the topics are just super interesting. It is hard, and I think linear algebra should be a prerequisite, but Vaccaro is an amazing professor. If you are going to take it, try and leave open space in your schedule for you to really delve into the material, otherwise it tends to form this amorphous cloud of information you don't fully grasp above your head before each midterm. The homework sets aren't bad if you start more than two days before. They will take 10 hours at a minimum so set aside that time. They are normally pretty fun, so it isn't tedious to work on them by any means. Once again, take it, but leave time for it.",
    "DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS unless you are absolutely required. This class with Vaccaro was honestly the worst class I have ever taken. Vaccaro lectures with the expectation that you have a pretty solid understanding of differential equations and linear algebra. He tries to pack so much material that the concepts on psets are often not touched upon until the day they're due (Friday). There were many weeks that I would be doing psets without any knowledge of the concepts, at all. This class has not been conductive to my learning because the exams are quite frankly too difficult. Averages are always in the mid 60s with the high a 97 and low a 19. The spread is far too wide, but one should realize that there are geniuses who will always score near perfect. I studied for a week straight, not doing any other homework, and could not pull away from the average on a midterm. Midterms are extremely stressful. 10 true\/false questions and two questions long form questions, usually taken between 7pm-11pm. Honestly, I would have scored the same on my midterms if I hadn't studied. I regret spending weeks on the material because the exams take a base level concept and expands it to ask you problems you haven't seen before, so no amount of studying can really help you. Yes, I know what a eigenfunction is and I know the wave functions of a molecular orbital but please don't ask me how to form the equations from peanut pictures-- that's just ridiculous.",
    "Would not recommend this course to another student unless he\/she is a chemistry major (and must take it) or is especially fascinated by quantum mechanics and its relationship to chemistry. A strong math background would also help, although it is possible to get through the course having only taken MATH 120. Quite challenging.",
    "All the other reviews from past years are true - problem sets take easily 10 hours a week and cover stuff you won't get to until you turn them in, you meet throughout reading period and have a pset due the day before finals begin, the midterms take all night and the second one is on the last week of classes - so this class is a ridiculous amount of work. That said you get a solid introduction to quantum chemistry, but the only problem is there's just so much material that you don't have the time to fully understand anything and it's therefore not as good as it could be. The exams are actually fair and doable if you realize that half the stuff he teaches you is really unnecessary - but the problem is knowing which half that is. Ultimately I think you do get a lot out from this class, but it's probably not worth the stress and time and effort you put in. Go to your TAs for help, go to the peer tutor, email \/ talk to Vaccaro (he's very accessible and wants everyone to succeed), and don't fall behind and you might just make it out okay. If you're a Chem\/Chem E major I guess you have no choice but to take it, so good luck and godspeed.",
    "I would not take this course unless you have to. While you learn a lot, the amount that is expected from you is completely unreasonable.",
    "If you for some reason love calculus and quantum physics, take this class! If you don't, just take it if it's required because it's rigorous.",

    "Are you not satisfied with the excruciating amount of work from pchem lab? You don't think your life as a chemistry is shitty enough? No problem, here is pchem 2, brought to you by Patrick Vaccaro. Imagine all the work that you did in pchem lab and pair it with a ridiculously dense subject and extremely unreasonable expectations and you got yourself pchem 2. Get ready for 4 hours long exams in the middle of the night (because no sane human being can finish Vaccaro's exams under regular class time), and psets that will ruin your weekends. Remember how much fun you had in orgo learning about that subject? Well you won't have to! This course will only touch chemistry when you get to the last lecture, until then, enjoy a semester full of long equations, handouts, and poor jokes about bananas and tangerines. Also, someone should call the forestry school because I am pretty sure that Vaccaro chops down a whole acre of forest to supply this class with handouts.",
    "This is a really excellent course. The material is fascinating, and the lectures are clear and well-organized. Prof. Vaccaro is probably the most dedicated professor Ive ever had. If you ask most professors a question with no easy answer, theyll say its complicated, or at best send you some reading material. If you ask Prof. Vaccaro that question, hell make a handout about it. There are currently about thirty such handouts, and many of them (especially The Schrodinger Equations and The Variational Theorem) are excellent supplements to the course material. If you go to all the classes, do all the problem sets, STUDY HARD for exams, and read some of the handouts, youll learn a lot about quantum mechanics. All that being said, this is not an easy course. Prof. Vaccaro works really hard, and he expects you to do the same. The problem sets are difficult (~10-12 hours per week), and there is one during reading period. The midterms are hard, and I studied over twenty hours for each (theyre also four hours long, and at night). To study for them, I would recommend taking notes on his class notes (which are on reserve in the CSSSI). Make sure you understand all the math up to The Harmonic Oscillator. Go over the problem setsmaterial on them IS fair game for the exam. Practice drawing wavefunctions, and study their properties (equations, energy eigenvalues, parity, orthonormality, etc.) Look at the reference sheet, and make sure you know where the equations come from. Make sure you understand key mathematical concepts (operators, eigenfunctions, Eulers formula, basis sets) especially if you havent taken linear algebra. If you do all of that, you can definitely do well in the course.",
    "If you're taking this class you probably have to but I did find it very interesting. It's a lot of work though and quite challenging so I'm not sure I'd recommend it if you don't have to take it unless you're very interested in the material and willing to put in a lot of effort.",
    "absolutely not, was completely horrible",
    "This course is a tremendous amount of work, both in volume and in intellectual workload. Problem sets were grueling and material was confusing, but I now feel that I have a much deeper understanding of chemistry. Going through the course I was basically lost the entire time. It wasn't until I read through Professor Vaccaro's lecture notes (that he keeps on reserve in a library) again that I began to piece together everything. Having had no backgound in linear algebra or differential equations, there was a bit of a hurdle, but Professor Vaccaro does his best to explain everything. The midterm exams are also a grueling marathon. Even though there's an option to take them in class, they really require the 4 hour after-class time slot. Yes, they really take 4 hours. Overall this course was a climb. I hated it while working late nights on psets, but it is really fascinating to learn Quantum Mechanics in one semester. The only gripe, and it is a big one for me, was that there was a problem set assigned during Reading Period. This pretty much guaranteed I couldn't study for any of my finals, including the one for this class. In a semester where Professor Vaccaro really seemed to care about student understanding and success, this was a shocking low blow.",
    "Never take this course. Do not take it, unless you are taking a 3 credit semester. Professor Vaccaro does not lecture well, because he spits out so much information with al the same emphasis, you have no idea what is truly important to the course. A strong lecture would provide information and highlight thigns truly important to students taking quantum mechanics the first time, rather than emphasize every single thing that comes out of his mouth. This class will waste all of your time and energy, hurting the effort you attempt to bring to other courses. The psets will be over material likely not covered yet in lecture, so good luck with that. The exams are seemingly arbitrary and lucky, only being three total questions, so good luck identifying the two topic that will make up 80% of the exam without Professor Vaccaro providing any insight - meaning you have to study over 100 pages of difficult chemistry and math, for only 3 pages of it to show up on the exam.",
    "Take this course if you want to learn quantum mechanics and don't have any other time-consuming classes.",
    "I would only recommend this class to another student if they have to take it for major requirements, as it is quite the investment of time and energy to learn the material. The course is very rigorous, and the exams expect complete mastery of material, making studying quite the endeavor. Overall, the class is good for learning physical chemistry, particularly quantum chemistry, but it begins to feel like a math and physics class, and the problem sets and other resources provided in the class can reflect this. If that sounds like an amazing time, then perhaps this is the class for you, but it was a lot of work, and should not be taken lightly."
