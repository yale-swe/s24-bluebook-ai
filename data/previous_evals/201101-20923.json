    "A class *not* for those who don't a large amount of weekly reading, but very rewarding if you are willing to put in the effort. An excellent introduction to the literature of the C18th, but for those completely new to the period some contextual reading prior to the class might help (basic Irish and British history, a knowledge of epic poetry). I would definitely recommend this class!",
    "It's THE class to take, even if you don't think you're interested in 18th century English literature or satire. It thoroughly fills the gap between the many 17th and 19th century English literature courses on offer each semester."
