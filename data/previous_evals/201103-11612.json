    "Great Senior Thesis Adviser. Provided lots of insightful direction for my paper.",
    "Great way to explore a topic you're passionate about, but tough to self-motivate. Definitely find a topic you're interested in.",
    "Yes, if you find a topic that you're interested in. Pretty serious commitment, so make sure you have a good one.",
    "Do 2 terms. Much better than 1 term essay.",
    "I wrote a one-term essay and it was a lot of work towards the end. I would not recommend this option unless you have a topic selected and some research done going in. (I did some research over the summer.) That said, writing a senior essay is an awesome experience. Find an adviser who's invested in your success and a topic you're passionate about, and it's a really worthwhile experience.",
    "You either want to write a thesis or you don't want to. It's not required, so maybe you shouldn't.",
    "A senior essay is valuable if you are interested in graduate school. Otherwise, it is simply a waste of time.",
    "Yes, I definitely recommend ECON 491 to anyone passionate about researching a specific topic in economics.",
    "A great experience that any serious econ major should consider.",
    "write a thesis... really weak to not attempt writing one semi-significant in the major",
    "Do it! It isn't mandatory, but you will grow as a person and a scholar.",
    "It's tough, because you need to create your own work schedule, but it's very rewarding if there's something you're really interested in. It's a great opportunity to work closely with a professor and get to experience how a real research project takes shape from start to finish.",
    "Good way to get to know a professor very well. If you don't have a topic, reach out to profs!!"
