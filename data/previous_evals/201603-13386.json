   "comments": [
    "The instructional classes should be used to teach practical methods\/approaches to tackle a variety of related\/common sustainability business challenges, instead of bringing in guest speakers to present on green certifications. This course has a lot of potential, and if we could grow the client base each year, we'd have a better understanding of the status of corporate sustainability. Instead, we have revolving door clients, and our collective memory of what it means to tackle environment\/business problems is limited in scope, due to lack of exposure.",
    "Defining a scope and goal of the projects that is challenging and keep students interest going. In general both for my project and the other projects in the class I feel no one did any real work.",
    "The course requires written materials to meet a Flesch readability score of 35 or greater and use no passive voice. This requirement is well meaning but leads to perverse incentives while focusing student effort and time on making reports less professional. The admirable goal would be better met by requiring students to work with advisors from the Yale Center for Teaching and Learning's writing program, or by consulting with professional communicators employed by F&ES and CBEY."

The lectures don't do much, and then we have to apply our existing skills\/approaches to solve client problems, which is problematic.",

    "Generally, yes. I appreciated the thought frameworks reviewed in the early part of the semester, and would appreciate more topics on how consultants do their work. This could include analysis tools, client communications, and client recruitment and development. In addition, the course would benefit with one or two sessions on managing human resources in a consulting environment."
