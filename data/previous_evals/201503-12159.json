    "Believe the reviews, this class is very cool. You will leave with an entirely different perspective on maps and mapmaking, as well as a highly-developed analytical mindset that is always useful. Dr. Rankin is also an incredibly friendly guy.",
    "A wonderful class that discusses all the complexity and subtlety of maps -- you'll never look at them, territory or identity the same way again. Keep in mind it is an intensive course, that a lot of the discussion does get theoretical and that you are expected to contribute in class. Overall though, a wonderful experience and a must-take (if you can) before you graduate.",
    "This was an excellent course that I would highly recommend to anyone interested in nation-state formation, the relationship between technology and power, or postcolonial theory (or, I suppose, maps). Although the topic sounds extremely specific, there's something for everyone in this class: you'll learn a lot about cartography, sure, but as Professor Rankin promises on the first day, this isn't a class on the \"history of cartography\" so much as a sustained discussion on \"how to think about maps.\" The questions guiding this course are abstract -- e.g. what makes a good historical argument? how do we read a piece of technology as a vector for philosophical and political content? how are the sciences used to configure power relations, especially in the context of imperialism? -- but the specificity of the material brings them down to earth, and allows for focused, productive engagement. Professor Rankin runs a tight ship, and he's reason enough to take this class -- he's extremely well-prepared, knowledgable, and caring, and the course material really comes alive in his hands. He's a great seminar leader, and I felt that the discussions from week to week built on one another better than in any other seminar I'd taken. The assignments are very well thought-out, and most of the readings are quite good.",
    "This class explores the fascinating intersection of cartography, historiography, post-colonialism, and art history. Focusing on both the history and method of cartography, the class is excellent at probing how notions of territory and identity intersect and conflict. The assignments are interesting and allow you to pursue whatever you're interested in within the course, and the readings are really eye-opening. It may at first appear to be a niche subject, but it will change the way you look at maps forever. No joke.",
    "Professor Rankin is brilliant, down-to-earth, and caring with his students. He was the highlight of this class for me!",
    "AMAZING class. Best class I have taken at Yale!!!!!!!! I was really fascinated by maps before I took the class, and I came out of it seeing them in a totally different and more complex way. The critical reading of maps as texts that was done in this class helped develop a skill set I will take to other future classes. I actively looked forward to going to class each week, in part because the breakdown of the long seminar was great-map discussion, reading discussion, short feedback on class projects. Professor Rankin is so engaging, knowledgeable, and insightful. My classmates were all also very engaged, and I learned from everyone in the room. The readings for class require a lot of work, and Rankin has high standards for the work that students submit. I think these standards were a strength of the class, as it pushed me to write more precisely and clearly. Overall, I can't recommend this class highly enough. TAKE IT."
