    "The field trips were way too concentrated to the end of the semester -- and several took WAY too long\/longer than was useful. It often felt like we were having a field trip just to have one and not to highlight some really useful lesson that we couldn't gain from a power point.",
    "Field trip value: I think we could get more out of field trips if we had a lecture in class that prepared us for them technically more in depth, e.g. sewage treatment technology and processes.",
    "The workload was disproportionate to other classes. 5 discussion sessions, 4 fieldtrips and 4 response papers, 4 homework assignment on top of a written finals took up a lot of non-class time commitments.",
    "My biggest problem with this class is that it has a lot going on, and takes so much additional time outside of class designated to field trips and discussion sections. He also changed the course and\/or discussion section meeting times often, which was frustrating. There's a lot going on apart from readings and lectures--section, fieldtrips, response papers, homeworks...and it's hard to keep track of it all. It's also more heavy on the latter half of the semester.",
    "The book used as part of the course was great. It explained the concepts very clearly and complemented the lectures in a magnificent way. The instructor is very clear on lectures and puts a lot of effort in answering every student's questions, he also promoted discussions in the classroom and extra discussion sessions of the field trips. Very good course.",
    "The course for me was a mix bag. Though it was well structured and useful it covered a 'lot' of materials.Besides, the class session was nearly three hours a week and also included a discussion session for about an hour and a field trip which was three to four hours. However, i got to learn more from the field trips. In addition, the class size was too big to make it more interactive.The instructor was excellent while the TAs were very helpful.",
    "More time should be spent in class covering the field trips. As it stands, it feels as though they are tacked onto the syllabus and not integrated into the class well. Separate discussion sections are not helpful.",
    "The problem sets were very useful. I think a few more of these towards the end would be good, and at least one fieldtrip in the earlier part of the course.",
    "Qu 9a. The field trips cpuld be more spread out.",
    "- I thought the number of fieldtrips was fine, but i think students had a little difficulty planning because they didnt start until the second half of the semester (this is to say, i think logistics would work out better if fieldtrips and required sections ran the course of the semester instead of only the second half).- In terms of out of class assignments, the response papers to the field trips, while a valuable exercise were perhaps a little monotonous. maybe giving one, or a list, of thought provoking questions or issues students might comment on would help to direct analysis a little more.- Prof Anisfeld is incredibly knowledgeable, seems committed to teaching, and covers a lot of material. sometimes lectures felt a little dry - maybe switching between methods of presentation (powerpoint\/other) would be a good fix for this.- TAs were responsive, ran sections in a structured and directed fashion. Nathan in particular was excellent at synthesizing discussion.",
    "I audited this course; and thus simply went to the lectures and did not work on homeworks or attend fieldtrips.",
    "Great course - but content is very scattered! Would love for lecture notes to be more consistently organized, and also wish there was greater integration and tie-in with the fieldtrips. I think the fieldtrips are valuable in themselves, but just that they don't necessarily correlate with the classwork.",
    "This is a very interesting class, however, it is clearly a survey class and to be comprehensive, a lot of material has to be covered. This leads to a somewhat superficial engagement with many topics. Also, the class was large and there were a few people with a lot of extraneous questions and comments, which made the pace of the class a little hectic - Shimi clearly tries very hard to both accommodate the questions as well as get through the material, but sometimes I wish he had been more consequent about cutting short discussions that might have interested some students, but not the large majority. However, his excellent preparation and accessibility to students made this a very good experience.",
    "Water resource issues are important for anyone to know about, regardless of area of focus."

    "The instructor - clearly knows a lot, but will also admit to not knowing something.",

   "comments": [
    "The class either needs to be a 4 credit course, or have greater flexibility in scheduling. Having all the field trips and required discussion sections AFTER spring break was total overkill. It made this the most time-consuming class at FES for me, and often felt perfunctory. Plus it was a bit inconsistent to require such significant outside of class time, when we didn't even get our homework assignments or discussion papers back prior to the next being due (or even before the class ended for the term). The outside of class activities need to be spread more evenly throughout the semester, and planned for from the very beginning. The discussion sections were scheduled by a raising of hands one day in class and conflicted with several other FES classes, leaving VERY little flexibility for many of us.",
    "Some content too general. More case studies, perhaps? More hard skills learning. More economics.",
    "The evening discussion sessions should be dropped. They are an overkill.More numerical problems would be nice.",
    "too many rigid requirements with the field trips&discussion sections. lectures a bit boring; hard to concentrate.",
    "The class was too big to have productive discussions. Discussion sessions helped but the discussion among students during class time weren't that engaging always, mostly because there were too many people.",
    "I thought this class was a bit too broad and not enough deep. I would have preferred if we left off a topic or two in order to go into greater depth with something.Also, the field trips shouldn't be so backloaded. The first half of the semester required little commitment, then at the end of the semester we had two lectures, one field trip, one discussion section, and one review paper due each week. Gotta spread that out!",
    "The time commitment for the class very strenuous while the class size was too big to make the class interactive.",
    "Field trip and discussion session time commitment was too much.",
    "The way field trips and discussion sections are used -- wasn't helpful at all.",
    "A change in the structure of the lectures. Questions were openly invited and encouraged, but this had the disadvantage of allowing for many superfluous questions which slowed the general pace of the lecture and the content reviewed. Of course, this is the fault of the students more than the professor.",
    "The spacing of the field trips. Also, the out of class structured time commitments were fairly arduous.",
    "For some of the topics it would help to have more images in the slides.",
    "Guidance on the purpose or focus going into field trips. i.e. what we should be looking for so the the information is not too broad.",
    "The field trips are an important component of the course. The field trip response papers and the discussion sessions are overkill. Either response papers or discussion sessions would be appropriate, but not both. Being required to attend a discussion session for field trip you didn't attend is not helpful and leads to confusion. Field trip response papers are helpful because completing them requires you to reflect on the field trip, but they should not be graded - credit should be received for completing them. Grading response papers, and specifically grading the papers on how well they \"critique\" a field trip is not a good idea. This approach works for things like the Zyg Platter field trip or the Water movie, but does not really work for the actual field trips. You're asking people who have little information or experience to critique something, which puts them in a \"critique\" mindset instead of a \"learning\" mindset. It is possible to respond to something without critiquing it. One certainly has a response to a stormwater basin, but asking someone to specifically write a critique of a stormwater basin (or stormwater management in general based on literally, seeing two stormwater basins) is flawed. If they have a critique to share that's fine, but the grading system shouldn't be designed to require a critique. Ultimately, the people who build the systems (engineers, planners, etc.) end up not listening to people who have learned to critique with little background knowledge. Teach to learn, think, reflect and yes critique - but don't force artificial critique.",
    "- perhaps more depth if possible (i dont know if it is given that it is a survey course)- perhaps a little more hands on work?- some of the problem sets could use a little refining- changing up lecturing style, away from powerpoint sometimes.",
    "I would try to improve the pace of the course. So many people asked questions during class it was difficult to keep up with the syllabus. Also, I would try to make the class a little more interactive, by adding short homework assignments or making lecture more interactive.",
    "The slides (though excellent) sometimes were hard to follow in order. A way of structuring the slides would be very helpful.",
    "Discussion sections poorly run and managed - a lot better preparation could be used both in terms of the TAs (material they can work on to engage class) and for students (have questions you will be asked, make sure students know they will be graded on contribution or participation).",
    "I wish field trips, which, in terms of time, were a considerable commitment, had been better spaced throughout the class. They all came at the end.",
    "Sometimes I wish Shimi had spoken more of his own research, to give some more depth in an area of expertise. The class is good, but sometimes survey classes can be frustrating - one leaves with a little information about a lot, and it would maybe have been good to engage more deeply with one topic for a week or so.",
    "The RWA field trip was not so engaging.The course requires a lot of out of class time, but I think in the end it was manageable."

This should be made clear in the first class (I think it was made clear, but I've seen in some other classes that students don't seem to grasp this kind of advice early on and then later some tend to complain that they didn't expect a class to turn out this way, even if the instructor announced at first - I know it's frustrating to deal with this, but maybe next time make it EXTRA clear that it's a survey class)",
