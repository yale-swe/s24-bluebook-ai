    "I thought the field trips were incredibly valuable; I learned a tremendous amount from Jim out in the field.",
    "The field trips were great but there could have been more, particularly to material in the second half. Most of the streams we did visit were pretty pristine, but it would have been interesting to go to a wetlands or dam or more urban streams.",
    "Jim is a GEM! This is one of the best courses that I've taken at FES. He is so generous with his time and knowledge. Who else at FES would give up all of their weekends for most of the fall to assist in student projects? Unbelievable! The passion he has for this field is contagious! I loved this class!!",
    "Jim's lectures can be hard to follow for three hours. It's great that he loves his career and is so excited to pass on what he's learned to us, but sometimes he gets too \"into the weeds\" and uses terms that make it easy for the non-engineers among us to tune out. Overall the class was very interesting, but I wish we could have taken more field trips. The essays assigned were very helpful, and I probably learned just as much from them as I did from the lectures. The final essay was very thought provoking and fun to write, but it didn't sum up the last half of the semester like I hoped it would. I wish there was a way to test our knowledge of the second half's content like there was for the first. It wouldn't necessarily have to be a formal test, but perhaps writing several shorter essays would help.",
    "Overall a great course. I felt it could be OK for homework assignments could be a little more specific or rigorous - there is a lot of potential material that the course covers, but a lot of it is not required to commit to memory or use to complete the course. It could be OK to require more.",
    "It was a great course and was well taught. The reason I gave the course a \"4\" on question 15 (how valuable to students with interests similar to mine) is that I felt like it did not cover several topics of keen interest to MF candidates interested in forest management. I would have liked to see more about forest roads and their interactions with streams and hydrology, and bioengineering, or the use of plants in restoration."

    "Field trips and the river restoration paper.",

    "It was great that this material was very hands on. It covered a lot of stuff and was a very good overview of fluvial geomorphology and river restoration. It was cool that it was project based and even though I wish we went into more details on some things, we really did learn a lot.",

    "Field trips",
    "Field trips were great-- loved applying classroom material to real-life situations.",
    "Field trips and lecture were equally great.",
    "Jim's wealth of practical experience. He is a contrast to many acadmemics - he has actually done what he teaches for the better part of 4 decades. He had great stories and a clear presentation style. The field trips and final project gave us some experience on some of the field techniques. I particularly enjoyed the final exam\/essay. The choice of topic was fascinating (even for people interested in other disciplines), and the open-ended opportunity to go where we wanted with it made it an excellent capstone to the course. I thought the articles for the final exam were excellent and very interesting. As a result, I would say that this assignment ranks among the best of my time at F&ES."

   "comments": [
    "I thought the mid-term required knowledge of a lot of not very useful information - it required more memorization than critical thinking.",
    "It would be better if it were taught in shorter lectures twice a week (but that may not be possible). I sometimes wish we spent a little more time on the second half of the class. We spent more time on fluvial morphology and then channel design, then things like drought, flooding, dams... than I would have liked. Also, sometimes I felt like there was a lot of information without always the amount of detail into each topic that I'd like. Some of the workflows and steps for restoration sometimes felt repetitive or unhelpful without more on the ground examples",
    "The lectures lacked hierarchy of information, I think summarizing the key take away focus points could have been helpful. 3 hour lecture is a difficult format for learning, so warning us as to the key issues in each lecture would have been helpful.. Jim does a great job of giving this history of each topic, but important information can get lost in the background in a 3 hour lecture. The assignments often felt as if they came out of nowhere, and I had to return to the lectures and search for the information.",
    "Near the end of the semester a few of the lectures got a bit repetitive; would have liked a little more practice with some of the equations.",
    "I think the writing assignments could be greatly improved. I would suggest making them shorter with more clearly designed essay questions.",
    "I would have liked to see more related to forestry. I know there were several of us interested in forestland hydrology and restoration work related to forestry. I think we could have had less quantitative exercises (even though I normally like quantitative work) and less about dam removal. As interesting as dam removal is, and recognizing that many students called for it to be a focus of the last weeks of the course, I am left wondering how many of us will actually ever do any work related to it. On the other hand, many of us who are MF candidates will only take this course on hydrology\/rivers. This was our only opportunity to learn (in school) about how this subject relates to a field we will practice. I can see in my work having to make decisions regarding roads, bank stabilization, and hydrology - it would have been nice to gain more exposure to the use of plants and to the effects of forest operations and management on streams and hydrology."

    "Yes.",

The final weeks on dam removal and fish passage were well taught, but I did not have much interest in these subjects. As a forestry student, I would have hoped to see more about the effects of forestry on water and streams, and ways I can improve my practice in the future.

As I am a first year, this was kind of bewildering at first but I came to understand I needed to make sure the project was successful. This was in part because I was in a group that had designed its own project. On the other hand, the pre-designed projects seemed to simplistic to me - for instance doing an assessment of an area seemed very entry level, and I wanted to do something more interesting.",
