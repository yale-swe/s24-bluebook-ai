    "This has been my favorite class at Yale so far. There are really no weaknesses. You get to spend 4 hours a week in the beautiful wright lab shop with Dave who is a funny, fantastic professor with a ton of good stories to tell. He makes sure that everyone makes a steam engine that you get to take home. The walk to wright lab and the fact that this class isn't for credit aren't great, but so worth it for this class.",
    "The class is instructive by nature and Prof. Johnson is great at what he does. I really can't say the class has any weaknesses because I learned all I expected to learn",
    "This course was taught well and well designed. No improvements needed.",
    "BEST COURSE EVER!",
    "Overall course was great, and very rewarding. Also super cool to take home operating engine that you built yourself."

    "SO MUCH YES. If you've ever wanted to make something with your hands and be proud of it, TAKE THIS CLASS. I took it as an undergrad sophomore and loved it. Even if you aren't a MechE \/ STEM student, everyone I know who took it loved it.",
    "Yes. It was fun to work with your hands. It was a nice 4 hour break each week from the difficult course work.",
    "Yes. The class is a great way to learn machining techniques, not to mention a break from the general stress of Yale.",
    "Yes. This course offers a variety of applications on many fields: from art to architecture to science and engineering.",
    "Yes, definitely feel confident in my ability to machine basic parts now."
