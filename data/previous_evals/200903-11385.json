    "This is a really great course if you're interested in psychology or neuroscience. Knowing how the brain works is so valuable in this day and age. Plus, the course is really interesting and accessible without being a gut course. I highly recommend it.",
    "Best class I've taken at Yale. Fascinating material, incredible professor. Professor Arnsten is actually incredible. She is without a doubt the smartest professor I've had here. Plus she has no obligation to be teaching us--she does it because she loves it and is passionate about it. She is able to explain stuff in ways that people who have no neuroscience background can understand and appreciate, and the links that she draws to real life and art make the class relevant and interesting. I can't recommend this class highly enough.",
    "I would say only do it if you are really confident you can get all of the work done. It is actually a hard class, and if like me memorization is not your strong suit, you will have to put in a lot of hours to do well. (I say this, for the record, as a junior who has by and large done well at Yale.) But I took this as the class I wasn't going to attend to that much because it wasn't in my major and all my other classes were very time-consuming, and that was a bad plan. If you take this class be sure to give yourself the time you need to learn the material.",
    "Good intro psych or cog sci course for learning more about the functions of different parts and circuits in the brain. Fun lecturer, very approachable, easy tests. Occasionally the lecture can be difficult to parse out especially alongside the book when you are studying for a test. For someone more science inclined, the analogies that Prof. Arnsten uses can be confusing. 3 tests, a final, and a 10-page paper is a lot of work, but the first 3 tests are not that bad (fill in the blank and a pregiven essay), the paper is creative, and the 3 tests make you fairly prepared for the final.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS! It's a fascinating introduction to neuroscience. It's definitely tough at times but in the end worth it. It's well organized and the tests are not too hard and mostly require memorization. There are no prerequisites but I would recommend taking it if you have some psych background, otherwise you'll have to work a lot harder. Definitely do not miss this class, it's a gem.",
    "The class is interesting although the description is a bit deceptive since you really don't spend much time discussing disorders. The class has more grades than other classes, which is nice if you do badly on something, but otherwise its sort of a hassle to prepare for it all. Sections are really helpful--what you learn there is generally what you will be tested on. If you take notes in section and lecture you really don't have to do the reading. If you take the class try to get Sarah Gray as your TA, she is great! Overall good class, not that difficult.",
    "twake it whether you're a science person or not. it's really interesting.",
    "It's a great class to take to learn about how the brain works. The pace can get to be pretty fast, but TA sections help make that manageable. There is quite a bit of work, though, with four tests and a 10-page paper, and each test will require you to study a lot of material. The textbook is also really horrible, and does a terrible job explaining things. I would not recommend getting the textbook, as it's pretty much useless, considering we're not tested on anything not taught during lecture anyway. Professor Arnsten is a very good lecturer and, though not always riveting, delivers her lessons well.",
    "Highly Recommended.Brain and Thought is a high-level neuroanatomy and physiology course that relates biology to cognition and disorder, and somehow makes it accessible to even non-science majors.",
    "I would recommend it. It's a fairly accessible science class with a bunch of great lecturers. Beware, you do have to study sometimes, but if you do you should be fine.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. There is a good amount of work--three tests, a final and a paper--but they prepare you really well for everything, and I didn't mind doing the work because I found the material really interesting and presented in a comprehensive and comprehensible way, especially for non-science majors.",
    "It is a very intense introduction to neuroscience. I would definitely recommend it if you are up for the challenge andaren't taking a heavy courseload other wise. It takes a lot of time to understand and process the material, and even more to commit it to memory.",
    "One of the worst classes I have taken at Yale. I seriously don't understand what all of the hype is about. I was left lost and confused most of lecture. Most of the class is taught by guest lecturers who are supposedly experts in their field but they do a poor job of explaining the basics for someone who has not had any exposure to neuroscience. I took this concurrently with Fundamentals of Neuroscience, and this class is basically Fundamentals but taught poorly and you leave without any real understanding of the brain. I read a few reviews before I took this course that warned me it was not as good as people say it is, and I really wish I had listened... Don't take this.",
    "Fantastic course. Having taken a bunch of neuroscience courses already, I have to say this might been the best one.",
    "Take this. The material was interesting and the workload manageable.",
    "Not a gut, but interesting and informative.",
    "Great! Take it. It is, however, a good amount of work.",
    "I took this class as a senior in search of my distributional requirement, Sc. I am still very surprised at the reaction I would consistently receive from people. \"Don't take that, it's too hard.\" \"Don't take that, it's too much work.\"I found the course neither to hard nor too much work. Sure, it might involve some memorization of basic regions of the cortex--and while that's something I'm not very good at, the exams are relatively simple. When things get tricky, they're always manageable. After all, the course is mainly for freshman. What's going to be emphasized on the tests is certainly emphasized in lecture or section, so no surprises there. Just go to lecture and section and you'll be fine--I promise.Finally, the pay-offs are pretty big. You get to learn a whole lot about the brain and how your brain processes stimuli from the outside world.",
    "Definitely take it. A science class for people really interested in sciences but not wanting to becoming a science major and take hundreds of prereqs to get to the good classes.",
    "Take it if you want to know how the brain works and how it affects you.",
    "AMAZING course. Must take. You'll regret it if you don't and it's a totally manageable though intellectually challenging Sc credit.",
    "It was great! It was very interesting and the information you learn is easy to apply to real life!",
    "Interesting subject matter and good guest lecturers, but frustrating exams (two very easy and two very difficult makes it hard to gage how to study) and more frustrating sections. There is also a lot of work (3 exams, a paper, anda final).",
    "THIS IS NOT A GUT. it's a real science course- if you want an easy way to fulfill a science, there has to be an easier way. i took this class because i thought the subject matter would be really interesting, but it's a lot more science than psychology. i, for one, will look for a guttier science to take to finish my requirement.",
    "yes. if you are interested in the brain and want to put work into it",
    "You learn a lot of really interesting things about how the brain works. Tests are very straightforward, but the material is challenging and the short lectures aren't enough to give you a full understanding on their own, so doing well requires a lot of self-directed effort. I appreciated the short lectures though. Instead of being stuck in a lecture you don't understand for an hour and a half it's over in 50 min., and if you take good notes you can go back to them in your own time (before the test) to really understand them. You don't have to do all the textbook reading assignments, but it's worth having the textbook for when you need to look things up or look up diagrams. The Sylvius software is not worth buying if it doesn't come with your book, you don't use it and it didn't even work on my computer.",
    "This is a good course if you need to get a Sc credit. There's a lot of material and it's pretty detailed but it's not too difficult to get a good grade if you study well before the tests. And there are 4 of them so it's not too much pressureif you do bad on any single test.",
    "I thought the class was pretty interesting and I liked it, but its kind of falsely billed. This class is not really about mental illness or really any aspects of psychology--the first 3\/4 of the course are really about biological neuroscience. The work isn't that hard: its all memorization. If you study, you'll do fine. (You'll have a pretty tough time if you don't.)",
    "Yes! If how the brain works interests you, and you're interested in engaging lectures from the people who actually did the research you're learning about, go for it.",
    "Definitely!",
    "Good class whether or not you like science. But be prepared to be confused for the majority of the semester if you aren't a science person.",
    "This is a great class. The material is really complicated if you're not a science major, but the tests are not too hard. (USE THE SHEETS THEY HAND OUT IN LECTURE-- i didn't and did horribly on the first few tests, then i started using the terms to make flashcards and scored 20 points higher (you do need to start before the night before, though)). Professor Arnsten is excellent, and so are almost all the guest lecturers. I learned a ton and am so glad I took it. If you need a science credit, TAKE THIS. And try to get Sarah Gray as your TA.",
    "Amazing if you want to learn about how the brain works. Highly recommended for a science introduction. Not a gut course, though.",
    "reading that is not necessary to do. four tests. one final paper. the work load is managable. beware: some of the guest lecturers go WAY TOO FAST. it is extremely frustrating. i wish that prof. arnsten gave every lecture.yes. the material is extremely fascinating and applicable. just make sure that you get a good TA because it makes a HUGE difference. (i recommend sarah.) section is so important in terms of actually learning the material because lectures can go pretty fast.",
    "I would recommend this course. It was an interesting (and not too strenuous) way for me to get a science credit.",
    "AMAZING CLASS. I was a doubter, but I signed up anyway and I am so glad that I took this class. It's very interesting, but be prepared to read and pay attention! The tests are easy if you pay attention during lecture and section.",
    "I highly recommend taking this course if you have any interest in understanding how the brain works. It is a bit of work, but it is definitely managable. I consider it one of the best classes I have taken so far.",
    "Brain and Thought is a great way to fulfill your science requirement if you're neither a science major nor someone who hates science and is looking for any way to get the requirement out of the way. You do need a strong high school biology background, I feel, though most of the material isn't covered in high school courses; also, the class is a legitimate neuroscience class, not psychology disguised as biology, though Professor Arnsten (who is very sweet!) does a good job of talking about diseases and real-world applications to make it more accessible. There's a good mix of memorization and conceptual material, all of it interesting (because come on, you're learning about how your own brain works). Take it, though not if you're not willing to put in the work (there are three tests, a final paper and a final).",
    "A really good credit D for an interested non-major. Classes are interesting, and you can get everything you need from lectures alone. You will learn a lot.",
    "Awesome science credit. If you are looking for a gut though... keep looking cause this isn't it. That said, the material isvery interesting and useful to know. I recommend taking the class if you are interested in the material!",
    "Take this class if you have an interest in the brain but not much science background. It's not too hard, very informative, and I enjoyed most of the work. Lecture was entertaining most of the time, and there's not too much busywork or anything.",
    "Yes, I would recommend Brain and Thought to any students. I know it's hard to get into the course if it doesn't have anything to do with your major and PreMed. But it's definitely worth the fight.",
    "3 tests + cumulative final. Tests are straightforward, fill-in-the-blank with a word bank, and you usually know the essay in advance or can guess it easily. 5-8 guest lecturers who are at the top of their field.Section is mandatory, and you discuss neuroscience articles which can be dense (but, lets be honest, will you really read them?). It's science-y, but I know a bunch of non-science people who not only survived but also loved it.Gives you a great understanding for how the brain works- how an action potential and activity of individual neurons are responsible for complex thoughts, memories, and language.if you're a psych major, TAKE IT, and TAKE IT EARLY. it will enrich all future classes.usually capped at 180, so go the first day and fill out a card.",
    "Brain and Thought is one of the best classes I have taken at Yale. It is a broad introduction to the mechanisms that underlie brain function, which are explained in enough detail to feel real, rather than simply models, but not so much as to drown the uninitiated student. The tests were fair, lecture was always stimulating, interesting, and made relevant to my daily life, and I learned an enormous amount, which I think about now as I go about doing actions that I used to think were simply routine. Phenomenal. And for a science credit that won't kill you with work, a must-take class at Yale.",
    "There are numerous lectures, mostly in the first half of the semester, led by top figures in the area, which is really impressive in itself. Amy Arnsten then leads the rest, and she's great. I would definitely recommend Brain and Thought to everyone. It has inspired me to continue taking neuroscience classes for my other science credit.",
    "Definitely, especially for non-science\/non-psych\/non-cog sci majors. Not a ton of work, not too difficult and really interesting.",
    "Pre-med Psycology majors owe it to themselves to take this class. This class is great for anyone though.",
    "Great class and excellent way to fulfill a science credit for those not interested in taking a gut. To get an A you do really have to work, but it's hardly impossible. Also, the textbook is all but unnecessary: most people I know just used lecture notes, slides from lecture and section notes to study. You'll come away with new ways to think about human cognizance.",
    "Brain&Thought has some really interesting moments and a lot of sciencey science. You learn about the workings of the brain at the neuronal level. Lecture is an overwhelming flood of information that you can't really understand until you go over it in section. I took Brain&Thought for a science credit and thought some parts were cool but was sort of underwhelmed. It is very thorough but there are MANY tests and a final paper (and exam).",
    "In depth look into the functioning of the brain. Recommended because it's a very good course if you put the work into it.",
    "This was an interesting course that surveyed the brain, along with brain disorders and diseases. It was lecture based, although section was mandatory. It was an interesting way to learn about the brain, with a scientific focus, but accessible enough to non science majors.I would recommend it, because I feel like I learned a lot. Even though I was not extremely interested in the material, I know that was because of the material, rather than the way it was presented. I just happen to not be a science person. But for people who are, or for people who want to learn more about the brain, this was a good course.",
    "Great course; enthusiastic professor. Learn a lot but it's hard to put together as a final.",
    "TAKE IT. If you are at all interested in the human mind, in how we function, in the neurobiology and\/or psychology of functions both small (the five senses) and large(thought, judgments, some of the more common diseases and disorders) - TAKE IT. Professor Arnsten is wonderful, the course is jam-packed with information but not overwhelming (it's work but not too much), section is useful, and I've never learned so much. It was a wonderful experience, all around gold star!",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS. Even if you don't think you're interested in the material. You will be.",
    "Take it. You'll learn tons about the brain, and the tests are very straightforward. I really felt like this class changed my worldview, and it really made me want to take more neuroscience.",
    "This is a really interesting class. Totally disorganized, but always enjoyable to sit in since Professor Arnsten (and all of her guest lecturers) are highly entertaining. DO NOT BUY THE TEXTBOOK!!!! It is written in another language and you will definitely never open it.",
    "For me, it had its moments of extreme boredom and complete awe at the human brain. There were more of the former than the latter. I didn't like it very much overall, but I did learn some cool stuff. I just took it to fulfill the \"natural sciences\" list of the Psych major, and to get a science distribution credit. For that purpose, it worked well. It's just that, once you get into the microscopic workings of the synapses and all that, it ceased to really mean much to me. A LOT of rote memorization of things that I didn't really understand or care about. The tests weren't too hard if you studied for them.",
    "def recommend. one of my favorite non-major classes so far",
    "hard but worth it",
    "This course is an introduction to neuroscience, covering electrical and chemical signaling between neurons, sensory transduction, memory, emotion, mental illness, etc. You never need to know anywhere near as much as appears in the textbook for the tests (although the book is interesting enough in its own right to be worth reading) and, generally, if you pay attention in lectures and devote just an hour or so per week to thinking about the class you will do fine. You will cover all the subjects sketchily, without going too deeply into cellular mechanisms or specific signaling pathways. To avoid getting too technical, Professor Arnsten uses a lot of images and metaphors to describe how processes work, rendering the material more understandable, but less deeply understood.If you want a more rigorous class, you may consider Fundamentals of Neuroscience, although Professor Arnsten is wonderful.",
    "Psych 120 is a good class for anyone that is interested in learning about the human brain and it's ability and potential disorders. The syllabus may look daunting at first, but all of the assignments are definitely helpful in learning the material on a deeper level.",
    "This is one of the best classes at Yale. It is challenging but a great way to earn a science credit. Arnsten is one of the few professors at Yale who focuses on actually \"teaching\" instead of just lecturing. She goes to extremes to make her lectures easy to follow and her course interesting as well as vigorous. She also always explains how course material is relevant to the real world and it's always nice to know why the things you learn in courses are useful.",
    "Take it it is great.",
    "Brain and Thought is a great class with a lot of exams - if you mess up on one, you can easily make up for it on another exam. You learn a lot about the brain, hence the title of the course.",
    "I am not a science person and I felt that from a non-science perspective, this course seemed pretty heavy on the science of the brain. A little more scientific detail than I would have liked.You really need to take detailed notes for this class, as most of the stuff on the tests are taken from details mentioned in lecture rather than from the textbook.Workload;-daily reading assignments-mandatory section; we often discussed scientific research papers that were assigned for that particular section-two tests, one midterm, one final, one paper.",
    "Pretty fantastic. Amy Arnsten is a great lecturer with a keen eye for the poetry of neuroscience, which colors every class with valuable and often surprising insight. It covers a TON of material, but the tests reward the well-prepared. Be ready to take diligent notes (which won't be hard because it's so engrossing), and don't forget to read the papers for section. Absolutely go for it though - it's a great (even life-changing) class.",
    "Yes, highly recommended.",
    "Yes. It covers a lot of interesting topics.",
    "This is an absolutely terrific course--an introduction to how the brain works and how that physiology corresponds to the cognitive processes that underlie behavior. The class covers anatomy and cellular processes during the first few weeks, but it only assumes an introductory knowledge of biology and chemistry, and once you've covered those basics you'll dive into the far more interesting topics of circuitry and phenomena. What's great is that the class is a science credit--so you really do get a pretty detailed understanding of the neuroscience--but it's taught from a cognitive science perspective, so there's also a lot of emphasis on the psychological and behavioral aspects of the information. Be forewarned: just because it's advertised as a science credit for non-science and cog sci majors doesn't mean it's not a serious class: there's a lot of reading and a lot of terms to memorize, and you will read a number of sophisticated articles about current research (though you will have ample opportunity to discuss and review those articles in section). If you're really interested and committed, though, I recommend the class whole-heartedly.",
    "Yes! I'm not a science major so I took this class to fill my distributional requirement--in spite of that, the class is rigorous and challenging, but I learned a great deal from it. Professor Arnsten writes her tests to make sure that your grades reflect exactly what you put into studying the material, which is really rewarding if you take the time to go over the lectures, etc. Thanks to this class, I have a completely different outlook on all of the amazing functions that the human brain performs and mental illnesses.",
    "I would recommend the course. It's a very accessible way to learn about an extremely complex part of the human body. Plus the stuff you learn is pretty awesome.",
    "This is a great science credit: it's interesting, it's about things that everyone should know a bit about (we all have a brain, after all), it takes non-science majors out of their comfort zone but is constructed as to make adaptation easy even to the most incompetent humanities major.It's science that is more immediately useful than, say, astrophysics (though if usefulness were the primary motivator in our lives maybe we wouldn't be at a liberal arts institution). The class definitely touches on philosophy and linguistics often and serves as a fantastic complement to those disciplines. It makes you think about what it means to be human, particularly whether or not we have free will, and usually ends up challenging previously held assumptions.",
    "Excellent, excellent course. A real gem. Why can't other departments model their non-science-major offerings after Professor Arnsten's class? Informative, interesting, exciting, the right level of difficulty. All in all exactly as I hoped it would be.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to others. This class is for those who are interested in the neurological workings of the human brain, especially for those students who are very interested in the subject matter but have chosen not to follow the more typical science or premed tracks.",
    "Lots of work, but not too painful",
    "It is a DETAILED study of the brain. Sometimes, it was so detailed I was furious. The bilateral dorsal-lateral parietal lobe? Seriously? It's a lot more chemistry than I'd hoped for, and a lot more memorizing names than I'd have liked.",
    "A very good class. Fascinating material, but accessible for non-majors. One of the very few non-major science classes that is does not give up on teaching you something that matters. It's definitely not a gut;it requires a good bit of studying, but it's not at all unreasonable, and it is definitely worth it. Professor Arnsten is a great lecturer and is very accessible.",
    "Not conceptually challenging, but a lot of information to memorize. Take this class for Professor Arnsten: she is an inspiring lecturer who keeps the material surprising and points out its connections to everyday life. It was more work than I know many other intro science classes are, but I use knowledge I gained in this class at least every other day.",
    "This is a great course, with wonderful lectures and content. The workload is a little high (this year there were three midterms, a 10 page paper, and a cumulative final), but the individual tests and assignments are very manageable. I thought it was less difficult than the reviews I had read made it out to be, and thought it was fun and interesting (I'm not a science major).",
    "basically you learn everything your brain does when any of your 5 senses are activated and other function of your brain, like memory"
