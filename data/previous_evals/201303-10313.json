   "comments": [
    "I would recommend it. I think it's unlike any other class you'll take at Yale, and I wouldn't at all describe it as \"preprofessional,\" as some have criticized. It's a really neat and unique experience when your academics interact with the outside world, and having the opportunity (and responsibility) to present our knowledge in conference and paper format to members of the National Intelligence Council was very cool.",
    "Absolutely! This is the most \"real\" policy\/academic experience I have had in my Yale career. The complexities of working in a group and approaching such a broad topic are extremely informative for post-Yale life. I came out with both a much deeper intellectual knowledge of the Sino-Russian relationship and great practical tools to coordinate among peers and superiors on policy research. However, at the end of the day, each capstone is different and really depends on who is in your group, who is your mentor, and how specific are your client's instructions (in addition to the actual capstone topic).",
    "Well, you have to do a capstone to graduate. That said, really think about which capstone you want to do in terms of the professor who is teaching it, the subject matter (it's so much easier to do the project if you're interested), and the structure of the capstone (which then determines what you get out of the experience). This one was seminar-like, with a creative sort of final product as opposed to a data-driven one which some others might enjoy more.I noted in a previous response which I don't think is published that Thomas Graham is one of the most patient, most supportive professors I have known, and has a wealth of government experience. He is a great reason to do this capstone.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to a fellow student.",
    "i mean you gotta do it if you're in the major...even if you don't get a project you like, make it worth it for yourself. remember that if you're hating it and just slogging thru, you're wasting your own time. feel like i learned a lot from this because i very much wanted to and pushed myself to catch up on stuff i wasn't an expert in (this is imp in a group proj, i think; much as you gain from others' knowledge, niceto have your own understanding)",
    "Yes."
