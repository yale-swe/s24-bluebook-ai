   "comments": [
    "It is a wonderful review of concepts from L2 but presented in such a way that allows you to really engage with the language in a fun and mature way! I definitely recommend it.",
    "Yeah, I would recommend it. We basically covered mostly all the same grammar (but new vocab) from Italian 120, only in more detail. So, for that reason, class material wasn't too hard to keep up with.",
    "If you've taken L1-L2 and did well, maybe consider taking the placement exam and skipping the course. While interesting and well-taught, the course is only review, which is frustrating if you're looking to delve more into the language.",
    "a lot of work!!!!!!!",
    "Italian level 3 is a very good class. Like the previous levels you can learn a lot in a relaxed environment. I would recommend this class.",
    "Yes, a phenomenal class with this professor! The class is easy and rewarding if you put in the effort.",
    "It is more active and less book work. It is definitely more enjoyable.",
    "Basically a combination of the grammar\/vocabulary you already learned in L1 and L2. There is a lot more writing and reading this time around, though.",
    "L3 is so much better than L1\/L2. You review everything from last year, and it really starts to cement itself in your mind. Take it with Griffin if at all possible--he's really fun and a great teacher. The films we watch were really good (Io non ho paura is now one of my favorite films) and the material is very manageable.",
    "Ital 130 with Griffin is excellent. It's a class that is not too difficult but very rewarding, and you emerge speaking much better Italian. It's got more room for fun stuff than 110 or 120, which can turn into grammar drills! Take it with Griffin."
