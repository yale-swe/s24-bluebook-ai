   "comments": [
    "Easy class, but you need to keep up with the problem sets. If you do that, you'll be fine.",
    "I recommend it now that I am done with it.",
    "Logic is pretty easy, but more work than you'd suspect and more confusing as well. Not a great class overall.",
    "Logic is fascinating and not very challenging. The material helps you with a lot of majors (Philosophy, Linguistics e.t.c.) and really structures your thoughts and arguments beyond the classes scope. Raul was relatively good at explaining the concepts, but attendance in lecture wasn't absolutely necessary. Be careful because the problem sets get increasingly challenging.",
    "I'm glad I took this class. It's good to learn how to think this way. I didn't get a lot out of lecture, but the book is extremely didactic. Problem sets are fun though they can be tedious (have a study friend and you'll be fine).",
    "Take it to get an easy QR",
    "I would not recommend this course. I took it thinking I wanted a fun QR, but the material turned out to be useless. Do not take this course thinking it will be easy--the teacher does not do a good job at presenting the material in lecture, and it is difficult to learn solely from the book (I tried to do so and found that when problems deviated from the examples given in the book I could not complete them). In other words, unless you love logic and philosophical reasoning and really, really are interested in the material, do NOT take this course.",
    "DULL. An easy QR IF you have friends in the class because between all of you someone will have gotten all the homework. Don't go through it alone. Also don't even bother going to lecture. Some problem sets are harder than others so start them early just in case. Midterm is easy.",
    "I would recommend Philosophy 115-01 to another student because of the fairly easy work load and the easy grading. However, I would warn them that lecture time is not well utilized.",
    "I would recommend the class only to those who enjoy proofs like those done in high school geometry. I would also warn that while the material is by no means undoably challenging, this class is not a gut. The problem sets can be time consuming, and while the online grading system allows you to work on them until you have them all right, this will take time if the material isn't coming naturally, on the other hand, attendance at lecture is unnecessary at best, so you get an extra few hours a week to spend on the work with the very effective textbook,",
    "PHIL 115 is an easy-enough QR class, if that's what you're desiring when taking it. The system of homework submission is unconventional but it allows you to check your answers multiple times without marks off before you formally submit it. The professor is more long-winded and confusing than need be, and you can tell with how the class size dissipates over the course of the semester. It's not the most enjoyable class, but you may find some pleasure from it on occasion.",
    "Horrible horrible course, but the textbook is pretty good so lecture really doesn't matter. A QR without any numbers.",
    "There is a midterm and final which emphasize content knowledge more than proofs. The bulk of the homework and lectures is on proofs and the rules, though, or at least that is what you come away remembering most. So basically the exams don't reflect the work you do each week, so just keep that in mind.The lectures were not good but section was extremely helpful. I also recommend you start homework early because there are impossible problems you will spend a lot of time on. Form a study group and put your heads together.",
    "Logic. If A and B, can we determine C. Ish like that. If you need a QR or are a phil major, take it. Otherwise, the programs you have to use for the homework (not the logic itself) are very, very annoying.",
    "It's pretty easy, but the software has a learning curve. (Read: You will be cursing and pulling your hair out for a couple weeks until you get the hang of it)",
    "I am an English major... generally interested in the world... but these problem sets sucked a lot of joy from my life this fall.",
    "This may seem like an easy way to fulfill a QR, but it's not. It requires a lot of time and understanding to fully grasp the material if you aren't naturally inclined to logical reasoning.",
    "The course is pretty easy, especially for quantitative thinkers.",
    "Only do it if you wish to use it for a greater purpose.",
    "This is a very straightforward class--you learn the basics of FOL, and follow the textbook pretty closely. I took it just because I was interested in logic, but I can definitely see why people would take it as an easy QR. There's absolutely nothing difficult to understand here and the workload is quite light. If you're interested in the subject it can be fun, otherwise it's probably very boring, since there's not much to challenge you.",
    "This could have been a good class, but it was so badly taught that I could not bear to go to lecture. The subject is inherently interesting and worth knowing. It's easy and fun. But there's no reason the lectures had to be mind-numbingly boring. Maybe with a different professor this class would have been better. But most of the slides were entitled \"recap,\" and the pace was unbelievably slow. I stopped attending lectures entirely fairly early in the semester--and I've never skipped a class before. But it was quite easy to teach myself everything from the textbook. Also, an annoying thing: All homework has to be submitted electronically, which means that figuring out the logistics of sending the work in sometimes took almost as long as completing the problem sets.",
    "This class is kind of odd because it's not obviously applicable to anything at all. The psets were mildly enjoyable, and it's a pretty interesting thing to learn, but it's just so unique that it doesn't really seem to fit into any real world context.",
    "Yes, take this class!",
    "Logic is a good QR. I think some people neglected to study for the midterm properly because it's so easy to rely on the software (the homework is based on a tri-application computer software program associated with the textbook) instead of actually learning how to do things on your own. But the midterm and p-sets were manageable. Lecture was unnecessary, though; Raul reviews things for about half of the class, and rushes through his examples, muddying the important concepts for that day and causing a vicious cycle because of the need to review. I'd recommend taking it as a fifth class and dropping it if you get sick of it.",
    "Kind of boring, wouldn't do it again. Sad that I wasted a credit senior year on this.",
    "Take it if you need a QR. It's not too hard.",
    "PHIL 115 is a very standard lecture course. The material is very interesting and problem sets are a bit like puzzles, which makes them enjoyable to complete. I would recommend the course.",
    "This class definitely makes you think in a way that might be different than you're used to. People either love it or they hate it. I enjoyed the class. It was an interesting alternative to more math-y QRs. There's a lot of extra credit and you can check the majority of your homework before you turn it in so its easy to do well as long as you try.",
    "I took First-Order Logic because I thought I'd find the material really interesting and I wasn't disappointed: FOL is, for the most part, pretty enjoyable stuff. Lectures, regrettably, were sometimes unclear and unnecessarily confusing, but, if you're willing to self-teach from the excellent textbook and if you have a great TA like I did (Kelley Schiffman), you'll be fine. If FOL sounds cool and you need a QR, go for it. P-sets aren't too terrible and Professor Saucedo (Raul) loves giving extra credit and is generally super nice, in person and on the midterm\/final.",
    "LOGIC IS AWESOME. Don't take it with Raul.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to anyone - is not too hard and it is really interesting.",
    "Easy QR. Mediocre lectures (if it's still Raul Saucedo) but easy enough midterm and the homework grading system is a lifesaver. The material itself is pretty interesting, but don't expect to enjoy class itself.",
    "Logic was a really cool subject, and though Raul was cool\/funny\/nice, I always heard Winkler was amazing (which Raul was not) so I would probably just wait till he teaches it again. Also, though it seems easy at first KEEP GOING TO CLASS (the course builds on itself and gets really confusing really quick, right when you're starting to realize it's easy). But yeah, it's not going to be anyone's favorite course, but as an interesting and manageable QR that has some real-world application, I'd defs suggest it.",
    "fun, interesting, more work than it seems at first",
    "First-Order Logic is a good QR to take if you don't want to work with numbers, but that doesn't mean that you won't learn anything interesting from it. Even though a lot of the class is very straightforward, there will be challenges on each problem set, so you should go to sections even though they're optional. FOL is also a prerequisite for a lot of the higher-level philosophy courses here, so that's another good reason to take the course.",
    "When planning my schedule and reading course reviews, I had trouble gauging how hard this class would be. Here's the deal: if you are good with logic puzzles, this class will be a complete breeze for you, even a gut. You are expected to do one problem set a week, and sometimes these take 5-6 hours. But they're not so different from a logic puzzle I would do in procrastination. If you were always pretty good with math or if you are great at doing logicpuzzles, you won't need to go to a day of class or section and you'll breeze through with an A. If you struggle with that kind of thing, beware.",
    "Take it! Logic is really fun. And if you need a QR, this is a great option.",
    "With Raul, Philosophy 115 was a pretty easy and fun class. I took it as a QR and it was incredible manageable. The textbook is really clear (and oddly amusing!). Some people say that you EITHER have to go to lecture OR read the textbook, but not both. That was true in my experience.",
    "If you really need the QA and the material makes sense to you, yeah. Especially if you're using the GradeGrinder software, where you turn in your homework and it tells you if you have things wrong so you can fix them before submitting them to your TA, you can get an 100% homework average (50% of the grade) and hopefully do okay on the midterm and final. FIND A GOOD TA, or at least go to a good TA's section, as my friends with better TAs found the class more manageable. QRs are always going to be a pain in the ass for about half of the students at Yale, and this is definitely one of the easier ones, but some of the proofs get hard and the lecture is poorly taught. Find a more interesting QR, or if you do this one, do yourself a favor and read the book instead of going to class.",
    "Needs some serious reform: lectures were drawn out, professor was confused, TAs sort of held everything together (the ones that were into the class) and overall disorganized. The material was great! If only half the class didn't learn only from the textbook and section.",
    "Not really, unless you really need a QR or you are inherently interested in this topic.",
    "Yes if you want an easy QR, but understand that you still might struggle if you're REALLY not a math sort of person. If you're actually QR capable it could be a good 5th class because you'll probably get an easy A and not have to go to class if you don't want to.",
    "Good class, good QR. Raul picked a good book\/software and it was great that the homework was worth 50%, as everyone should be able to do well if they put in the time. His lectures weren't great and the exams were more difficult, but the subject is interesting and as long as you put in some work and just practice, practice, practice proofs, it's a good class!",
    "If you had a logical mind, the material of this course will be pretty gratifying. However, this course obviously has some flaws, and if you're struggling with it, don't expect the lecture to be very clarifying.",
    "I took this class as my last QR. I will say this: there are probably much easier and more interesting QR's. That being said, homework was worth 50% and the computer program we used for homework almost guaranteed that you could get almost 100% on all the homework. The midterm was difficult to answer in only 50 min. It's not an incredibly interesting QR. I would only take it if you are maybe planning on going to law school or don't have many other choices.",
    "A good QR for a humanities major, especially if you're interested in breaking down the reasoning behind arguments and ideas into their basic, atomic components. It was possible to do very well in this class while never attending lecture or section. If that's what you're looking for, great; if not, maybe look elsewhere. Or look here if Kenneth Winkler is teaching it again and not Raul, who was energetic and fun but inexperienced and didn't actually *teach* anything that wasn't in the book.",
    "Yes. Very fun to do the homework and test problems. Lectures not that useful; you can basically learn everything you need from the textbook.",
    "Yes I would. This class will increase your ability to spot faulty steps being made in arguments all around the world, in all disciplines. And it'll help you with your own arguments. If you're into politics, literature, math, etc. This class has something to offer you.",
    "A crash-course in basic methods of proof in First-Order logic. In many ways, the subject matter won't be what you expect. Prepare to spend a fair amount of time doing practice problems.",
    "This was a horribly taught course in a wonderful, important, and (I think) fun subject. That it was taught with such maladroitness was a pity; lectures were very slow, regularly consisted of more \"recap\" than new material, and rarely, if ever, did a better job of explaining concepts than the book did on its own (the book was quite good). Many of us stopped attending lectures, not because we didn't have the time, but because going felt like such a waste of time.Most homework was reasonable, but some assignments were randomly and brutally long\u00e2\u0080\u00942-3x longer than the average.The tests, on the other hand, were almost unfairly easy, making me (and others) feel like studying would be almost as much of a waste of a time as going to lecture. I am happy to report it was.",
    "I would to anybody who's interested in logic and\/or is looking for a fun and easy QR",
    "It was interesting, but I kind of regretted taking the course. I'm a science major so I didn't need to QR and I have already fulfilled my HU requirement. So I really didn't need this course for anything. If you're interested, though, it's worth a shot!",
    "A great QR, as long as Raul isn't teaching it anymore. And get Kelley for your TA!",
    "I would recommend taking this course as a fun way to get a QR credit.",
    "This course is fun at many times, especially if you like doing proofs etc.",
    "Again, logic is not necessarily easy. In fact parts of it are downright miserable. But if you like the challenge of learning to think critically, you really should take this class \u00e2\u0080\u0093 apparently it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s also quite helpful for the LSATs, if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re thinking of going to law school after graduation. Plus, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll find it creeping into other parts of your life \u00e2\u0080\u0093 the way you think about language, or the way you evaluate an argument in an essay you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re reading. Logic is awesome, and you should definitely take it!",
    "For the sake of your GPA, take it! The class (and by that, I mean Raul, not the material) is interesting enough to keep your attention for 3 hours per week. The problem sets (similarly to Game Theory) reminded me a little of puzzles. Overall, it's very roughly an easier version of Game Theory.",
    "Interesting topic, very useful. Thus, even if the lectures are poor, as they were this year, it's well worth spending time on and learning on your own, so a good use of a credit and of time at Yale.",
    "Definitely! The workload is very reasonable, the TFs are always willing to help, and Prof. Raul is such a cool, chill professor that you'll actually enjoy lecture.",
    "Yep! It's an awesome QR that doesn't deal with numbers.",
    "Though the course gets rather fast at the end, if you try and are willing to get a good grade, you will be able to. Good qr credit for non-qr students.",
    "Take it if you need to fulfill a QR. As an English major desperate for an easy QR, it's the best QR I've taken so far - it won't help with anything else you'll do in your future life, but it'll get you a QR. The work isn't terribly hard, there's just a lot of it, and it's pretty boring.",
    "I would not recommend this course with this instructor by any means. Don't do it!",
    "Yes absolutely. Great QR credit with no numbers, not hard problem sets.",
    "I really enjoyed the course, partly because I'm by nature alogical person and one who likes solving logic puzzles (which really is what we end up doing for most of the class). The concepts that we learn aren't terribly difficult, but they're really fun, and so I had a great time. For this class, the lectures are very well thought out, and the professor plans everything superbly, but because he makes his slides so thorough, I often find it more efficient to just read the slides on my own instead of going to lecture because I can get through them in half the time. I really enjoyed doing the psets, so that's also a plus. I also had a fantastic TA, so that really helped. I would recommend this as a fun fifth class if people are interested in problem\/puzzle solving, and why not?",
    "Wow. I did not take this expecting a gut, but that's what I got. I believe that I went to two or three lectures total, and at least one of those was just going over the syllabus on the first day. I never went to section, either (neither of these things are usually my style but lecture and section were both unnecessary and not particularly helpful). The book was good, easy to follow and helpful, and the homework was fun and interesting, only very occasionally was it difficult or time-consuming. Take it as an easy fifth (or sixth!) class or as a gut QR credit -- or wait until Winkler's back because I'm pretty sure it isn't a gut then.",
    "FOL is a low-stress QR that is only the more rewarding and interesting if you have an interest in philosophy and sound reasoning. Professor Saucedo (Raul) is young, fun, and approachable. If you have no background in logic or a substantial foundation in mathematics, you should definitely take this course before considering any more advanced courses in logic or mathematical logic.",
    "I took it for a QR, although I am interested in formal logic. It wasn't too hard, but lecture was abysmal: of the 170-ish people registered for the course, maybe 25 attend any given lecture. You basically learn solely from the book. I've heard it's been very different (and better) in past years when Winkler and Sun-Joo were teaching it.",
    "Take it. Its not a hard class. But, do not underestimate it.",
    "It's a pset miderm final class. Psets start out easy then get harder, midterm was easy but final was tougher.",
    "Logic is a decent alternative QR credit - you just need to stay on top of the weekly problem sets.",
    "It's a decent QR. It's not too rewarding, but it's pretty easy--just a problem set a week and a midterm and final, neither of which were too difficult. However, I wouldn't recommend taking it unless you want the QR.",
    "If you're a humanities student desperate for a QR, it's better than a poke in the eye with a sharp stick!",
    "This is a great course for anybody who likes puzzles. Seriously, take it! This is a gut class where you can definitely, definitely get an A: but it's so interesting! The homework is all through a computer program and you have to solve problems and move around little blocks. Professor Saucedo was a little disorganized but is so cool and really enthusiastic. I have a math mind so the class was rather easy for me but it was my favorite class this semester.",
    "It was a good QR, but not a great one.",
    "Really fun class!",
    "Yeah, sure. It'll be easy if you're a math person, and if you're not it won't -- but it's a good way to challenge yourself. I felt really good when I worked hard and the concepts finally clicked.",
    "First Order Logic is a really useful class to take. The professor frequently changes each time it's offered, and even though Professor Saucedo's lectures were sometimes unclear and a little confusing, the the class was still valuable. Logic is really helpful in thinking about and doing philosophy, and this course shouldn't deter anyone from the major. It also just helps organize your thinking to be familiar with First Order Logic and proofs.",
    "Yes if looking for a good QR.",
    "Take it",
    "A pretty interesting class that is either really easy or annoyingly hard until you figure something out, after which it becomes easy again. Take it if you are curious about logic or want a QR and hate calculus. I enjoyed the class and would take it again.",
    "A lot of people did really well in Phil 115, but I think this is because it's a self-selecting group, not because it's a gut class. There are weekly problem sets that take several hours to complete, but homework is worth 50% of your grade, so making consistent A's is a huge grade booster.Raul Saucedo, while obviously a nice person (who introduced each class by playing a hip, semi-relevant-to-the-course-material song -- A+) was consistently disorganized. He would explain a problem incorrectly and then, midway through completing it on the whiteboard, would realize he was wrong and have to re-explain everything. Fine if it happens once in a while, but it happened more than once almost every class, which made lecture extremely difficult to follow. There were also errors on our midterm and final exam study guides, which were only rectified if Raul or a TA noticed them later. I get the sense that many of the students who did exceedingly well in Phil 115 skipped a lot of lectures -- they were able to teach themselves what they needed to know from the textbook. I didn't grasp the concepts as readily, so I know I would have benefitted from a clearer, less scattered lecture.Take Phil 115 if you know you have a good handle on the kind of rigorous, quantitative thinking that formal logic requires (or if another professor takes over). Also, if he's a TA again next year, Justin Khoo is super helpful, so try to get his section.",
    "Take this class if it seems interesting. I don't recommend taking it with Professor Saucedo. The Psets get harder and more complicated, but are doable with the help of other students and a good TF. Start them sooner so you know if you need help. With the material\/psets, you either get it or you don't, so you'll either do really well or not very well on any given pset. Thus if you do it early and poorly, you have time to get help and figure it out before it's due. Fitch allows you to pre-grade a lot of work before you turn it in.",
    "Yes. This was a very interesting course. If you need QR credit and if you are preparing for LSAT or GRE, take this course. It does get very hard towards the end of the course and you will often get very frustrated. However, if you do the readings, go to the sections and ask questions, you can do well."
