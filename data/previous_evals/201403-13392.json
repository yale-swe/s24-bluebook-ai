    "An introductory statistics class in which you work with real-world situations and data.",
    "Take it. I was frustrated in the beginning because nothing seemed relevant, but by the end, everything was. It's a necessary class for basic life skills.",
    "Absolutely! If you are considering taking the \"flipped\" class, do it! You will learn much more and be able to ask more questions and practice the material you learn.",
    "Stat 103 is a good stats class. Homework is pretty time consuming but interesting. I had never taken stats before, and usually that means you're behind, but I didn't feel that way at all in this class. Professor Reuning-Scherer is really good, too.",
    "I felt lost in this class for a good amount of time because I could not follow the lectures and there was no assigned textbook for the course. The course is overall pretty disorganized, the psets were unrelated to the exams (because they require a statistical software named minitab while the exams are entirely on paper). My TA wasn't much help to the situation either: the psets are often returned a month after they were handed in so I was left completely in the dark in regard to how well I was processing the material and where I stood in the class. The bulk of learning I did for this class was a week before a major exam, on my own. Surprisingly, I got good grades on my two midterms, given my poor understanding of the material, because all you need to do is cram and regurgitate. You could do decently on the exams without really understanding what's going on. (P.S. I've had no stats experience before coming here)",
    "Definitely the best of the intro stats options. Prof. Reuning-Scherer is funny and engaging, but also teaches a lot of information. I found the class very useful, especially the \"social sciences\" part. Learned a lot and highly recommend.",
    "I highly recommend this course, as hard as it may be to believe that an intro stats course comes highly recommended. It was interesting and useful in a practical sense. I feel much more qualified now to think about and comment on statistics that we see or compile frequently in life. The work load was not overbearing, and although the problem sets could be tedious and counted somewhat heavily (30%), they were always much harder than the exams were. Also, Professor Reuning-Scherer is amazing. Hands down the best stats professor I'll ever have. He has a great sense of humor, is an engaging lecturer, and above all he obviously cares about his students and wants them to do well. Before the second midterm, he held a continuous FIVE-HOUR review session for students to come when they want and leave when they want, asking whatever questions they had. I've never heard of anyone doing that before for five hours. He also had long review sessions for the first midterm and final, and these were so productive and his explanations were so thorough that I often felt as if most of my studying was done by the time I had left the review session.",
    "A solid introduction to statistics -- as harmless as it can be, though not, by any means, \"easy.\"",
    "If you need a stats course, this is a good one to take. Okay amount of work, not too difficult, amazing professor.",
    "Highly recommend STAT 103, even if you don't need it for your major (which, for many majors, you do).",
    "Take it with Prof JRS! He's super cool and he makes stats a lot of fun",
    "STAT 103 is an introduction to statistics that can be applied to any field. I would recommend it to another student as I feel what I learned is very useful and interesting.",
    "Yes, as long as you are decent at math.",
    "You're probably only doing it to fulfill some requirement anyway, and if you're not it's probably not worth it.",
    "Stat 103 is a basic introduction to statistics. We covered t-tests, chi-squared, ANOVA, and multiple regression, which are the main statistical tests needed to evaluate data for social science experiments. You don't need calculus, and for most of the problem sets you rely on MINITAB (a statistics program). But you do need to understand the material -- how the tests work, and why you use them. This is the focus of the exams. It's not a GUT. It is a good applicable QR. Plus, JDRS is great and makes the classes fun.",
    "STAT 103 moves pretty quickly if you've never taken stats before. I had a hard time keeping up with the material in the beginning, but as we moved on to social science modeling I found the class to be very applicable and relevant to my other studies at Yale . JDRS has clear expectations and the class notes are useful.",
    "Not a great class overall. We focused a lot on theory\/the mathematics of concepts, which both wasnt helpful (since in the real world everyone just uses programs to do it) and didnt allow us to delve deeper into the actual applications. The problem sets varied, with some being a lot of work, but most being manageable. The tests were very hard, especially because they were nothing like the problem sets (which were all done on a computer). I would not recommend this class unless you need it, and if you can take the psyc 200 stats instead, I would give that a try. The only upside is that JDRS is a boss; hes really funny and quite good at explaining things (if you can stay awake through the actual statistics part of it).",
    "Good class for introduction to stats. Weekly problem sets aren't terrible, but be prepared to spend some time in the computer lab messing around with MINITAB.",
    "I would absolutely recommend taking the Flipped Stats version of 103. You basically watch all of the lectures as videos outside of class, and in class JRS answers questions, we do practice problems, and explore data using Minitab. Two very fair take-home midterms plus a final project (involving Minitab). Great class, hope it's offered again next year!",
    "As you will probably need to take a statistics class at some point, take this one. Now. It is definitely the most fun statistics is ever going to get for you and will teach you what you really need to know about the subject. If you put enough effort into the homework and study decently for the exams you are also almost guaranteed to get a good grade. But be warned: this is not a gut. It is just fair, and, to some degree, fun.",
    "If you just need a QR, there are easier ones out there. That being said, class is doable, and the social science section is fairly interesting. Professor Reuning-Scherer is great as well so definitely take whatever section he teachers.",
    "Solid statistics course. Professor Reuning-Scherer makes stats enjoyable and exciting to learn during lectures. For the classes I wasn't able to attend, his class notes were generally easy to understand. I also felt prepared for each of the tests--something I can't say for other quant courses I've taken at Yale. The p-sets were manageable and gave us practical examples of how to use stats in social science contexts, though I often went to TA office hours to double-check my work. I can't speak for the other sections of Intro Stats, but you certainly can't go wrong with this one.",
    "If you're taking this, you're probably taking it because you have to as a requirement for pre-med or your major. It serves what it's supposed to do, but it certainly would not be my first choice for a QR credit. Psets vary in length -- sometimes taking 9 hours to complete and other times 45 minutes. The class moves very fast, and if you're not coming to lecture and paying attention, life will be difficult for you.",
    "A not particularly difficult class. This is definitely not a gut just because the 103 section final is cumulative, and there is a lot to learn for the final. That being said, the class is completely manageable (8 problems sets, 2 midterms, and a final). JDRS is very engaging and enthusiastic which is really necessary when the class is held at prime mid-day nap hours (1-2:15). Make sure you eat beforehand, so you can stay awake during the sometimes dry lectures. Nevertheless, JDRS makes this class as fun as possible. You play a couple review games with prizes, and he is always engaging the audience. I took this class as a precursor to econometrics (I had no experience with statistics), and I feel like I learned a lot of the basics that will be helpful with econometrics next semester.",
    "I would recommend it as it was very helpful in understanding static programs such as mintab and useful in everyday situations.",
    "This course was a great introduction to statistics and I would definitely recommend it to other students.",
    "Stat 103 was one of my requirements for my major, so I took it. I was pleasantly surprised at how many useful things I learned. Moreover, Professor Reuning-Scherer truly tried to make it as enjoyable as possible. But at the end of the day, the material is not exciting. Some classes were painful to sit through, but I think stat 100 anywhere would be. I would not really recommend it if you do not have to take it. Furthermore, if you have to take it, then I would take stat 103 with Professor Ruening-Scherer.",
    "Not the most interesting class in the world, but you need Intro to Statistics to move into higher-level analyses, and if you're going to take it with anyone, Professor R.S. will give you the most engaging and useful grounding in the field.",
    "I would recommend this course to people looking to fulfill this requirement, especially if it's with JRS. The workload is average and the exams are reasonable.",
    "Great continuation of introductory statistics with interesting applications!",
    "It's good to have a working knowledge of statistics in order to be an educated person. Not a particularly riveting subject, though.",
    "An intro to basic statistics, a good half of the corse is just review of AP Stats but with JDRS you learn to use MiniTab which is a skill you'll probably need forever so that's a plus!",
    "A quick and sometimes tough intro course. But worth it to take",
    "Yep- all Yale students should take some kind of stats\/econometrics class.",
    "Great course definitely a must take",
    "I would recommend the class if you want a decent intro into stats (beware, the class IS NOT a gut). The professor is hilarious but the material goes by super quickly and it is very easy to fall behind in class. The psets are pretty easy but the tests are all pretty hard. You will have to put work at this class.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone who wants introductory statistics. JDRS is an awesome professor. Even though statistics can be a bit dry he tries to make it interesting.",
    "Absolutely. This an excellent introduction to statistics, but you should take this class for JDRS! He is enthusiastic, and considering that this is an intro class, he cares A LOT about his students. You will walk out of this class with a good degree of statistics knowledge that can be applied almost instantaneously. Also, the midterms and final are fair, although there is no curve (so use the homeworks as an opportunity to boost your grade). The homework can be time consuming at some points, but the TA's are available and willing to lend a hand. Also, JDRS can be fast-paced in lecture, but the lecture notes are thorough enough that you can catch up outside of class",
    "Love jdr. Intro stats with him so much fun! Mich love! Take with jdr yay!!!",
    "A very good intro stats course. I recommend that all students, at some point, take an intro stats course as it is a useful skill in nearly all areas of study. JRS is an incredible instructor--he is clear, organized, passionate about the subject material, and makes bad (good?) statistics jokes. He often brought a Light-Saber to class to use as a pointer. The material is not too challenging and is often interesting, but I could be biased because I really like statistics in general. Overall, it's a great class to take if you need a QR, want to go into any field that does any sort of research, or want to understand what they're talking about in polling data or research papers.",
    "I was deciding between social and political science. I stayed with 103 because the professor was the same after the 5 week mark, so there was no transition period with teachers.",
    "Yes I think it's a practical class.",
    "I highly recommend STAT 103, especially for students who want to take a real QR and are trying to decide between statistics and, say, more calculus. Statistics is applicable to most disciplines and I realized how little I understood about how experiments are run while I was taking this class. It's not too difficult, but you do have to be willing to put a good deal of work in for the exams.",
    "I would recommend STAT 103 to any student looking for a useful QR credit that is willing to put in the effort.",
    "Not a gut course that should be taken more seriously than the professor's jokes.",
    "TAKE IT WITH JDRS. Stats is fine, a bit boring, but he definitely is the best you can get. GO TO OFFICE HOURS. TFs will help with Psets and general understanding even if you have no idea what's going on. Worth it if you need a stats class, but honestly there are probably some easier ones",
    "Good class to take to complete a QR requirement it be warned, there is a homework to turn in every week so a considerable amount of work.",
    "The first few weeks will give you a false sense of security about the course. It should not be treated as AP Stat 2.0 -- you will spend a lot of time on statistical programs doing modeling that can be difficult. Biggest tip: use office hours early to get a grasp on Minitab basics.",
    "Yes - I feel like I learned a lot.",
    "Do not take unless necessary - otherwise regret it all semester.",
    "An introduction to stats that is good for someone who has never taken it before.",
    "I would definitely recommend it because it is a very good introduction. I learned a lot of new things which, although complicated, were explained in a simple and fun way by the professor. Finally it was an enjoyable class and the professor managed to inspire me instead of making me think of statistics as something boring and useless.",
    "Stat 103 is a great intro to stats course. You learn a lot and the exams are fair. The lectures can get boring but you should go because you can get behind quickly. I would definitely recommend this class.",
    "STAT 103 is a satisfactory statistics course. The material is far from interesting, but Professor Scherer is a really enthusiastic lecturer, which makes the course bearable. The second half of the course was less social science-related than I anticipated, but the material was still useful. I would recommend this course to someone in need of a QR who is not afraid to go to a couple of extra help session now and again because it is easy to fall behind.",
    "Sure. I would. It is not particularly difficult and is quite useful. Despite its being somewhat boring, it is well worth the time.",
    "It was an engaging and fun class thanks to Professor RS. If it wasn't for his enthusiastic dialogue, the class and its dry material would have been much worse. But I came out having learned a lot and understanding much more statistical analyses so I am glad I took it.",
    "Take this if you need a statistics class.",
    "I can't recommend this course. It looks very good in shopping period, especially for someone looking for a gut that might be interesting. Don't let it fool you - this course has all the interest of a gut (that is, no one even pretends the material should be interesting) with none of the benefits (grading is reasonably difficult, although there isn't a tone of work). I'd avoid it if possible.",
    "It's a surprising class in that I expected to like it a lot less than I did. It's definitely really useful. You see the things discussed in topics and readings for other classes. There was not very much math at all and the tests were very fair. I would recommend the class. It is not an inspiring or captivating class, but I liked it.",
    "I would recommend EP&E 209 01 to a student if they wish to gain an in depth knowledge of statistics but not if they are looking for a general overview.",
    "Easy QR class with only one assignment a week and two midterms. I would definitely recommend this class for anyone wanting to learn basic statistics, even if you have never taken a statistics class before.",
    "Im not sure I should have taken stats for a QR...there were rough points. But JDRS is about as good a stats prof as you get.",
    "The lectures can be very boring, but it's just the nature of taking a large intro course, and Professor Scherer really does his best to make them engaging. The p-sets aren't too hard and they don't take a very long time. The tests are also relatively easy. Overall it is not hard to do well in the course and having a basic knowledge of Stats is necessary for a lot of subject areas. Basically, if you have to take a stats class, it's not very difficult and Professor Scherer is cool, but I wouldn't take it if Stats isn't applicable to what ever area you think you'll major in.",
    "Stats 103 is a course for those interested in statistics, but who do not have any experience with it. I would only recommend this class for people who are good at math and good at figuring stuff out on their own. If you are confident in your abilities to take sparse notes and fill in pertinent information yourself, you should be able to succeed in this course.",
    "I would recommend this class with the advice to go to weekly office hours. I think the material will be useful later in my professional career.",
    "A great teacher leading a fast paced lecture with strong emphasis on homework\/exams. This class is doable but you have to put in the work - there are no mandatory sections but the homework is built that you will end up having to find a TA lest you do poorly. NOT a gut. Class starts off huge under a general STAT 10X then divides into smaller sections. JRS is lively, genuinely interested, and cracks jokes. He also presents information in an interesting fashion, making a subject usually perceived as \"dull\" at least bearable to even the biggest math haters. He also really knows what he's talking about and is willing to explain things to you many times on a one-on-one basis. Hell, he's open to Skyping and phone calls. He'll be the reason you make it through. Also his games are cute!",
    "Please add this recommendation to the FES510 course. This course is fantastic. It's a class of about twenty or so students, turning the class into a flipped seminar course. You watch the lecture videos online, then come to class with questions and practice the techniques you learned while Jonathan answers any questions you may have. Jonathan is fantastic, the course is fantastic, and I learned a ton of statistics. If you are going to take stats, don't take the lecture course, take this course instead, regardless of your major. It's the exact same material covered in Stats 101, but the class format makes such a huge difference.",
    "I wouldn't recommend it."
