    "I learned so much about the Harlem Renaissance and now have a better understanding of one of the most pivotal periods of African American art and literature. I also gained insight about passing narratives, something I was NEVER exposed to before taking this course.",
    "A great sense of the period and also of how the period is preserved and changes throughout our receiving information about it through various mediums. Also my first introduction to concepts like intersectionality and a greater appreciation for prosody and archival research.",
    "Very helpful for learning archival research techniques.",

   "comments": [
    "fantastic reading list--would not change or remove anything. prof. reed was excellent: funny and warm, he gave us great insights into the texts and the general milieu of the harlem renaissance.",
    "The course only features three essays for grading, and though they were very insightful prompts I do believe it could be improved by providing other, more engaging assignments, perhaps involving presentations. However, I think that incorporating archival research helped peak my interest in this period! I feel much more encouraged to utilize Beinecke's resources after doing that assignment. All of the pieces we studied were so interesting, demonstrating a variety of different viewpoints. The course made one thing clear: The Harlem Renaissance was not a period embodying a single viewpoint. Anthony Reed did a great job illustrating the entirety of The Harlem Renaissance, and I am so happy that I took this course.",
    "This course should be more organized. Frequently the readings changed and were not posted soon enough. Frequently Professor Reed would say he would talk about a subject in a later class period and never get to it. Class was cancelled multiple times (at least 3), further contributing to the moving around of readings and less learning for the students (consumers?). The lectures about the period and multiple art forms were stronger on the whole than the lectures which attempted to focus on three poems. I think it would have been better if Professor Reed had just lectured on what he wanted to rather than trying to stick to a syllabus which he had lost sight of. He is an absolutely brilliant lecturer with so many articulate theses. I learned a lot about articulating an argument and couching it in appropriate discourse.",
    "The course is great but organization and lecture content could be better and more consistent.",
    "The syllabus is full of classic books, which was a strong suit for the class. At times the lectures could incorporate too little of the actual books sometimes.",
    "Dumb chill, no weaknesses"

    "fantastic course--pairs very well with prof. homans's 'race & gender in transatlantic literature'.",
    "I would DEFINITELY recommend this course to another student, especially if they are interested in music, literature, or even just intellectual debate. This course perfectly encompasses the ideas one should know about the HR that they most likely never learned in previous courses, even in AFAM courses, and it does so without bombarding students with too much work, and rather encourages study and research. If it's with Anthony Reed, take it!",
    "Absolutely, the material is so very interesting, as are the lectures, and it's not a hard class.",
    "Yes!! Professor Reed is possibly the smartest professor I've had at Yale and it's clear that he truly enjoys the material.",
    "Yes,",
    "I would recommend this course if you want to be well read in black literature. If you don't have a particular interest in the material, the lectures won't be engaging.",
    "Oh fasho, everyone should take"
