    "My favorite class so far at Yale. Definitely a lot of work (think 100-300 pages of reading each week, and a position paper that usually ends up being around 5 double spaced pages) but you learn so much and become a much better writer. For anybody who's interested in education, from early childhood to K-12 to higher education. Professor Hersh is the best best best. So kind and funny and invested in our class. He gives really thorough comments and feedback on every paper we write, and you're allowed to edit your papers as many times as you want for a regrade.",
    "If you are interested in education, TAKE THIS CLASS! It is wonderful, Professor Hersh is a sweet and extremely helpful man, and I learned so much. That being said, it is a LOT of work. About 200 pages of reading every week (sometimes less, sometimes more) and a 2 page reading response due every week (although my responses were never that short, always at least 3 pages). However, the writing is an extremely important part of this class, and your writing will improve immensely. Prof. Hersh also varies the prompts so you can try out different styles (speeches, policy briefs, reflections, etc.). This class also really depends on the people in your seminar, but you'll probably get lucky! Enjoy :)",
    "This is by far the best, most transformative class I have ever taken at Yale. It offers a wonderful overview of thoughts and theories around the \"ideal\" education, and the shortcomings that our current system is dealing with. It forces you to become very reflective of the readings and how they have impacted your own life. I have been able to nuance my attitudes toward education while learning about the myriad of variables that play into education reform. I recommend this to absolutely everyone who has any interest in education at all.",
    "Good class. Decent amount of work but worth it if you care about education in any capacity. One of the few classes I could write a paper in a couple hours for because I had such a good grasp on the class",
    "(Same answer as that for question 1.) Definitely one of the most valuable courses I've ever taken. Even though the material was full of theory and history, it's crucial for me to know as a future educator. The course made me really THINK. I came away with a lot of well-formed opinions but I also came away with more questions and moderate views than I had expected. I looked forward to this class every week.",
    "100% take itas long as you are committed to the workload, which includes weekly papers. The course material is really engaging, and you will develop an appreciation for education's transformative and equalizing power. Professor Hersh is an amazing person and incredibly warm. He genuinely cared about all of us and not only our academic, but our emotional well-beings. What's most inspiring is the people in the classit was really like a community by the time that we were done.",
    "Amazing class. It is a ton of work to do properly, but Hersh is by far the best professor I have had so far and cares a million times more than any other professor that I have encountered. The subject matter is broad, but incredibly interesting and Hersh runs the discussions very well and gives incredibly helpful feedback. I have yet to learn so much from a class or enjoy doing it nearly as much.",
    "Yes, take this course! There will be a lot of reading each week, and Professor Hersh expects weekly writings that are at the level of professional academic work, but it is worth it. I know I personally have become a better writer after this course.",
    "Much of the strength of the course will depend on the students in it, but having said that, I think this is somewhat of a no-brainer class to take if you are interested in the theory or the practice of american education. It frames a lot of important questions and its best might help give you some peers to continue working over these questions with.",
    "TAKE IT.",
    "People talk about \"classes that change your life,\" but this is a class that will change the way you think. The class illuminates why your high school education was the way it was, pushes you to think about how a college education works, and challenges the preconceptions you have about American education and education reform. If you're taking this class, be prepared to write a short (~ 4-page) paper every week. For me, this was the hardest part of the class, but it made me a better writer and better thinker. Considering the reading every week in order to write the paper made all of us, I think, more ready for seminar and meant that we arrived with more interesting things to say. (If you've ever had a section that's terribly boring because no one has done the reading, this class is the exact opposite.) If you're interested in the policies behind American education and have the time in your semester to think and write a lot, this is a fantastic course.",
    "Take this class! It is truly one of the best offered at Yale. The workload is heavy, but you will without a doubt improve your writing ability and learn so much about the material. I am not an Education Studies Scholar, but this class has made me want to pursue education as a field. Prof. Hersh is a top-rate professor--he is tough, but he cares deeply about the material and his students. He's extremely accessible and provides invaluable feedback."
