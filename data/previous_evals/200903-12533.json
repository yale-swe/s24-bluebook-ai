   "comments": [
    "You read all of Nabokov's greatest hits, and then talk about them. I would take this class if you really have little familiarity with Nabokov (perhaps read Lolita and was interested in more), and generally if you're not used to taking more intensive literature seminars. I often wished that the class had been more rigorous in its discussion - either more close reading, or more theory - instead it often hovered in a sort of hazy gray zone where Alexandrov's favorite theses imposed themselves in every discussion. That being said, there are worse ways to spend an afternoon than discussing one of the century's master prose stylists.",
    "An enjoyable class. Nabokov is an incredible author and it was wonderful to get to read so much of his work. The class is set up really well, so that you actually have time to read the works closely and get to have a fair amount of time to discuss each book before moving on to the next one. The course became a little repetitive in the analysis of the works and I wish that Professor Alexandrov had shared his insights a little more often.",
    "This is a fantastic class and, provided you're interested in Nabokov, I would wholeheartedly recommend it. It's great to dive into such a fantastic artist's body of work, even though reading 7 or so of his works is still only skimming the surface. Any lovers of lit in general or Russian lit in particular must take this class.",
    "This was my favorite class this semester. I would definitely recommend it.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS. Alexandrov is amazing (even when he repeats himself) and Nabokov is brilliant. The only book I didn't really like was \"The Gift,\" but that's a matter of personal preference. No prior knowledge of Nabokov is assumed or necessary. Two papers - one at midterm (7 pg) and one at the end (10 pg).",
    "Take it. The reading isn't heavy (although you should take it slowly and thoughtfully), and Alexandrov is just such a cool teacher. He can tell you all sorts of stories about Vera Nabokov or about the butterfly he was asked to name. Also, the books and the author happen to be incredible.By the way: don't take this class Credit\/D\/F because Alexandrov is so able to make you passionate about the material that you'll do a great job on the papers.",
    "Intense, metaphysically-oriented look at Nabokov's canon.",
    "Def take this class",
    "This course is a good in depth study of Nabokov's works- make sure you like his novels before taking it, though. A lot of time is spent on the ideas brought forth in the books and less on his written aesthetics which was disappointing. The reading is wonderfulk though and Professor Alexandrov is a good professors.",
    "Definitely take this class. Nabokov's literature is beautiful, and this course is a good opportunity to read the best of his English and Russian language works. There are two papers only, and not very long ones, so the class really is more than anything an opportunity to explore the texts themselves.",
    "I would take this class if you have read some of Nabokov and are inspired by his work. This class is more of a study of his philosophy on life and other things though an in-depth look at his work. Someone who loves reading and thinking will like this class."
