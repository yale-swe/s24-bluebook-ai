    "I would recommend this class with reservations. If you are looking for a general course on American poverty, take Marcus Hunter's \"Urban America\" instead. In this course, you will work hard, read a lot of technical and policy-based papers, and engage in focused, somewhat arduous class discussions. However, if you already are familiar with American poverty and are looking for a more detailed approach, this is the class for you. Be prepared to work hard and receive harsh feedback from Professor Horan.",
    "This is a really fascinating topic, and highly relevant. That said, ONLY TAKE THIS CLASS IF YOU ARE PLANNING ON DOING THE READING. You won't get anything out of it otherwise, and Professor Horan is extremely good at calling people out if they're just spewing BS. She's highly critical of what people say, so be ready to defend your opinions. Think before you speak! It was nice that she didn't let people ramble though--quite refreshing for a seminar setting.",
    "Poverty and Politics in US Cities is a fascinating course; you'll learn a lot about American poverty and have the added benefit of learning it under the tough but insightful tutelage of Professor Horan. Take it if you're a poli sci major, especially if you have an interest in poverty!",
    "This is a rigorous and engaging introduction to poverty policy and the policymaking process in general. Some degree of background knowledge is very useful, but may not be required. Good and manageable readings, and the professor is an excellent seminar leader. Horan won't let you make a claim in seminar without having the logic to back it up, which is refreshing and really makes you think. Although a little intimidating, she is actually very nice and cares for her students. Take this class if you are interested a comprehensive approach to policy and poverty and a challenging and intellectually interesting weekly discussion.",
    "It's an amazing class. The readings are interesting and selected to give you a broad introduction to U.S. urban poverty. The assignments are designed to make you think, not just to force you to regurgitate information. Professor Horan is a phenomenal teacher---she wants you to come away with the class with better critical thinking skills as well as the information. (Also, she may seem intimidating, but she is a wonderful and kind person. Go talk to her in office hours!)",
    "Fantastic class. Really learned so much. Definitely challenging but worth the work you put in. Professor Horan is a phenomenal discussion leader. She's one of those professors everyone needs to take a class with at some point.",
    "Take this course. It is a lot of work - 10-12 two page reading responses plus two 15 page papers means over 50 pages of writing, plus you have to do all the reading. It is extremely worth it, however. The reading is excellent, and Professor Horan is one of the best seminar leaders at Yale. Her comments are extremely helpful, the class is fun, and I can't recommend it enough.",
    "Good course if you're interested in urban studies and\/or poverty issues. Professor Horan is incredibly knowledgeable, and in these areas the best professor you can find at Yale. The readings are great and comprehensive, and class discussion really digs into the authors' arguments. Workload is manageable--weekly reading responses and 2 big papers.",
    "I would recommend this course if you are interested in the subject matter. It is well-taught and you will learn a lot. Weekly reading responses are helpful for synthesizing the material, so give them the time they are due. Be forewarned that Professor Horan is looking for something very specific in her essays. It's not impossible to write the essay she wants, but be careful not to stray too far.",
    "PLSC 280 was by far one of the greatest seminars I have taken. The structure of the course provided a very comprehensive view of the problem of the prevalence of poverty in America. The readings were interesting and purposeful and the weekly reading responses helped to make sure that you stayed on track. The essays also forced you to think in different ways and really engage the readings. The introductory \"lecture\" at the start of each session was very helpful and discussions were led in a very insightful manner. I would highly recommend this course to anyone interested in poverty issues or who thinks that they may be interested in poverty issues. Although the course is a lot of work and you need to stay on top of your stuff in order to bring relevant points to the discussion table, it is very well worth it."
