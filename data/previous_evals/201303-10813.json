    "This course is a wonderful look at one aspect of Caribbean culture. No musical background is necessary to really engage with the course material. You will learn a lot about how the development of afrocuban music affected the United States, other islands and how mass media influenced those same musicians. Wonderful course.",
    "Yes!",
    "The material can be a bit dull, but if you are interested in the hispanic Caribbean, it is a must take.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. It is a fun, low-stress, high-reward, literature class that leaves with you just as much historical and social literacy as literary prowess."
