    "Sometimes it seemed a bit unorganized, but that might just have been my feeling. But generally it was hard to know the structure and topics of the course in the beginning.",
    "The slide presentations early in the semester should be more clearly presented. The professor was often too quick moving through the material.",

    "It was great to dig into a case study. I struggled a little with getting everyone to meet\/show up on time for group meetings, but everyone seems to have a different work schedule.",
    "In the groupwork it was at times to me unclear what exactly we were supposed to research, which lead to us more or less researching everything. Also it wasn't clearly communicated when and in how many pieces the presentation of the gathered knowledge should go. I recommend that the teacher agrees with each group IN THE BEGINNING OF THE SEMESTER on deadlines for multiple presentations or A deadline for one big presentation. I like that Mike is trying to keep it flexible, but let's face it we are students and operate under deadlines. A class without a deadline is a class that will receive less attention.",
    "For the semester-long project, it was good to be able to dive in deep to a specific issue regarding forest management operations. However, it would have been good to have more specific instruction on the timeline, deliverables, etc for the project as it felt somewhat unclear about when we were supposed to have what done.",
    "Working in groups was a great way to connect with my classmates and accomplish much more than I could have done singly.",
    "I recommend switching up the groups between the semester long case study and the harvest plan to give students the opportunity to work with others. I did enjoy the groups project because it gave us the opportunity to conduct in-depth research and make professional connections with a region\/topic of our choosing."
