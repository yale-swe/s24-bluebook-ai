    "If THST 250 is ever offered again, TAKE IT. Great class about Samuel Beckett and other cool experimental plays that Kalb sees similarities in. Kalb's the expert in the field, too.",
    "Take this class! If you have any interest in Beckett and how he has influenced the rest of the theater, you will learn so much. The professor is amazing. However it is a lot of reading but worth it if you can devote the time to it.",
    "Take it. If you like Beckett even slightly, this class is for you. Professor Kalb is absolutely amazing, and knows how to conduct a class! (You will love him; everyone in my class did.) The readings are excellent, and the discussions top notch. I am a chronic procrastinator, but the class was so good, I did every single reading. That should say everything. If this is offered ever again, you have a wonderful course waiting for you. (Unlike Godot, you should show up! Many happy days!)"
