   "comments": [
    "Good intro to music! If you've done some theory before, though, consider 205--this one starts at the very basics of reading music, then progresses to scales, chords, harmonic analysis, etc. Very chill if you have music experience.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student. Music 110 was a super fun and rewarding course! It can be tedious at times and it is annoying when people who are overqualified (and know it\/brag about it when you're alone) stay in it, but your professor understands that if you let him\/her know! Take it if you want to get into songwriting or learn some things about whatever instrument you play.",
    "I would recommend the course for musicians only. If you do not play an instrument, the class has little to no relevance for you.",
    "students should take this class if they'd like a primer to music theory as a whole. the class is",
    "I would recommend this class if you have a musical background but no knowledge of music theory. The first few weeks are spent on learning to read music, which is a bit boring if you can already read it (I could), but after that the class becomes more engaging.",
    "It's a pretty fast moving class, and a little more work than I expected for a 110 class, but the teacher was very nice and gave us both a take-home open note midterm and final. I'd recommend if you want to learn the basics of music theory and chord analysis."
