   "comments": [
    "It's really boring and the textbook contains most of the information you need. But it's a good introduction to students who are interested infinancial accounting - I think I have a much better understanding of the practical difficulties and terminology.",
    "Wouldn't take this for a grade.",
    "standard accounting course. nothing special. take it if you need it.",
    "this course is very enjoyable and very informative. you learn so much but without a huge workload. it is essential to finally learn something practical in your four years at yalelecture is not so great, and the textbook is good enough for studying for exams and homeworks.prof schiffres is also very understanding, very helpful, and one of the best professors i have had at yale.this class is a must take for all yalllies.",
    "Miserable class. Don't waste your time taking it.If you're taking this to get background for a job in banking\/finance\/business, skip it and read an accounting textbook instead. You'll learn almost everything you need from the first three chapters of the book and the rest on your job.The 9AM MW time slot is awful. Only about 1\/5 of the class actually shows up.",
    "Not too much work - 2 problem sets every week (usually only 1 problem though). Midterm, final, both open book. Pretty straightforward.",
    "Straight-forward. Practical. Useful.",
    "Yes, but only if you want to learn the stuff for finance and willing to teach yourself. Also, it does not count towards the economics major.",
    "If you are going into finance you should take this course. It is useful since you will be looking at financial statements in any internship that you come across",
    "Only if you want to educate yourself about financial accounting.",
    "I would recommend this class if you want to learn something about the following things: balance sheet, income statement, statement of cash flow, t-accounts, journal entries, marketable securities, inventory, leasing, bonds, and other topics of financial accounting. I think I learned a lot this semester about accounting. That being said, if you're not interested in this kind of stuff, it will probably not be that exciting for you. The professor isn't the most engaging, but I thought he was clear.",
    "Boring.",
    "I would fully recommend Accounting to other students.",
    "Definitely. This info is probably more useful to people looking to go into finance than anything in the econ department.",
    "It's important stuff - but pleaaase try to go to class.",
    "Pretty easy stuff, and really useful",
    "You don't have to take the class. Can learn most of the materials yourself. Easy gut.",
    "I think the class might not be the most interesting class, but without doubt, it provides very important knowledge that you may require for finance. If you want to go into banking or simply find the corporate financial statements intriguing, this class may be right for you.",
    "Never went to class and psets and midterm are easy, but the final was ridiculously hard."
