   "comments": [
    "Very fair workload and interesting (if sometimes repetitive) discussions - you have three short (two page) papers, and a longer 10 page research paper due at end of term, for which you need to do research in the archives of either Beinecke or Sterling. Prof. Rugemer is very helpful and passionate about the subject - highly recommended class.",
    "Lots of reading, tolerable amounts of writing, lots of great in depth class discussions. My favorite class this semester.",
    "Take it! Take it! Take it!",
    "TAKE IT. Professor Rugemer is the best. You will not regret taking this course. The workload is not too heavy but incredibly fulfilling. TAKE IT!",
    "I would recommend the course. Many of the books are really interesting, and although you don't have to read them all to get by in the discussions, they are worth reading. Professor Rugemer is a very laid back and friendly guy; he cares about the course, and he knows the material extremely well. Also, it's not that much writing for a QR credit. Only three 500 word papers and one longer and fairly challenging research paper. Take the course!",
    "This is a great class for those interested in history and in african american studies, as well as a good class for those wanting to learn how to write a solid history paper. It's a very good freshman seminar, but I would avoid it if you're not interested in reading a lot about the history of one topic.",
    "I would not particularly recommend considering how great some other freshman seminars sounds.",
    "Take this course. It's a lot of reading but it's very rewarding. The course work is not extremely demanding but requires a good bit of planning to do. Overall a very good class.",
    "The Significance of American Slavery was a great course. All of the readings were interesting and Professor Rugemer did a great job of leading class discussions. I enjoyed meeting in the Beinecke and learning how to use the archives. While the final research paper was challenging, I appreciated having the opportunity to conduct original research. Definitely consider this classhighly recommended!!!"
