    "EXCELLENT!I wish the course had been available to me in my first year so that I could have applied all that I learned in this class to the survey work I did last spring and summer for my internship.",
    "Great course. Interesting subject matter. Great instructor. Great atmosphere. Overall great course. Highly recommended.",
    "A valuable skill. This was driven home to me as I executed the byzantine questionnaire from my practicum.",
    "Fantastic. By far one of the most practical and applicable courses in YSPH.",
    "Best course I have taken at YSPH so far. Every minute of class and all assignments are extremely practical and directly benefitted my summer internship project.",
    "This course was very interesting and practical for careers in public health.",
    "This was the first semester this course was offered and I think it went very well. You learn some great skills in creating and validating questionnaires and it's really exciting to work with real data that you collect and analyze yourself. It's a very hands-on class and is also very personalized to your interests.",
    "I learn a lot from this course.",
    "Awesome professor. Treated us like adults\/self directed learners. I learned a lot though some of the readings were superfluous.",
    "The course wasa solid introduction to key concepts in questionnaire development and validation. Working through the entire process ourselves for the class project was a very valuable experience and probably the best way to really learn the material.Looking back on the course, I wish we had covered even more content, including getting to factor analysis earlier in the semester and exploring that in more depth. The lectures often ended with time to spare in the assigned class period, so it would have been great to either go into the topics in more depth or to cover more topics.A few suggestions for possible improvements to the course:(1) I think it also would have been helpful to have a periodic lab session for the course, either with students bringing their laptops to class or meeting in a computer lab. We could work with existing data sets (before obtaining our own questionnaire data results) to practice the coding for the different exploratory and analytic techniques, and then discuss the results together to be sure that we were interpreting them correctly. This would have been helpful practice in advance of doing the data analysis for our own class projects.(2) I would have enjoyed starting off each class session with a discussion of the assigned readings. I think it would have helped me check my own understanding of the readings, and allowed us to cover complementary material in the lecture. Some weeks the lecture covered much of the same material that was in the readings, which diminished the incentive to do the readings as the semester progressed.(3) Consider having each student in the class do a brief oral presentation of his\/her questionnaire during one of the class periods. We had a class session in which we did peer review in small groups but it would have been interesting to hear about each class member's questionnaire, especially as not all of them were included in the eventual SurveyMonkey.(4) It would have been helpful to understand how the question format would translate into SurveyMonkey data output (in Excel) before finalizing the question format. Some formats produced data that required extensive manipulation\/recoding in order to use in analyses. If I had known that the data would come out that way, I could have changed the question format to capture the same content but in a way that produced more useable data. Perhaps the class members could complete a sample survey early in the semester in which the same question was asked in several different formats on SurveyMonkey, and then that data could be used (for example in a lab session) so students could see the relationship between the choice of question formats and the recoding needed for analysis.(5) Consider having a class session where we read some 'bad' validation papers and have to critique them. We did some of this around selected examples from the book chapters but more practice in such critical questionnaire evaluation would have been great."

    "Instructor: Marney A. White \u00a0Dr. White is a great teacher! She is very down-to-earth and provides lots of helpful feedback on assignments. She has tons of experiences in questionnaire development and gives great examples of how to approach this subject is appropriate ways. She is also really funny and made classtime enjoyable and worthwhile.",
    "Instructor: Marney A. White \u00a0She is great.",
    "Instructor: Marney A. White \u00a0Awesome professor! Nice, bright, good at communicating concepts, a true expert in her field, funny, maintained the attention of students.You should bring her on board for other EPH classes.",
    "Instructor: Marney A. White \u00a0Marney was an exceptional instructor. She was passionate and knowledgeable about the material but also accessible and personable in answering questions and providing guidance at each stage of our projects. Her extensive experience in developing questionnaires was evident and a real asset to the course; she was not just teaching us the theory but providing insight into how to address problems we might encounter in real-world applications of the theory. Marney was very responsive on email and generously provided comments on multiple drafts of our papers. She also took the time to enter all of our survey questions on SurveyMonkey and posted a variety of helpful resources on ClassesV2. She really went above and beyond in making the course a success."

    "Excellent introduction to how and why we need to be methodical in conceiving an epi questionnaire ...AND the steps for getting it done, from a real pro.The semester's reading and survey-development-and-testing-and-launch assignments culminate in a final manuscript. A lot of work, but all of it was well worth it and highly rewarding to this student.",
    "learn how to properly develop, evaluate, and validate questionnaires.",
    "Well worth taking. Fun and instructive.",
    "I definitely recommend this to any student interested in research. We all hear about reliability and validity of measures, but most of us have no idea how these conclusions are made. The work from this class is already helping me on my research for my PhD. Go for it.",
    "If you are thinking about conducting a questionnaire based project in the future, do yourself a favor and take this course.",
    "This is one of the best courses I have taken at YSPH. The material is relevant to future public health professionals. The instructor is extraordinary. The questionnaire development project is an enjoyable class assignment that takes the students through an entire questionnaire research project from beginning to end.",
    "I would definintely recommend this course to another student. No matter whatfield of public health you are in, questionnaires are an important aspect of research and evaluation. Learning to properly create and validate one makes a big difference and this course gives you all the skills you need to do so.",
    "Great introduction to questionnaire development.",
    "Recommend highly.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. Questionnaire development and validation is an important and useful skill in many areas of public health. The skills you learn in this course will give you a foundation for designing your own questionnaires and for evaluating questionnaires used in the literature."
