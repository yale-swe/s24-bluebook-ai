    "I would definitely recommend this course! It's interesting but you definitely need to study for the tests.",
    "Very good class, interesting information. Tests are fair and easy to study for, everything is based off the lectures for the most part, no trick questions, not too much information to memorize. I would recommend for a fellow student. The \"essay\" (project) is a little stressful tho.",
    "Take this course. It's simple, straightforward, and really interesting. Note, though, that if you don't particularly enjoy learning about hunter-gatherers for an entire semester you won't enjoy this class.",
    "I would take this--not an absurd amount of work, interesting material, you'll get something out of it.",
    "Interesting topic, but lectures were kind of boring and overly easy to understand. I would have enjoyed more depth rather than breadth in the material. Sometimes it is difficult to remind yourself why the material is relevant, since it seemed kind of arbitrary sometimes, and it is difficult to link it all together back to an overall question or topic for the class. I would suggest the Professor puts more effort into explaining the relevance of the things he is teaching. I took it Credit D and I don't think it's hard to get an A-, but I know I would have been frustrated if I had taken it for a grade, because what you give to the class (time-consuming resource study)is less than what you get from it (arbitrarily assembled material, relatively boring lectures and lack of depth or rigor).",
    "Think about the final project now. The final project is your study on a resource that humans in your area use. If you have never done a research project before, ask the teacher and teacher's assistant for help at the beginning of the course. They expect you to know what you are doing when you walk into the class. Little guidelines are given for the milestones, so ask your teacher's assistant beforehand what they expect and check up with them a week before they are due.",
    "Great class -- you should take it! Really interesting material, and fun\/relaxed lectures. I learned a lot. The resource study is a pretty big project, but if you choose an interesting resource it can be a lot of fun.",
    "Midterm was difficult, would have been hard to get an A\/A-, happy I took it credit\/D\/fail. The Resource project is a hit or miss depending on what you selected as a resource, so choose something you are actually interested in!",
    "Great class with super interesting material. Not too difficult, and teaches you a lot about our species' history and part of how we arrived at our current state of affairs.30% midterm30% 7-10 pg paper (with graphs if ya want)30% final10% section",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone. The information is so interesting, and it's not too difficult of a class. You need to study for exams though, and go to section.",
    "This is probably not the best class for a person who has never taking an anthropology class before, but shop it and see if you like it. Nothing really changes after the first lecture, so you'll get a good sense then.",
    "Anthropology is a good course if your interested in human evolution."
