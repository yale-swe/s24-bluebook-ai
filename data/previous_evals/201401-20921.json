   "comments": [
    "Take this class, particularly with Ehrgood. He is the consensus best English 120 professor and you will leave his class enlightened. He gives interesting readings and is pretty flexible with deadlines. The guy is a genius and will blow you away every class. He also brings cookies and sushi to class from time to time.",
    "If you like to read and write, you must take English 120. And you must take it with Andrew Ehrgood. You might be overwhelmed by the intensity with which he expects you to read each and every essay (don't think: oh, essays are short to read and write, this will be easy. it won't.), but you will gain a lot from this class. Attendance is high, and people are (almost) always engaged in thoughtful conversation. Take it.",
    "I would recommend ENGL 120 to anyone at Yale. (I took this class as a senior because I've always wanted to take it, but have never tried too hard to fit it in my schedule.) It was a lovely class to take senior spring (leisure reading for credit). And as a bonus, my writing improved.",
    "It's a great class, a lot of gratifying work",
    "I would be careful before taking this class. As an Econ major, I was looking for something different than normal QR, SO classes. I thought this would be a chance to express myself and channel my thoughts into papers. It turned out being quite hard. Yes, I did have the chance to explore things that I would not have otherwise, but I felt more constrained than I expected. Take this only if you are sure that you want to develop a way of writing essays in a very specific way--not because you are trying to express yourself. I did enjoy the course, but it was not what I expected it to be.",
    "100000% a must-take, and a must-take with Professor Ehrgood! I've been putting off taking this because I was afraid of the workload and afraid of the grading - turns out both were just not things to worry about. The workload is definitely manageable and really fun! We wrote five papers and did four revisions of those papers over the course of the semester, with lots of interesting readings and class discussions in between. The work was spaced out pretty well throughout the semester too. Professor Ehrgood is an awesome amazing super insightful professor and his comments really helped improve my writing. Also, the class discussion was really great and our class got really close after workshopping each other's writing! Everyone was so helpful and so funny and it was incredible to see how everyone's writing grew over the semester (Professor Ehrgood showed us the revisions after we had helped them workshop their papers). Take it take it take it.",
    "You should not graduate from Yale without taking English 120, and it would definitely be in your best interest to take it with Ehrgood. This is basically a universally-agreed-upon fact among the student body. However, I would add that it should not be your first course with a substantial writing component. It's a lot of work, and you may initially underestimate that.",
    "Wonderful course. Allows for you to workshop your writing and lean on peers for suggestions and encouragement.",
    "This class really helps you improve your writing because you see how other great writers have written. You delve into style and practice using other writers as guides. I would recommend this class to anyone who wants to improve their writing or who just likes to write in general.",
    "I would definitely recommend 120. High school is a lot of analytical writing with a few creative assignments here and there, but 120 helps you write in entirely new styles and try out different influences you otherwise would not have been exposed to. It is not a very stressful class either, provided you get started on assignments with enough time.",
    "I would highly recommend English 120. Professor Ehrgood is wonderful, and I felt lucky to spend part of my week with him and learn from his expertise. I found each of the five essays to be challenging and enjoyable. The essays are short, and the class fosters a careful and detail-oriented attitude towards completing the work. It is the sort of class that motivates you and makes you feel very proud of your accomplishments.",
    "I would absolutely recommend ENGL 120 with Professor Andrew Ehrgood. As I understand it, his syllabus is slightly different from the other professors but I thought every assignment was well worth the effort and time spent. We had five essays with four subsequent revisions (essays 1,2, 3 or 4, and 5), the final essay being a lipogram assignment, which I believe is unique to Prof Ehrgood's section. Although I still have things that I'd like to improve on in all my final essay drafts, I cherish all of the pieces that I have written in this class."
