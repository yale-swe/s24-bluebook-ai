   "comments": [
    "Typical L3 language requirement accomplishing course. Take it to get the distribution or if you are genuinely interested in Spanish. Prof. Tortora is wonderfully kind and generally a good teacher-- she sometimes spends too much class time telling personal anecdotes. But she is very quick to help students and provide additional resources\/ answer questions. It is very clear her students are in her best interest. Having homework every day is tiring, as is meeting every day for class, but seeing the same people every day leads to closer friendships and more interesting classroom discussions. The workload is very manageable. Given the nature of exams, it is very difficult to get an A in the course; however, an A- or B+ is completely doable.",
    "It sucks, there is an awful amount of grammar but you probably have to take it so get ready to hate yourself.",
    "I would not recommend it, but the language requirement makes it so that most students interested in Spanish have to take it.",
    "It teaches you to speak Spanish much better. It's a consistent, moderately heavy workload, but entirely manageable. Take it if you want to learn Spanish. Do your homework--shockingly, it helps you learn Spanish! Don't take it if you expect to skate by doing nothing, but you can finagle your way around somewhat, so don't stress about it.",
    "This class is good to fulfill language requirements and improve fluency in spanish. However, if you have a choice, go for the L3\/L4 abroad.",
    "Not life changing, but helps you improve your Spanish.",
    "I enjoyed the class very much, and the workload was nice and reasonable (as opposed to what I have had in the French department). The textbook is terrible and softcover and ridiculously expensive however...",
    "Yes I would recommend to fill a language credit but outside of that I would not because of the mass amounts of work."
