   "comments": [
    "Survey class on U.S. national security that introduces students to a variety of tools of statecraft.",
    "This course seems to fulfill the stereotype of a \"policy\" class by a senior fellow - some useful practical knowledge, lots of important guests and potential networking opportunities, somewhat light on substance and academic rigor. Overall I'd recommend it, but with reservations.",
    "If you're interested in understanding how the national security decision making process works in the United States, this is a useful course.",
    "I would definitely recommend if you have any interest in the topic. It's an engaging class with a lot of open discussion.",
    "Yes. I would recommend GLBL 757 to any student interested in diplomacy, civil-military relations, intelligence, or any other aspect of national security decision-making.",
    "This is a great course where you get to have a bit of simulation and emulation. Best for students who want to work in government, crafting foreign policy. I would recommend it to those students, as it exposes them to many high level contacts, its an intimate enough class where you have a lot of interaction with the instructor, and the workload is small, but still challenging."

   "question_text": "How did this course deepen your knowledge of your discipline\/profession? To what extent did this course contribute to your dissertation\/research?",
   "comments": [
    "The main substantive contribution of this course was that it required us to think about concrete policy recommendations. It was a useful exercise to have to come up with one's own national security policy agenda rather than just critiquing extant ideas or speaking in generalities about best practices.",
    "I have a better understanding of how natl security decisions are made in the US and how important personal relationships are at the top.",
    "Professor Spence provided inside knowledge that cannot be found in the standard books and articles on the topics.",
    "Coming from a non-traditional background for the subject matter, I learned a great deal that will help me in my future career and provide useful context for future Global Affairs classes.",
    "This course helped me with my memo\/brief writing. It also exposed me to new topics like cybersecurity and economic tradecraft that I had not taken a course on before."
