    "Joe Salem's a good instructor, and an even better person. He's kind and understanding, which makes the class a lot less stressful. The class itself is basically an ear-training course, with a \"keyboard lab\" component. If you play piano and have perfect pitch, it should be pretty easy. On the flip side, I imagine this class would be inconceivably hard if you can't do either, so tread carefully.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone who's interested in music. The listening and singing skill that you'll develop are quite useful. However, since this is a training course, it WILL take time and effort. So unless you really like music, it'll most likely be a very long and hard course.",
    "A quick and fast-paced introduction to musicianship for people who have a strong musical background. This is a good and fun course but be prepared for much more than a half credits worth of work.",
    "This class is a really fun introduction to ear training and sight-singing. Everyone in my class came in with really different skill sets and needs, and Professor Salem did a really good job catering to each student while making the class enjoyable and challenging. The piano labs are super fun and low-key, and very helpful. I think this class helped me train my ear a lot (and also realize where I need more practice). There is substantial homework, but it's a really nice change from your normal kinds of homework."
