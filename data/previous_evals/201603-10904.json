   "comments": [
    "The classes have a relaxing atmosphere and requires a low work commitment On the other side, it has no structure. This could be improved by giving it some structure. Assignments were never given back so one had no idea of the grades one was receiving. This could be improved by giving assignments back.",
    "I did not know my grade at all through out the course, which was a weakness. The class also lacked a little structure. We mainly had guest lectures, which were interesting, but I would have liked to see the professor teach more.",
    "This course was great. I really enjoyed it, especially the guest lecturers. The only suggestions I have are to offer more feedback on class presentations and papers.",
    "This was a pretty awful course. It was mostly bearable because it did not require a very large amount of work, but students were extremely unengaged and nobody in the class really seemed to care at all for the class.",
    "Strengths: Student-initiated projects on topics that are interesting to you. Weaknesses: The topics felt random and not integrated. There was no feedback throughout the semester on the quality of our work. The papers felt long and lacked guidance."

    "Yes, if your workload and intellectual capacity is already maxed from other courses, you would want to take it as this course offers none of those.",

    "No",
    "I would not recommend. Take it if you are looking for a science credit and can't stand actual science but don't mind writing a few research papers. If you actually enjoy science, you wont find it here. The course consisted entirely of guest lecturers and student presentations, which were all thoroughly un-engaging, with the exception of our cheese tasting on the final class. That is the only section that I actually remember the material from.",
    "A relatively easy, writing-based geochemistry class. I would take this class if you are looking for a straight-forward way to fulfill requirements"
