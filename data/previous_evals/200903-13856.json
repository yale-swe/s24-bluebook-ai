   "comments": [
    "L3 Spanish reviews the material covered in earlier Spanish courses before proceeding to further concepts. Vocabulary is presented in thematic units (the environment, vacations, etc.) much like in earlier courses. Pretty much all old grammar concepts (from conjugation in the simple present up past the preterite and the imperfect) are reviewed first (so don't be concerned if you're a bit rusty; for instance, I didn't take Spanish last year). Then, the course covers new material. Students learn all the types of commands, the imperfect subjunctive, basic adverbial clauses, and other new concepts. The course includes a variety of instructional methods, including lectures, readings, oral practice, online and paper homework, and in-class essays. Grades are based on a wide range of assignments,requiring active participation all semester. Be warned: the textbook (Enfoques) is exorbitant, and the online assignments are graded without human involvement (not always accurately). I took this course after Spanish 1 and Spanish 3 (skipping over 2) in high school; the only tricky adjustment for me was that the entire class was conducted in Spanish. Whether you've taken L2 or you place into this class, I would recommend it.",
    "L3 is basically a review of the grammar from L1 and L2. If you've already taken these two at Yale, the class will probably not be nearly as enjoyable as there are lot assignments and busy-work style homework. You will learn more Spanish, though. It seems like a good starting point for others starting the language at Yale with a decent grammatical background (any gaps in knowledge will be filled).Professor Safille is incredible...she is lively, engaging, and cares about the students. Choose sections wisely.",
    "I would recommend this if you have to take it or really want to get your spanish grammar down pat. Take it with Barbara, she is fantastic and makes the class enjoyable.",
    "Span 130 is a great intermediate class, and not overly difficult. You do a comprehensive review of basic grammar, and then go further towards the tail end of the semester. The emphasis is on gaining mastery of the language and learning slightly more complex constructions, as well as building up vocabulary. There is a fair amount of daily work, but I would work ahead on the weekends rather than have to deal with stuff every night, and that was doable (less daily work than similar level French classes). I would recommend taking it with Barbara Safille, she was awesome and really high energy. Take it if you want your Spanish to improve.",
    "I would recommend this course because it summarizes grammar rules and improves oral skills."
