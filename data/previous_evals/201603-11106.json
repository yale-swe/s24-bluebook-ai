    "Really enjoyed this class, learned a lot",
    "A deep and very interesting investigation into rome baroque art. The reading materials are insightful, diverse, and always interesting to read.",
    "Excellent lecture course that managed to balance breath and depth. Wonderful material, wonderful readings, wonderful collaboration between professor & teaching fellow. Overall, one of the best classes I've taken at Yale!",
    "I learned an immense deal in this course. The course covered a large scope of artworks in the 17th century, treating paintings as well as sculpture and architecture. The theoretical framework for interpreting the Baroque was both insightful and valuable for larger art historical inquiries. I found Professor Suthor's approach to the art truly illuminating and refreshing; she also encouraged literary approaches to the works, which helped paint a fuller picture of this fascinating time period.",
    "After seeing the Baroque works during my travels, this course placed visual analysis in a contextual academic framework, which I greatly enjoyed",
    "This class greatly helped with my art historical writing and analytical thinking. The class excursions to the MET and Wadsworth Atheneum were great ways of synthesizing my knowledge from class.",
    "The professor exposed us to interesting pieces of art and explained their history and iconographic meaning. She brought us to three museums and taught us how to analyze and explain a piece of art in person."

   "comments": [
    "This course is well organized. The two excursions are very rewarding.It would be better if there are more opportunities in the class to have direct discussion with the professor.",
    "Excellent class. Manages to hit all of the \"high points\" of the Roman baroque (not an easy task) AND engage with them in depth. Great reading list, too.",
    "The course was really fantastic! I found the lectures to be clear and well-organized; the handouts provided were a great addition. The two field trips were excellent and encouraged close observation.",
    "The readings and pace of the course were very good, I would have wished however for the lectures to have been clearer.",
    "This class greatly helped with my art historical writing and analytical thinking. The class excursions to the MET and Wadsworth Atheneum were great ways of synthesizing my knowledge from class.",
    "I especially enjoyed the trips to museums and analyzing artwork in person. The professor is very helpful and extraordinarily generous with her time. She saw me outside of class to talk about course readings."

    "Yes!! Take this class, you won't regret it",
    "I would recommend this course very enthusiastically if you're interested in art history. You learn a lot if you do all the reading materials carefully.",
    "Absolutely!!!!",
    "Baroque Rome is a fascinating course. The material covered is fantastic, and the intellectual (largely literary) approach to the artworks and the Baroque, more generally, was truly stimulating. The passion that Professor Suthor shows for her subject is contagious! I have left this course with a much better understanding of the period, its major figures (and its lesser known artists), and a stimulated interest in art historical methodology and increasingly philosophical approaches to the study of art and history.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to anyone interested in Baroque Art.",
    "Yes! If you are interested in learning about a rich culture in an art historical context then take this class. Between the museum excursions and stimulating readings, you learn so much - and it's all interesting! Baroque Rome was such an intriguing place and period of time, and the class is organized in such a way that it lets you get the most out of it.",
    "Yes. The professor is very helpful and passionate about the subject matter, which makes the class interesting."
