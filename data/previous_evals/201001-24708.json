    "TAKE IT!",
    "It's a good way to learn a lot about the history of Mexico, which is really something every American should do, so it's well worth taking.",
    "Great course if you want to learn about Mexico's history. Professor Joseph looks at it from a unique perspective, but you still get the basic gist of the movements.It's a bit of work, so take it Credit\/D if you can. Still, an exceptional learning experience.",
    "This class covers Mexican history. We go quickly through the conquesty, spend a good month on the Mexican Revolution [you NEED that month to understand La Bola, so many people and events happening!], and the rest of the semester on contemporary Mexico. It's great.",
    "I loved this class!! Its a very interesting lecture. First of all, especially in light of today's issues of immigration and drug wars, everyone should have an understanding of Mexican history and of Mexican-U.S. relations, and this class does this very well. Second, there is a lot of readings plus a few movies to watch, but most of it is very interesting and relevant to class. Prof Joseph is great and always super understanding of students needs. Take it!",
    "Encompasses Mexican history from independence to the modern era, even as recently as drug wars and the 2006 election. If you want to learn anything about Mexico, this is definitely the class to take, because it shows how several things led to this thing, which led to other things, and so on, in a way that makes sense. There isn't that much work, just a good amount of reading. Definitely recommended.",
    "Yes. It drags a bit in the middle and sometimes can take a lot of time, but I feel like I learned an enormous amount about Mexican history, culture, and politics in just a semester. Professor Joseph is wonderful and you should get to know him.",
    "Take this class! It is very interesting and you learn a lot without getting bogged down in endless readings or papers. I recommend it wholeheartedly to everyone.",
    "This is a good, solid, small lecture that really brings alive its subject. Prof. Joseph's style moves beyond a dry study of the country; his obvious love for Mexico's people, history, and culture is infectious. Combining fact-filled lectures and a small history textbook with engrossing primary sources, music, film, and cool guest speakers helped transport this gringo south of the border for a couple hours every week. Most Mexico scholars seem to be pretty left-wing, and the professor and TAs are no exception, but Prof. Joseph does a good faith job of providing balance on most issues.",
    "This class covers Mexico from the colonial period until modern day. it will answer any and all questions that you have about the complex relationship between politics and society, among other things. The material is fascinating and eye opening. I can promise you that you will feel engaged with nearly every story that comes out of this. I think it is important for American students to have some experience with Latin America since they are our neighbors, and this class opens your eyes to many of the problems that these countries face.",
    "The class is an overview of Mexican history since 1810 with a focus on the 1900s (2\/3 of the class), especially the Mexican Revolution of 1910. The class has a lot of reading, probably too much, and a lot of work (reading responses for every section, an in class midterm, a take home midterm (5pg essay), a \"simulation,\" and a final). Professor Joseph clearly cares about his students and is a super nice guy, but his lecture style (no powerpoints, occasional slide shows using 35mm slides) is too old school for my taste. I also felt the material I was being presented with was skewed by his political views. Worth taking if you want to learn about Mexico, though.",
    "I highly recommend this class, especially if you have an interest in Mexico. There is a lot of reading but the class is well worth it.",
    "Take it if you are interested in Latin America. It is a priceless course. If you have no passion for Latin America, the course will seem painful and a lot of work.",
    "A very informative class",
    "This a great class that will give you a really good background and interesting perspective on Meican history. Progf. Joseph is a great lecturer. and the work load can sometimes be a little heavy but it's pretty doable.",
    "TAKE THIS COURSE. This was an amazing course. Mexican history is very interesting and important to learn about. Prof. Joseph is a great lecturer and organizes class well. He also cares about his students.",
    "Take it! History 358 is an excellent course. It covers Mexican history from the 19th century to now, focusing more on certain time periods (the Revolution, the modern day) through readings that supplement lectures and section. It's a decent amount of work--2 midterms, a final, and either a paper or group simulation project--but the material is interesting and worthwhile. You'll come out with a very good grip on some fascinating material.",
    "I would recommend it if you have any interest in Mexico. If not, then I guess not. But it really is interesting. So if you're open minded, and are interested at all in Mexico definitely take it. Joseph is great.",
    "Take this class! it is the best course offered on Latin America, it explains a lot about Mexico, the US-Mexico relation, and exemplifies development problems and Latin America today. Amazing!",
    "A clear and concise summary of Mexico's major developments throughout the specified time, explained in an interesting fashion. Definitely recommended.",
    "If you're interested in Mexico, TAKE THIS CLASS! It is truly exceptional.",
    "A very crucial overview of Mexican History and Mexico's relationship with the United States. I recommend this course to other Yale students with any form of interest in Latin American history (mexico as a case study), underdeveloped\/third world countries, or American imperialism. The course provides a significant # of primary resources as well as secondary resources. The diverse methods of instruction really helps make the course more engaging than any other history course. Apart from the intense reading assignments and Gil Josephs lectures, there were several interesting guest lecturers, lectures by the graduate students, film screenings, and a student simulation\/independent reading assignment. It's a lot of work but the course was great and as with education in general--the course is what you make it."
