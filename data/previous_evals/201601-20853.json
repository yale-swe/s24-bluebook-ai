    "This course is a lot of work but you will improve your Spanish grammar so much. This is a good course for someone who hasn't practiced or studied Spanish in a while, or for someone who is nervous about taking other L5 Spanish courses. While you will have a lot of homework, keeping up with it was rarely difficult and ultimately this course was far less stressful than other courses. I highly recommend it!",
    "Only if they were looking to really refine their Spanish grammar. Overall Spanish level could be improved in other Spanish courses.",
    "If you need to take L5 and aren't sure about taking a literature based class then absolutely!",
    "SPAN 243 is a great way to tie together all of your previous semesters of Spanish. It solidifies and expands upon all of the material you have learned before, as well as covers all of the little tricks that always tripped you up. Was really skeptical about taking this class after reading the reviews and talking to people that had already taken it, but I ended up really enjoying it. The workload is perfect.",
    "A lot of work by it strengthens your Spanish a ton.",
    "This class is the best kind of treadmill. The relentless work keeps your intellectual pulse high, but I guarantee that youll improve so consistently that whenever Profesora ramps up the work, youll be ready for it. I loved the predictable structure of each unit as well the myriad assignments within each unit, and Profesora went out of her way to pair each grammar concept with a short story so that you never felt like you had to write pointless sentences in the name of practicing grammar. And this brings me to the best feature of the class: Profesora herself. On one of my homework assignments, I wrote a sentence about how I learn best when I feel like I have a partnership with my teacher, and in between correcting my prepositions and clarifying the difference between ser and estar yet again, she wrote, Then please know that you are always welcome in my office hours. This exemplifies two of my favorite things about Profesora: The first is how she takes every single assignment seriously, especially the assignments that I would have written off as a busy work before. The second is how she creates space in her heart and her office hours for each one of her students. Take it from a clumsy Spanish speaker like me: you dont have to earn the love of someone like Profesora because she has more than enough to go around. Plus, you'll want to take this class just to see how she can make cold-calling adorable: she invents little games that are so elaborate that you wont even mind if you wind up being her victim."
