   "comments": [
    "If you like discrete math you'll probably enjoy the course, but otherwise the problems can seem tedious or contrived.",
    "Math 350 provides a framework for future studies in algebra, introducing many definitions and a few important theorems. The lectures are very clear and precise, with comparatively little homework. I recommend this course to all math majors who haven't taken intro to abstract algebra as well as to others who would like to study math but dislike computations. The subject is quite beautiful, even if things get slightly rushed near the end of the semester. This is also a good choice for freshmen interested in supplementing math 230 with another math course.",
    "FYI, this course is almost completely useless for physics majors. Don't bother if you are one.",
    "First part on group theory is good, second part on rings and modules got a more shallow treatment.It's not too difficult and the psets are short (not to mention the grader this year was extremely lenient, pretty much gave everyone full scores). However, it can get dry later especially when you don't see the application of the abstract objects you're learning about...If you want to learn more from the course, learn more about examples and applications (as I should have). For example, burnside's lemma or fermat's two square theorem.Also, it is advisable to go to lecture. Dummit and Foote has too much stuff in it so it's more efficient to get the lecture notes (also Casson is a good, organized lecturer).If you want to take higher level courses that use algebra (math or advanced physics) then definitely take this. Otherwise if you're just looking for a random class that sounds interesting, there are better options. And if you really want to know what a \"group\" is, just wikipedia :)",
    "This class is a great math class. Casson is very organized and gives you a nice survey of abstract algebra. Beware of the curve, though, as he curves the course pretty harshly. He is open with the class about it, though, so you should know after the midterm how you'll do.",
    "I loved it, but I love group theory ... don't expect any numbers -- if you like \"letters math\" then you know what I'm talking about. The class is fast and fun. Get to know the other students and study with them.",
    "MATH 350 was probably the most challenging course I've taken at Yale. The homeworks aren't too long, and it's not like the tests are absurdly difficult, but the actual material requires a lot of thought, and is difficult to understand at first. Prof. Casson teaches very clearly. The subject matter is very different from every other math course I've taken; it's pretty interesting, though it's really obtuse. Take it!",
    "This is a rigorous, difficult math course. You will work hard and you will learn abstract algebra. I don't think algebra is that interesting, but if you're a math or math-related major you should check it out. The tests are extremely difficult, but the problem sets are doable.",
    "If you have to take algebra you will survive and learn some of the basics but I did not find the class helpful in terms of developing an understanding for what the field is about and it did not get me excited about algebra. If you a math major you have to take it but if you don't then I would recommend taking a different math class because there are many other great ones.",
    "Definitely recommend it, even though it might be a blow to your GPA.",
    "Andrew Casson is an excellent teacher, so I recommend this course to students who want an introduction to group, ring, and module theory. The proofs in lecture are usually different from the ones used in the textbook, and every proof from lecture is very detailed (which is helpful for reviewing older material from notes).",
    "Coming from a truly fantastic Math 230\/231, I was somewhat disappointed with Math 350. The problem sets were not so interesting: the proofs usually followed directly from the definitions or propositions in the chapter. That being said, the material is important and I'm glad I learned it. It is like many introductory courses in that it prepares you for more interesting courses later on. I would not recommend this course unless you are intending to continue your study of algebra afterward.Prof. Casson is a very organized and comprehensible lecturer, and he provides useful insights into the subject. (His way of approaching quotients, for example, is way better than the textbook's version.) He is also a little dry.If you take it, study hard for the tests. The problem sets are very easy, but the tests are very difficult.",
    "It's a very pleasant class to take. He's a wonderful instructor, and everything is clear. However, think very carefully if you want to deal with his curve.",
    "I think this is an important class to take for math majors. Taking it will Casson will certainly mean you get a clear presentation of the topic, although he can sometimes be robotic. There is pretty manageable homework every week, two midterms and a final.",
    "Beautiful subject. I had never taken a proof-based class before, so this was trial by fire, but it turned out well. My one complaint is that the course is a bit too methodical - everything is just theorem\/proposition\/definition - proof ad infinitum. However, I really enjoyed the class, and Casson is great during office hours - he knows exactly what hints to give and how to give them, so that when you eventually do figure out a proof you can still feel as if you solved it. If you're a math major, I would definitely take this class.",
    "While I think that abstract algebra is an interesting subject, I think that it was not taught very well by Casson. Lectures were very dry and I do not think that he taught in a way that made understanding easy. I also thought the book was hard to use - I recommend getting another abstract algebra book to help with understanding.That said, Casson is a very nice professor who cares about his students and will help if you go to office hours.I think the material was pretty hard. It started very easy, but don't be fooled by the first few days of shopping period. It gets very technical and conceptual.",
    "The first half of the course covers group theory, and the other covers ring theory and module theory. I highly recommend this course to all math majors, and all others who like abstract mathematics. Homework is very manageable; just make sure to prepare well for exams."
