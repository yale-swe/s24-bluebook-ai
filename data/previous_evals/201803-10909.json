    "Rudimentary probability and statistical theory",
    "Good understanding of probability theory, serious quantitative skills",
    "Useful skills of metrics",
    "I learn a lot in econometrics.",
    "Probability and statistics.",
    "Learn about statistical tools in economics",
    "Although I knew many of the concepts covered in this class before, this course help me have a better and deeper understanding about them.",
    "Seriously developed my knowledge of econometric theory and skills relating to that, as well as my perseverance. The course was very difficult for me, but I'm glad to have put in the effort to make it through.",
    "I learn how to proof some lemmas or theorems. In that sense I know now where they come from. Also I feel I got a much deeper understanding on some topics.",
    "I learned a lot about the theory of probability and statistics. I became well-versed in the concepts that form the basis for these fields.",
    "Econometrics, probability, statistics",
    "I think I gained a deeper understanding of the foundations behind statistical methods of inference. I gained some more familiarity in manipulating equations to put them in a more useful form.",
    "It was an extremely useful course for learning the fundamentals of probability and the common statistical tools (confidence intervals, hypothesis testing). It gives a much clearer understanding of estimation methods (ML, GMM) and, at least for me, it connected several concepts that were sort of divided in my head.",
    "Basic measure-theoretic probability, and statistical inference.",
    "Understanding of econometric theory",
    "I effectively learned the mathematical foundations of statistic and probability. The formal and rigorous approach to these foundations was a remarkable takeaway of this course.",
    "I had very little background in statistics and so I gained a thorough background in probability theory and statistics."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The weakness is definitely the very basic level of the course material. I wish the instructor would have used his time to present and prove deeper and more complex results. The required homework take a lot of time to finish while providing no insights or learning experience at all.",
    "Strengths - most of material covered is interesting - course is challenging and rigorous, definitely made me smarter Weaknesses - Took up so much time compared to other courses - was difficult to keep up, material was covered at such a fast pace, that it was hard to understand and process it. I think it could benefit from eliminating some of the lectures - sigma fields, and lebesgue measure, and a few others, and covering the remaining topics more thoroughly and in better depth. Exams were so difficult - I don't understand the philosophy of giving an exam that you expect most students not to be able to answer half the questions. Then it becomes more of a test of what they already know from other courses rather than what they've learned in this course. Also many of the lectures were dull and hard to follow.",
    "No weakness. Perfection",
    "The course is taught in a clear and straightforward way.",
    "Very rich in content.",
    "The course content is very well structured and it's very clear.",
    "The lecture notes are very clear.",
    "Strengths: The lectures, homework and exam are very coherent, nothing felt disconnected. The materials were very high quality, better than the assigned text. I'm sure I'll refer to for years to come.",
    "Strength: it is very deep and is very well structured. I think it can be improved by showing in which situations all the material is going to be useful in research. Sometimes it gets too abstract and we lose perspective of what is the importance of these topics.",
    "The problem sets were mostly adequate in length and difficulty. However, towards the end of the semester, one or two problems per homework were too difficult for me. The final was difficult but reasonable. The midterm was unreasonably long for the allotted time.",
    "The class notes are very detailed and extremely helpful. Everything you could ever need is in the class notes, and they are straightforward and therefore easy to understand (as easy as this complicated math could ever be). The weakness I found is that sometimes I found myself not understanding why we were studying certain things, or the connection between the different topics being studied, which made the class a bit harder to follow. I'm also not sure how helpful many of the concepts are to PhD students who are not interested in econometric theory.",
    "Well structured, engaging",
    "The volume of concepts and the corresponding pace at times felt overwhelming. I found the lecture notes to be very good. However, I did not feel I learned much from listening to lectures, and I think it would be more helpful if the actual lectures were more differentiated from the notes. For example, the lectures could be more focused on the hardest parts of the lecture, while the notes provide a comprehensive look at the lecture as a whole.",
    "I like how the topics are covered and how the course builds upon itself. The Lecture Notes are amazing. I do not know if there is a particular reason, but the only thing is that it would have been more natural for me that, after OLS, we would cover point estimation, interval estimation and finish with hypothesis testing. The latter topics are very closely related so I believe that would make the transition smoother.",
    "No weaknesses",
    "Strengths: high quality of the problem sets, lecture notes, and the course efficiency to deliver its main takeaway: a rigorous formalization of microeconomics' foundations. Weakness: I believe the lectures can be more didactic, interactive and focus more on intuitions related to the topics of the course. The remaining details (which are on the lecture notes and on the textbook) will necessaraly be covered by students at home when they are doing the problem sets - and may not overload the amount of information given in the lectures.",
    "Dr. Andrews provides a fantastic set of notes and the course assignments allowed students to work through representative problems. While I found it difficult to follow along in class, I think that was more the result of my unfamiliarity with the material than through any fault of Dr. Andrews. I do think that the TA session might be more helpful if it were used to provide more of a summary of the week's lectures and focused less on covering new material. I did really appreciate the time in the TA session spent going over past exam questions and strategies for solving frequent questions included on exams."

    "I regret taking the course and would not recommend anyone to take it.",

    "Yes.",
    "Econometrics is one of the classes fulfilling the requirements of the economics PhD. However, if it was not required, I would not recommend it to someone unless they were interested in the theory of econometrics, or if they felt insufficiently challenged. I don't feel that the material is very transferable to other areas, and it is in my opinion too difficult to be worth the effort.",
    "it is a useful course for a review of basic methods in statistics.",
    "Definitely. The course provides the theoretical foundations for both theoretical and applied work.",
    "Yes.",
    "Yes",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. The strengths I mentioned above (in Question 3 of this evaluation) by far outweigh the weakness that I also mentioned. I believe the course was very efficient to deliver its main takeaway: a rigorous formalization of the foundations in statistics and probability.",
    "Yes, but only if that student was interested in probability and statistics theory. It's not a class for an individual hoping to gain a background in the application of econometrics."
