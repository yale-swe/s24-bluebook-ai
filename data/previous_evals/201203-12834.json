    "Yes, it is a fun class.",
    "Yes. Great class and instructor",
    "You have to take a language. Might as well take Spanish",
    "I would recommend this course if taught by Prof. Lomask.",
    "It's a lot of verb tenses and for the most part pretty fast.",
    "Laurie's just about as loose as they come. If you have to take L3, do it with Laurie. She's by far the nicest, most relaxed, and least demanding of the department professors, and is so great to work with. Laurie really values the learning experience, and does not get bogged down in grade calculations. If you put in a decent amount of effort, she will reward you. I'm not a language person, and probably wouldn't be taking spanish if I didn't have to, but I genuinely enjoyed Spanish with Laurie. You'll learn a good amount, and keep loose in the process.",
    "It is an intermediate spanish course that starts with the basics and goes all the way through to the most complicated of grammar topics.I would recommend it because the student will be challenged verbally and grammatically. It is a great way to improve on all fronts."
