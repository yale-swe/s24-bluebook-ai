    "I recommend this class but only if you know what you are getting into. You really need to be interested in the relationship between humans and our environment and willing to delve into some very philosophical stuff. Also, you really need to do the reading or you won't get much out of the class. I regret not forcing myself to do more of the reading. The only assessment besides some small reading responses is a final paper which is long (25-30 pgs) and open ended. Beware: get started on this early or you are doomed.If you are environmental studies major, you should absolutely take this class. I don't know anything about the other professor who teaches the other semester so I can only vouch for Dove as an excellent choice.",
    "This is a very interesting class. It makes you think deeply about challenging issues: Humans relationship with the environment, how nature influences the construction of culture, how culture influences the construction of nature, etc. Its nice that the course is so wide-ranging; it is part anthropology, but also part philosophy. However, this class is less a seminar than a small lecture. The professor pretty much speaks the whole time (you can interject and spark a small discussion, but eventually it goes back to him lecturing), and tacks on 30 minute (or less) student-led discussion component at the end. While it is a great introduction to anthropology, it is difficult to take without a background in Anthro, primarily because the professor expects a certain type of argumentation. If it isn't in an anthropological format, for lack of better term, he attempts to reconfigure your point to fit his understanding of the issue, which can be frustrating. Shop it to see how you like the seminar dynamic.",
    "Material varies from interesting to boring. I'd check out the textbook and a class before deciding for sure.",
    "One of the best classes I've taken thus far. The material is incredibly interesting, and Prof. Dove is wonderful at teaching this as an upper-level seminar -- the amount of freedom in designing the term paper given to us is really refreshing.",
    "I would recommend it to a student for the material and the opportunity to interact with Professor Dove. I would not recommend it for being a thoroughly engaging course to be very honest, but there were many classes where I felt incredibly intellectually engaged because of the issues, the material, and the ability to ask questions. I'm not sure that there's much else like it to be fair, but I would suggest looking elsewhere before 'settling' on this course. In terms of material though, this has been one of my most interesting and valuable classes at Yale. Perhaps an environmental studies\/agrarian studies lecture class or an actually upper-level anthropology course would be good, because this course tried to have a serious discussion element but it was really a struggle. At times I thought this course would have been better as a lecture followed by question and answer time.",
    "As most courses seem to be, you get out what you put in. You probably could put this on the back burner, breeze through it just because it is a requirement, and get by doing minimal work. However, I wouldn't recommend it. Do the readings. They actually are really interesting if you look further into them. If things seem dry and outdated, reconsider it in a new light and make it relevant to yourself. You have considerable freedom for the final project. Take advantage of this and make it into something you will enjoy researching\/writing\/learning about.",
    "definitely. the class is a good overview of environmentalism, indigenous people, anthropology as it relates to the use of the environment. class blew my mind on a regular basis."
