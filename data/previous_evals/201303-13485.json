    "Excellent class. Essays were varied and fun to write and assigned readings were very useful when sitting down to write your own essay.",
    "120 with Professor Stuart was a great class. The readings were well-chosen, and every class left me with some new insight into the techniques of writing. The grading could be a little tough at times, but that's true for a lot of English dept courses. Professor Stuart was a sweetheart and was very accessible in terms of meeting to discuss papers, etc. If you want to take English 120, Professor Stuart is a good teacher to take it with.",
    "If you enjoy writing personal narratives then definitely take it. If non-fiction isn't your cup of tea though then it might be better to find another class.",
    "If you want to improve your essay-writing skills, read some great work and learn to think about writing in a new way, you should absolutely take this class. Different than any other writing I have done before, and it taught me a lot about both writing and myself.",
    "I would recommend English 120 if you enjoy writing, often about yourself and personal experiences and if you enjoy and are willing to deeply evaluate reading.",
    "I do recommend this class BUT only for students who genuinely enjoy more creative reading and writing. Don't take just for the WR credit if that's what you are looking for! This is a workshop class and it is really a pleasure for students who enjoy writing. If you are not into that, I can see the class becoming a burden. Also, I recommend researching into the Eng 120 professors in advance. Talk to previous 120 students about their professors and try to get into a section whose professor you believe would be a good fit for your style of working\/learning. I heard sections are verydifferent all around, especially when it comes to grading.",
    "English 120 is a great class -- it serves as a nice introduction to college writing. We read 3-4 essays for homework every night (many from the New Yorker and the like) and would discuss the essays in class. We wrote five essays total -- both a rough and final draft for each. I loved taking this class with Professor Stuart. The discussions were always interesting and I think she has really helped me improve my writing. Great class overall if you want to learn how to write modern essays. Highly recommended!",
    "Interesting reading and a lot of writing that will really make you understand the particular elements and style of your writing and what sorely needs improvement. Daily classes primarily consist of student essay workshops or analysis of assigned reading. Highly recommended.",
    "I would recommend it."
