    "Lots of great music, much of it little-known, with an adequate amount of information on historical context so as to be useful rather than distracting.",
    "I would say that it's an enjoyable class and that he or she should take it if he or she has any interest in Romantic and early Modern music from anywhere in Europe, since so much of what the course tries to teach is that \"Russia isn't really so weird and exotic after all, and yet it is.\" I would make sure that he or she was ready to give a lot of presentations and do a lot of reading, but also let him or her know that it's very welcoming to those even without much prior knowledge and is a great way to open up a new chunk of one's own repertoire."

   "comments": [
    "This course's material is for the most part a bit historically later than what I specialize in, but it was still very related and very enjoyable and enlightening to study. I feel like its contributions to my personal path will be more oblique than direct, but they'll be helpful all the same. It was also very interesting and helpful in serving as a good example of the types of questions and discussionsthat theorists and musicologists of different allegiances will put forth in response to music they are unfamiliar with."
