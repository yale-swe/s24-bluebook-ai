    "I learned so much about race and ethnicity in Japan, Korea, and China!!! More than I thought I would. Much more. And I know this knowledge will be useful as I pursue more East Asian classes. I wrote the longest paper I've ever written and feel extraordinarily proud of it :)",
    "I was able to gain more definitions and concepts around the sociological lens of race and ethnicity.",
    "I greatly appreciated the overview of concepts having to do with the study of sociology at the beginning of the course. I believed this served as a strong foundation on which our case studies could rest.",
    "This class is great for giving you a basic foundation in social theory relating to race and ethnicity. The class then moves on to apply those concepts more specifically to East Asian ethnicities and minorities within East Asian nations. I particularly enjoyed learning about East Asian diasporic experiences.",
    "To have a general understanding of the theories of ethnicity and race, and to understand some current debates surrounding the definition and usage of the terms. This course also enabled students to gain a comprehensive understanding of the race and minority issues in Japan, and how are they comparable to the counterpart examples in the Western i.e. Asian Americans, Japanese Brazilians etc."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I learned so much in the course. And the class seems extremely fair to all students--possible to get an A if you put in the effort without being compared to every other student.",
    "The course could be greatly improved if more time was allowed for discussion. Lectures were excessive and overdrawn. Furthermore, more often than not the lectures were a regurgitation of weekly readings that gave little new insight. This class felt more like a lecture than a seminar.",
    "I like the depth to which we explored topics each week. The readings were incredibly helpful for giving a full sense of the issue at hand and the lectures helped to put things into perspective (like giving a larger overview of the country in question or discussing government policies). Though, I did wish we spent more time learning about Korea and China so that it would be more balanced with our in-depth look at Japan.",
    "The course is organized really well and moves logically throughout the material. When you do the readings, you get a lot more out of the class compared to when you do not. This class is worth doing the readings for. In terms of improvement, we often found ourselves running much overtime in terms of discussion. It would be great if the discussions could be more compartmentalized to be able to get through discussions fully.",
    "Strength: the readings are thorough and the required weekly critical summary allow students to be well prepared prior to the class with their own structural understanding of the weekly lecture topic and some critical discussion questions. Weakness: While the handouts distributed by the professor are extremely helpful, since all the students had already finished the readings and wrote the critical summaries, I'd rather to spent more time on discussion rather than lectures reviewing the contents of the weekly readings. Also, I would be interested to learn more about the way racial theories are discussed in East Asia. While this course provided a lot of readings discussing East Asian minority issues in the term of \"race,\" I would like to read and learn more about the opacity of race in East Asia: what are the difficulties of framing issues in East Asia in the term of race and why are there the necessity to use the specific concept--namely race--to explain the issue in East Asia."

   "comments": [
    "Yes! Although it most likely won't be offered in the future :( Very informative, readings were interesting, professor is helpful :)",
    "Unless the student has little to no knowledge on the subject this course is not recommendable. This course lends little to the facilitation of critical analysis and discussion.",
    "Yes - if you have any interest in East Asian diasporas or East Asian history\/politics, this course touches on all of those different interests. If you keep an open mind, you'll learn a ton.",
    "Yes, it is a really helpful course to build up structural understanding on not only fundamental understanding of race and ethnicity theories but also how are these theories discussed and applied in East Asia."
