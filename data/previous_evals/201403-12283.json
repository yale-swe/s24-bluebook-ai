   "comments": [
    "I would take it if you want a primer. It's not incredibly challenging or rigorous. You read interesting things about Chinese history and then try to connect them.",
    "I'd recommend this course to history and non-history majors alike! I found this course enlightening to say the least. You will take away as much as you'd like from it. You can choose to delve into (almost) any topic for your final paper and you get the benefits of a small seminar setting.",
    "A seminar, discussions depend on the other students in the course. A good overview of China and how its history relates to the environment.",
    "Take this and have a overview of Chinese history",
    "Don't take",
    "This course seemed interesting at first, but I leave this semester feeling very disappointed. Professor Schlesinger was one of the least qualified instructors I have had at Yale. First of all, he seldom responds to emails, and when he does respond, it is often days after the original email was sent. He did not seem to be very invested in his students learning-- for example, he would put much of our readings on Bass 24-hour reserve instead of putting them online, which was very inconvenient, especially if there were limited copies of the book. When we told him that this was inconvenient for us, he seemed to show little sympathy. Many times during class, it felt like he was just searching to fill the time instead of sticking to an agenda planned in advance. It gave the impression that he was very inexperienced. On top of this, his demeanor towards students was often somewhat arrogant and condescending. I would not recommend taking a class with him.",
    "This is a great class, and essential for anybody who \/really\/ wants to understand Chinese history. When discussing history, we often make big assumptions for simplicity. For example, in another course, we would say, \"And then the Han population base expanded substantially, and Chinese people began settling the Yangtze basin.\" In most history classes, you will learn this, but not think, \"Huh, why were they just now settling it? Why did it happen this way and not another? What were teh mechanisms and techniques that determined this process?\" These are questions that one often takes for granted when discussing history, but this class will really fill you in. You'll finish with a whole new perspective on history itself, forget China. Prof. Schlesinger is also a really interesting guy. I highly recommend this course."
