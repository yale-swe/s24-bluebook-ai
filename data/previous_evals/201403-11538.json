    "Instructor: Tamar Makov \u00a0Her comments on homework assignments were extremely nit-picky and not helpful, especially given the page limitations of the assignments. If we were to have answered all of her comments, the assignment would have been twice as long. Her presentations in class were hurried, cursory, and were presented in a way that implied she thought we were clueless and ignorant. She asked questions of us as if we were children. It turned me off.",
    "Instructor: Tamar Makov \u00a0I'm not sure what value either TF or TA added to this class in general. The greatest contribution was a discussion of NPV and that is something we learn in basic economics. Maybe focus the course more around their own areas of expertise (Tamar could have done a great lesson on the work she did in Israel).",
    "Instructor: Tamar Makov \u00a0Tamar is very knowledgeable about this topic area, however I do not believe she was a particularly fair grader. Her criticisms of our group work were unnecessarily nit-picky and when the professor or other TF looked at the same assignment, said that they would have graded it very differently.",
    "Instructor: Tamar Makov \u00a0She was very attentive, approachable, and always gave feedback in short time.",
    "Instructor: Tamar Makov \u00a0I thought Tamar was very knowledgable, friendly, and approachable! She had great English and command of the subject. I think her presentation skills could have used some improvement (specifically her voice inflection; her voice goes up at the end of sentences and I found this distracting), though overall I enjoyed the lectures that she led. Sometimes her suggestions differed from Marian's when writing the final report, which was a little confusing.",

    "Instructor: Tamar Makov \u00a0Clearly explained and justified points of view. Used thought experiments to encourage class engagement which I believe were effective.",
    "Instructor: Tamar Makov \u00a0I often felt that when it came to grading, the TAs were looking for ways to take off points and point out what was wrong, rather than constructively point out what was done right and where there was room for improvement. Based on discussions with other students in the class, it didn't seem like many people understood why certain groups received much better\/worse grades than others. This theme seemed to develop over the course of the semester to the point that the classroom did not have a positive atmosphere by the end of the semester.",

    "Instructor: Tamar Makov \u00a0Strengths: Good Researcher Weakness: Needs to handle more politely",
    "Instructor: Tamar Makov \u00a0Grading was far too slow to help us improve our work for the course. Faster feedback would allow us to change and grow over the course of the term. Instead the quality of our work stayed relatively unchanged since we didn't receive feedback until well after we were responsible for turning in several other assignments.",
    "Instructor: Tamar Makov \u00a0Marissa was incredibly accessable and gave insightful comments regarding questions on assignments.",
    "Instructor: Tamar Makov \u00a0It would be helpful to receive an updated schedule of due dates, should they change over the course of the semester. Also, I liked looking through the comments on each of my papers, but it would also be helpful to have a rubric for each project before submitting the project.",
    "Instructor: Tamar Makov \u00a0The grading in this course seemed arbitrary, and it often appeared the TA's and Chertow were not on the same page. The course seemed as though it was being planned week by week which limited the TA's ability to be helpful. They simply seemed unprepared for student questions because they weren't clear on what was expected either."

    "The field trip was rescheduled to the first day of Thanksgiving break many weeks into the semester and then said to be \"mandatory\" when students had already booked their tickets home. Not acceptable. I went on the alternative field trip to the lumber yard. A neat place to visit but was just tagging along to another class's field trip and had nothing to do with our own course. Overall a waste of time.",
    "Needs more in-depth discussion of strategy from a business perspective. Should be co-taught with someone from SOM, where FES can deal with the environmental management, and SOM can deal with the environmental strategy.",
    "None",
    "The class overs a great overview about all topics linked with environment and business strategy and management. Also, we always had great speakers coming in, which allowed us to not only have the theoretical approach but also learn from the experience and insights of the speakers. It was a great combination!",
    "I believe more class participation would be beneficial. The class time focused on introducing topics. I believe this could be better communicated through online videos (30 min). A flipped classroom style would allow more class engagement and discussion in a business school case study format.",
    "This was an excellent class, I learnt from lectures, guest speakers, TAs, and field trip.",
    "With regards to question 15, the course brought together case studies from different regions of the world. I found that interesting because it contextualised many concepts",
    "I really enjoyed this class.",
    "It can be useful to just choose between this course and industrial ecology. They are similar, this one is just more business planning and business concepts relative to the more operations-focused industrial ecology course. They are both useful and can complement each other nicely but the level of overlap can make it seem like you are wasting some of your time.",
    "I enjoyed learning about CEMS topics through my classmates' experiences, as well as through the reading, assignments, and lectures.",
    "Question 2: I enjoyed most of the readings for the class and many of the lectures. The readings weren't too technical and were short enough to be internalized and deeply thought upon for class discussion. However, the assignments were mostly unhelpful in my opinion. I would encourage making assignments like the Unilever case study individual assignments and reading responses instead of group work. Too much of the group work lacked a clear purpose. To make it more productive, there should be more group feedback forms to evaluate each other and more focus on how to work successfully in groups. The group work was mostly just done with friends as quickly as possible instead of building any team skills. Clearer explanations of why an assignment is important and worthwhile would go a long way towards improving the class. Questions 8-10: I understand that the field trip was being planned into the semester and require collaboration from outside companies, so planning is not always smooth. However, I was deeply disappointed that the date of the field trip listed on the syllabus wasn't firm. It took more than halfway into the semester for the field trips to be given a firm date, and yet there was a grade penalty for not going. The field trips weren't during normal class time, so students with regular Friday commitments were put in a position to either renege on those commitments or face a penalty. If the date on the syllabus was final or at least solidified early in the semester, plans could have been made to clear time for an out of class time trip. This issue gets to my main concern about the course. I felt that the plan for the class was constantly changing. Lecture topics changing isn't a problem, but the constant changes to HW assignments that require group work and considerable time to complete was not conducive to learning or helping students be successful."

    "I really like Professor Chertow. I thought she was a good facilitator of class discussion. Her level of expertise is evident and she brought in excellent guest speakers. I would encourage her to reform her lecture style by using few slides and tighten up each lecture. A better identification of the most important concepts for each lecture with supporting examples from the real world would add clarity. Lastly, I would like to see each lecture mention important skills and further reading related to the topic that students could pursue if they hoped to work in that particular industry after graduation.",

    "As to my opinion, there is no need for improvement.",
    "The final project is a disaster. Probably 75% of the time has been figuring out what Marion wants us to actually do, rather than doing a project. She needs to be more organized and more exact with the assignment so we don't waste so much time. Guest speakers were kind of a rag-tag bunch of ho-hum presenters.",
    "Time management in lectures",
    "There needs to be a direct push to making this class more relevant to post-grad school. Specifically, the vast majority of this class focused on the environmental sustainability movements of massive multi-national firms with billion dollar balance sheets. How does that help me in my career as a 27-28 year old coming out of school?",
    "It would be great to have more time for each topic.",
    "The change of the \"mandatory\" field trip date was a bit of a hassle... I think planning the field trip first for Halloween day, and then moving it to the Friday before Thanksgiving break was a little short-sited, though I am glad that I went on the trip and appreciated the speed and organization of the trip. Perhaps offering two trips (the one that required travel, but would have been more insightful would have been a great option for students), but making one mandatory would have provided more flexibility. I think having more reading responses would have contributed to great learning for me in the class. It was too easy to not do the readings when competing with other class assignments. I also did not like the process of trying to get into the class. It was left until the very last minute and was very stressful.",
    "The class discussions and the material in class can be a build on the readings instead of a general review. Students were already supposed to do the readings in advance.",
    "evt. a organizing a second fieldtrip",
    "The delivery of information in class time by engaging in more case study discussion. Rather than just introducing topics I suggest learning how to implement environmental strategies into corporate scenarios would be considerably more valuable to future practitioners (i.e. students).",
    "Although it was great to be presented with a broad array of CEMS techniques and systems, I don't feel like there was sufficient in-depth analysis done during lecture. The lectures often felt like a race to get through the powerpoint by the end of the class, rather than a lecture that was supplemented by the powerpoint slides. Additionally, the slides were skimmed through very quickly and were much too detailed to adequately read\/comprehend what they were saying. Discussions sometimes felt forced, and were not reinforced with commentary by the instructor. There were cases when students asked Dr. Chertow a question during a discussion, but she would hand it off to another student to add a comment, taking the conversation in an entirely different direction. On a separate note, a ten minute presentation to summarize the final project is a very awkward period of time.",
    "Ideally, grading of assignments would be done more quickly.",
    "So far I can't see any",
    "I thought the field trip was unnecessary. It was interesting, but mostly just filler. I didn't think it was necessary, given that it was out of class time and required many people to make special arrangements.",
    "Needs to be brought up to speed. Many, many readings were 15+ years old in a subject that evolves very quickly. Dialogue in classroom was superficial at best - there were students in the room with years of recent experience with environmental management in business from the corporate, government, and NGO side - many of whom never had a chance to be brought into the conversation.",
    "More in-depth assignments on business models would be great.",
    "need better content management in slides and teaching...just going through examples and concepts without clear emphasize on overarching point or concept is not easy to remember in the end. some of the comments from students are outright wrong\/controversial and should be clarified or discussed in forum. just gong through the motion of stating own opinion is not helpful. maybe instructor should tell students to be clearer and objectively agree\/disagree with other student's comments. the lecture slides need to uploaded at least 1 day in advance so that students can read up and focus more on discussion",
    "It's fine",
    "Making sure it overlaps less with the industrial ecology course.",
    "Class sessions sometimes seemed disorganized.",
    "The slides are helpful, but Marian covers so many topics in a day, and it can be difficult to keep up.",
    "The assignments. I felt that too much was busy work and there was no clear grading rubric. I don't mind getting 7.5 out of 10, but it wasn't clear why points were weighted in the manner they were. In the future, the assignments need much more refining before being given to students. Lastly, I didn't feel the TA's were consistent graders. I didn't find Marissa's comments or grading helpful, and would like to see Chertow take more of the commenting over to ensure high quality."

    "I hoped to learn more about bringing sustainable practices to businesses and what you need to do to be successful doing so.",

    "This class came across as a very broad overview. I wish that we had gone into some topics in greater depth, perhaps with a more substantial class discussion component.",
    "Yes. My takeaways are even greater than I thought they would be.",
    "No.",
    "No. Too basic. Too much of a focus on management, without context of strategy.",
    "No, too much theoretical and not enough hands on. I'm not going to be the CSO of Coca Cola anytime soon so don't think their struggles are anything like what I will see in real life for the next 15-20 years.",
    "YES!!!",
    "Yes, they match at a surprising level.",
    "Yes.",
    "Yes, although I expected more rigorous class material.",
    "yes, very much. Some topics were treated more superficially. However, the literature provided and discussion with classmates allowed to dive in deeper if there was a key area of interest.",
    "Yes.",
    "Overall, I was disappointed in the course.",
    "My expectations were exceeded. I learned a lot more than I had anticipated, not only through lectures and assignments but also through group projects.",
    "Yes, the knowledge and skills gained from that class met my expectations",
    "Mostly",
    "Yes",
    "Yes, actually the knowledge acquired exceeded my expectations. I did not expect the course to include case studies from Africa for instance",
    "No.",
    "Yes, it did.",
    "not really as i expected more developed case studies into strategies employed by copmpenies",
    "Yes",
    "Yes it did.",
    "I learned some new things but feel like I could have learned more in the time we had.",
    "Yes, absolutely. Interesting to gain exposure to the different vocabulary.",
    "yes",
    "Unfortunately, no. I would say I was given a cursory overview of some basic business theory, but little was done to support development of tangible skills."

   "question_text": "If yes, what were the advantages and disadvantages of the group work?",
   "comments": [
    "For the group projects where I could choose my group, I had a fantastic experience. For the midterm and final project, I found the experience frustrating and disappointing.",
    "Throughout the semester, I worked with different groups on the assignments and the final project. It certainly was both academically and personally enriching as I was able to work with many of my fellow students, all having different backgrounds and contributing different point of views and expertise to group discussions. Although coordinating a team of 4-5 students can be a challenging task, it was definitely worth to put effort in it.",
    "Learned effectively from the knowledge of others",
    "Advantages: Got to learn from different people in another school. Disadvantages: Coordinating was really difficult.",
    "There is not enough accountability. Two of the four members of my group were either incompetent, didn't care, or were out of the country. However, one member of my group was great so helped me explore my own interests and turn in a strong paper.",
    "I didn't really like the topic I was assigned, but that was fine... we made the most of it. I had difficulty working with ESL students (which was half of my group); I felt like more of a burden on editing fell towards me and they even acknowledged that. Perhaps splitting up the ESL students more would have alleviated that.",
    "Disadvantages of the group work are the fact that we had to work on a certain topic form a limited pool of choice and there was not a smooth cohesion between group members. In another situation, I wish I would have had the opportunity to work in a smaller group ( less than 4 people) on another chosen topic of my interest.",
    "The group work was a great experience and made the class richer. I learned to work in groups with different nationalities. I appreciated also that for every assignments the groups changed so we got to know the classmates very well.",
    "Advantage: working with many personalities. Disadvantage: not being forced to work through problems with personalities because you choose a different group every week.",
    "For most of the assignments, working in a group made completing the assignments much less of a burden. However, for the final project and even one of the smaller homework papers, working in a group with students who didn't speak English as their first language resulted in much more work for myself and the other English speakers. We often would have to nearly re write sections written by these students, which was certainly challenging.",
    "Generally my teammates in most assignments were great collaborators. That was not always the case.",
    "Working in group was very useful, as a way to enhance constructive discussion. I also practice my leadership, by learning to take the lead.",
    "Group projects depend on the group. I enjoyed most of my groups, especially my final project group. Other group assignments were miserable. I think having a balance of group or non-group assignments was valuable because it meant that we didn't ALWAYS have to work in groups.",
    "Advantages were to share knowledge and opinions, and to share the workload. Disadvantages were the sometimes disproportionate load that group members took on.",
    "The advantages or working in a group is that you get to discuss with your peers but I have to say there is lot of waste of time with discussions. Some times the group members have different understanding of the issues at hand and this can delay the work or impact negatively on the outcome.",
    "Advantages include project design - very flexible, well timed, great opportunity to work on something interesting. Disadvantage was two team members were complete free riders - the worst I've encountered in 3 semesters at Yale.",
    "The group work was very helpful because it was a great way to understand concepts collaboratively.",
    "the assignments are great for group work although time to present in front of class wasn't enough for well developed presentation.",
    "It's great for group work to have people's different ideas combined, making the project more comprehensive. However, it's always a problem in negotiating with time schedule and things like that that impedes efficiency",
    "Advantage - Learning Group Dynamics Disadvantage - One gets confused on realizing that the individual response to a section in a group assignment gets full marks (5\/5), but the grading of the responses of other group members could be as low as 1\/5 adversely affecting one's total score \/ grade",
    "The case assignments are too small to be worked on in groups and have a meaningful impact on your learning. We should each have to do our own complete case responses so we get everything we need to out of them. If you split up the work it takes too little time and you only get a snapshot of what you might have gotten working on it alone (like you would at SOM).",
    "Great to have more minds sleuthing through a project. Lack of some group members participation was tough. Would still prefer group over non group for the scale of the project.",
    "Some groups were highly productive\/effective, and others were less so. If we had more time to work on assignments together, our group dynamic was better overall."

   "comments": [
    "My advice is quite simple: There could be no more rewarding course than this one if you are interested in both industrial ecology and business strategies. TAKE THIS CLASS!",
    "An excellent introduction to a wide range of business considerations",
    "Consider SOM strategy courses.",
    "Make sure that you develop a final project that is truly of your own academic and professional interest because that is the avenue through which you will gain the most for the semester.",
    "Be prepared to a lot of work... But don't worry, it's totally worth it!",
    "1) make sure you realize that this class is really for people who want to work within or consult for a business that is looking towards reducing their environmental footprint",
    "This is a good foundation course for anyone interested in corporate sustainability. Goes into depth in different model and techniques that help businesses be more sustainable.",
    "Definitely read the lectures provided and although the class demands a lot of work, it is worth it.",
    "This course should be titled 'An Overview of Corporate Sustainability with a focus on Environmental Management'",
    "Be very strategic in choosing assignments and work partners. Make sure to set group expectations early and stay on top of the final project because it is not referenced often in class and there is not much guidance given.",
    "I recommend this class. The advice is that it is a very fast pace class, with a load of reading higher than average. so be ready to pace yourself.",
    "Do the readings ahead and attend the course.",
    "Think about possible final projects early enough.",
    "Read the required readings for each lecture, that would be helpful",
    "Be careful in group selection. Work as if you are individually working on the assignment.",
    "Weigh up whether you really want\/need to take this course compared with the Industrial Ecology course. This one is probably a little less intense and heavy on details than that one so it might give you a good idea whether or not you are interested in learning more about I.E.",
    "Keep up with the readings as best you can, and ask for grading rubrics before handing in each assignment.",
    "Good overview of many approaches to business sustainability and environmental management\/strategy. Would definitely recommend this course."
