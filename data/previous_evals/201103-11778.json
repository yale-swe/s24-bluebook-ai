   "comments": [
    "Do not take if you just want to keep up with your French of if you are planning on credit\/d\/f-ing it. Too much work.",
    "A lot of work. Credit D it if you don't need the language requirement.",
    "French 150 is a great class that truly helps you improve your written and spoken French. It is a demanding class with a good amount of work, but the workload is manageable if you go into the class knowing that you will have to spend a lot of time doing homework for each class. It also provides a nice review of grammar. Take it if you enjoy French and would like to improve and\/or keep up the language.",
    "The next level up from L4, more of the same stuff except less grammar and more interesting texts\/movies.",
    "Standard language class, good mix of readings and movies to continue learning French. I wish more grammar had been taught in-class though, given its weight on the tests.",
    "Depending on your aptitude, the grammar can feel a bit tedious, but if you're looking to get rid of your language requirement quick via one L5 course, this is probably it. The readings\/movies are for the most part interesting and it's worth putting up with the grammar drilling exercises. The four tests and four essays (2-3 pages each) can wear you down, though. Charney is great and from what I've heard one of the easier 150 teachers. I couldn't have asked for a better way to end my French studies.",
    "This class is a LOT of work, but it will do wonders for your French reading, writing, listening, and speaking skills, if you take advantage of it properly. Also, if you don't take it with Diane Charney, you're doing yourself an injustice. This woman is both a stellar, engaging professor, and the sweetest, most caring woman I know. Overall, a wonderful class all-around!",
    "It's a great survey of literature, review of grammar, and a way to further your oral skills. I would definitely recommend it."
