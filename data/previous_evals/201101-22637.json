    "PLEASE TAKE THIS CLASS. have you ever wanted to take the best class at Yale? Have you ever wanted to be taught by the best professors at Yale? Have you ever wanted to become smarter, learn more, be more engaged, and become more passionate about a topic than you have ever before? if you answered yes to any of those questions, then take this class. THE BEST CLASS AT YALE.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS. Completely worth the excessive reading and the big project at the end. I have learned so much in this class, and more importantly I have been inspired. It's basically a (Comprehensive) whirlwind overview of the main facets of international human rights law, the issues facing it today, and its practical implementations. Great class.",
    "A good intro course into the foundations of international human rights. After taking the course I thoroughly enjoyed it but would hesitate to recommend to another student because of the lack of continuity in grading (grades are best on class participation, one paper and an 8 hr take home final). Also the guest lecturers were hit or miss and the material they covered was never further revised by either Hope or Ally. Even between Hope and Ally themselves, Hope's lectures were often far more engaging. Someone with an already strong interest in the course material would benefit from the class, but those taking it on a whim are sure to become frustrated\/disillusioned.",
    "This course is an overview of many different human rights topics that incorporates case studies from many different regions and times. You learn about theory\/philosophy, law, and practical reality. Students lead the class for about ten minutes in each session, the rest is a mix of lecture and group discussion. It's a really interesting course and I would definitely recommend it for anyone who thinks they are interested in human rights.",
    "I thought that this class was just fair. While the professors have a great deal of clout as faculty members of the Yale Law School, I felt that they oftentimes treated us more like children, rather than college students, and the reading was onerous. The material covered during the class lacked substance and was not very engaging.",
    "A solid foundational course for anyone interested in international affairs and\/or law. There's a bit too much reading and you can't get by without doing at least some of it for each class, but that makes for better discussions. Hope especially is not only well known in her field but also a great professor-- it might be even better if it was just her teaching it. (While Allyson is clearly very intelligent, she's a bit disorganized.) The memo you write during the semester, meanwhile, is a great experience and leaves you with a sound understanding in at least one human rights topic of your interest.",
    "Great class with a lot of reading. Keep in mind that most of the concrete work comes towards the end of the semester though (final paper and exam). Profs Metcalf and McKinney are both solid lecturers but their attempts to involve the class (and to spark class discussion) tended to be unproductive. All in all, a fantastic introduction to human rights law.",
    "Great course, lots of material covered. Great professors. The material is really interesting, but the reading is overwhelming (more than should be required). Very recommended, especially if you are interested in human rights law.",
    "I would most definitely recommend it if you are interested in human rights work in any way. You don't have to want to be a lawyer to be in this class even though it is very law based. Still good stuff to know though. You can do almost anything with human rights- journalism, photography, politician, filmmaker, etc.",
    "IHR is a class that will show you exactly what human rights is in the world today through different viewpoints and avenues such as law, NGO work, and everyday lawyer tasks.",
    "BEST CLASS EVER!!!! TAKE IT TAKE IT!!! Absolutely necessary. It completely changed my mindset about human rights, law and the problems of the world and how to solve them. I loved it. I acquired the ability to analyze situations in a much clearer way and I learned a LOT about the world and human rights, and believe me, there are SO MANY things to be studied within human rights. It is a challenging class, and that just makes it better. TAKE IT!",
    "Take this class if you want a solid look at the framework of international law. However, note that there is a LOT of reading.",
    "The readings for this class are lengthy. If you're willing to do the readings, you'll learn lots of things in this course and you'll love the class discussions. However if you don't do the readings or if you only plan to take quick look at some of them, you'll be bored to death during class. So my recommendation would be, take the course only if you think you'll allocate enough time to do the readings.",
    "A lot of it is what you make. If you do all of your reading, skimming some of it and taking good notes; if you are prepared for class and discussion, this class can be really useful for learning the basics and understanding situations that are happening now. But what makes the class is the accessibility and the law experience and wealth of knowledge of the professors\/teaching fellow: so take advantage of it!",
    "International Human Rights is an excellent class but requires an enormous amount of reading. The class will raise interesting questions and expose a lot about the workings of international politics and law, which may or may not end up being interesting to you (you can't know until you try it). I would encourage people to shop the class but consider very seriously whether they have enough time in their schedule to read a few hundred pages per class. It's ultimately a very good class that you will gain a lot from but should not take lightly."
