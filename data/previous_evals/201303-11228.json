   "comments": [
    "It's a well-organized and thought-provoking class. I would recommend the class to another student. But one thing to remind the student is that the professor is very strict on grading. (It's recommended by previous students to take it c\/d\/fail...but don't be concerned about grades if you are taking DS...)Don't expect an easy A (or to be honest, any \"good\" grade) from him... Also you will have to spend more time than you expect on the reading if you want to contribute well to the section. But the class is really good. The professor leads the class very well. You will rarely feel distracted or bored during the section.",
    "I would recommend Directed Studies to other students. I believe that reading literature from the past enables us to understand how the ideas and literature of our own time. When else in your life will you have the luxury of devoting the bulk of your time to study of the classics? The negative side of DS can best be described by a metaphor: I love chocolate cake, but I don't love eating 10 of them at once. Sometimes, the amount of reading assigned is so great that it's hard to enjoy it. Nevertheless, I think it's really worthwhile to take DS and get a strong foundation before continuing your studies at Yale. Being in tiny seminars with a bunch of students who chose and want to be there is amazing.The literature course in particular is not too great of a jump from high school in that it's focused on a type of literary analysis most Yalies have done before coming here. Expectations are, however, higher, of course. The content of the course is a good mix: epics, tragedy, biblical works, poetry, etc.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class and section. DS in general: its a lot of work, but the content is fantastic, the professors and classmates really outstanding, and the papers really aren't that bad. You will learn so much and feel so fulfilled after taking it. Professor Billings is so smart and has tons of insight, both into the texts and into being a good critical writer. Don't let his knowledge intimidate you; he has high standards, but he'll help you be able to meet them, and try to take advantage of your time with him because he really knows so much.",
    "It is completely worth the effort. If you do all of the reading and budget appropriate time for the essays, this class will empower you as a reader, writer, and thinker.",
    "Take DS Lit with Professor Billings. Obviously the texts are incredibly interesting and relevant, but having a brilliant teacher makes all of the difference. Professor Billings always got essays back promptly and his comments proved that he had really read our papers closely. Be prepared to work very hard on papers and read the texts very carefully. Even though he's an extremely impressive scholar, Professsor Billings makes sure to set aside hours of his time to meet with every student individually about papers. This is the best class I've taken at Yale and I looked forward to every meeting.",
    "I would recommend DS to another student if he\/she was up for the challenge that comes with it. It is a lot of reading and a lot of thinking to go along with it. This course was one of the first that made me feel the weakness of my close reading, analyzing, and writing abilities. If a student can put up with the slight pressure (it's not too much-- don't get me wrong), I would definitely recommend this course for a student interested in strengthening his\/her reading\/writing abilities.",
    "If you are considering Directed Studies, you must switch into Professor Billings' section. I will say, hands down, that Billings is one of the best, if not the best, teachers I have had in my life. He has such a great command of the texts (the connections he makes are incredible), and his pedagogical method is incredibly effective. Section meetings are very thorough, and Professor Billings is not afraid to question your interpretations if they are unfounded in the text. Additionally, he knows how to run a section--he steers the class away from gratuitous tangents and ensures that we are heading in the right direction. More importantly, Professor Billings is profoundly dedicated to his students. He meets with every student before each paper to discuss your outline, interpretation, etc. and he will help lead you on the right track without derailing your original interpretation. But the best part is, his comments on papers are tremendously helpful! He is blunt, so he won't beat around the bush, in telling you where your paper went wrong. But unlike so many other professors, Billings will tell you specifically how to improve. He gives thorough handwritten comments that instruct how your writing is good but can be improved. The amount of progress I made this semester in writing is quite mind-blowing. I will be honest...you need to work hard in this section, and you should certainly not save your paper for Thursday night...but Professor Billings is quite understanding of DS' rigor. Make sure to go to Office Hours to get the full bang for your buck--he is very welcoming and is more than happy to have an in-depth discussion of any of the texts. Again, you must take Billings' class if you plan on doing DS Lit! This Professor is going places, and you do not want to miss out on his class.",
    "A comprehensive survey of major Western literature from Homer's Iliad to Dante's Divine Comedy. I would definitely recommend this course to another student because it is essential to know these works.",
    "Yes, I think this is a program everyone should take in college, especially those not going into the humanities. It is good to branch out and to learn a lot about something so useful, despite its current position in discussion of relevance at colleges.",
    "This is a rigorous, heavily discussion-based class that is both engaging and challenging. Be prepared to read a lot and think a lot. You will be expected to articulate your thoughts and opinions from day one - this seems to be a skill the student must naturally develop over time. I would recommend this course to another student, because it actively engages the students and ultimately challenges them to develop their own perspective on some of the \"great\" classical works of the West.",
    "I wouldn't, it's too much reading, it's boring, and you miss out on better courses. It was the best part of DS though."
