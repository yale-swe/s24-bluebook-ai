    "Yes, the course seems to change a lot year to year but the topics will probably be very interesting and Bloom makes sure discussion is usually great. He is a very opinionated teacher who isn't scared to give his opinion which I think makes the seminar more lively. Not a lot of work either compared to some classes, though he seemed to think that it was.",
