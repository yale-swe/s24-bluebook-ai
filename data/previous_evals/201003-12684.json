   "comments": [
    "I would absolutely recommend this seminar, or any other that Professor Rogers teaches. The seminar, especially at the beginning and end, discusses oil in really interesting ways, and presents issues I would never previously have considered.",
    "This is one of the best courses I've ever had at Yale. %50 for the content, which is super interesting, and %50 for the fact that it is rare to find a really, really good seminar here. Prof. Douglas is the man. He expects a lot from you, but will take you on a magical journey of learning. Take it if you want an inside view of the worlds most controversial necessity: oil.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to anyone who is interesting in learning more about the relationship between power and oil. There wasn't as much of a focus on culture but it was still a great class.",
    "A great class. An incredibly expert and personable lecturer, Prof. Rogers; good reading list of books and articles on oil; great conversations in our seminar, directed only sometimes by Prof. Rogers, but mostly carried on by the strength of student interest.Lots of reading and writing, though--the class is not for slackers, like most seminars. A book a week to read, and a midterm paper (10 pages) and a final paper (16 pages).",
    "This course was one of the best that I have taken at Yale. It takes a substance that is so ubiquitous to our world and uses it to shine light on global power structures. It was an interesting and new way of looking at the anthropology of political science.",
    "yes, one of my best courses at yale. reading load is acceptable. only one short midterm paper (8 pages) and one final paper (16-18 pages).",
    "I would definitely recommend the class to another student.",
    "This class looks at how the presence of Oil in many countries can directly impact social and cultural development. It goes beyond the basic econ\/political side to how pervasive oil is in everyday life in modern petrostates. Very eye opening on our present day natural resource dilemma.",
    "Differentiated from other classes on natural resource and energy exploitation, this course focuses on developing a series of analytical tools that allow the student to escape the \"promise for the future\" or the \"devil's excrement\" perceptions of oil discovery and exploitation. Professor Rogers knows the field well, and helps students to navigate discussion effectively.The feeling of community in the class and the structure of assignments make it a rare example of a course that is both fun to take and forces you to learn.",
    "YES! Take this course if you can get in - it is such a wonderful learning experience, Professor Rogers facilitates conversation flawlessly and you will leave the class with a completely different perspective of the world we live in then the one you wanted in the room with.",
    "Take this class. Best seminar I have taken at Yale. Everyone was so engaged. Discussions were entertaining and fruitful.",
    "Yes. The course material is very interesting, and Professor Rogers is awesome. There's a pretty decent amount of reading, but it never seemed overwhelming. Overall an excellent course.",
    "The name says it all. The course is successful in conveying the interaction between oil, culture, and power. Subtopics include country development, authenticity\/manufacturing of culture, economic balances, environment, societal barriers and stratification, etc. Professor Rogers is eager to teach and to work with students. Very timely course.",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone regardless of their major. It was so helpful having students from different majors in the seminar for a class that looks at oil from a number of different angles. I enjoyed discussion in class every week and it's amazing how a natural resource can have such an impact on various aspects of life.",
    "This is a really great anthropology seminar that would be relevant for students in a wide variety of majors, including political science. It had the perfect combination of interesting readings and a professor who was good at guiding discussions. The work load was average for a seminar--one midterm paper (6-8 pgs), one final paper (approx. 16 pgs) but no weekly reading responses. I would definitely recommend taking this class or any other class with this professor.",
    "Very interesting. The class focuses more on politics and economics through an anthropological lens rather than on \"culture\" in the traditional sense. It's a very interesting subject, and you walk away with a much greater understanding of how oil affects national economies and productions of culture. Excellent class for a poli sci or econ major looking for an anthropological perspective."
