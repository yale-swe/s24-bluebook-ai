    "This is a great class. The teachers are enthusiastic and amazing. Chinese is one of the coolest languages out there. I would encourage anyone to take this class, but you should be prepared to put the work into it.",
    "It's a lot of work, and always an uphill battle, there's no break from Chinese. However, you do learn a lot, and although the class may seem repetitive, you do learn quite a lot of Chinese. The teachers are all great, and they try really hard for their students. Wang Laoshi is the best but all of them are phenomenal, and they all are very dedicated that you feel the same to reciprocate. The daily quizzes are a pain and there seems to be a test all the time, but it's a very fair course. If you are motivated to take Chinese either for a future career or for a personal interest, definitely take it at Yale.",
    "If you have any interest in the Chinese language, you must take this course. It takes a lot of work and dedication to complete the homework and memorize the vocabulary and characters. However, it is well worth it in the long run. At the end of the semester, you look back and realize how much you actually learned."
