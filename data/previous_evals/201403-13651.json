   "question_text": "Looking back on this course, what is your overall assessment of the course:  What are its strengths and weaknesses, and in what ways might it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths -interesting and broad topic -multiple speakers -not just learning, a lot of discussion and a great course to improve on reading papers Weaknesses -questions about the papers not always answered -maybe having the speaker stay for the discussion part would help",
    "A broad but certainly informative class; one of the best Yale has to offer; constructive venture facilitated by the school of Forestry but very much relevant to persons interested in the public health aspect of the environment. Strength: Instructor, Teaching Fellow, Topics, Guest Lecturers, Breadth of material, the usefulness\/applicability of assignments Weakness: Non-central location (minor); singular weekly meeting lasts almost 3 hours (on occasion; minor) Recommendation: Some slightly quantitative aspect to complement critiques and group presentations.",
    "This is an excellent course for anyone interested in learning about how the environment can influences human health. Dr. Bell brings in guest speakers for the first half of the class, and the second half is a class discussion led by a different group every week, which helps break up the class, given that is 3 hours. There is a fair amount of work involved, but it was never overwhelming, although the final exam was very long and somewhat tedious.",
    "S: variety= speakers, student presentations, article summaries, papers, etc; also, i loved her thorough and well-organized slides W: nothing really"

    "Instructor: Michelle Bell \u00a0Strengths: -close to students and easy to talk to -good speaker -full of energy and very motivating Weaknesses: -maybe too much focused on air pollution in her examples",
    "Instructor: Michelle Bell \u00a0Very knowledgeable, intelligent, capable and encouraging. Willing to engage, support and challenge. More focused on educating than assessing which allows for students to address mistakes without being too concerned about harsh evaluation or heavy judgement. Clearly excited about the material and interested in participation of the students as to maximize the takeaway",
    "Instructor: Michelle Bell \u00a0Dr. Bell is a fantastic lecturer and is extremely knowledgeable about the field of environmental health, specifically about air pollution. She is also very approachable.",

   "comments": [
    "Very accessible course for those with no previous knowledge on environmental health. Good introductory course for those who are interested in the link between public health and the environment.",
    "A broad but certainly informative class; one of the best Yale has to offer re the environment and human health; constructive venture facilitated by the school of Forestry but very much relevant to persons interested in the public health aspect of the environment. With an invested and knowledgeable instructor, the dynamic\/pacing and requirements of the class were not only manageable but constructive and consistent in design. Highly recommended as aforementioned.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to anyone who is interested in an introduction to environmental health.",
    "yes because it is a good survey of environmental health issues, and you get to really delve into the literature"
