   "comments": [
    "This is a good and interesting class, but know that both professors consistently go 10-20 minutes beyond the actual class time. If that doesn't bother you, then take the course! It's also a lot of reading.",
    "Yes. If you want to take a history course that doesn't involve memorizing long timelines and statistics, this is the course for you. You get to learn about how history and culture (film, music, science, etc) are interwoven in Russia, and you get to learn from two professors who are experts in their fields. Although there isn't much regular work, this is most definitely not a gut class. In order to get as much out of this class as you can, you really have to keep up with the readings, which may be up to 150 pages a week. But reading all the primary sources will give you another perspective on the topic you're learning about, and you won't regret it.",
    "I would highly recommend this class. A light workload, excellent readings, and interesting lectures. This is a history class for the history major who wants a chance to dip into the humanities and learn a great deal about Russian lit and culture.",
    "Absolutely. This is an interesting course with interesting material. The lectures are never boring, and the course flies through hundreds of years of history fast enough to cover it all and thoroughly enough so that students have a solid understanding of the culture and history by the end of it.",
    "An excellent course. Every lecture is filled with interesting information about a fascinating subject. Both professors are excellent. A lot of reading assigned for a majority of weeks. One will learn an incredible amount and come away with a new appreciation and command for the Russian History and Culture.",
    "Great class - hard to get through all the readings, but Professors Bushkovitch and McKay are enough reason to take it.",
    "Russ 241 was an OK class. It was a bit overwhelming and there was a lot of information presented to us for an introductory class. Some of the lectures were dull or difficult to follow. Take the class if you have to for the Russian major.",
    "I would recommend this course. It is, of course, a survey, but one that I enjoyed and that taught me a great deal. I have few reservations about recommending it, I think. Interesting and varied material, excellent instructors, a substantial amount of reading but little other work. Forgiving of some skimming and so forth when the reading load is too heavy certain weeks, I think."
