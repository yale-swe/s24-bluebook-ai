    "This class is interesting, but poorly led and philosophical. It eventually became a burden in my schedule, but I'm not sure everyone felt or would feel that way.",
    "I would highly recommend the class.",
    "I would. I think it gave a great overview of the research done in social cognition, which links to many student's own research well.",
    "I would definitely recommend it. Summary would be a discussion of the various cognitive processes that effect our engagement with and assessment of various social interactions and situations and our resulting behavior. Has profound implications for more philosophical and theological questions about the development of beliefs and the formation of community structures, which ties in more closely to my own research interests, and for that reason was a particularly fascinating course."

    "I have a better understanding of the type of questions and arguments proposed in social psychology research, but it has limited application to my own work.",
    "I'm not sure just yet how this course will influence my work, but I think I learned a great deal and it was a very positive experience.",
    "I think that this course both familiarized me with a new field, and introduced me to research methodology that I am glad to know more about. I don't know how directly it will affect my own research, but I am certain that some of the topics we covered will come up again over the course of my career.",
    "Helped to provide insight into the cognitive\/psychological\/physiological\/biological components of belief formation and the development of groups or communities, which are of particular concern to my own areas of research."
