   "comments": [
    "ENGL 245 is a pretty standard fiction workshop, which I know was perfect for me. We workshopped two stories, handed in a revision of one, and did writing exercises and discussed works of fiction. I would definitely recommend it, even to people who haven't written that much before, just because writing fiction is that beautiful.",
    "If you love writing and want to explore it further, take this class! The workload is surprisingly light, and the assignments are fun. I ended up using the homework assignments and readings as a break from my more stressful homework. If you can, you should also consider taking it CreditD so that you feel comfortable experimenting and trying new things.",
    "A course like this is a great opportunity to write. Professor Hopkins is great at providing assignments that are open enough to encourage writing in almost any genre or style but restrictive enough to provide a creative challenge. Moreover, he balances rigor (on the syllabus) with generosity (in class and office hours) in a remarkable and useful way. He can wander off on tangents now and again, but the discussions he leads are (usually) lively enough to bear them. Take it if you're eager to write (better) and willing to indulge in occasionally meandering sections.",
    "Yes its a change of pace from most Yale courses and is pretty enjoyable, without too much work",
    "Absolutely take this class if you get in. Best course I've ever taken. I mean, come on, it's reading and writing short stories with a professor who cares about you and peers who love creative writing as much as you do.",
    "This class depends so much on the teacher!! If it's Hopkins mayyyybe take it as a fun fifth class you're using as a step to get somewhere else (a different creative writing class) but don't take it for its own sake. Not worth it."
