    "TAKE THIS COURSE IF YOU ARE PREPARED TO TAKE A DEEPER, MORE CRITICAL LOOK AT YOURSELF, YOUR BACKGROUND, AND YOUR FUTURE.",
    "YESSSS!!!!!! If you are lucky enough to get in, you have to take it. Howard and David are the nicest people on the planet and they have such a great rapport. It was nice to hear Howard's \"war stories\" and get the inside scoop on what is going on in politics. But the best part of the class was that it changed the way I think about myself, my friendships, and my life in general. The class is much more about reflection and self-evaluation than politics, which I liked. Not that much work -- a midterm and a final paper that don't take too long to write.",
    "Yes, yes yes. Transformed my thinking, and made me reflect on myself in a way that I never had inside or outside a class.",
    "The only humanities course at Yale where you actually learn something about the world. If you can get in you'd be a fool to turn it down.",
    "Absolutely. This will be your best seminar if you take it. It sounds like BS, but honestly you learn a lot about yourself and your fellow classmates. There should be more classes at Yale like this.",
    "This is the best course I have taken at Yale. It will change the way you think about everything, especially yourself and your relationships with others. You will reveal a lot about yourself, and will have to trust in others, so be ready for that going in. Not a single complaint. A must.",
    "Yes, absolutely! One of the best classes I've taken at Yale, and it's absolutely nothing like any other class I've ever taken here. If you want a class on Howard Dean's war stories, don't sign up. Instead, this class is more a thought-provoking journey of self-reflection and learning about how people think, with politics as a unifying theme. I know that sounds corny, but this is the kind of discussions college is about. This will be the best two hours of your week: every class is a lot of funny and you'll see the world in new ways. They do a great job selecting students, and it's also one of the best mixes of people I've had at Yale.Don't assume that just because Howard Dean's famous he's not a wonderful, caring, skilled professor. Take class this because it's one of the best run seminars you'll ever take at Yale, and because Howard and David are an extraordinary teaching team. They make a meaningful effort to bond the class and to get to know each person individually.The only thing you should know is that there are two self-reflection papers in the semester. I enjoyed writing them, but as someone used to writing analytical\/research papers, looking within was a little bit harder.",
    "TAKE IT. TAKE IT TAKE IT. If you want to think and not just learn facts that you will later forget, take this course. If you want to discuss how politicians work or what makes them want to do this job, take this course. Do not take this course if you want to discuss political hot button topics - you won't be doing that. This is a course about looking at politics, politicians, and then yourself, with the emphasis being on yourself and how you like or do not like some of what will be required of you as a politician. It gives you a more nuanced view into politicians and into journalists. It is a wonderful, wonderful, thought-provoking class.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS!If you're ready to look deep into what motivates you into action, political or social, and process and reflect on memories and experiences that shaped and formed who you are, definitely take this class.this is the best class I ever had, no joke.Howard and David are amazing, and the combination of them together is hysterical (they both went to Yale together).",
    "More of a psychology class than a political class.Interviews were very fun to do, and discussion would often get deeply personal.Though Gov. Dean and Prof. Berg would discuss political stories in the course of interviews, the class was focused much more on the personal than the political.",
    "ABSOLUTELY.",
    "YES! I would absolutely recommend it! I have never felt so uncomfortable and comfortable in my life with a group of 20 people.",
    "This course is very different from other seminars at Yale. It is fun, personal, exploratory, and cerebral. It is taught by two brilliant friends who have known each other for decades, which makes for great teamwork on their part and hilarity all round.I think the course does a wonderful job of using the weekly meeting time to take advantage of the people present. Many of the sessions were based on exercises that integrated the individuals in order to help everyone learn better. It was always partly hands-on (activities) and partly cerebral (in depth discussions). The students got to experience first-hand many aspects of the syllabus concepts and then share with each other and the professors to aid everybody's learning further. The professors handled discussion well. They always explained the purpose of exercises (eventually), made sure everyone had a chance to talk, and challenged us to explain ourselves better or revisit aspects of our thinking that seemed faulty or incomplete.We covered concepts like the role of media, money, and emotion in politics. But you really learn just as much about yourself as you do about politics. That's because the course is equally concerned with discovering the psychology of any person in the political system, whether it be a voter or a presidential candidate. I would highly recommend applying to the seminar.",
    "Definitely take this course.",
    "An absolutely wonderful class! Definitely take it if you can. This course is very different from anything else I have seen at yale. I got to know a wonderful group of people pretty well as we worked together to explore how our world works and what we all want out of our lives. The class is not really about politics or politicians--rather, the political world is sort of used as a lens for our self-discovery. Also, for anyone interested in journalism, there is a heavy focus on interviews. David Berg and Howard Dean were both fantastic!"
