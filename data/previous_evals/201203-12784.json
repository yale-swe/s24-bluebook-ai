   "comments": [
    "This is an unusual class, so I don't think I would necessarily recommend it if you are only interested in reading and thinking about a lot of Faust works-- you have to be on board with the format and specific selections of the course. Be aware that assessment is mostly based on speeches and discussion-- it's a good opportunity to work on your speaking consciously, but very different from a class with longer papers.",
    "\"Faust\" is an engaging course that takes a truly unique approach to learning at Yale. The course is almost exclusively oral-based, with most assignments coming in the form of speeches, discussion leading, and discussion in general. It also delves deeply into one particular myth, examining its various manifestations from the fifteenth century on (along with some discussion of earlier historical roots and similar myths). Professor Hagens puts a lot of time and effort into his students and class. Since the focus is on discussion, a lot will depend on your classmates, but I can say that I'm very glad to have taken \"Faust.\"",
    "Faust is an extremely unique course, with a heavy emphasis on oral participation. It made me a more self-aware seminar participant and honed my speaking skills. It also made me very conscious of how difficult teaching is. You will come out with a very clear understanding of the Faustian situation and how it's developed over time, as well as a (less clear) understanding of the historical and philosophical trends that triggered the changes in the legend throughout time. The course feels a little redundant at the end, as if it could have been accomplished in less time (maybe ended a couple weeks earlier), but I would still recommend it. It's not very much work, and you get to read a lot of great literature.",
    "The only class of its kind at Yale. If you do the work and enjoy sharing and defending your ideas in class, you will do well.",
    "Take it! The reading can be hefty, but the speeches and discussion leading are actually a lot of fun and the exams are very low-stress.",
    "The quality of the class depends a lot on the competence of the student body since the class is a \"discussion class\", Prof Hagens does little lecturing. Great texts."
