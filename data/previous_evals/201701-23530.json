    "Instructor: Timothy Michael Terway \u00a0Tim was a great asset to the course, but was also really busy with his dissertation and post-PHD plans. When he was present and focused he was amazing, but it was evident to the class that his head was elsewhere much of the semester. That said, I very much appreciated his contributions when he was engaged.",
    "Instructor: Timothy Michael Terway \u00a0I think Tim is very helpful in class discussion and contents.",
    "Instructor: Timothy Michael Terway \u00a0This course had the feeling of a course team-taught by two professors rather than one with a professor and a TA taking a backseat. Tim is phenomenal; no improvements necessary.",
    "Instructor: Timothy Michael Terway \u00a0He brought things back down to our level and was very friendly, approachable and accessible.",
    "Instructor: Timothy Michael Terway \u00a0Tim really carried this class. Susan is a great professor, but she can be pretty hard to follow sometimes. Tim was organized and really helped breakdown the more complicated aspects of the course for us. Without Tim to guide the class, I'm not sure I would have gotten much out of it! Thanks Tim! Towards the end of the class, Tim and Susan became a little less accessible and clear in their expectations. Tim was finishing his dissertation, which I know is a huge responsibility, but it did make for a few frustrating moments as we tried to finish our projects."

    "This class has a huge amount of potential but the class, the assignments, and the lectures need to be more structured to provide a more rigorous pathway to learning and mastering the material.",
    "yes",
    "I learned almost nothing from this course. I was very confused the entire semester and did not ever understand the direction in which it was going. I have no idea what Susan was saying half the time and never nothing was ever linked to anything else. The readings could have been helpful but they were so dense and theoretical that I did not understand them. If we would have discussed the readings in class and gone over what we were supposed to take from them, then maybe I would have understood more but the instructors just spoke to us as if we were now experts on the readings they assigned and never explained them so I was just lost the entire semester.",
    "On Susan and Tim: Susan and Tim were a good teaching team. It's obvious Susan has done a lot of pioneering work in her field, but sometimes her theories were so complicated that having Tim there was really the difference between comprehension and having no idea what was going on. On the field trip: The Jackson, Wyoming field trip over spring break was the most valuable part of the course for me. I had a fantastic time meeting a bunch of different people from organizations I'm interested in, as well as exploring a part of the country I really like. It was a good bonding opportunity with my classmates as well. The field trip allowed us to put some of what we learned into practice, which was immensely helpful. On the course: I have such mixed feelings about this course. I wanted to love it, because I'm very interested in large-scale conservation. There are parts I did enjoy - my classmates, the field trip, my group project group. I also did learn some interesting things. However, the class was also pretty challenging - see my responses below for more details."

I am confident I will use this approach in future, and that my thinking will be better for this class. The group project component was also great. I appreciated the opportunity to dig deeply into an area of interest with my peers, and learned from all of the groups' presentations at the end of the semester.",
    "The field trip to the Jackson Hole",
    "This course challenged the way that I view conservation work. While it's at times really confusing - I'm pretty sure every student had no idea what was going on for at least a few weeks of the course - this course provides a framework for looking at large-scale problems (conservation or otherwise) that I think will be very beneficial to me moving forward.",

   "comments": [
    "The structure.",
    "Outlining of expectations and deliverables timeline from from the beginning. Sometimes it felt like assignments were dumped on us with very little notice and that was hard to accommodate due to other grad school meetings\/assignments.",
    "While the content was fantastic and transformative, the actual management of the class left much to be desired. Much of the semester felt scattered, and some of the individual classes lacked coherence\/were repetitive of other classes. We were supposed to receive a weekly email about what the next week would hold since there was no syllabus, but this only materialized some weeks. Other logistical things also just failed to happen in a timely manner. While all of this was relatively frustrating during the semester, I increasingly see the big-picture benefits of the course now that I no longer have to deal with the logistical difficulties.",
    "The reflections of the assignments",
    "Sometimes Susan's explanations are too meta to follow.",
    "Making sure that we review the readings since they are basically what they are trying to teach us. Also, making sure to connect what they talk about to other things and tell us where they are going ahead of time. I just did not understand the point of anything... or how it was relevant or connected to other things. The whole course was too abstract and theoretical.",
    "I didn't take Susan's foundations course in the fall, where she explains in much more detail her work on the Policy Process (the foundation for this course and all her courses). As a result, I was lost for much of the semester, trying to make sense of what she was taking about. I expected the course to be about large-scale conservation efforts, and while there was that aspect to it, it was much more about how to reframe problems and goals to more effectively come up with solutions. That is a great skillset to have - but the course was taught in such a way that it could be extremely hard to follow at times. I wasn't sure what I was supposed to be learning. Susan and Tim warned us in the beginning that we would feel this way and that things would come together in the end, but it didn't make it easier."
