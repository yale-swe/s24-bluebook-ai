   "comments": [
    "A political theory-rich course that alludes to perhaps the central question of the modern age: What is the purpose of our freedom? Great syllabus, good overall structure, and a very intelligent, helpful professor. Recommended as a thought-provoking, deeply introspective look into modern liberalism and its antecedents.",
    "If the reading list appeals to you or you want to build your understanding of the history of political philosophy, you should take the class. Everything else is great.",
    "This is a seminar in intellectual history that has a great syllabus and involved a lot of close reading and examination of arguments. Discussions and writings for the class were fun, and Professor Garsten was fantastic!",
    "Yes, although you should have some background in the subject area. Would be an hard course for those just starting out.",
    "Modern Liberty is a very good seminar. The central question that the course explores \"What are the positive benefits of Modern Liberty?\", meaning what are the benefits other than freedom from something is an important question for modern life. The course was also surprisingly centered around political economy, which I found to be interesting. I took it as a former DSer and thought the syllabus filled holes in my political theory foundation. Would recommend."
