    "This is a great way to get credit for lab work (particularly if you don't want to get paid). I ended up spending about 15 hours in lab each week, but that's only because my lab was awesome, not because of Research for Credit requirements.",
    "Great way to get involved in research. Do it! Do it now!",
    "Definitely choose to do research if you love to do so! Be prepared to work way, way more than 10 hours though, but if you love it, even that time is fun!",
    "Yes, if you want to do research. The time commitment isn't too bad and the logistical requirements are pretty minimal.",
    "Its research for credit. Depends on what you are doing and what lad you are in. But overall a very good opportunity to engage in research at Yale. There is a proposal, a 10-15 min presentation, and 15 page term paper.",
    "Absolutely. If you want to do research, you should definitely do it for credit.",
    "Research for credit is a great option to receive course credit, especially if you're already involved in a lab at Yale. Also, it can probably get you out of the MB&B 360L Biochem Lab requirement for the BS degree, which is another plus. The final paper is pretty easy to take care of too as long as you have a general idea of what you've been doing. Term-time research is a lot of work though. People say you should treat it as an additional class (which you do, with the 1.0 credit) but I think it's more work than any class. Drawbacks are that 10-12 hours never actually means 10-12, and can sometimes be 15-20, which is inconvenient when it's midterm\/finals time (cells don't wait for midterms to end). Also, it's probably tough to start research in a new lab that you'venever worked in, because you probably won't get much done in the 150-200 hours during the semester.",
    "Yes, I would recommend doing research for credit. It is a great way to perform independent research and then practice presenting in front of your lab and organizing your results into conclusions.",
    "It's research for credit -- you get out what you put into it.",
    "Research for Credit was a great experience for me, but it totally depends on what lab you work in... some of my friends had similar experiences, while others did not enjoy their labs at all. Bottom line: if you already work in a lab you like, or if you find a lab you feel really good about, it's an awesome class.",
    "Great"
