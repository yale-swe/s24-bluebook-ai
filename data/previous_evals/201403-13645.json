    "The progression of readings was clear thematically, but sometimes we didn't actually discuss all of the material we read for class.",
    "This course covers both melodrama and its antecendents as a period-distinct genre and the melodramatic as a mode deployed throughout dramatic history. As with all of Jim's courses the syllabus is split into \"A\" and \"B\" which provides a comprehensive overview of the subject with ample space for personal exploration."

The class on THE OCTOROON in which Branden Jacobs-Jenkins visited might be my favorite class of all time at YSD thus far.",

    "The variety of videos was so great. It was enlightening to see the melodramatic operate in so many different forms--opera, film, mainstream American movies, etc.",
    "Jim's library of supplementary material is second to none. Each week supplementary materials are passed around the class for perusal. These materials help to ground the work under discussion in a more concrete way.",
    "Jim always provides a treasure-trove of secondary audio and visual materials. They are awesome.",
    "Jim is the king of supplementary materials. We should have to watch more of the materials and discuss them in class. Maybe instead of a play text as the main object of discussion one of the supplementary materials could best be the main object of discussion. How can the extra materials on V2 be required? Or be more active participants in class discussion?"

    "Yes.",

    "If we talked more about the theater craft inventions of Melodrama, perhaps TD&Ps would be interested, but their schedules are insane, so maybe not. What I appreciated about this class the most, though, was the attention to the actual material practice of theater. What a great way of learning the history of our craft!"
