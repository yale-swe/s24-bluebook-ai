    "The Mark and Brad Show was a great way to end my academic studies at Yale. This course is definitely anideal 'capstone' course for students that are interested in environmental management \/ working with a client \/ design. I think it was also really valuable to produce something for Yale. However, I do almost wish the course had been split into two semesters-- one semester developing the ecosystem services framework (and defining each service) and the second semester applying it to different parts of campus. I felt like towards the end of the semester everyone got burnt out and we could have produced a lot more work with more time and thought. Overall, however, I think this is the best course I've taken at FES.",
    "How clearly did the instructor provide explanations of conceptual material?Out of class assignments for this course were _______________ to my learning.How responsive to student comments was the instructor?I learned a lot from field trips\/lab work:The class was divided into two sections- one focusing on exploring an ecosystem service and one on drafting a plan for a part of campus. The exploration of each ecosystem service suffered from the artificial separation of one ecosystem service from another. None really functions without the others, so the decision to separate had enormous impact on the usefulness of the work. To make a case why Yale should pursue one ecosystem service over another (be it biodiversity, aesthetics, climate, or water) weakens the very thing- interconnectedness- that makes such an approach compelling.So the explanation of conceptual material was constantly compromised by the attempt to keep ecosystem services separate. This was simple but huge and it kept us turning around in circles instead of moving forward in our understanding of ecosystem services in the built environment.Both assignments were done in groups. The paper on an ecosystem service was somewhat helpful to my understanding of ecosystem services. More helpful was the development of a plan for a part of campus. I wish we had devoted much more time to this part of the class.The professors were both fantastic. This was a learning experience for them as well and they never suggested that they already knew the answers. It definitely felt like a partnership with consistent conversation.The field trip wasn't so helpful for me. Everything I saw there, I already knew about and understood. Many of the meetings were with people who are working with the market but since this class wasn't engaged with the market, this wasn't useful at all. Sure, it was interesting, but I can only absorb so much information at once! The trip was really over-scheduled. Free time to explorethe city would have been useful for getting first hand knowledge on how things work.",
    "I think trying to do both the baseline for what ecosystem services are, and making recommendations for specific parts of campus, was too much for one semester. I understand the reason for both, but we were limited at a conceptual level for both because of the time available... Not necessarily a bad thing, but it does make providing a solid analysis much harder. If we had only done one, I actually preferred the second part, because it gave us the ability to get creative with a specific area of campus. That wouldn't work as well if people didn't already have background, but in this case I think it would have because almost everyone in the class already had experience with green infrastructure to some degree.",
    "I really enjoyed this course. I experienced some difficulty in my group. I would suggest closer monitoring of the groups. I would not advocate specifying roles for each group member. I would let the groups form on their own. However, closer monitoring may alleviate some of the difficulty the groups found.",
    "The course was a great learning experience. It was different than what I initially expected it to be but turned out well.",
    "Good class because it allows brings together theory and practice."

    "The experimental nature of the class. We were researching something on which no one group or person is an expert. It was challenging but very educational to research ecosystem services.",

   "comments": [
    "I think the class went smoothly - if anything I would say there needs to be better consensus from the client side on what they want as an outcome as there were a lot of conflicting expectations.",
    "The field trip to Portland was great-- but a little tiring.. Next time the class should have more \"free time\"...",
    "Trip organization needs to improve. A balance of meetings that correspond to the class and free time.The separation of ecosystem services needs to be revisited.",
    "Clearer identification of course objectives at the beginning",
    "I think we should have spent time on figuring out costs and tradeoffs. I also wish Brad and Mark would have shared more of their knowledge on these issues.",
    "The field trip was great--lots of activities and interesting people to meet, however, I felt like it was too jam-packed. I think we could have gotten more out of it if we focused in on a fewer people and organizations. A day to explore on our own would have also been a great way to explore things each of us are interested in on an individual level.This course changes subject matter each year, but I think in terms of organization, starting off with the delineated campus zones would have been a great way to frame the class. It's hard to parse out ecosystem services as separate entities, and I think both Yale and the students would have made better use of time and energy if it was devoted to campus specific areas from the get-go.",

    "Advantages were that a good group is more than the sum of its parts. Disadvantages were that a bad group is also more than the sum of its parts. I think that designating a project manager for each group, as is done in the office environment, would improve the group work process.",
    "I was lucky enough to have two teams who worked well together. This allowed us to divide up the work, reducing the load on each of us, and also made the work stronger because we all had complementary expertise.The disadvantage is that we had a large amount of work to do in a short amount of time, and I know that a lot of groups had conflict through differences of opinion and\/or work styles.",
    "The advantages of working in the group were a wealth of information coming from the first half of the semester to the second. The second half of the semester the advantages were goal attainment from conceptual framework to applied examples. A detail in the work and a successful effort in creating a central campus ecosystems services plan.",
    "The first group there was a lot of tension. Thesecond group was great. Not sure what the difference was.",
    "This was the hardest group work I've ever participated in at FES (and almost every class I've taken has involved a group project). I was part of a group that had issues from the beginning. When I look back, I think there is more I could have done to smooth these issues over. I learned a lot of from this experience, and think I'll be better able to handle tricky dynamics in the future.",
