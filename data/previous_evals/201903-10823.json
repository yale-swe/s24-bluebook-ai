   "comments": [
    "Strengths: good readings, professors very open to feedback, interesting prompts and topics of discussion. Weaknesses: sometimes discussions felt a little aimless. I appreciate the benefit of allowing students to direct the discussion, but I think sometimes we harped too much on a few small points without discussing the main points of the reading or the big ideas of the field, and it might have been helpful to start with a few guiding questions (which wouldn't have to be strictly adhered to) to focus the discussion. I also don't understand the rationale between having different assignments for the graduate and undergraduate students. It's very unclear who did more work--I think probably the undergrads did, but the assignments were just \\different\\ which could get a little confusing at times. As an undergrad, I would have preferred more frequent and smaller assessments instead of two large papers and only two small prompts, although I did like the final paper as opposed to the presentation..."

   "comments": [
    "With a few tweaks to the organization of the class, I think this could be a really great course. I would recommend it to students from diverse backgrounds--philosophy, ethics, information science, any subfield of biology... it really gets you thinking. Be prepared not to learn a lot of content, per se, but to explore topics you already know something about through a philosophical lens. There is a decent amount of reading, but it's manageable, and it's a pretty good introduction to philosophy if you've never taken any philosophy courses before."
