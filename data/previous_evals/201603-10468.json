   "comments": [
    "I did develop a better understanding of how things that we take for granted, like voltage etc., are actually discovered. I learned some laboratory skills but I feel like each time I work in a new lab I have to learn new skills so I don't know how relevant those are.",
    "I learned basic laboratory skills and how to preform experiments using these skills efficiently. The pre-lab lectures were also very good reviews of what I was learning in the complimentary gen chem II course.",
    "The course helped perfect certain basic in-lab skills. Labs were not too complex, and with the procedures given to us, relatively easy to follow. I think the most helpful aspect of this lab was taking it in conjunction with CHEM 167, as a lot of concepts and equations made far more conceptual sense after performing relevant experiments in lab.",
    "It was a very good hands-on laboratory experience.",
    "This course helped me transition into college level labs, and it was a great review of most of the core subjects visited in general chemistry.",
    "I gained proficiency in many laboratory techniques that I had not been able to practice before. It was very satisfying to do such hands-on work. Taking this course congruently with Chem 167 was very helpful; I felt that the experiments we conducted in this class helped me to visualize and understand the concepts we were learning in 167.",
    "I got great at using excel and being able to stand up for three hours straight without eating.",
    "Fundamental laboratory skills.",
    "My ability to understand and carry out lab procedures on my own increased greatly.",
    "I learned general lab skills and how to be innovative in equipment use.",
    "Laboratory technique, including actual performance of experiments in addition to lab notebook keeping, lab report writing, etc. I felt so proud to make it through a 100 page lab manual by the end of the semester! I also deepened my understanding of some Chemistry 167 lecture material that hadnt been taught very well and was made much more clear by the prelab lectures in Chemistry 136L (note: each day in Chemistry 136L starts with a prelab lecture describing the chemistry behind the experiment, followed by a 15 minute quiz with questions about the experiment itself and calculation questions using relevant topics, followed by the experiment itself).",
    "I learned about the lab procedures, writing lab reports, and learning material for quizzes--these activities really helped me grow as a student.",
    "In all honesty, not much. This lab course is ineffectual at equipping students with any kind of meaningful laboratory skills, and the continual insistence that it does so is unfounded and illegitimate. Instead, chemistry lab is a slog through busy work, both in class and out. Lab reports are quite beyond tedious, and the half credit for this class is as absurd as the claims that it teaches you anything at all.",
    "Lab protocol, comfort in the lab setting, efficiency",
    "I learned how to be extremely organized in a laboratory setting, and how to be very precise and accurate when performing experiments.",
    "I became MUCH more confident working in a lab setting, and developed a higher understanding of concepts in my gen chem by being able to apply them during lab.",
    "I developed my laboratory skills and problem-solving skills in the context of lab work.",
    "I have become much more comfortable in a lab setting. I have learned how to carry out several different experiments as well as many smaller skills that are needed.",
    "I became much more comfortable in the lab environment, to say the least. I gained increased mastery over basic laboratory techniques that once gave me trouble, I learned how to do lab write-ups effectively, and I gained a better understanding of how to use data that I gather in the lab.",
    "I was able to practice lab skills that reinforced many chemistry concepts.",
    "I learned more laboratory techniques which supplemented my learning of chemistry in lecture.",
    "I learned how to perform important lab skills and write lab reports.",
    "Titrations",
    "In addition to becoming familiar with laboratory techniques and procedures, this course clarified concepts from chem 167.",
    "While I had been exposed to a lot of the lab equipment and techniques prior to taking this course, it still helped me become a more organized, independent, and mindful lab student. I also had good practice working with a partner, doing accurate experiments and observations, and graphing data.",
    "It was a really useful course for developing lab skills. I learned how to write in my notebook, something that will be necessary for future classes with harsher grading, and how to use basic equipment such as a spectrophotometer and buret for titrations.",
    "Necessary Chemical Lab Techniques",
    "I developed a good foundation of skills for working in a chemistry lab. I learned how to use a lot of important lab equipment as well as how to carry out essential lab techniques."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The strengths of lab is that the expectations are very clear and the semester is well planned. It's clear that a lot of thought has been put into the syllabus and as a student it was very nice to always know what I was going to get each week. The weaknesses are that sometimes the quizzes were on material not thoroughly explained in the lab manual which made them kind of stressful (especially if you weren't taking chem 167 or 165(?) concurrently). It also does include lots of tedious work-- the lab reports took a long time each week and when you add that to a 4-hour lab it's easily a credit or more. While Dr. Parr made it a lot less stressful than 116L was, I still think we could do more quality things and spend less time on them.",
    "I thought this course was very well taught and carried out. I was well prepared for all of the experiments we did, and I can not think of any ways to improve it.",
    "This lab is incredibly well organized with an extensive procedural handbook as well as helpful and straight-forward report sheets. Personally, I found constantly changing partners to be difficult at times, as I definitely felt I simply worked better with certain people in lab. I understand the reason for promoting mixing of partners, but also think the lab experience could have been improved for me through also allowing for us to stick with one partner throughout the duration of the course if we choose to do so.",
    "Course was a strong laboratory course and lab reports really helped me better understand the experiments.",
    "The biggest strength of this course is Dr. Parr. It's hard to make a general chemistry lab interesting, but Dr. Parr was able to make it fun as well. Really funny guy, and he will answer your questions no matter how unrelated they are to the lab. The only weakness to this lab is that you can only do pretty traditional experiments, but seeing as it is an intro lab course I doubt this can be avoided.",
    "I very much enjoyed how the labs were set up to coincide with what we were learning in class and for giving enough instruction that I was not confused, but not so much that I didn't have to think about my data and actually analyze it. I also think that the pre-lab lectures were very beneficial in understanding what we were going to accomplish in lab that day, thus making the entire learning experience better.",
    "This class was strong because it was very small, the professor gave lots of individual attention, and not much weight was placed on the accuracy of results (grading focused on whether you understood the concepts and processes, which I think is much more important and conducive to learning. In my opinion, this course did not have any significant weaknesses.",
    "Lab reports take a surprisingly long time each week, but getting to use such a wide variety of laboratory equipment feels valuable.",
    "Strengths: Experiments were fun and insightful, Lab reports were reasonable Weaknesses: Not enough time for pre-lab quizzes sometimes",
    "Strengths: good for developing confidence in laboratory technique that Im sure will become important in higher science courses, fantastic professor (Dr. Parr), allows you to pick up some useful knowledge for general chemistry on the side. Weaknesses: has absolutely no business being a half-credit course: I spent more time in class for Chemistry 136L than for my chemistry lecture course (which is worth a full credit), and I also spent more time out of class writing lab reports and preparing for prelab quizzes than I spent doing chemistry lecture homework or preparing for exams. That, in combination with the brutal 1 pm - 5 pm timeblock for chemistry lab, makes it really frustrating that all the work I poured into this class only resulted in a half credit, forcing me to take more classes to reach my credit quota but piled on top of what really should be a one credit class.",
    "This course was great for experiments that could be performed within the alloted time frame. I don't know if there's any way it could be improved.",
    "I don't know how it could be improved. This course was solid.",
    "I did not find any weaknesses in the course. I found it to be well organized and found that it lined up well with the material taught in the General Chemistry class. There was a clear progression, and the manual was structured very well and explained everything just enough so that topics were understandable but still challenging and interesting.",
    "Strengths: high level of engagement; thorough and constructive feedback; teacher makes sure students understand what they are doing and why; pre-lab lecture allows students to ask necessary questions; course in general facilitates learning of basic chemistry techniques.",
    "Strengths: the instructor, Dr. Parr was extremely helpful and cared for his students, the course was well organized, the experiments were engaging, the lab reports were reasonable and helped reinforce concepts. Weaknesses: taking a lab class is inevitably tiring, especially when multiple assignments from other classes are due the same day as your lab report\/lab day.",
    "The class is very helpful but the lab reports are very long for a half credit course. I found the class to be beneficial for my learning of chemistry but a lot of work.",
    "The labs were interesting, but the ones at the beginning were way too long. The course could be improved by shortening some of the initial labs so that they could actually be completed in the time allotted.",
    "Doctor Parr was really good at clearly explaining the material and was very kind and understanding. He was always open and willing to help students. Additionally, the TA, Jake, was awesome:)",
    "This course's biggest strength is the way it both made me a more self-sufficient lab student while also never making me feel unsupported or like I didn't know where to go to get my questions answered. The lab procedures were always clear and uncomplicated to follow properly, and the lab itself was incredibly organized and a perfect workspace. If there were one way to improve this course (and probably lab courses in general), it would be not to make students write up the lab procedure in our yellow sheets. While I understand that communicating methods effectively is an important lab skill, this task only bogged me down during lab and seemed a bit redundant considering more extensive methods were already in our lab manuals.",
    "The course is great to introduce undergraduates to working in a lab that is probably more advanced than what students had in high school. It moves at a pace that may seem fast at first but becomes comfortable after a few weeks."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "Chem 136L is a lot of time and is definitely not worth it if you don't need to take it for premed or your major, but if you do it's not bad, just tedious. Definitely take it with Dr. Parr if you have the choice.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to other students. It was a great learning experience where I got to use practical skills and observe the chemistry I was learning about instead of just hearing about it or seeing it on lecture slides. The work was very manageable, and it felt like a very good solidification of my gen chem knowledge.",
    "I would definitely recommend taking this lab course when taking CHEM 167 or its equivalent. This is especially true if it's taught by Dr. Parr. He's absolutely hilarious, made a 4-hour lab somehow incredibly fun, and also explained the concepts present in lab very concisely! Of course, lab reports take some time, but since you're given a unique template for each lab with step-by-step instructions to guide you through all of the calculations you need to make, they're really not that bad.",
    "Would recommend if you have to take a lab. Take it with Dr. Parr if you can! He is lovely.",
    "I would 100% recommend this class. Its a pretty easy intro lab, and Dr. Parr is hilarious. Just don't expect cake at the end of the course.",
    "Yes, I would highly recommend this course to another student. It was great in teaching lab techniques as well as the chemistry behind the lab. It was very beneficial as a supplement to my chemistry lecture, sometimes offering better explanations of the concepts from the lecture.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course. It wasn't too challenging, I learned a lot, and it was genuinely fun to be in lab. I looked forward to the experiments. I would definitely recommend reading over the procedure before each experiment. My understanding and enjoyment of the lab experiments increased by a huge amount when I did this. You won't get nearly as much out of the course if you don't take the time to fully understand the procedure beforehand; on the other hand, doing so will make writing the lab reports go a lot faster.",
    "I would recommend this class only if taught by Dr. Parr.",
    "Yes, but keep in mind lab reports can be wrong.",
    "I would recommend this course. It supplemented the information from the lecture course very well and Dr. Parr was a joy to have.",
    "I took this course thinking I wanted to major in chemistry, and although my lecture course really turned me off to chemistry, chem lab made it worth it despite the fact that Ill probably never need the skills I picked up in this class ever again. I learned a tremendous amount and would feel better equipped to go back into chemistry if I decided to change my mind. Id be hesitant recommending this to someone whos just trying to pick up a science credit because you need a course like Chem 167 to understand all the chemistry going on in the lab class, but since I was already taking chemistry lecture, I was able to really enjoy the experiments we did in chemistry lab and learning from Dr. Parr. On that point, if you are a science major and taking Chemistry 167 at some point anyway, Id definitely recommend taking it at the same time as this class. There are certainly people who dont do so, but the courses are timed to track with each other, and I felt that 136L helped me with 167 in addition to 167 helping with with 136L, so youd be missing out on that bonus if you didnt take them at the same time.",
    "I would definitely recommend CHEM 136L to another student, especially if it is with Dr. Parr!",
    "No.",
    "Yes, great professor and good lab experience",
    "I think this course is a good introduction to how Yale's laboratory courses are run. I don't know if it is very helpful, especially if you have done a lot of the reactions in an AP Chemistry course before, but it definitely teaches you what Yale expects from you in a chemistry lab.",
    "Yes! (You probably have to take this anyway though.) You will become a better lab student. I came into lab intimidated, and I left confident. The TA and professor made it very clear what exactly they expected from us, but it was also not really a big deal if you messed up. I think what really made this course worthwhile was how understanding and chill they both were, even when I broke something, or a few things.",
    "Yes, it is a great class if you have no lab experience before then.",
    "Most people take this course because they have to, and if you're premed or a science major you probably have to take this course regardless. That being said, if your still on the fence about a chem major I think you should try out the course to get a feel for the lab. It may seem like a lot of work at first (especially for only half a credit) but once you understand what's going on it gets much better.",
    "Yes; it was a great introduction to lab courses at Yale. I gained invaluable experience from it.",
    "I highly recommend CHEM 136L with Dr. Parr because it is well organized and Dr. Parr is the most understanding, caring, and passionate lab instructor.",
    "I would only recommend this class to people who need lab for a requirement. While the class is interesting, it is very time consuming for only half of a credit.",
    "I would only recommend taking this course only if its required for your major or if you are premed. Definitely take it with Dr. Parr if you can! He is very helpful (though he may seem a bit intimidating at first). The course load is more than a half credit's worth, so only take it if you have to. That being said, I did enjoy many of the labs!",
    "This lab section with Dr. Parr was amazing! Take it with him if you can! He's more focused on teaching laboratory skills than the organization of a lab report.",
    "Yup!",
    "Yes. It was well taught and Doctor Parr and Jake really made it as pleasant as a four hour lab can be.",
    "Yes. This course, though tedious at times, was rewarding because of the knowledge and skills gained.",
    "This lab is awesome, especially with Dr. Parr. He made each lab very comprehensible and had a dry sense of humor doing it. Expect to put real time into the lab reports even though they aren't overly challenging.",
    "I would certainly recommend this course and particularly in the semester after most students take it. The smaller class size and Dr. Parr's exceptional teaching made this course very engaging and something I looked forward to every week.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to any students who wants a hands-on science experience. The skills I learned will be useful in any lab environment I find myself in in the future."
