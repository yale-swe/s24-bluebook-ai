   "comments": [
    "Great, fun lecture. Lots of stuff you may have learned in high school US history, but it makes it fun to go to lecture and hear stories and you don't need to worry to much about memorizing and studying tons of things. Workload is on the light side of standard for a history lecture.",
    "In Early National America, one will learn how to contextualize the early national period from the Articles of Confederation through the beginning of the Van Buren presidency. We learn how the nation turned from a new experiment in governance to dominating a decent portion of the continent. Also, it's interesting to look at this class in the eyes of the founders and other early leaders. We have the benefit of knowing that it all turned out well, unlike them. I would warn those who haven't taken English 114 (or an equivalent) to wait to take this class. I would also advise against taking this in conjunction with English 114. I struggled with the essay portion of the midterm and the second paper as a result.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to a fellow student, history major or not. It was cool to learn about the period, and I enjoyed going to this class each time.",
    "A great lecture that covers the period immediately after the revolutionary war and until the age of jackson. Joanne Freeman is the best lecturer at Yale. She comes to class with a prepared, rehearsed lesson that still feels light, fresh, and inspired. She weaves anecdotes and stories into her lectures that, to use a cliche, make history come alive. She is an amazing teacher.",
    "This class is an easy and fun overview of the period, but don't expect to learn anything you didn't learn in high school us history.",
    "A survey of the early American republic that focuses on political history.",
    "A history of the period from the Articles of Confederation to Jackson. I would 100% recommend this course--by far the best class I have taken at Yale. Freeman is incredible--the stories she tells from the archives make history come alive. TAKE THIS CLASS",
    "I would recommend this class, but with some reservations. While I believe it to be of the best classes for unbiased engagement with American history, one really needs a good TF to foster the kind of discussion that makes this period so important and interesting.",
    "I would recommend this class if you are interested in early American history. It is very interesting, the workload is manageable, and the professor is great.",
    "You must take this class. Joanne Freeman is probably one of the best lecturers at Yale. She makes every lecture interesting, engaging, and fun. If you like US history, take this class.",
    "Not too much work, but make sure you pay attention in lecture and do some reading. Really fun class",
    "I'm not totally enamored of the time period, which covers from the writing of the Constitution to the presidency of Andrew Jackson -- I actually took this course last minute because I needed to fulfill my American History requirement for the history major. That being said, Professor Freeman is an incredible lecturer. You can tell she loves her subject more than anything, and just really enjoys not only doing research but also teaching an intro course about it. Her lectures always include funny anecdotes, and it's just really great to listen to someone talk about something they are totally in love with. That being said, you should know the period you are getting into and be sure that you want to learn in depth about it.",
    "This class is a must-take! Professor Freeman is amazing, and this class will teach you a ton. Even if you do not consider yourself a history person, take this class. It may give you a new outlook on the study of history, as it did for me. Shop it at the very least, because Professor Freeman is so funny and engaging, so her lectures are always a ton of fun.",
    "I would recommend this class to any history major looking to get a good footing in early United States history, anyone who wants to try out the history department at Yale, or any new history majors. It is a great introduction to the history department at Yale - the expectations in terms of papers, and what to expect on midterms and exams. The history is worthwhile to learn, engaging, interesting and enjoyable. Overall very hard to go wrong with this course!",
    "This course is awesome! Professor Freeman is awesome! TAKE THIS COURSE!",
    "I would recommend this class to a fellow student in a heartbeat-- in fact I recommended the class to my fellow classmates throughout the year. The readings were insightful and entirely manageable. The timing of the midterm paper and exam, and the final paper and exam was great as well. What's more, the class was incredibly engaging. Only positive things to say about this class."
