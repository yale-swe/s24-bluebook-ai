    "It's a wonderful reading list, full of titles that I, at least, had never read before. Professor Phillips is very knowledgeable about the history behind many of the works and gives you great insight into their larger social and political contexts (toward the later half of the class, he actually knows a number of the authors, which can add an interesting element to discussion). For whatever reason, I wouldn't say that my year the class managed to achieve a good dialogue between students--the readings themselves and Professor Phillips' take on them were by far the most interesting part of the course.There is also little to no written work until the final paper, which is worth half your grade, so make sure to start thinking about it early.",
    "I would definitely recommend it! The syllabus is great, none of the novels are incredibly long or anything, and Professor Phillips is amazing! You definitely have to be prepared for that thesis paper at the end, also somewhere in the middle of the year he might do a surprise in class essay on the reading, so keep doing it. But the class is definitely worth it!",
    "Pretty solid senior seminar; good books",
    "This is a great class! Professor Phillips is a fascinating, engaged, and witty individual who always keeps class exciting. He is actually hilarious which makes the class all the better. He tends to spend a bit more time lecturing than facilitating discussion, but his lectures are always very insightful and engaging, so I didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t mind too much. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s actually not that much work because most of the books are pretty short and even if they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not, they are fast reads because they are contemporary works. The 25 page essay is definitely very challenging, but Professor Phillips is super helpful and welcomes students to come talk to him all throughout the semester.",
    "Take this seminar if you can get in. Prof. Phillips is a chill dude, and though it would've been nice to have the final grade not depend so heavily on one final paper, the upside is you only need to read one book a week.It was a lot of great literature you wouldn't normally be exposed to, and the discussion framework is refreshing -- more historical\/cultural context, less literary analysis.",
    "Yes, this is a great senior seminar. A lot of good books and I learned so much about the history of England post-1945.",
    "This is a strong course and a tough course. Though it's only one book each week, the readings require a great deal of time spent with each, and if you are not up to date on your contemporary British history, you will need to spend some extra time acquainting yourself with the sociopolitical context from WWII on. Be forewarned: the works studied are often quite dark and depressing; rarely do they have happy endings. Professor Phillips is remarkably insightful and brilliant, and you should come prepared to class or office hours with articulate arguments... ideally, make sure they're well-researched. Aside from any in-class assignments, the final paper is the only work you will produce for the course, so only the highly self-motivated need apply. I grew a great deal from this course, and cautiously recommend it to anyone interested in this particular body of work.",
    "Take this class! It's great. Prof Phillips is your standard badass (guy's written like 234092834092384 books and knows half the authors we read personally), and also an incredibly sharp professor. Class is a great balance of learning about the sociopolitical and historical context of novels and analyses of the text itself. There's a pop quiz halfway through, so look out for that and make sure you do the readings (which aren't too bad, a book a week, which is pretty standard).",
    "Contemporary British Fiction is an interesting senior seminar. The reading list is very specific -- the entire class revolves around one distilled thesis: class, race, gender, and sexuality serve as barriers to belongingness in British society. This idea gets tired, although one leaves with a deep understanding of this area of literature.Phillips knows absolutely everything about this field. He probably should be on the syllabus. This, however, makes class discussions limited, as there seems to always be a right answer. His expectations for the final paper are very high, and his criticism can be very harsh.Take it if you care deeply about the syllabus.",
    "If you look at the reading list and are interested, take it without hesitation.",
    "The biggest takeaway I got from this course was, quite simply: whatever you think you know about England, you don't. This course paints a fairly bleak picture of England as shown through its contemporary literature, but it's well worth taking, if only to divest yourself from your conception of England as a land of Oxbridge and glamorous London.",
    "I definitely recommend this class. The reading list is great and Professor Philips is always leads interesting classes.",
    "Contemporary British Fiction is a survey course that focuses on post-War (WWII) fiction in Britain. Some of the authors are members of the British Commonwealth, but their writing is still influenced by their experiences in Britain. The assognments are limited to a short paper proposal (2-3 pages double spaced), weekly readings, and a final paper. You may have a pop quiz around midterm. That said, the final paper is demanding, so start early. Participation and writing assignments will factor heavily into your final grade (50\/50 split)."
