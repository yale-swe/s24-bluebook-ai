    "GREAT course. A fun way to do a lab credit. If you're looking for something that won't take up a lot of time, then you've come to the wrong place, because this lab always takes the full allotted time, and the lab reports are not trivial at all (the full ones took me several hours). However, provided you are willing to block out the time necessary to do it, the work isn't that hard, so it's a fair shake in that regard. The labs are super interesting if sometimes a bit long. But Marta is absolutely amazing, and her energy really drives the course. She's always so enthusiastic and I think it rubs off on her students. Definitely take the course if you're looking for a very different and very positive lab course experience, but do be prepared to put in some time.",
    "Highly recommended!",
    "This lab is super fun and I highly recommend it. Marta is super passionate about the lab and she's sweet and kind. The lab is an overview of diversity and ecology. There is a lot of hands on work and the work load is pretty manageable with about every 3 labs being a full alb report. The rest are mini labs. I highly recommend this lab.",
    "This is a great lab. Take it! Marta is the best and really nice. The lab reports can take some time but there aren't too many. The mini lab reports are quite easy. Overall a great class that everyone should take if they are even the smallest bit interested.",
    "Best lab I've had at Yale. I would recommend it to any and every student.",
    "'Twas an absolutely amazing class! Many of the labs were truly enjoyable activities that I would have paid to do because they were so fun, but instead I can do them for course credit! (Well, I guess I kind of am paying to do them with tuition and whatnot, but you get what I mean). In my favorite lab, we ate 43 different types of exotic fruit, which was incredibly cool. We also had a fun field trip to a stream to collect specimens, and other labs involved fun dissections or observations of interesting organisms. My one big caveat is that the full lab reports take some doing. There are only four of these (as opposed to ten in previous years), but if you put them off until the night before they can be painful. But on the bright side, we got to each have an iPad for the semester!",
    "I loved this class. If you're looking for a relevant lab course to take to accompany the intro bio sequence (or just in general), E&EB 223L is the way to go (it was especially helpful for BIOL 104). The lab itself is not too hard, though at times the work can seem tedious. Either way there are only 4 full lab reports to write, only two of which take any significant amount of time to complete. It was definitely a lot of fun, especially the last few labs. There are dissections involved, however, so if that is a dealbreaker for you be warned.",
    "I would definitely recommend E&EB 223L to another student. Also, this class counts as a biology lab credit for pre-meds, but it comes without the stress!",
    "Take this if you need a bio lab. It's not exactly the most instructional you've ever taken, but it was actually enjoyable and covered a pretty wide scope of life. It was general enough that I could actually talk about it in the world at large, which was cool.",
    "This is an easy class, but its also a fun and rewarding class. Don't come in hoping for a rigorous lab, but come in with an open mind to appreciating the diversity of life.",
    "This is definitely the most interesting class I've taken. Dissecting squids, field trips etc. It's like other labs except fun.",
    "ATTENTION ALL PRE-MEDS\/STEMMERS\/PEOPLE WHO RANDOMLY NEED A HALF SCIENCE CREDIT\/PEOPLE WHO LIKE FRUIT, ICE CREAM, NATURE, AND A GREAT TIME: TAKE THIS LAB! It was fantastic. We went on a field trip to Sleeping Giant State Park, and even though I got a TON of water in my waders, we caught a snake and got ice cream afterward, so it was all cool. We also spent a lot of time at the greenhouses, which was an experience I had never had before and for which I'm very grateful. There was one day where we literally looked at flowers, learned about fruit, and then had a fruit feast. The final project (a creative project about the tree you're assigned at the beginning of the semester) was also super fun and definitely a great break from all the exams and papers I had to do for other classes. However, there are definitely lab reports and quizzes for this class, so it's not all play and no work. It just so happens that the play is so fun that it overpowers the work, and after taking orgo lab, this lab is just a breath of fresh air. Bonus: you get an iPad for the semester, so that's fun.",
    "Really great bio lab if you need one or if you don't need one. very engaging class, I learned a ton...lots of time outdoors and a field trip and overall just a really great class that I thoroughly enjoyed!"
