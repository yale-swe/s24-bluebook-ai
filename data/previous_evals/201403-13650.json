    "The readings took a while, especially for malaria since that was the disease I knew the least about and the readings tended to be complex. However, if you're interested in the Big 3 the readings are very interesting and homework questions were often based on the reading. Homework questions took a while but we didn't have homework problems that frequently. Working on the class presentations and final paper probably took the most time but it was interesting to look at how organizations have been able to shape the trajectory of the three epidemics.",

   "comments": [
    "Very interesting subject matter and a great professor. A weakness of the class is the time management - too much time would be spent on some topics, and not enough on others. A faster pace would ensure the material is kept interesting and that it is fully covered.",
    "The class was interesting. Lectures tended to run over (time wise) but the material was interesting and engaging. Sunil is also a wonderful professor and very considerate. He's obviously passionate about the three diseases and the small class size allowed for a close discussion.",
    "This was my favorite course this semester! I really enjoyed the material and found it fascinating. I also liked the schedule of the class with regular assignments and projects toward the end. The biggest weakness was not having any feedback the entire semester. I don't think I've taken a class in my entire class where nothing was graded, so I have absolutely no idea if I was meeting expectations. The other improvement would be being consistent about when readings and assignments are posted. Instead of continually updating links in the syllabus, it would probably make more sense to create a folder of readings each week on Classes V2. (You can link to them instead of actually posting them this method - this is actually how Melinda posted readings in Principles of ID).",
    "Strengths: lecture material\/content, guest speakers, projects instead of exams (projects are a lot more appropriate for this class I think) Weakness: short time to cover so much material, perhaps a little more time could have been spent learning about TB, reading the whole book by Dr. Snowden was a bit demanding",
    "The material was GREAT. I loved learning about the Big 3 -- they are diseases that are often discussed in almost every class here but we do not get many opportunities to learn more in depth about. Sunil's slides were great and the workload was very appropriate.",
    "A very interesting course with informative lectures, impressive guest lecturers, and plenty of opportunities for student presentations. There are still some teething issues, such as the timing of the classes, distribution of the homeworks, and arrangement of the material, but the instructor is aware of these things.",
    "Course was very interesting and full of new information especially for those of us not in EMD. Presentations could have been a little more condensed for the sake of time, and more efforts to incorporate the other fields like health management and policy could be improved.",
    "This course was very interesting and informative. The subject matter was engaging and relevant to my studies. Because this was the first year this course was offered, there were some organizational glitches, but I think these will be resolved when the course is taught in the future.",
    "This was one of my favorite courses taken at YSPH. It is a great way to learn about HIV, TB, and malaria in depth. The lectures were jam-packed with information--many times we could not get through the slides due to time constraints. Additionally, there were a lot of readings and expectations were high. However, I ended up learning far more than I had in earlier infectious disease courses, and I liked the format of presentations. The guest lecturers were also well-selected.",
    "Less clinical material. The social issues and discussion of barriers to treatment were very interesting.",
    "Strengths: great course! Learned a lot. Weaknesses: small room, hurt my head.",
    "I really enjoyed learning about the big 3 diseases, especially from Sunil. However, the material covered may have been more suitable for medical school candidates rather than public health candidates. There were a lot of drug names that were thrown at us that I felt may not have been necessary. For public health purposes, I felt that more social determinants could have been covered as opposed to looking at the drug perspective. Also I felt that in order to consolidate the knowledge better, we ought to have had an exam (at least one) AND a presentation. Two presentations, especially the individual one, felt slightly redundant and not as useful as it could have been. The group presentation was interesting because I don't think that we would have gone off and learned about the large global health players on our own without some form of coercion. In conclusion, I think one exam and one group project would be optimal and put our knowledge to better use.",
    "The Big Three course provided an in-depth exploration of TB, malaria and HIV that surpassed the biological and physiological impacts of disease, and highlighted the global health impact of these three diseases and the way they interact and affect each other. The combination of student and faculty presentations, and our personal ability to explore our interests within this subject enhanced the course."

   "comments": [
    "Instructor: Sunil Parikh \u00a0A fantastic, experienced, and very interesting professor who cares greatly about the students and the subject. One way to improve his teaching would be better time management and keeping the class at a slightly higher level. It would be great if the pace could be a little faster with less extra detail.",
    "Instructor: Sunil Parikh \u00a0A wonderful professor. If anything he is too kind. He was very considerate to students needs. Coming from a medical background he was able to relate how these conditions have been presented and impacted society from both a medical and public health background. The only criticism is that we never really had a sense of how we were doing in the class, but as he mentioned 'if there had been a problem with your work he would have talked to you', I can assume the class is doing very well. Although lectures went over, this was my favorite class so it didnt bother me.",
    "Instructor: Sunil Parikh \u00a0Sunil is great! Knowledgeable, interesting, approachable. I know this was his first class, but he's a great professor!",
    "Instructor: Sunil Parikh \u00a0I absolutely loved Dr. Parikh!! He is a great lecturer and is very approachable. I also really appreciated how he shared stories from his work around the world and with patients he's in hospital settings. You can also tell that he always considers what the course is like from the perspective of the student, which is a rare but incredibly important quality to a great instructor. I highly recommend his course and wish he was teaching another one next semester so I can take it!",
    "Instructor: Sunil Parikh \u00a0Very dedicated to the students and very knowledgable about the material.",
    "Instructor: Sunil Parikh \u00a0Sunil is very smart and is very good at disseminating his knowledge. I thoroughly enjoyed his slides. However, he was very disorganized. We got zero feedback at all throughout the course. I have no idea what grade I received on my homework assignments or my papers and presentations. Also, he has a very poor sense of time... Maybe because it was his first time teaching here, but we always went over the class time which made me late multiple times to my next class\/meetings. He also kept getting dates wrong in the syllabus and gave us confusing information (\"homework will be posted tomorrow\" but actually was not posted until a few days later). Better organization would make this course perfect.",
    "Instructor: Sunil Parikh \u00a0Interesting, understanding, and humorous, with a wealth of knowledge and an easy-going attitude.",
    "Instructor: Sunil Parikh \u00a0Instructor explained the material well and tried to provide comprehensive picture of the big 3 diseases including historical context.",
    "Instructor: Sunil Parikh \u00a0I really liked his teaching style. He was enthusiastic, and he presented the course content very well. Things were a little disorganized because this was the first time he taught the course, but he did a good job.",
    "Instructor: Sunil Parikh \u00a0Sunil was a great professor, you can tell he's really interested in the topic. I know the class went over a few times throughout the semester, but I enjoyed what we were learning, and it wasn't usually an issue. My only criticism is that I wished we received more feedback throughout the semester.",
    "Instructor: Sunil Parikh \u00a0Sunil was a good lecturer and knew his stuff. I enjoyed listening to his perspectives on malaria.",
    "Instructor: Sunil Parikh \u00a0Just need to work on starting and ending class on time.",
    "Instructor: Sunil Parikh \u00a0Strengths: so nice and very approachable. Weaknesses: a bit unorganized and didn't give us feedback.",
    "Instructor: Sunil Parikh \u00a0Sunil is a really dedicated and clever person, and I know he really loves the material. However, I would encourage him to speak a little louder and get the class engaged a little more since the class size was small. It would have been better as a seminar style type class instead of a pure lecture.",
    "Instructor: Sunil Parikh \u00a0Sunil has been one of the best lecturers I have had the opportunity to experience at YSPH. His insight on malaria research and understanding of the burden of these diseases on global health allowed me to remain engaged throughout the course. He was very approachable and helpful, providing assignments that were challenging but also interesting, allowing us to interact and collaborate as a class."

   "comments": [
    "An interesting overview of three critical diseases in public health. I would recommend as way to gain an understanding of the history, biology, epidemiology, and progress for these diseases.",
    "If your interested in malaria, TB, and HIV definitely take it. Just to work with Sunil is a great opportunity. He loves malaria and his passion for the field comes out in his work and lectures.",
    "This is a really interesting class and pretty low-stress. I would recommend it to anyone interested in a class similar to Infectious Diseases I and II or anyone who wants a greater understanding of any of the Big 3. Be ready to roll with some things (like not having anything graded all semester or having classes run out of time) and you'll have a good time.",
    "Excellent!",
    "I would definitely recommend. I think all EMDs should take this.",
    "It is a great course that focuses on HIV, TB, and malaria, mostly in the developing world. This course is perfect for EMD students who want to know more about these diseases (from three angles: biology, epidemiology, and social) after taking the Principles of Infectious Diseases courses. It is a good supplement to the 1st-year EMD course, since it takes more time to focus on three of the biggest infectious diseases. Recommended for all 2nd-year EMD students.",
    "I would recommend this course to someone interested in getting more than just a surface level understanding of the big 3. I thought it also gave a good picture to the current day issues facing SSA with respect to the big 3 and up-to-date research on drugs and technology that have been developed.",
    "This course is a good overview course about the public health challenges posed by malaria, TB, and HIV.",
    "Yes strongly recommended, great teacher",
    "I would highly recommend to anyone interested in learning a thorough perspective on HIV, TB, or malaria.",
    "Really interesting class. Very glad I took this class.",
    "Great course for second years.",
    "I really liked the material so I would recommend the course, but with some hesitation given the course's fledgling nature.",
    "The Big 3 is a new course provided by the EMD department which I highly recommend to all students, within and outside the department. For EMD students interested in any or all of these diseases, it provides a very thorough scope of each of them, while highlighting the complexity of their interaction, and exploring its impact in the global burden of disease. For non-EMD students interested in taking a class in the department, this course provides an in-depth view of each disease, which allows students from all background to become well-versed in the subjects. It also provides the unique opportunity to become better acquainted with organizations that directly target these diseases, and under the subject material, develop the ability to understand how the missions of some of these programs match global health needs."
