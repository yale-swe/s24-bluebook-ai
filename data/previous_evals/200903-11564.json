   "comments": [
    "Not as bad as they say, but still difficult - if you commit to it, you will do fine and learn useful information for the first time in Chemistry.",
    "Not as bad as you would think. If you have a true scientific mind, you will like organic chemistry - it is a new way of thinking that is challenging, yes, but also fun.",
    "This class is a very challenging one, but with lots of work and dedication, it is manageable. Overextending yourself in extracurricular activities during a semester in which you are taking Orgo is not smart. You will have to do crazy time-consuming problem sets, and you might want to kill yourself. But if you get it done, you will find that the class is very rewarding and perhaps even fun.",
    "This class sucks, but I think that's common knowledge by now. Obviously, the only people who are going to take it are the people that have to, with or without a recommendation. It takes a lot of work and time to do well in the class.",
    "don't take it unless you have to",
    "Lots of work. But still, not as terrible as its reputation states. Ziegler makes the class enjoyable, even if the classes are at 9 AM. Problem Sets are helpful, so are the textbook problems. Tests are fair. Highly recommended.",
    "Take it if you're a chem major or a premed. Not for fun.",
    "It takes a lot of work.",
    "absolutely not, but it won't change your mind.",
    "Horrible. Only take it if you have to for pre-med or for your major. Frankly, if it wasn't for those two reasons, orgo would be a seminar for the few people who actually enjoy this subject.",
    "220 is a great, great class. ATTEND THE LECTURES, TAKE GOOD NOTES, and do a HECUKVA LOT OF PRACTICE PROBLEMS. It's not half as bad as everyone say it is, and the material's actually kind of fun (for me) :D Definitely recommended, though I doubt people take this class because others recommended it......",
    "Go to the chemistry tutors in the residential colleges, or get your own. Otherwise, it will be extremely difficult.The final was worth 45% of the final grade. This is stressful, and makes it completely possible for you to bomb your final grade in the class after working hard all semester. 45% is unfair.",
    "Orgo is, well, orgo. It's not as bad as people make it out to be, you just have to approach it with the right attitude from the get-go. Seriously. That's perhaps the most important thing. Approach the problem sets and the problems on the test like they're a sudoku - it's a really hard sudoku that you need to finish, otherwise it's going to drive you crazy until you do. Understand the concepts, don't memorize. Beware of Ziegler--he's not the best professor but your experience will be better with him as a professor if you prepare for lecture beforehand. FORM STUDY GROUPS! I would've probably failed without mine. My study group was great for working on orgo, and also empathizing with how horrible orgo seemed to be for the semester. Persevere. It's doable.",
    "- I would only recommend this course if you have an interest in chemistry or are pre-med",
    "The course was challenging but the material was interesting. However, Ziegler is intimidating and not so helpful. The TAs were a major asset to this course, and were pretty much the ones who taught me what the book couldn't. You have to be willing to do a lot of self studying\/learning, but it really isn't as bad as people make it out to be.",
    "It's not as bad as you might expect. The problem sets can be grueling- they're due on Mondays, and I would spend all day Sunday working on them- but only one problem on each is graded. Read your textbook before starting the problem sets. The textbook is very clear and well-written. The exams are reasonable. Organic chemistry introduces you to a type of science that is probably quite different from any other science you've studied before- it requires a lot of visual thinking. It takes a little getting used to, but it's definitely conquerable. Overall: don't take this class if you don't have to, but if you need to take it, don't be scared.",
    "Only take Orgo if you need it for your major or are a premed. Trust me, you are not missing anything life-changing.",
    "Chances are, if you're taking this class it's because you have to. If you work hard you can pull off an ok grade. If you don't have to, don't take this class.",
    "If you're considering taking this, you obviously are pre-med or orgo is a pre-req for you. If you have to take it, do try to avoid Ziegler, and stay on top of your work. Remember that if you want an A in this class, you will be devoting your entire life to it, which might not be worth it.",
    "It's a key pre-med requirement, get through it if you have to.",
    "It's not something you take as a elective. You have to put the work into it, and you have to enjoy it in order to do that. If you are going to take it, put the work in, or else you'llhave a horrible term. It just takes a lot of reading the book and doing problems, and keeping up. But if you get it right, it's enjoyable. Make sure you ask questions if you don't get it. Once you get the chemical principles, it's just memorizing reactions. (Zeigler's not hte greatest; I really didn't use my lecture notes at all when studying.)",
    "take it if you need it, sorta interesting if you put the time and effort in",
    "Honestly, I wouldn't take it if I didn't have to. It's difficult no doubt about it, though the workload isn't too bad.",
    "If you're looking at this class you probably already have to take it; don't let people tell you orgo is hard--it's not, as long as you keep up with the reading and take good notes. The lecture itself isn't that helpful, but the material is manageable and the class isvery fair.",
    "If you are willing to put in the time and have decide that you want to be pre-med you should definitely take this course. It is very competitive as well. Please be advised!!!!::: this course takes a lot of work if you want to do well.",
    "I would recommend Chem 220 with professor Ziegler. This class was as bad as it was built up to be and I attribute that to him.",
    "I would recommend it because it is required for biology majors an pre-med students.",
    "Take it ONLY if you're pre-med, thinking about pre-med, or a chemistry major. Otherwise you're wasting your time.",
    "Hard, don't take it unless you have to. Especially not with Z.",
    "This is a class you are taking because you need to, but it is not the best experience. It isn't as well taught as other chemistry classes I've taken, and lectures are not enjoyable at all. My recommendation to other students is that you should avoid taking Ziegler as much as humanly possible. Do the spring version of first semester and finish it fall of junior year, or do it over the summer. It really weighs down your semester and ruins what is actually a very interesting subject.",
    "Take it. Has lots of premeds but even non-premeds enjoyed it.",
    "Orgo definitely requires a lot of hard work. You will have to spend long nights reading and studying the material, and cramming like mad before the exams.",
    "If you have to take it, you have to take it.",
    "Challenging! And tons of work.",
    "only take it for the requirement",
    "I mean, you have to take this course for any number of science majors. Sorry about that. My advice: keep up with reading the book. It makes lectures easier to understand and you can study for the test without even looking at your lecture notes if you just use your book.",
    "Only if you have to take it",
    "i wouldn't recommend it but it's something you have to take",
    "If you are reading this, I assume you have no choice but to take organic chemistry. If, under any circumstance, you are considering taking this for a grade and it's optional, the grass really has to be greener on some other side. Ziegler is awful. So snarky and arrogant, although you can tell he's trying to be nice. But don't be fooled.If you have Ziegler, you just have to figure out his little tricks. Reading the book will give you the actual concepts, but you need to learn the Zieg-cepts. These are just random batshi** problems that he recycles over and over.",
    "I would recommend chem 220 only to those who are willing to put in a lot of time and effort. Also, be prepared to realize that sometimes, no matter how hard you work, you're not going to get the grade you want. I would only take it if it is a requirement.",
    "If you are looking at these reviews of orgo, you are probably required by your major or premed to be in the class. That being said, if Ziegler is teaching you should SERIOUSLY consider waiting to take it until another professor is teaching. The class will likely be stressful because the material is very difficult and the class is very very competetive, and you really do not need a horrible professor on top of that! If you can wait until someone else teaches it, you will save yourself from a very stressful semester!",
    "Great!",
    "Orgo doesn't have to be as scary as its reputation claims it is! As long as you keep up with your work, do the big scary psets (which get less scary as you start to understand what the prof is getting after), and are willing to work TONS of practice problems, you can do well. Yeah yeah, I know that sounds scary, but it actually becomes, dare I say, quite fulfilling and sort of fun. That said, this class isn't for those who are not willing to put in a great deal of work. Ziegler's psets and tests FORCE you to understand things, which may seem like a pain for those who just want a good grade, but will most certainly prove much more beneficial for the MCAT. (Yeah... surprise... orgo is geared towards premeds).",
    "Pre-med? then take it. duh.",
    "It was okay, the final counts for about half your grade so it feels like most of the other aspects of the course are irrelevant. I also wish that all the questions on the problem set were graded instead of just one question.",
    "Organic chemistry is fun and interesting if you let it be. After prodding most people, they will grudgingly admit that they like the material, they just assume that they're not supposed to.",
    "This course was not as bad as some of the reviews that I have read made it out to be. Ziegler was helpful and mostly clear in his lectures, and the material was manageable if you go to lecture, section and read over the textbook throughout the semester (versus cramming the night before an exam).",
    "This class goes very quickly and it's a lot of work. Ziegler gives problem sets that try to \"stretch\" you, so they take hours. The tests aren't impossible (and he makes lots of practice tests available), but the final was excruciating. In general, the course really depends on the professor. The actual material isn't too awful, just depends on how it's presented.",
    "Chemistry 220 is definitely a challenge. It's a 9:25 am class at the top of Science Hill, so I was not motivated to go to lectures. However, the lectures that I attended did help me in understanding the material. Though I learned a lot, I would not take this class unless it was required. This class requires a lot of time to understand the material and do the problem sets.",
    "It's awful, it's a struggle, but once it's done with it's done with. Just try to get through, that's all you can do. Unless you miraculously just understand it, it is difficult and definitely have a good group of friends that you study with before tests. Ziegler was good for ahving many old tests available to practice but there are no answers which doens't really help. So at that point doing them together is good and try asking your TA. Also review sessions are helpful in going over those, but in all honestly, probably the worst class I've ever taken and put so much effort into but gained absolutely nothing. The horror stories you hear about Orgo exist so just try going in with a positie attitude, or countdown of the days you ahve left until you finish to look o nthe bright side of things.",
    "Great class. Fun material. Be prepared to study a lot because it\u00b4ll be rewarding in the end.",
    "I really enjoyed this course. The teaching was fairly good, the tests were very fair, and organic chemistry is just fun and interesting. I liked the material more than anything else. The problems were challenging, but fun. The course is A LOT of work. It is a lot of material to learn, but I found the work surprisingly enjoyable.",
    "It's organic chemistry. I really liked the subject, but if you don't train yourself to do problems quickly, tests will be a real pain. If you're pre-med or a chem major, you have to take it, but DON'T FREAK OUT AT TUTOR SESSIONS. Or during sections. Or tests. Really, it's not that bad. I wish I were better at the subject. Zeigler was an alright prof, his website was fantastic, and it definitely could have been a more miserable experience.",
    "Very challenging and difficult. Only take if you have to for premed or major",
    "I would recommend it for premed or chemistry majors. Being likely neither one myself, I would say there are probably better classes one could take, but its still very interesting stuff.",
    "It's first semester orgo and it's difficult and you've got to attend lectures and study the book as you go. That said, it's not the ridiculously hard class that breaks your back as everyone will tell you. Definitely try to work in a group for the problem sets and studying for exams. Also, make sure to be memorizing reactions and their mechanisms as you go, instead of cramming for the exams. Professor Ziegler hadn't taught the course in two years, and his old reviews were poor, but I found him to be a capable teacher and interesting enough to stay awake during lecture. His exams were fair and problem sets took between 4-10 hours due on Mondays.",
    "CHEM 220a is tough, but even though I didn't do very well, I still think it's not as bad as everyone says it is. The tests will be difficult and you'll have to put a lot of work into the course on your own outside of lecture, but being really negative about it just makes it worse.",
    "It's orgo -- this professor is good, though.",
    "It's orgo. You're either taking it because you have to take it, or you're taking it because you're a masochist and you don't want a high GPA. It is a very difficult course, and you have to put in a lot of work to do well. That said, I found the subject matter very interesting and overall, I sort of liked the class. Ziegler is a pretty good lecturer as far as science lecturers go, although he can be sort of abrasive at times.",
    "Organic Chemistry really isn't all that bad if you put in the time and read the textbook on the side. You don't really need to go to lectures, especially if you're taking it with Ziegler (he's smart, just not that clear).",
    "I took this course as a freshman, and had success. If you are a freshman, don't shy away or be intimidated by sophomore orgo. If you think you can do it, go for it. I got a 5 on AP chem, and so I felt that I didnt want to take gen chem all over again. Furthermore, FRESHMAN ORGO AND SOPHOMORE ORGO ARE NOT AT ALL ALIKE, so choose carefully. Here is a compare\/contrast of the two courses.Sophomore Orgo (i.e. Chem 220)-relies heavily on the textbook.-teaches organic chemistry. period.-has students who were in chem 112,114, and 118 as freshmenFreshman Orgo (i think chem 125 is the number)-has no textbook; relies solely on lectures and power points-teaches fundamental science principles, like quantum tunneling, and other stuff that is related to orgo. Actually starts doing orgo late first semester into second semester-has students who scored 5 on AP chemIn both classes you have to score above average to get an A-. So shoot for at least that. You put the time in and you will do well. Best of luck",
    "I mean, it's orgo. If you wanna go to med school, you gotta take it, and, unfortunately, there is no easier orgo course at Yale, so it's this or the high way. It's really not that bad though--I actually know a few people who enjoyed the class. If you're like me, you'll be super engaged by the reading--it's really fascinating--but then get extremely frustrated by the problem sets, which rarely ties directly to the reading. The tests are hard. Unlike pretty much any other class I've ever taken, you actually have to study A LOT if you wanna do well. Like not just a couple days before the test. Weird, right?",
    "Only if you are premed. The problem sets count for nothing so it is easy to work hard on all the problem sets and do well on them and not well in the course. Final counts for a lot.",
    "Overview\/intro to Organic Chemistry. Not too much work, just make sure you stay on top of your reading. Most people take this as a requirement, so not much choice involved here. Ziegler's lectures are not that helpful, but he's a nice guy and is really dedicated to helping students (lots of office hours, good website etc).",
    "Yes.",
    "Chem 220 is orgo, and it's how you've heard it is - complex, with a lot of material. That said, if you keep up on the material, it's not that bad. The most important thing is to always read the textbook and put good effort into the problem sets. Professor Ziegler has midterm and final exams for four previous years he's taught the class posted online, and if you go through these tests, you'll be set for the exams. In short: working hard will get you a good grade.",
    "Take it if you must. Otherwise wait for a different professor.",
    "take it only if you have to.",
    "Ziegler is nice guy if you take the time to go to his office hours. He will also really help you out with the problem sets if you ask; the only problem is his explanations often assume lots of information we haven't covered and thus can't understand what he's saying. The problem sets are too hard for what they're worth of your grade. Learn E1\/E2\/SN1\/SN2 reactions before you're taught them in class or you won't have any idea what's going on--even learn them in the summer if you can. Everything else can be crammed before a test. The biggest problem with the class is its overly time-consuming for a reason that could be easily resolved. Ziegler posts old tests online but doesn't put the solutions up. Because everyone has access to them, you have to do them all or will be at a disadvantage. The problem is that even when you try to study, you may actually just be studying the wrong thing. You will spend most of your time before a test trying to figure out the solutions and then checking with others to see if you're right. It's not helpful if you don't completely know how to do something and also don't have the solution either. Also, at the review sessions, you go through the old tests but oftentoo quickly to actually get anything from them if you don't already know the material.",
    "Organic Chemistry itself is not a bad class. It's true that you need to study A LOT; it requires a lot of work and a lot of reading, and you tend to do better if you spend a lot of time on practice problems. That being said, the material is interesting and I actually enjoyed learning about it when I had time to do everything.My problem with this course is that I ended up teaching myself. Lecture was entirely useless - I went to every lecture until the first midterm, even though I never understood what the teacher was talking about and had trouble following his train of thought. I ended up doing better in the second half of the semester even though I didn't go to lecture at all. It was unfortunate, because Ziegler is a very nice person and very accomplished, but I didn't like his lecturing style.",
    "Take this course only if you are premed or a chem major.",
    "The class is not as bad as people make it out to be as long as you keep up with the material. The textbook really helps, sometimes even more than the lectures. Expect to memorize like crazy.",
    "I would recommend it if you need it. If you do the work and keep up it's a manageable class.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student. It is tough and it is extremely important to spend time working through the problem sets because that is the best way to learn Organic Chemistry. Also, be sure to attempt to read the chapter before class if you want to get anything out of the lecture.",
    "Organic chemistry is unlike any science I had taken prior to this course. While there is much memorization and finite answers like other science classes, orgo is a logic puzzle with multiple possible reaction schemes. This course is a useful introduction to this 'different' type of science and exams seemed to reflect the work you put in. I would recommend this course to another student--not just pre-med or science majors! The lecture was not particularly useful but the textbook was very well laid out and informative. If possible, get Andrew as a TA. He was awesome!",
    "If you're reading this, then that means you have to take orgo. It sucks, how else can you put it. But choose your poison, orgo is orgo and it'll suck regardless.",
    "I would say that it is a challenging course, but it is what you make of it. If you read the chapters thoroughly, do the practice problems throughout and at the end of each chapter, work through the problem sets, and do old problem sets and practice exams, you will do well in this course. But it is a time investment. Personally, it was my favorite class I have taken this semester, or at Yale (since this was my first semester).",
    "This is a difficult class to get used to. It is hard to get your mind into the organic chemistry language, but once you do it's more manageable than you might think. But it takes time and dedication to learn the material and even after learning it all you still might not do as well as you would like. Ziegler was also not the best teacher. I wish his lectures had been more organized. It would have helped more. Instead I mostly learned out of the book and from practice tests.",
    "Good course if interested in synthetic organic chemistry.",
    "It's tough, but you'll definitely learn a lot. If you get Ziegler, consider yourself very lucky and remember that he's there to help you succeed.",
    "You take orgo because you need to. Professor Ziegler was excellent and his tests were not that bad because he posts old tests online which are very similar to what he gives during the actual tests. Do the work, stay on top of problem sets and reading and you will be fine. Also, take the time to go to office hours because he is really nice and wants to help you.",
    "You should actually consider taking this course even if you don't ABSOLUTELY need it. It's interesting stuff and it's problem-solving skills. If you do need it, don't be so afraid of it! It's challenging, but there's lots of help if you choose to take advantage of it.",
    "Only take it if it's required for Pre-med or your major. And if you're struggling with it early on, go to the tutor. The Orgo tutor is extremely helpful.",
    "Take it only if you need it. Better than General Chemistry.",
    "Do it if you need to as a pre-med or are majoring in a science. It's not really a class you take for fun.",
    "Although I would never recommend Organic Chemistry to another student, it is necessary. I felt like I went through the entire course only half-understanding the material. There was tons of memorization required for the course, which I would learn for the test then promptly forget. However, this seems to be the norm for the subject, so I don't think much can be changed.",
    "this is orgo. if you have to take it, it doesn't matter what the review says, you're still going to take it. it's not as bad as people make it out to be. just do the reading and try to find friends to do the problem sets with. also, if you have a roommate or someone who has already taken orgo, ask them for help. they can usually do a really good job of explaining things you find confusing.",
    "You're likely taking the course because you have to as a requirement. If you can adjust your schedule such that you have someone who has better evaluations than Ziegler (Miller's supposed to be great), I would recommend it. He doesn't explain the material particularly well, his tests contain a ton of material for 50 minutes, so they reward memorization instead of understanding (that may be true of everyone), and the problem sets are pretty ridiculous and often require knowledge you don't yet have (apparently the residential college orgo tutor is helpful, but on your own they can take about 10 hours). That being said, the book is very good (you probably have to read it), and the material is not all that complicated conceptually and often interesting. There's no way around it, you have to put in the time, but it's all doable even with Ziegler.",
    "I would recommend it ONLY if the student is a chem major or pre-med. That is it.",
    "The course is frustrating, but not horrible."
