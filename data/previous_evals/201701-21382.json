    "I developed skills in connecting different books of the same theme across the course and finding parallels between them. I also became better at writing papers about literature and coming up with a comprehensive argument.",
    "I feel like English classes are always an opportunity to improve one's writing, and so this class is what you make of it in terms of picking up new writing insights\/techniques. Insights generally came from reading and discussing the works, and so pertain more to specific things within each text than an applicable set of skills.",
    "Discussion of written words and essay writing. An appreciation for the development of the epic.",
    "Incredible learning here. You learn to think deeply about what is happening in a text and how the texts relate together. I learned how to expand the depth of my paragraphs. I also feel like I learned some basic texts of the European Epic.",
    "Developing a literary argument, how to discuss thoughts clearly and cogently, how to read literature beyond the surface level",
    "an overview of european literary trafition, essay writing skills, ability to relate literature",
    "great",
    "You really learn about the literary significance of the journey and how literature has progressed from the epic to the novel overtime."

   "comments": [
    "While I thought that at times it would have been nice to have more time to read the books, in general the course was paced very well and included excellent material. I loved all the books and the discussion we had in class. I loved comparing the Odyssey to Ulysses, as well as the class where we discussed the three versions of Hell. The writing assignments were well structured and not too much work.",
    "Strengths: You read some incredible, important works. Discussions can be both a strength and a weakness. On one hand, one can always gain insight from the perspectives of others. Weaknesses: On the other hand, with texts so dense it can happen that discussion gets bogged down in themes, moments, etc. that you might not find particularly important\/interesting. Also, you read Ulysses.",
    "The course was very well taught and had great material. I don't see much room for improvement.",
    "really great. Professor Roffman needs a raise. The only thing I would suggest is encouraging students to engage outside of class. there are a lot of characters and a lot of plot events and it's hard to know what are the facts of each book.",
    "Strengths--great class-driven discussions Weaknesses--more detailed feedback on papers. It was not always apparent what revisions or changes should be made, since it often seemed like the draft was being read for the first time on the day of the meeting",
    "strength: material selection, class discussion, essay",
    "lots of work",
    "This course is amazing, but a wouldn't call it a complete coverage of the epic to novel journey. Gilgamesh and Beowulf are excluded from the syllabi, but I think they might help provide a real solid definition of what an epic is. While this course was great, I think it can easily just be called \"Tracing the Odyssey through Time\"."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. The books are all bucket list classics but many, such as Ulysses, would be difficult to read in a non-classroom setting. Additionally, Professor Roffman is an excellent professor who is extremely helpful in explaining the confusing aspects of the book in order to bring out the big picture. This is a class everyone who likes the classics should take.",
    "Yes, but only under certain circumstances: Firstly, you have to have the time. With the amount of reading in this course, it simply won't be worth your while unless you are able to do most of the reading. And again, DO NOT UNDERESTIMATE THE AMOUNT OF READING. That being said, these works are all important to the history and culture of the world, though you likely will not love them all.",
    "Absolutely! The material that you read and the arc of the course make it a fascinating learning experience. These are books that everyone should read.",
    "absolutely. positively. Especially with Professor Roffman. She is so attentive as a professor to your growth and she comes to class extraordinarily prepared. She's always willing to help. In the class you will learn how to think, and she will help you by always validating your thoughts in class-- never saying something is wrong but considering each contribution with thoughtfulness.",
    "This class is a ton of reading, which should be apparent from the syllabus. If you are up for it, then I would recommend because the texts covered are rather foundational and can be intriguing to study. I was not much of a literature person and did not quite realize what I was getting myself into so keeping up was stressful for me. I certainly did not enjoy the course in the moment, but upon completion I am satisfied by having studied such useful works. This just as a warning, but if you're ready and willing I would definitely recommend.",
    "Eh... the class discussions were great, but I think a class on epic literature could have been taken a bit further with some variety to the class structure, workshopping, etc.",
    "yes, but only if you have an interest in understanding literary history. the reading is a lot but rewarding.",
    "yes!"
