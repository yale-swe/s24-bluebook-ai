   "comments": [
    "Since the course is centered around operatic research and source study, I would certainly recommend it to fellow music historians and any other students interested in opera. It provides a good basis for handling 18th-century opera and opens up questions that can be asked concerning texted music in general.",
    "The class was a detailed look into a specific issue, with broader implications about genre and history. I would recommend the class to anyone working on the 18th century, since we did handle a wide range of materials outside of Vivaldi; I think it also gave us a good idea of how to approach other composers and other time periods."

   "comments": [
    "The course was especially helpful in creating a sense of how to do research on primary sources, which is an extremely valuable skill for a music history student. It touched upon subjects that could evolve into bigger projects, such as 'pasticcio' and the identity of 'the work.'",
    "The class gave me insight into an area of scholarship that I have limited exposure to but that I think will become essential to my work. I'm excited to think through an interdisciplinary lens, and I think that this class gave me a sense of how to do it."
