   "comments": [
    "It is a class that is not theoretical, but allows you to understand the ICC and the Security Council in practice. You get to host very interesting speakers. I would definitely recommend this course to any student planning a career in global justice or international relations.",
    "Real-world, the good and the bad.Innovative thinking about the future of global order.Take it.",
    "The beauty of this course is that, much like the beloved television show \"The Simpsons\", it speaks simultaneously to two audiences. First, the younger students are given an introduction into international law. Second, the older students get to apply what they know in a difficult context. I would definitely recommend this course to the older, wiser students in both the Jackson Institute and the Law School and I hope that more of the latter group become involved in this course.",
    "This course was a study of the Libyan conflict from an international perspective, covering UN, NATO, and ICC actions. Although a specific subject matter, we used this sitation as a spring board to discuss global order and potential for future actions. I would definitely suggest this class if you are interesting in this area.",
    "GLBL 737 isa course that focuses on the workings of the ICC. It is a great course if you want to understand how the ICC is operating in the world and how it can be used as a tool for global governance. Few people understand the intricacies of this new court, and taking a class on how it actually works was very useful in comprehending how it fits in the global scene. Professor Ocampo is very engaging and uses everyone's opinions in oder to push the envelope and create innovative thought. It is great to understand the process through which the court operates from begining to end; from the moment a situation arises to the point of referral to the ICC and the process of arrest. Understanding how different countries view the court, refer situations to it or see it as a political tool is important in understanding how the global scenario is changing. This is a great course taught by an outstanding professor, which brings guest speakers in and will push you to think outside the box.",
    "I would recommend the course to students who are looking for a dynamic course in which to discuss issues of international law in the current world situation as well as power dynamics in the UN Security Council. I would not recommend it to students who do not like simulations or lively conversations.",
    "I would recommend it. It's not particularly academic- something I'd rather take if I was an undergrad than a graduate student."

   "comments": [
    "It served to deepen my knowledge about the current international system. This is key to much of my course work\/research\/future profession.",
    "This course allowed me to see how the world is changing. Professor Ocampo stated this was a \"lab\" in which new ideas would be developed. It served its purpose. I am now able to see how the ICC operates within the current international relations institutional framework. I also can propose new ways in which it could be used. Professor Ocampo was great at guiding research and this will surely help me in the future if I want to pursue a career in international affairs. I learned that the world is constantly changing, cannot be constrained to the walls of theory, but that practice in a global apparatus is even twice as hard. This course contributed to forming a better internationalist who understands the global landscape and can comprehend the intricacies of the sovereign states as well as think beyond them to create global order through law.",
    "The experience of engaging and meeting Moreno-Ocampo significantly advance my knowledge of the ICC and its operations. It did not contribute towards my interests significantly."
