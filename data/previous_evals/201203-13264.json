    "Intro to Biomechanics covers the basic biomechanical principles that govern liquid flows in physiological systems as well as the mechanical principles of other aspects of the body. Humphrey does this by identifying five main balances - mass, linear momentum, energy, entropy inequality, and angular momentum (which we don't cover) - and derives them in detail to the point that we could all do the derivations by heart at the end. In summary, the class is not that much work because Humphrey doesn't believe in busy work, the material is fascinating (especially in the way it is presented) and the professor and TA are both really invested in the course.Cannot emphasize this enough - definitely look forward to this if you're a BME major and definitely take this even if you aren't!",
    "I would definitely recommend BENG 353 to another student, even if s\/he isn't majoring in BME.",
    "This course provides a background to biomechanics and its fundamental equations. I would recommend this class because it is not too much work outside of class. However be prepared to read\/write a couple papers. The midterm is not very difficult but the final is not easy.",
    "Take this class! Prof. Humphrey is awesome. Class is taught entirely from the chalkboard, and is mainly theoretical. Not much work during the semester, with a research paper on a topic of your choice at the end. Would highly recommend.",
    "Definitely. Even if you're not a BME major, the class is taught in such a way that anyone with a calculus background can appreciate the material. It's really well taught and Prof. Humphrey is one of Yale's best. The class is taught at the perfect pace, the homework is thoughtful and not busy work, and the exams are fair. You won't regret it!",
    "This was probably the best class I've taken at Yale. Prof. Humphrey is a GREAT teacher. His lectures are interesting and engaging, he gets to know everyone, and he has an incredibly deep understanding of the material. The workload was nicely balanced, the exams were challenging but fair, and Paolo the TA was great as well. On top of that, the material was really interesting and useful background for each of the three tracks in BME. Overall, an excellent course!",
    "If you're BME, you have to take it. Good news is that are even if you aren't into Biomechanics you'll have a hard time not enjoying the course. Prof. Humphrey is an amazing professor, work load isn't terrible, and you'll be engaged for the whole 75 minutes.",
    "First of all I would like to note that I am not a BME major, and decided to take this course on a whim, and I am so, so glad I made the choice. If this material interests you at all, I would recommend it.If you are any sort of science\/engineering\/mathematics major, and you have the room to do so, take this course. It is very manageable and extremely interesting. And the math is almost all exclusively the \"fun\" calculus that I have missed so much, the puzzle calculus of working with integrals and derivatives of many different variables, seeing how to play with the equation until it is a neat, understandable, usable form.",
    "Maybe it will be better next year, but as of right now I would not recommend it. Although the lectures are interesting and fly by, the class has no coherent structure or textbook and in the end seems to just be a bunch of random equations that we need to become familiar with. Perhaps if we had done legitimate, structured homework using the equations discussed in class instead of writing non-mathematical papers about the equations and their authors, things would have come together better. But currently the course doesn't transmit any single lesson of value.",
    "This is one of those classes where you nod your head during the class, understanding everything perfectly, and then as soon as you leave you can't explain anything you learned to anyone. Or rather, it's like that in the beginning, until you learn how to absorb the material. But there is definitely a learning curve to how to learn this material.",
    "An overview of many of the fundamental laws of fluid and solid mechanics as they apply to biological systems. You spend alot of time deriving these laws, but in a way that actually gives a better understanding of how and when to use them. You learn about these things on a theoretical level but also gain an understanding of how to apply them to actual experimental situations -- as prof. Humphrey's says, \"theory tells you what to measure and why\"",
    "Required, but luckily a very very good class. In my mind it felt more like a comprehensive introduction to mechanics and physics rather than \"bio\"mechanics, but maybe that's just me.",
    "This class was an introduction to the physics that explains biology, focusing on the mathematical derivations of these physics equations. The class was structured in a well-organized way, and Prof. Humphrey is an extremely smart man who always had pre-planned lectures that he gave without any notes! He also knew everyone\u00e2\u0080\u0099s name by the second week of class. I really enjoyed the research paper and felt like the exams were fair. Although it was a good class, I didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t particularly enjoy it because it focused on math derivations that I had to memorize, which isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t something that I like doing. I wish that the class had spent more time on the biological applications of these equations instead.",
    "It's a tough class but as long as one stays on top of things, one will do just fine. It is definitely not a class to take if one is looking for an easy class since understanding in many different areas of the sciences and maths are needed. But, overall, I think it is a very rewarding class to take since the knowledge one obtains will be useful in the future as an engineering student.",
    "You should take this class. Even if you're not interested in the material, everyone should have a professor like Humphrey before they graduate.",
    "Interesting material, relatively light course load, and Humphrey is a very dedicated and interesting professor - you will enjoy it whether you are taking it as a requirement or as an elective.",
    "great class. definitely recommend it",
    "I would recommend Biomechanics to both BME students and general pre-med students alike. I think it should even be included in the MCDB curriculum. The level of math needed is doable for almost any student, while providing more concrete basis for many observations discussed in other biology classes.",
    "This is a fantastic course with a fantastic professor. You learn so much in a way that's almost impossible to forget, except for maybe on the exams. This is one of those rare science classes that are actually great, and you should definitely take it. The bad part is that this class will require you to go back to old school calculus and diff eq roots, and you will feel bad about yourself for not remembering that kind of stuff. But, it's fun to try. Take the course.",
    "If you're comfortable with physics, very good course. Comprehensively covers a lot of theoretical physics\/mechanics that are more relevant to the practical side of things, with some biomedical examples thrown in."
