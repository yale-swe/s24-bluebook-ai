    "I wholeheartedly recommend this class. Just know that it is what you make of it, and the stories you read are really interesting so make sure you read them.",
    "Interesting class that talks about preeminent Brazilian authors.",
    "As writing credits go, this is one of your better options. Really good readings, a very likable and usually engaging professor, very little pressure to know the readings inside and out during class. Depending on the class size it could be a seminar or a lecture, not really sure which Jackson designed it to be. Jackson is really good about giving you opportunities to turn in drafts and get his feedback before sending your final copy, so with a little work it's not difficult to do well on the three 5-8 page papers. Take home final was very chill this year. Also, take this class if you have any interest in Brazil\/going to Brazil, because Jackson knows more about Brazilian history, literature and culture and has more Brazilian contacts than anyone else I've met in the Portuguese department.",
    "This class surveys some of the most notable Brazilian literature from the past two centuries or so, ranging from poetry to theater to short stories to novels. The literature itself is INCREDIBLY interesting, but the class suffers because Professor Jackson -- although he is very knowledgeable in this subject -- isnot a very engaging lecturer. As far as work goes, there are two 4-6 page papers and one 6-8 page paper, and you have to turn in a draft for each one. There is also a final take-home exam. If you know how to write, this class will be fairly easy."
