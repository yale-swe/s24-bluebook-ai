   "comments": [
    "Very good",
    "Strengths:-on the onset, seems very applicable to decisions you might make in a healthcare setting-goes through a good range of probability and excel modeling for those who haven't studied it beforeWeaknesses:-after taking the class, it feels like the topics\/decisions covered were much more applicable to a policy setting and less relevant for healthcare management--> improve by adding more examples of decisions that healthcare administrators or consultants might make",
    "The instructor is so great: smart, entertaining, knowledgable, but the course itself is largely driven by his lectures alone. The homework is not graded, so there is no feedback on assignments no supplemental work for the course beyond a once-a-week lecture. It is really, really critical to beef up this course, perhaps creating a weekly section with more rigorous homework assignments.",
    "Interesting class",
    "Interesting and well-taught.",
    "Overall good class, but I definitely expected to learn a lot more. It didn't help that the lectures were in Winslow.",
    "Strengths- material is very interesting and I'd like to learn more about it in a different way. Weaknesses- I don't think the lectures added much to the course, and it was difficult to figure out how to learn the material independently. More practice problems or a different class format (maybe a review section?) might help...",
    "The course was good. There were so many disruptions at the end of the semester that it felt a little disjointed, but I think I learned a good background on the subject. I wish we had more examples for each of the topics because it was all too new for me to have questions about a topic so that I could understand it more. I also wish that it was not as focused on clinical decision making and wish it was more about different policy or intervention choices, it would just make it easier to know how to do analysis in many different situations.",
    "It was a good introduction to the topic. I would have liked to read and really deeply discuss a couple more papers from the recent literature that really explored the topics (and maybe a good, recent review paper of cost effectiveness research in public health). The course moved a bit slowly for my tastes and I think this course is ideal for a kind of final project instead of final in which one could actually do some kind of research, playing with MCMC, playing with published data, or something else. I would have also been curious to hear more about the intersection of cost effectiveness research (the \"dry numbers\"), human psychology\/behavioral economics (\"reality\"\/\"perceptions\"), and actual policy decisions (eg social welfare functions, how the different sides are integrated, how policy is actually made, and what the role for cost-effectiveness research is for academics and policy makers).",
    "strength: interesting topics, very practicalweakness: didn't see any",
    "Good class, but feel like I didn't have a class the second half of the semester.",
    "strengths: awesome course. very applicable to most areas of public healthweaknesses: rushed material due to storm",
    "strengths: very organized and applicableweakness: more problem sets to work on, more homework",
    "Since this is now a required class for HPM, it is needs to be restructured so it caters to the HPM students. While the concepts remain the same, I am not interested in clinical\/medical decision making and the reading is too dense to understand if it doesn't have a policy application.The class needs to have more TFs and it would be better with a discussion section. The instructor doesn't really teach the material. Therefore, if you don't have enough knowledge to teach yourself, you are lost and in that case, it has no value. If a class is going to be required, the program needs to commit to making sure it is well taught and suited for its students.",
    "N\/a",
    "The topics discussed during the course were very motivating and well prepared. Each class included examples and additional resources. The paste of the class was rather fast and instructor often engaged students into discussions.In my opinion the midterm and final exams were much more difficult as compared to examples provided during lectures.",
    "very good skills learned,need more application of those skills during class",
    "I was an active listener in the course, but I really struggled with the midterm. This made me re-evaluate what I actually did learn from the instructor. When I was going over his slides and my notes, I found that I had to re-read all of the readings to get a sense of what I learned. I am not sure why that was for the midterm, but the final was better.",
    "Strength: the course material is very interesting and unique. To do well in the course requires good quantitative and logic skills. It is a very good practice.Weekness: the mid-term is very hard, which I don't know it is necessary or not. Also, on classesV2 within the folder for class notes, the material is a little disorganized. It will be much better if the professor include unified file names.",
    "Very passive, also not what I imagined cost effectiveness to be given I worked in the area for years; too theoretical and math based. Would have preferred a more financial perspective.",
    "I appreciate the fact that the homework was not graded for correctness; but rather it was graded for completion\/effort. Since the homework problems were only discussed after the homework was due, this homework policy was appreciated.",
    "Strengths:1. Skills based class- the content covered in the course is very applicable to real world problems2. Despite being a complex course, the content is very well structured",
    "So, so hard, almost impossibly hard. Felt more like a struggle than an invigorating challenge.",
    "This was an awesome course! The use of case write-ups to discuss the material is one of its strengths. Overall, no major weaknesses, but I think a couple additional sessions might have been helpful to cover all the material.",
    "The course had a reasonable work load, and I enjoyed the weekly homework assignments. I liked the format of the course, which involved self-learning and application of concepts followed by clarification and explanation by the instructor.",
    "This is a great course for students who want to learn about cost-effectiveness analysis or medical decision-making. The concepts are taught in an enjoyable, interactive way, and Dr. Paltiel really makes an effort to show the utility of these concepts. That said, this class is only an introduction and really does not go into depth on any of these concepts. In addition, the class can move somewhat slowly at times, but the information is useful and it is a really enjoyable class to attend. I really enjoyed this class.",
    "This course provided an excellent overview of cost effectiveness analysis in both methodology and theory\/practicality of the methods. It was extremely interesting and useful for any student.",
    "I don't have much criticism. Loved this course.",
    "Great!",
    "The midterm was too hard.",
    "It's a very interesting and helpful course.The professor is a very good lecturer.",
    "Excellent introduction to cost-effectiveness analysis.",
    "Interesting lectures and material which seems like they will apply to my future career, however too much emphasis on clinical aspects of CEA and not many PH policy\/CEA scenarios discussed or presented. As a requirement for HPM students, this course should have a closer connection to policy issues.",
    "This course is amazing. It was a lot of work but it was interesting and I learned a lot of things that I think will be good for my professional career.",
    "I feel some methods to do the cost-effectiveness will be very useful in practice",
    "Great course. Good introduction to decision analysis",
    "Strengths:Dr. Paltiel is a great speaker.He really cares about teaching.He provides a great explanation of the principles behind cost-effectiveness and medical decision making as well as really interesting examples of studies that employ the principles.Weaknesses:None.",
    "-Lectures were clear-Readings were helpful-The class moved a little slowly and I believe more material could have been covered. Maybe an advanced second course could be offered in this topic-I felt like I gained enough knowledge to be able to grasp the cost-effectiveness literature, but not enough to do cost-effectiveness research-Midterm questions were good, but the way the points were distributed were kind of strange (i.e. taking off almost all the points on the question for a small error, and only taking off a few points for a bigger error on another question)",
    "The course provides a strong foundation for decision trees, cost effective analysis, etc. The lectures support the self-learning required to master the subject.",
    "While the second half of the course was cut shorter due to several class cancellations, it felt that the second half was the material we should have covered in more depth. While decision trees and analysis seem foundational, for future health policy work additional time spent on CE would have been extremely helpful.",
    "Strengths--I liked that we did the homework before we actually learned the material because--although it took too long--after struggling to figure out how to do it, I learned from my mistakes. I like that they provided us with \"student notes\" for each class aside from the power points. The professor made the material sound fun even though it is so dry.Weaknesses--I would have liked to receive feedback in our homework assignments and not just get a grade from them. I did not like the instructions for the third question in the midterm. It seemed unfair to have such a tricky question and be told not to spend too much time on it.To improve--change the lecture time, from 5 to 7 it is very tiring to pay attention through it.",
    "The course is very helpful for us to learn the basic concepts and principles of cost effectiveness analysis\u00e3\u0080\u0082 The instructor is very helpful and has a very special teaching style. And he is very sensitive of students' reaction and can give a response very soon.",
    "This course was simply excellent. It introduced all of the tools in cost-effectiveness analysis and decision making that public health professionals need to evaluate evidence and an intro for using it in research.I wish we had more help in applying some of the models, even if its just as an introduction to using excel for this type of analysis",
    "I found this course to be one of the most valuable I've taken at Yale. I can see some of the issues that other people have had with this class, but I found it to be well organized, interesting, and useful.",
    "Great lecturer. Interesting and valuable topics",
    "This course is a great introduction to cost effectiveness analysis and policy modeling more generally. It will help you think about a number of issues like an analyst, and give you a greater appreciation for and ability to read analysis based on these methods. It also does a great job tempering these ideas with an understanding that cost-effectiveness is not and should not be the only driving force behind decision-making, and the exams and problem sets push students to really think about those larger issues while working through analytic methods.",
    "I like this class. Learn about cost-effective analysis although I'm not sure about its applicability in my career.",
    "Super interesting material, and the professor really makes it come alive.",
    "Strengths: Great topic and tool to learn; Excellent instructorWeaknesses: Would be great if we could learn how to use software along with the theory",
    "great course",
    "My favorite course. My favorite professor. Awesome.",
    "The course was very good. Lectures were engaging and applied the the material to public health examples. The midterm exam was very long, but the final was much more reasonable.",
    "Best class of the termOften had time to start and finish the homework the day of class. This still left plenty of time to understand the concepts.Amazing class and it is very relevant.The Prof, David Paltiel is able to take a possibly difficult and dry subject and make is exciting and very easy to understand.You definitely get the tools you need to expand on this knowledge-set later on.Even if you go to class tired, listening to the prof speak will wake you up.Weakness:wish we had more practice problems",
    "I enjoyed this course and the material that was presented.",
    "Strengths: Dynamic instructor, excellent TA, some very interesting examples and applications of the material in-course. For the most part, the instructor addressed students requests and responded to student input on the course.Weaknesses: The instructor catered to students who understand the material well, often leaving the rest of us behind during lectures and DEFINITELY on the midterm. The midterm was the single most difficult exam I have taken at YSPH, and did not accurately reflect the material that I felt I had learned. For me, past about week 5 I benefited very little from going to lecture as the material was presented very quickly and often in a confusing manner. The texts were sometimes helpful and sometimes not. The course could benefit from a textbook (or multiple textbooks if need be), as students need something more comprehensive to refer to than single articles.",
    "- Little background or additional practice is provided",
    "This was a good course, but I feel like it should have prereqs (as it did before). I felt unprepared for the course simply because I did not have any statistical background.",
    "The cases were interesting and helpful for practicing what we learned in class. The lecture slides were very informative and easy to refer back to.Having an additional exam or more cases would have been helpful."

    "She was excellent. She helped me a lot when I struggled through this class.",
    "Never interacted with the TA",
    "all clear in class so no need for contaction with TA",
    "I didnt interact with her",
    "Kiersten.Amazing TA. Took time to explain concepts. Very patient, and very knowledgeable.",
    "Strengths: EXCELLENT grasp of the material, friendly and cared about students, willing to meet outside of office hours and outside of class, offered clear and well-organized explanations for difficult materialWeaknesses: none? The only thing I can think of is that her regular office hours were at a very inopportune time.",
    "TA does a much better job at explaining and teaching the material."

   "comments": [
    "Yes",
    "This is a great class to learn basics of probability and excel modeling for decision-making. I however would not recommend it to SOM students as these topics are covered in Probability& Statistics as well as Spreadsheet Modeling.",
    "Yes, amazing class, due to the professor, Dr. Paltiel, who is brilliant, but I wanted more: a weekly section with the TA to go over material beyond the once-weekly-lecture. I felt as I did more self-teaching in this class than others, that is, since we met only once a week, had assignments that weren't graded, the course didn't ask too much of me and then the midterm arrived and you had to cram even though it was a take home. People did well on the test, but with better use of the TA, we could have gotten more in-depth, covered more material or gotten additional support for understanding the weekly lecture.",
    "I believe there are some useful lesson we could learn from this course.",
    "Good intro to Cost Effective Analysis, but you'll have to spend a lot of timelearning the material on your own.",
    "It is a good class if you are interested in the topic. The examples are very clinically focused, which is fine since you still learn the frameworks, it just won't be as directly related to topics we are used to studying.",
    "I'd recommend it. I think anyone interested in public health should have some idea about how cost-effectiveness is calculated and what its role in public health might be. The instructor is great too.",
    "very worthwhile and practical, it's a must-take course at YSPH!",
    "Good class, would recommend.",
    "Yes, would recommend",
    "I would recommend it. Good course, gives you a good background of C\/E analysis but it is not too in-depth",
    "I would not recommend it unless it is required or restructured.",
    "N\/a",
    "Great course to learn about decision making, cost-effectiveness especially in terms of public health applications. Very well prepared lectures, and attention-grabbing examples. Overall verygood.",
    "great skills learned, need a little more application to perfect them",
    "Helpful framework. Recommended.",
    "It is one of the best courses at YSPH. Definitely recommend to take it.",
    "No.",
    "The class provides students with the basic knowledge of cost-effectiveness analysis through the construction of probability trees and the calculation of posterior probabilities. The class is self-taught and there are no good textbooks other than the text that the professor provides. Although the class entails calculating conditional probabilities, a student who may not be strong in math should not be dissuade to take this class.",
    "Great course! It is a must take for every student since it provides a perspective on how to think through problems.",
    "Super interesting material, but super hard course. Caused many tears.",
    "One of the funnest and most interesting classes I've taken. This will definitely make you think about how you make decisions and how to compare different health programs\/policies. I would absolutely recommend it to other students.",
    "This class teaches students who to think from multiple perspectives. The homework is fun. It involves case studies, and problems are similar to brain teasers.This class will boost your IQ and make you smarter.",
    "Good course on the basic concepts of cost-effectiveness analysis. Before the course, I had no idea what this even meant, and I now feel comfortable reading papers on the subject.",
    "This is a great class for students who want to learn about cost-effectiveness analysis and decision-making. Although it is just an introductory class, you learn about the basics of conducting a cost-effectiveness analysis and the cases and exams are very oriented towards having you apply your knowledge. Dr. Paltiel is also a wonderful teacher who makes the information applicable and fun. I would strongly recommend this course to students.",
    "One of my favorite courses so far. I just love the instructor. Also, the material is interesting and gets you thinking about how you would assess information regarding a decision to make the best, most cost effective one. Fantastic.",
    "I highly recommend this course it is a different way to approach public health that is not taught in any other classes.",
    "It's ok. I don't know why this course is a requirement. I don't know that I'll be using this information in the future. The midterm is worth a lot and is challenging, but the grading is fair.",
    "YES",
    "Take it! Great introduction to cost-effectiveness analysis.",
    "Interesting overview to CEA. I would recommend the course, but suggest adding an optional weekly or bi-weekly discussion section for those who struggle with the material and accelerated pace of the lectures.",
    "I would recommend that students take this course, it entertaining, challenging and relevant to public health all at once. An amazing course overall!",
    "Strongly recommend",
    "A great course to expand the way in which you think about problems involving cost and outcome. Not too much work, lectures are engaging, and exams are all take home.",
    "This class teaches some great ways to think about health policy and decision making. Dr. Paltiel also introduces some complicated methods (Bayesian Stats, Incremental costs, etc) in a very digestible form. While I had been introduced to these methods in other classes, I really didn't understand them until he presented them(even though health policy is not exactly what I am best at.)",
    "I would definitely recommend this course",
    "This course has great real-world applications. I would recommend it, but would also warn students to be prepared to do a lot of independent learning. There is a lot of material to examine, but the benefits of this knowledge is definitely worth it!",
    "The course will improve your understanding of probability and cost and the factors required in cost-benefit decision making.",
    "An interesting course that will get you thinking about outcomes differently. It's geared more toward Med students than MPH policy students though.",
    "Useful course and teaches you to think in ways that you might not have done so before.",
    "Yes, definitely. Both the course and the instructor is very helpful.",
    "Useful for students in all disciplines. Not too hard, worthwhile, for sure.",
    "This is a fun and somewhat challenging introduction to cost effectiveness analysis, which will help you apply Econ and statistical methods to decision making.",
    "I would recommend it",
    "Professor Paltiel makes the class really fun to go to. Material is generally really interesting as well.",
    "Definitely recommend this course. One of the best at YSPH for student in any concentration.",
    "Great course!",
    "Awesome. Take it. Only complaint I have is with the grading of the tests: they're graded by the TA in a bit of a formulaic manner. More than one way to skin a cat and in one instance the TA didn't recognize this (though Paltiel did).",
    "The course gives a different perspective for evaluating programs, interventions, etc. by cost effectiveness. It shows how types of analysis are applied to public health. May be more suited to policy and management students, but I would recommend it for students in all divisions.",
    "once a week lectures5 or so assignments - each take about 1.5hours at max to do after the reading is donetake home midterm - you have a week to completetake home final - you have 2 days to complete.Midterm harder than the final.Overall the best course I had in the Fall.",
    "Great overview course to cost-effectiveness. I would recommend this course to another student.",
    "I would recommend it for students who are focusing on management skills, but would not recommend it as a good way to master the skill of cost-effectiveness analysis. While it helped me think differently about public health problems, and did provide me some new skills (decision trees, review of probability, markov modeling, incremental cost-effectiveness analysis, etc.), I do not feel confident applying these skills in a work setting after taking this course.",
    "This course is a good introduction to cost effectiveness. No programming skills are required or taught. I would recommend the course since it provides a strong enough understanding of the topic so that students can critically evaluate articles and other published cost effectiveness analyses."
