   "comments": [
    "I recommend this class to anyone who may think they like studying people. If you're a people watcher, take this course. It's pretty much a guaranteed A or B.",
    "It can be a bit dry at times but all the guest lecturers are very insightful. Take the time to get to know Prof. Anderson on a personal level. He is AWESOME and has some great stories.",
    "DO IT. You will not regret it.",
    "The course has a lot of interesting readings and guest speakers, but was disorganized. The syllabus changed often in terms of requirements and which readings to prepare for each week.",
    "It's a class about field work, and you read some really important texts in sociology. But more important to know is that Prof. Anderson is a character. He's also sort of the man, and if you're in the major you gotta take one of his classes. Mostly he just talks about his own work and experiences. There's not too much work though, just the books.",
    "You read a lot of urban ethnographies, and focus on the \"chicago school.\" There are a lot of guests, some of which are better than others. Take it if urban ethnography actually interests you, especially those focused on African Americans. If not, it won't be very exciting.",
    "A course about how to conduct ethnography. I found the reading and discussion of the course readings very beneficial even though I do not plan to conduct ethnographic research in the future."
