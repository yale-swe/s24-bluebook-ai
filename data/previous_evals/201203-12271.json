   "comments": [
    "Basically we read three authors: Lysias, Plato, and Herodotus. It's nice to have that variety, and it goes at a very manageable pace. Definitely take it!",
    "This course provides a good context to practices one's Greek reading skills, while working with some important grammatical and syntactical constructions in context.",
    "I would definitely recommend L3 Greek to anybody studying the language because this was the first course in which I felt as if I engaged with actual Greek literature. It was very rewarding to be able to read Herodotus in the original. Difficulty-wise, I found that Greek 131 didn't differ much from the latter part of Greek L2.",
    "I would certainly recommend this course to another student. I would summarize it as an opportunity to read the Attic prose and dialogue styles of Lysias and Plato, as well as the Ionic dialect of Herodotus. It is an excellent introduction to classical Greek.",
    "I would recommend the course.",
    "AG 131 is an introduction to prose through selective reading of 3 texts of differing genres. The texts become increasingly more difficult, but help one to build vocabulary and familiarity with syntactical structures. Grammar, narrative\/rhetorical devices, themes, etc. are all discussed. This is a very good introduction to prose, and a good stepping stone for moving on to more difficult material.I would highly recommend this course!"
