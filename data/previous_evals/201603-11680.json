   "comments": [
    "The class is paced well and the assignments are engaging. Professor Alexandrov was fantastic.",
    "It moves very quickly and it is expected of the student to be on top of the material, if not ahead. It is structured to teach a good basis of Spanish, and the material is mostly relevant to everyday speech and use.",
    "Strength: The homework closely followed the material which helped cement the knowledge Weakness: Class could be fairly boring because the activities were the same everyday",
    "Very structured, a lot of evaluations.",
    "There were no weaknesses. It was taught at a good pace and Professor Alexandrov is one of the best instructors I've ever had.",
    "This course was very well taught and the concepts were clear and explained well. However, I think the course is a little too fast paced for someone who has never taken a Spanish course before.",
    "The textbook is set up in a poor order in which to learn things.",
    "The layout or order of the course is a bit poor. We were learning things too quickly and skipping over some basics I thought should have been taught first.",
    "My Professor, Sybil Alexandrov, was awesome. She encouraged a lot of engagement and was really able to get us to speak Spanish while we were in the classroom (whether or not we were talking about what we were supposed to be working on!). I think the grading is, by necessity, a little arbitrary (language is just subjective like that), but since that's the case, department policies about grades and work should trust the teachers more and be more flexible.",
    "The course moves very quickly for a level one language course and should spend more time when introducing new subjects.",
    "The course was very well structured and thorough. One way to make it better would be to make the departmental policy of not allowing students to make up in-class compositions without a Dean's Excuse more flexible--some students may have personal issues that prevent them from getting Dean's Excuses but are still willing and able to make up in-class compositions, and that should be accounted for."

    "A great way to fulfill your language requirement.",

    "Yes the course is excellent introduction to a new language.",
    "Yes, for any student wanting to learn Spanish. I'd also recommend Professor Alexandrov.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course",
    "Yes, i would although you have to have a genuine want to learn the language rather than just get the credit.",
    "Yes, but it would be extremely helpful to have some background in Spanish first.",
    "If you are interested in learning Spanish then yes i would.",
    "I would only recommend this course to a student who has taken Spanish before, it moves very quickly and is hard to grasp without prior knowledge.",
    "I'd definitely recommend it, especially with Sybil Alexandrov."
