   "comments": [
    "Through reading the work of many amazing writers and getting feedback from my professor, I learned a lot about how to write more effectively with more force and emotion. I learned about specific techniques for improving my writing and also got more of a feel for my own writing voice.",
    "I gained an appreciation for the thought and the craft that goes into the essays in read in my everyday life. The modern essay feels much weightier and more significant now that I've taken 120. I also learned about and became familiar with the myriad techniques and strategies writers use to make their points.",
    "I learned so much in this course! I felt like my writing skills definitely improved a lot, especially since we wrote a huge variety of pieces, from personal essays to critical criticisms to humor. I learned a huge deal about the editing process, and about deciding what works well and what doesn't. I also learned how to read different literary nonfiction pieces with a more critical eye.",
    "I think we learned how to become better writers and accept and give constructive criticism.",
    "I developed non-fiction writing skills, including how to consider tone, rhythm, content, form, and style. I also developed text analysis skills, particularly in regards to reading essays.",
    "This course helped me develop my skills in reading an essay for structure and craft, and also helped me begin to hone my skills as an essay writer. I also learned about a variety of topics covered by the essays we read, from coffee and lobster to traveling in China and Egypt to parental relationships.",

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The small seminar format of this course and my amazing professor (Lynda Paul) made this course dynamic and interesting. I think it could be useful to get peer feedback on more than one of the five essays, though.",
    "A strength of the course was the diversity of my classmates' perspectives. Some analyzed through the lenses of race, gender, and sexuality while others stuck strictly to the text, doing close analysis. I learned a lot from my classmates in the class. Another strength was Prof. Paul's theoretical background. She was able to connect class discussions to larger questions of truth and authenticity. The class could be improved by deeper, more explicit consideration of the historical and theoretical contexts surrounding the texts and texts in general. There were a lot of theoretical issues which we encountered and were forced to put to the side by the pace of the class. To this end, there probably should have been fewer readings.",
    "One of the best parts of this course is that each student gets their essay workshopped in front of the whole class. It seems intimidating, but it's actually very helpful to have so many different perspectives and that much feedback about your piece -- I felt like I was more conscious of my writing after my workshop session. It's also really helpful to read your classmates' writing because you learn how to tell what works and what doesn't in a piece.",
    "I found a lot of the material engaging, but I think we needed to read more of each genre before we began writing the essays.",
    "Personally, I would have liked to do some more writing in the course. I found that the opportunities to write were very helpful in getting ideas out, and I felt that I grew significantly at each chance, but there were only 5 chances to do so, 4 without the last essay. I also would have enjoyed a more significant focus on craft and structure in the class, thinking about different strategies to emulate in our own essays.",
    "The strengths of this course lie in the assigned work (reading and composing essays). The class time itself often felt too long. When we had workshops, it was great, but I don't think we had to spend so much time discussing the readings."

    "I would definitely recommend English 120 to any student in any major at Yale! This course strengthens your writing in a way that would be useful for any discipline.",
    "YES! Take this course no matter what you're interested in. You read essays about all sorts of things, from colonial encounters to the ambushes of family life.",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend this course! I'm really glad I took this course because my writing abilities improved *a lot* over the semester and I feel much more comfortable writing about a variety of different topics now. There's usually a draft of an essay due almost every week, which seems like a lot, but it's worth it to help improve your writing. The readings are super interesting and about a lot of different topics so the class feels fresh each time!",
    "The level of work was really high but I don't think I would have gotten the same thing out of another Yale course.",
    "I would recommend this course to any student. I never really considered myself a writer, but this class made the task accessible and fun. It was an amazing class to take because it was almost a break from my other schoolwork, the readings were fun to do and the class was always engaging.",
    "Absolutely!",
    "I would recommend this course. I think it is interesting and relevant and can be enjoyed by people of all backgrounds. It was engaging and fun and I felt like I knew my classmates well at the end, and most importantly, it felt like my writing was seriously improving with each draft. This course made me more serious about being an English major.",
    "I would because I think it's a very fun way to get a writing credit and the course content is engaging. But the essays are back-to-back and you have to produce a lot of work, so I would only recommend it to someone who enjoys writing."
