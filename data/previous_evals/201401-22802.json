    "This class covers presents an overview of some major topics in German history since 1648 and the intellectual traditions developed to make sense of them. If one enjoys reading and discussing Kant, Hegel, and Habermas, then this class can be quite rewarding. For one less accustomed to studying history with an emphasis on political theory and philosophy, it can be rather challenging.",

    "Thanks to this class on German history, I now see parallels and themes within my own field that I otherwise would have missed.",
    "Yes, this course tremendously improved my familiarity with German historiography and my facility with using relevant terms. I have definitely honed intellectual skills with this subject area and look forward to further academic work on this. Though it has not provided much direct help for my thesis, I believe myself better able to see the broader context for it."
