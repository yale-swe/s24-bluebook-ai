    "Probably the best lab class I've taken at Yale. The electron microscopes are AWESOME, and you have a lot of autonomy in your work. Beware though - this class is a LOT of work - you simply CANNOT save the paper until the last minute, lest you face the wrath of Barry. But Barry is awesome.",
    "This class was well taught and organized, but it is significantly more than 0.5 credits worth of work. The strength of this course is that it is actually interesting -- you have the opportunity to learn a really awesome technique and study a mouse organ of your choice. However, these techniques can be VERY difficult to master and you will never get it on your first try. It takes a tremendous amount of patience. You must also be willing to dedicate time out of class to this lab, which can be a burden. I would only recommend this class to a peer if he\/she is willing to put in a significant amount of time to this lab. You should also be prepared for the 30 page paper at the end. Nevertheless, this class can be very rewarding.",
    "This was a great lab. A lot of fun and you get to look at cool cellular structures. It is a very specific technique, but a powerful one.",
    "The Lab in Electron Microscopy is an excellent course and I would encourage anyone interested in biology to take it. The general outline of the course is as follows: In the beginning, you choose and organ from a list of mouse organs and you are given a sample of tissue to prepare. Throughout the majority of the semester you cut thin sections of your sample to image with the electron microscope. At the end of the semester, you take the images you've taken throughout the semester and use them to write a long paper. This course requires time outside of the scheduled class time, but if you keep up with it the work load is completely manageable and fairly flexible. The paper at the end is difficult, so get started early, but your final product is something you will be proud of. I took this course because it was something that I had never done and may never get to do again, and I certainly do not regret it.",
    "Definitely recommended! It's not the most time consuming lab ever because most of it is done in lab. You do have to go in extra every week, but it's not overwhelming by any means.",
    "One of the best courses I've taken at Yale. Piekos makes the course. He is straightforward, experienced, and no-BS, while also being very encouraging to those who are struggling. From day one the course is solely oriented toward the final project, and that gives the course an overall structure and direction that was so valuable and rare in biology labs. It is a lot of work, more than most 1 credit classes, so don't take it if you have a heavy semester otherwise. But if you can fit it in somewhere, please do.",
    "EM lab is an upper level lab that focuses on imaging of organ systems. It will really test both your technical and conceptual knowledge of histology and biology. The class is chill yet you gain so much from it. I would highly recommend this class to anyone needing to take a lab class. Barry is great, the TA's are great, the subject is great. There's only two papers and one presentation so work hard on it, but there's no weekly pedantic assignments for the sake of having weekly assignments which other lab courses at Yale have. This is one of the best class I've taken, and I've taken 26 classes for the MCDB major.",
    "Great lab course; I would absolutely recommend it. The work that you get to do in lab is really awesome and it is structured such that it feels as if you were working on a structural study without any previous knowledge about what you're working on so its sort of a discovery. However, make sure you can make extra time available for this class because it does take up an extra 2 hours per week. And start the paper early; it takes a long time. Its a pity this lab isn't a whole credit even though it takes so much time and incorporates a lot of skills.",
    "If you're looking for another half-credit lab course and your schedule is nottoo full, this is definitely a course to consider. You'll be working one one tissue, such as small intestine or retina, for the entire semester, conducting every part of the electron microscopy process from initial sample preparation to sectioning to imaging and analysis. Barry, the instructor, is almost always available to answer questions.The final report for this course is substantial, at 25-30 pages long (though at least 9 of those pages will be images). However, it is manageable if spaced out over a week or so of work time, and it is definitely something that you will be proud of at the end of the course.",
    "Electron Microscopy Lab is an exceptionally well-designed and well-taught elective laboratory course. In the first half of the semester, you learn everything you need to know in order to perform transmission electron microscopy, from harvesting your assigned organ from a mouse (on the second day of class) to chemical fixation, embedding, block trimming, knifemaking, ultramicrotomy (sectioning), staining, light microscopy, and electron microscopy. The lab manual is extremely helpful, and Barry Piekos is an exceptional lab instructor. He is knowledgeable and experienced both in electron microscopy itself and in teaching it to people with no prior background in it. The expectations are clearly laid out throughout the course, and by mid-semester, the class transitions such that Barry and the TA\u0092s switch from teaching to providing merely a supporting role, and each student then becomes responsible for taking the lead and the initiative in seeing his or her project through to completion. At the beginning of the semester, you\u0092re assigned one of the organs in the mouse, and you spend the entire semester on that organ, so it\u0092s a great way to become intimately familiar with the anatomy, physiology, and cell structure and function of a specific organ system. You write an 8-10 page introductory paper in the first half of the semester, which is good because it forces you to do some independent research on your organ and become familiar with its structure and cell ultrastructure just before the point in the semester when you begin to get light micrographs and electron micrographs on your samples, and the intro paper counts as the intro of your final paper. The only other requirements of the course are an epic final paper and a final presentation, both during reading week. Instead of writing menial lab reports every week, you\u0092re required to come in an extra 2 hours or so each week on your own time, beginning a few weeks into the semester, in order to work on your samples and work on the electron microscopes. If you stay on top of the course, if you consistently put in the required extra hour or two every week throughout the whole semester, and if you begin working up each TEM image as soon as you get it on the scope, then the final paper is not a problem at all. If you procrastinate and wait until the last two weeks of the semester to do all your work, however, you\u0092re just screwed, because the final paper is probably the longest and most intensive final project I\u0092ve ever had to do at Yale (working up your TEM images takes as much time as writing the text itself!). That said, it\u0092s incredibly rewarding to work up, analyze, write about, discuss, and present something of that length based entirely on work you did and images you produced over the course of the semester."
