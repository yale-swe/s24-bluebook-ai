    "You'll be taking this class to fulfill the history major's senior essay requirement, so you don't have much of a choice about whether or not you will take it. In writing a paper of this size and caliber, I feel like I can now say I can write and that I have gotten noticeably better at writing since coming to Yale. More importantly, all other assignments at school have paled in comparison. Especially if you set a few times each week to work on the essay, things will go very well for you, and you'll have a good experience.",
    "Start working on it early.",
    "It's a painful agonizing and painstaking experience. When you are done on April 5, the relief will wash over you like a cool shower in the middle of a scorching desert.",
    "You have to complete the senior essay to graduate, but don't look on it simply as a requirement. It is a chance to make a serious intellectual contribution to the field of history, so take that chance. I strongly recommend finding an adviser who will force you to stay on task, and will be willing to make advising your essay a priority. It's important to make a good start in the Fall, but if you're coming into the Spring feeling behind, don't worry. You can catch up - it takes hard work, but after having fallen far behind in the Fall, I ended up producing an essay that was nominated for several prizes, so it's definitely possible.",
    "Are you really reading this? If you're a senior history major, you have to take this whether you want to or not. I would recommend using your writing tutor to check your actual paper far in advance. And going to Docuprint for binding.",
    "Start your work early, and choose a subject that you know. If you do not have a basic understanding of the area you are writing on you will be drifting alone for a long time and be frustrated with the topic. Also, make sure your advisor will be there all year.",
    "Of course the task of researching and writing a thesis was daunting and difficult, but you really feel accomplished when it's all done.",
    "You've got to do it if you want to be a history major. You'll be happier if you pick a topic you love and start researching early. Having a good adviser helps, but in the end it's about your ability to make and meet your own deadlines; otherwise you'll spend spring break in SML.",
    "I definitely recommend the Senior Essay. It has been a crucial part of my senior year, and one that I actually truly enjoyed. It is unlike any other paper writing experience I have had here at Yale and although it certainly takes a lot of time, it was absolutely worth it.",
    "Yes, you should take it... so you can graduate.",
    "a marathon not a sprint.",
    "Get a draft done before spring break! It makes life so much better.",
    "Well you have to take it so do it.",
    "Very fun to be able to work independently, but also so closely with a single adviser.",
    "It's the senior requirement so I don't think there's a choice, but would recommend anyone to write a thesis in general.",
    "yes",
    "Start early",
    "It can be really rewarding, if you are on top of your shit. If you're not, its just stressful. Not a bad way to finish the history major though, if you like history.",
    "I enjoyed working on this project a lot, despite feeling as though I never got the hang of it. I definitely feel that it taught me a lot about how to pursue a project on this, even if I would do things very differently in the future. Get a head start; do a chunk in the fall, as it makes things much more manageable in the spring even if you take a while to get back into it after winter break.",
    "Absolutely.",
    "If you are majoring in history, I'd take it in order to graduate. Pieces of advice: 1. Set aside time each week to do research in the fall; treat it like a regular class schedule. 2. Try to have most\/all of your research done in the fall. 3. Begin writing BEFORE you think you are ready to; it will help you realize what research you might still want to do. 4. Complete a rough draft before spring break. This is the most important advice that my adviser gave me. Trust me.",
    "Take it if you would like to go bald.",
    "Yes, and make sure you write about a topic that you are very interested in!",
    "If you need to read this evaluation for insight into the senior essay process, you should rethink what you're doing in this major.",
    "You're going to have to do it. So nut up, and go do it.",
    "It is an intense project but rewarding at the end. Pick a topic that you really want to research the entire year and won't get bored with",
    "The senior essay is a major project that should be started early, and done with an adviser that you know and work with well. A very gratifying project in the end!",
    "Spend a lot of time picking the right topic. Develop your relationship with your adviser early and focus on setting a timetable with them regardless of what the Department says. Stop doing research in time to write a decent product.",
    "Mandatory.",
    "This was the best academic experience I have had at Yale, up until the grading system which is atrocious. The fact that students can commit their entire academic lives to this project, and then be subject to the whims of one random faculty member in terms of grades and criticisms is absolutely ridiculous and must be resolved. As it is, it is far too easy for an entire year's worth of work to be flippantly invalidated by one person who just doesn't care.",
    "Yes, you do feel a great sense of accomplishment once you're done.",
    "Make sure you get a good advisor that you can work with for this project.",
    "You can't avoid it. So I encourage you to do it."
