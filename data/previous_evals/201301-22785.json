   "comments": [
    "Great introduction into philosophy. Don't expect to do a ton of reading or learn a lot of in depth philosophical arguments. Instead the course will focus on giving you the tools to think critically about ethics yourself.",
    "Yes, take this course. It might interest you enough to go into philosophy. If you already are thinking about philosophy, this course will equip you with the tools necessary for writing good papers and coming up with good arguments. This course is truly essential.",
    "If you're an EPE major, don't put this off; you'll be frustrated by the course if you've already been through other philosophy seminars. If you're thinking about applying for the EPE major, keep in mind that the seminar requirements for the major are not like Introduction to Ethics. The major is much more \"history of ideas\" oriented than is Professor Kagan's analytical approach.",
    "Please avoid this class at all cost, because it would really teach you little philosophy. You will be stuck with an egoistic professor full of himself for the entire semester and he will try to fail you in your papers whenever possible. Be wise and avoid the class. If you have to take it, do C\/D\/F and try not to fail.",
    "Not the best philosophy class at Yale, but definitely a good intro to Kant and Mill. Not much work. Definitely need to take Credit\/D\/Fail though, unless you feel super confident writing philosophy papers.",
    "Yes, the class is a very interesting class and is well taught. I would recommend that another student takes the class credit d fail for Kagan's famous grading.",
    "I would definitely recommend the course.",
    "It is a fabulous class that is worth taking for the way it makes you look at the world, but the papers are very difficult to get good grades on and there is a substantial workload. I would recommend for a student who is a good writer or is interested at all in philosophy or ethics.",
    "It's not an easy class but I would definitely recommend. Starting it Credit\/D until you know what you're capable of will definitely help make it less stressful.",
    "A hard class by virtue of the slimness of the work. 3 papers, one section grade, 25% each. No room for error. Improvement will heal the sick, but not revive the dead. If you are a good writer and have experience in philosophy, take the course. If not, Credit D.",
    "This is not a good credit\/d class. I took it because I love going to lecture and listening to Kagan. However, you will be very stressed in section and you will get a projected grade of a C or D half way through. Put in some effort and you can really enjoy it.",
    "A challenging introduction to moral thinking. THe grading is very tough! There are only three short papers, but they are the hardest papers that I wrote this semester.",
    "Junior EPE major taking the class Credit\/D. I think I would've gained a lot more from the course taking it as a freshman or if I didn't have a background in util\/deon before coming to Yale. I didn't learn much about the theories since I knew a lot about them already. The papers weren't very hard though. Probably would have gotten an A- if I took it for a grade--didn't need to put in much effort to score decently (B+) on the papers if you knew how to write philosophy stuff. Not sure if Kagan is all he's cracked up to be. Go to your TA for help in writing the papers.",
    "A great introduction to ethics. A little rigorous for someone who has never taken a philosophy course before. Readings can be dense, although usually not long, but this requires a commitment to really dig deep into the text.",
    "A good class to take if you've never done philosophy before. Introduces you to some major ideas in ethical philosophy while also asking you to think critically about them and evaluate them.",
    "I would certainly take Philosophy 175. Even if you take it Credit\/D, it's worth going to all the lectures and doing all the reading. It's possible to do well without that because there are only three short papers, but you'll get much less out of the class.",
    "YES. One of the best courses I've taken at Yale.",
    "Worth taking but take Credit D, because they grade hard",
    "An excellent class. A class to take Credit\/D\/Fail.",
    "I would recommend this class, but only if the student is really interested in learning about ehthics in particular. That might sound silly, but I mainly took this class because I enjoyed Death with Shelley Kagan, and although many of the same positive components still hold (engaging lectures, for example), I did find myself less committed to the class because I was not as interested in the particular material.",
    "Honestly, this course is not that great. I would say Shelly Kagan is an engaging lecturer but he often babbles. The grading is fine; I think that they tend to make an upsloping curve for grades so you will improve, just meet with your TA to discuss your work. Often lectures would not say much and as a result, I felt that we didn't learn as much as we could. I would have preferred if it was a bit faster paced and we came to some conclusions rather than pure rambling. From the first couple of classes you may be tempted to stay, but I would say that there are just classes that are a bit more interesting out there.",
    "I was disappointed. I needed to take it for my major, but I would not have stuck with it otherwise. Based on the reviews that Professor Kagan read at the beginning of the first class--also, who does that? and he does that for all his classes--I expected to either love or hate it, and really set out to love it. However, I instead just felt that it was a mediocre class. If you've taken any philosophy class before, you've covered all of the thought experiments and basic frameworks that you will cover in this class. I suppose it would be fine as an introduction to philosophy--but then again, although the material might be exciting if you were being exposed to it for the first time, the standards are set too high without enough support systems in place to make sure that students are able to meet them. For example, TFs will go over outlines for papers, but not the papers themselves. In an introductory class, this just doesn't seem fair. Basically, I think that there are better intro philosophy classes out there, and that Kagan's class is just not worth your time.",
    "Yes, and the grading isn't even that hard. Don't be scared. It is just another normal Yale class. Shelly is a wonderful professor. And this class gave me some opportunities to think so deeply that was unexpected and otherwise wouldn't have happened to me. Reading is minimal to none. All you have to do is THINK for yourself. And guess this shouldn't be a problem for anyone at Yale.",
    "I really recommend this class. Lots of students hesitate in taking this due to rumors of Shelly's harsh standards; I too have avoided this class for two years because of that very reason. If it was not a requirement for my major, I probably would not have taken it at all. But not taking this class for that reason is a big mistake.Shelly's standards are not unreasonable. It's actually very possible to get an A or A- on all three papers (I've done so and so have others). Here's how: first, don't write an essay analyzing what so-and-so great philosopher thinks about the situation in the essay question. That's the straight way to an F. I know many people in the class who actually love philosophy, have excelled at multiple philosophy classes, but have stumbled in this one because of that reason. This is not a philosophy class about critical reading; it's about critical thinking. The sooner you forget that a dead man wrote the theory that you're studying, the better.Second, think deeply about your own beliefs and try to build an argument around why you think that your beliefs are right. Then, become your own devil's advocate and try to destroy that argument. Be merciless. Cut no corners. You'll want to take it easy on your values. Don't. If your original argument is right, you should be able to come up with a solid counter on every single criticism (at least have two main and powerful counterarguments) that come out of the devil on your shoulder. If your argument weathers the storm unchanged, then you're good. If not, it's time to accept defeat and switch sides. Argue for what was your counterargument.Third, write the paper, but at this point, your hard work is already done. Turn your painful thought process of arguing for and against yourself in step 2 into the body of the essay. Your writing just has to be simple and solid; nothing fanciful is needed. All that is important is the power of your argument. The more holes left unfilled in step 2, the more your grade will drop. If you want a real-life example of how to do step 2, look no further than Shelly's performance on stage every lecture. Always, he presents an argument, then the rationale behind that argument, then criticize the argument at least 2 or 3 times, and finally presenting arguments against those criticisms. If you capture the essence of this in your own papers, then you'll have written a good paper. 90% of writing is thinking and 10% is putting your thoughts on paper.Lastly, don't think about the curve or beating the curve. There is no real curve. If you write a good paper, you write a paper. There's no special finagling to make sure that only 20% get As or 25% get Bs or whatever. Believe in yourself, work hard, and you can succeed.",
    "Take it Cr\/D. I'm serious.He very very rarely writes anything on the board (which is about par for the course, I guess) and it's easy to get lost in his lectures if you get distracted thinking about what he just said (thought is required).",
    "If you don't have to take this for a major I would not recommend it. Start it credit d. Take a political philosophy class instead and you will learn much more and it will be worth your while. I would not recommend this class.",
    "No. It is quite a waste of time, and the grading is exceptionally harsh.",
    "This is a great class which you'll definitely be glad you took. The lectures are consistently excellent and engaging, and you come out of the class with a really good foundation in moral philosophy. Unless you're confident that you're the next Shelly Kagan, do not take this class for a grade; Kagan is on a one-man mission to stop grade inflation, so take this credit-D unless you absolutely can't. Beyond that, it's a great class with minimal work and no final exam, so you should definitely take it.",
    "Suck it up and take this class (or just take it Credit\/D and don't fail!); yes, the grading is harsh, but the course is well worth it. Shelly is an INCREDIBLY engaging lecturer who has a better understanding of the material he teaches than any professor I have had so far at Yale. He is incredibly good at establishing an argument, and always provides adequate context for any statements that he wants to make. He is always open to talk with you after class or by appointment, and really wants his students to become engaged with the ideas themselves rather than the people who first systematized them. If you regret taking the course, then you probably approached it without an open mind.",
    "A good class, not a great one. I wish kagan's lectures were less calculated, but this does help achieve a good grasp of some difficult philosophies (kant...). I wish we read more beyond the basic works we read on deontology and utilitarianism; some critiques or applications of the philosophies might be helpful, but Kagan does say early on that the course seeks to establish a foundation without necessarily focusing on applications.",
    "The class spends much time focused on utilitarianism, deontology, and Hume's theories - with much time allotted to questions of free will and the role of practical reason in morality. Lectures are engaging and the reading is interesting and manageable. Section is very fun. The papers are graded very harshly, but relatively interesting prompts are given. Overall the class is highly theoretical with little focus on concrete applications.",
    "This class really makes you think about ethics and morality. Not easy to score well on it though. Might be a good Cr \/ D \/F but only if you have taken philosophy before, because otherwise you'll be pretty anxious about the D\/F.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class if you are interested in ethics and don't mind getting a less-than-expected grade or two on a paper. The lectures are amazing, the subject material is relavent to every day life, and questions are posed that will make you think, and want to think, about your own ethical beliefs (although it is often difficult to reach a conclusion). In addition, the homework is very manageable and the discussion sections are engaging. Overall, if you think debating and learning about ethics is interesting, this is the perfect class.",
    "Ethics was ok. If you have taken any sort of philosophy course before it will probably be repetitive, but that was my major complaint about the course.",
    "I'd definitely recommend this course to anyone at least remotely interested in philosophy or morality. Kagan is an amazing lecturer who is almost able to make the 200+ person class feel like a seminar. He's one of the brightest people I've ever had the pleasure of learning from. The man is almost like a prophet or something. You won't get answers about how to live your life in this class, but you will learn how to think. Sometimes asking the right questions is just as important as getting answers. You'll come away with an ability to better organize your thoughts and an understanding of the basic theories on moral philosophy. Yes, the grading is hard, but you will be better off for it.",
    "A truly wonderful class, even if you have read some (or a lot) of philosophy before. Kagan does an incredible job of boiling down very complex thoughts into simple, understandable lectures that are still very stimulating. You will leave the class with a very solid outline of both Utilitarianism and Kantianism. Definitely shop sections though -- the papers were rewarding to write regardless (since Kagan actually grades hard enough to make you work), but some TAs were terrible, while others were really great.",
    "This course was great - Shelly is a great lecturer and professor, but the grading IS harsh. If you're ready to cherish a B+, then go ahead, but if you've gotta get an A or A- in the course, then this might be a stressful class for you. The grading is split 4 ways between section and 3 papers, so the quality of Shelly's lectures is really the only thing to encourage you to attend (apart from being prepared for section, which you HAVE to speak up in). There is a minimal amount of reading to do for each week; most of the work is in the papers for the course. The first paper grade is basically dropped if you improve a lot... DEFINITELY meet with your TA about your papers before writing them (but after sketching out an idea for the topic) - they will help you figure it out and give great advice. The papers are about coming up with your own arguments and learning how to DO philosophy, and NOT about spitting back out what you've learned in lecture or for readings (although you have to know this information to write the papers). I would recommend this course, but again, only if you're willing to have to write REALLY good papers and participate in section a LOT for the A-range grades.",
    "This course is a very interesting, eye-opening introduction to ethics that does not require any previous studies in philosophy. The focus of the class is the basis of morality and the content of morality. Kagan is a great professor: he is engaging, with interesting and sometimes amusing examples, and explains concepts clearly. This is a great course to take for someone whose major is unrelated to philosophy but is interested in the subject, though grading is tough so consider credit\/D.",
    "Phil175 is a great Credit\/D\/Fail class. It's light on workload and the lectures are engaging with Kagan. I would recommend take this course for fun if you can.",
    "It is definitely one the courses you need to take before leaving Yale. The workload is only three 5-page papers but the material is well worth it. Start it out Cr\/D\/Fail but if you have an inclination you did well on the second paper, take the class for the grade and don't make the same mistake I did. I would recommend this course every year and would coerce you take it.",
    "Great, I didn't actually do the readings because I was credit d but between section, lecture, and the papers I still learned tons",
    "A good, low work introduction to moral philosophy. The readings are pretty irrelevant to the class. Although, what people say about Professor Kagan's grading is absolutely true.",
    "Take it credit d. You will get slammed with a C otherwise. Even you intellectual \"I'm a good writer and I write for the YDN and read Ulysses as a fourth grader\" will get trounced by an unrelenting Shelly Kagan as he has tea with Kant and tells him where he went wrong with deontogy.",
    "The content of the class is really good, but what is done with the content is the better part. This class does not aim to be a comparative philosophy course, but rather it aims to ask the students to do their own philosophy in the context of and in response to the theories studied. Indeed, this is difficult, but it is also rewarding.The grading is notoriously tough for this class, but I don't think that that's reason enough not to take it. If it really bothers you, take it Credit\/D\/Fail. Or audit it. And if you do take it for a grade, know that the grades in this class are a more true measure of your ability--for instance, a C is a real average, not \"below average\" in any way. That way, if and when you do better, you can really be proud of the hard work you put in.",
    "If you take it credit\/d, it's not a lot of work at all. You don't have to do any of the reading, but it's still helpful to make it to class as much as you can, because Professor Kagan neatly and coherently lays out the major philosophical points needed for the papers.",
    "I object the idea of Credit\/D-ing this class as a means of putting in less than 100%. That's not what a class with Professor Kagan is about. It's about fully (100%) engaging with each new idea which is brought up. To work to fully understand the idea, then to develop strong objections to it, and generate responses to objections. It's by no means an easy effort, but extremely rewarding. It'll jack up the horsepower of your analytical thought process to be faster, stronger, and deeper.",
    "Only take this class if you are sure that you are interested in philosophy, otherwise it will be incredibly boring. Kagan is a good lecturer, but he neglects to provide enough instruction on how to write his papers, so it's hard to get a good grade. I personally did not enjoy the class and did not think I learned very much from it.",
    "Yes! It is a very interesting and not very difficult class. The readings are short and fairly straightforward, and lecture and section will prove worthwhile. It trains you how to think like a philosopher, and ethics is very interesting of its own right. The essays are not too hard either, they just require you to think and express yourself clearly. Very recommendable course!",
    "Great class for learning the basic philosophies of Mill, Kant, Hume. How should we act morally, and what makes an action moral? Is it better to maximize the good of a group, or are there more objective rules of morality? I feel like this class can actually help you view your life differently.",
    "Fantastic intro philosophy course. Very light reading, so you are able to really get into it. Exciting and relevant philosophical topics.",
    "So everyone says this is a mind-blowing class, and Professor Kagan loves to play it up as \"love-it-or-hate-it.\" Honestly, it's neither. It's just boring. Professor Kagan clearly cares about his students, but he doesn't trust us to get it, because he uses way too many examples and doesn't get through much material. Maybe if you were a feshman it might be the right pace, but as a junior who has already taken Kapustin it was dull. Take it credit\/d- it's too boring to be worth how hard the grading is. (Not too much harder than Kapustin, honestly, just not a quarter as engaging. You can get an A, but it will feel so slow.)",
    "Intro to Ethics is a great traipse through the question: How should we live our lives. The assessments are three essays and section participation. Contribute in section, and argue for YOUR beliefs in essays, and you'll be fine.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS (credit-D). I was expecting to find a course that hadambiguous discussions and ambiguous lectures on a topic choc full of ambiguities, but what I found instead were remarkably engaging, well-articulated and well-structured lectures and discussions. The assignments, though tough, are extremely interesting (and even fun) to grapple with, and both Shelly Kagan and my TF (Emad Atiq) were incredible and unbelievably knowledgeable. I'd definitely recommend this, BUT with the caveat that you should probably take another philosophy course first so you have an extra leg up when tackling the harshly-graded papers.",
    "Take this class if you want to figure out why different theories of ethics should be persuasive, not a summary of what different historical figures thought about ethics. The point of the class is to wrestle with what someone might think and how to make it as plausible as possible. It's actually doing ethics, not learning about ethics. It's a great class, especially if you have a good section (if Julianne's teaching again, she's fantastic).",
    "Intro to Ethics gives you an overview of different moral philosophies and Shelly Kagan does a good job of clarifying some of the views in these philosophies. Kagan is a brilliant lecturer and I really enjoyed they way he takes arguments and breaks them down into their smallest components from which he is able to provide counterarguments. However, one of his faults is that he can be narrow-minded as well and often fails to provide a complete picture of all aspects of a moral theory. The workload for the course is not bad, but the essays require a lot of thought in order to do well. Kagan is a harsh grader so credit\/d\/fail is recommended.",
    "If you're an EPE student who has already taken Classics, you will be bored. Unfortunately, you still have to take it and the grading is harder than most classes at Yale. More hypotheticals than other ethics classes, but that is not necessarily an advantage.",
    "interesting class, although it gets repetitive near the end. i took it credit\/d, and the workload was extremely manageable -- just three papers the whole semester.",
    "Absolutely fantastic course. Without a doubt one of the best courses I have taken, and possibly one of the best courses at Yale. Shelly Kagan is brilliant, eloquent, lucid, and outstanding both as a philosopher and a lecturer. Each lecture is extremely engaging and very enjoyable to listen to. You'll come away from the course with a solid foundation in the language and ideas of ethics, and deep familiarity with some of the most notable competing conceptions of ethical theory. Furthermore, this course effectively develops one's writing and philosophical argumentation skills in an interesting and enjoyable way. The course is rewarding like few others.The reading is mostly famous foundational works in ethics by well known philosophers like Mill, Kant, Hume, Hobbes, and others. The reading supplements the lectures very well, and Professor Kagan does a fabulous job of, in turn, adding insight and context to certain sections. The course emphasizes the broad elements and ideas of the readings, rather than specific passages, and if you're looking for a close study of Mill of Kant, this course may not be what you're looking for. For instance, the course is interested in Utilitarianism as a general idea, not Utilitarianism strictly as one philosopher wrote it. Same with contractarianism and even Kantianism. I very much enjoyed this approach. It seemed that the course was enriched by not being tied down by the specific words in the texts, and instead having a greater emphasis on finding the best ideas.Section is a large component of the course, and I very much enjoyed mine. My TA was highly knowledgeable about the material and knew how to start very interesting discussions and debates. Section was generally not stressful, and was a pleasure to attend.The three papers for the course each have two or three prompts to choose among. The topics are decently open ended, and leave much room for taking your paper in whatever direction you would like to go. The papers are graded primarily based on the clarity and strength of your argument, and you are given leeway to make whatever argument you find strongest. Shelly Kagan may have a reputation for difficult grading. I found that he has a high bar for excellence, but not unreasonably high. It seems he grades the first paper strictly, but generously rewards improvement. If you take the course seriously and put genuine thought into your papers, you will almost certainly excel.I cannot recommend this course enough. For anyone who finds ethics, philosophy, or any sort of logical argumentation interesting, this course is for you. It's tremendously rewarding.",
    "Kagan is a good professor, but don't take it if you're not ok with a so so grade, like a B. I thought it was a good class and it definitely challenged the way I think. Overall, recommend it if you're interested in political science or philosophy, but most everyone else won't enjoy it.",
    "Take it--you won't regret it. Take it C\/D\/F if you're worried about the grading (especially if you're worried about the grading and you're taking it for your major); although I ended up not changing to A-F, I know others who did because they felt like they would be getting a decent grade. Putting aside the grading, this is an incredible class. Shelly presents the material really clearly, and I like that he tries to encourage exploration of the philosophical concepts (including all possible interpretations and extensions) as opposed to attempting merely to understand what the philosophers meant. I did feel that we proceeded a bit slowly--we spent 2\/3 of the semester on Mill and Kant, and only touched on certain aspects of Hobbes and Hume--but that might be just because it's an introductory class. Even if you've read the texts before, your understanding will be deepened, whether from Shelly's interpretation or from your own reflection.",
    "PHIL175 was a great intro philosophy course. It was challenging but I would recommend it.",
    "YES. This is probably the best class (or at least the best lecture) that I've taken at Yale, despite my terrible TA. The lectures get progressively more difficult as the semester goes on, but if you stay after class and talk through your questions with Professor Kagan, you will definitely get it. Professor Kagan is REALLY good at answering questions. I'd really recommend staying after class and talking to him, or at least hanging out and listening to other students' questions. It clarifies things a lot. Professor Kagan is also great to talk about your paper topics with. He is crazy smart, very helpful, and so willing to spend time with students. I learned a lot from this class.Readings are pretty much optional, but do spend time on the papers!",
    "Don't take this class if you care at all for actually learning anything about what modern ethical philosophers have thought. The readings are decent, but you will never refer to them. Citing sources seems to be a high crime for Professor Kagan. Kagan is, at least, a decently entertaining lecturer (I would not, as one evaluator did, call him \"The Worst Lecturer IN THE WORLD,\"), however, his lectures are full of flimsy hypotheticals (\"If I pulled an imaginary lever here to get a candy bar, but, when I did so, 500 random children in the deep, dark, interior of Africa died\u00e2\u0080\u0094would that be moral, if their deaths weren't traced back to me?\" Professor Kagan once asked the class), and general intellectual dishonesty. Professor Kagan loves overly broad and usually incorrect generalizations of philosophers' arguments\u00e2\u0080\u0094which is dangerous if you don't plan to take more philosophy courses at Yale. You shouldn't be paying $60,000 a year to come away with a faulty understanding of Kant. If you're lazy, this class will be lovely: there's nothing of substance to take notes on in lectures; you don't really have to do the readings (although the readings are the best part of the whole ordeal), and there is no final. But Kagan's idea of what a philosophy paper should be is eccentric and ludicrous, and good grades are difficult to come by\u00e2\u0080\u0094I usually don't complain about grading matters, but here, one's GPA really suffers at the hands of Professor Kagan's eccentricity. My TF was terribly lazy and personally off-putting; our last discussion session was spent talking about the merits of cocaine use, the night-life in Latin America, and the state of prostitution in Cuba (there's a lot of it). The experience was almost surreal, but deeply dissatisfying.",
    "I took it because I had to as an EPE student. If you don't have to, there are many more, much interesting philosophy courses out there. Try political philosophy, for instance. normative ethics is not interesting, and I personally did not like Kagan's teaching style.",
    "Shelly Kagan is fantastic. A word to the wise though: Don't take this class to get good grades, because you probably won't. Take it to learn how to do philosophy, because you definitely will.",
    "If you like considering lots of random thought experiments and hypothetical scenarios then you will probably enjoy this class. Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t expect to do a lot of textual analysis of what you read though. Use your Credit\/D."
