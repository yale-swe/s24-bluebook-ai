    "A practical, hands-on experience with working in a molecular biology lab was obtained. I felt like the material was very relevant to lab skills I use in the lab I work in, along with past labs, and found that the explanations provided with each lab helped solidify my understanding of the topics.",
    "Developed lots of applicable laboratory skills",
    "important experimental techniques in biochemistry, as well as a better understanding of several fundamental concepts of biochemistry",
    "I learned many methods useful to my development in lab. This lab is definitely useful to learn lab skills.",
    "I learned how to write a scientific research paper, and how to conduct hypothesis driven research. This course also teaches students basic laboratory skills and techniques that can be translated to non-course lab work."

   "question_id": "YC403",
   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths: Well organized in the lab manual. Weaknesses: The lab is not well-furnished to be a molecular biology lab, which made it very difficult to share equipment and get hands-on experience when materials are difficult to acquire.",
    "This course assumed that we knew a bit more than we did since the only pre-req is one semester of biochemistry. The material was challenging and the guidelines for what was to be expected on reports were not completely clear. This course could be improved by perhaps providing a lecture before every lab explaining all details, not just before some classes and brushing over some concepts students were assumed to have known.",
    "As someone with no previous laboratory experience, I felt at first that I was always behind, which was a source of stress. However, as the course progressed I became more comfortable with the experiments and the class as a whole. I feel like I've learned a ton and had quite the intensive introduction to biochemistry laboratory techniques and concepts. One thing I would say is that at times it was difficult to understand lectures and directions. It was usually the TAs that had to clarify things for us, and more clear lecturing\/instruction would have made experimentation much more smooth.",
    "For a lab with no prerequisites, this assumes far too high a level of understanding of biochemistry and is therefore very frustrating for most students. It's also rude to make people buy course materials during shopping period. On the plus side, the techniques learned are useful and interesting.",
    "The first paper is extremely long and difficult. I think it would be helpful to be encouraged to start the paper as soon as the first project has begun."

   "comments": [
    "If you are interested in gaining lab experience in molecular biology, I recommend this course.",
    "Great lab course! Lab reports can be a bit long, but experiments done are exciting",
    "This lab was very tough. Only two lab reports made every mistake really count towards your grade, and the weekly quizzes were very difficult as well. It was a bit stressful.",
    "If you have no laboratory experience like me, beware -- you will need to come to lab prepared to be on your A game all the time. It might feel like everyone's doing everything right and you're the only one who's clueless, but if you talk to other people (even though most of them have performed similar experiments in other classes or through their own research), they'll also be lost. Make sure you're able to form a group of people where you can discuss your results and ask each other questions, and you'll be fine. While a 60% grading weight on lab reports looks absolutely terrifying, if you follow the guidelines and put in the time grading honestly shouldn't be a problem. So as long as you work hard to follow along and understand everything you're doing, you should do great.",
    "Do NOT take this class unless you are an MBB major who has to. It assumes too much prior knowledge, is frustrating, and can become stressful. Worst four hours of every week. Premeds stay away this is not the lab for you.",
    "Yes, take this lab. There is a significant amount of work, don't get me wrong. But you learn a lot and the professors are very kind and helpful. They really want you to learn care about you.",
    "Definitely take this course if you need to take a MBB or MCDB lab. There are two reports throughout the semester which are both a lot of work, but are extremely rewarding once complete."
