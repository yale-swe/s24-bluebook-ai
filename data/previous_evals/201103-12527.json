    "This class takes a bit of getting used to, because you have to learn to think about variables and equations in a slightly different way than you do in calculus. The first two weeks or so were rough for that reason, but then it got much better, and the material turned out to be quite interesting (I say that as someone who likes math a lot, so take it how you will). You're definitely going to need these concepts for applied math and any of the physical sciences, so take it early if you can.",
    "Good math course, one of the better ones Ive taken.",
    "Math 246 gives a great mathematical foundation in ordinary differential equations. Topics covered this year included 1st order techniques, n-th order linear differential equations with constant coefficients, applications of the Laplace Transform, systems of linear, first order differential equations and a brief introduction to nonlinear systems and numerical approximations. We learned a lot. At times the teaching was hard to understand, but Professor Luli was always willing to answer questions and talk outside of class. The class doesn't do drill problems like the engineering class version do, which would help one to be more familiar with solving random equations that may come up in practice, but we certainly learned many theoretical and applicable techniques. I would say that this class is one good step in preparing for fully proof-based classes.In summary, if you need to learn how to solve differential equations for your major or are just interested in learning about them like I was, you can't go wrong taking the class. But let it be known that it is not particularly easy.",
    "It's a good class. Take it.",
    "If you want to learn about differential equations, not just how to solve them but also theory behind them, this is a good class. If you would rather focus on applications, take the ENAS version. The teacher is likeable but not necessarily so helpful.",
    "Take it if you're interested in differential equations! The professor is good, and it probably gives you some good background for other math stuff.",
    "Ordinary Differential Equations with Professor Kevin Luli is not what most people would consider a standard course in differential equations. When people think about a differential equations course, they usually think that what will be taught are the algorithms used to solve these equations. This class is not an engineering class and hence transcends a shallow coverage of the material, delving more deeply into theory and developing an appreciation for the mathematics behind differential equations. Of course, Math 246 covered the basic material expected of a course in ODEs including first order differential equations, second and higher order differential equations, Laplace transforms, numerical methods and linear systems. However, the course also covered with great depth topics beyond the scope of the textbook including nonlinear systems, limit cycles, Jordan Canonical form, and a complete proof of the Existence-Uniqueness Theorem at the expense of forgoing topics such as power series methods and physics applications. The homework assignments and examinations for this course are challenging and ask students to both solve differential equations and complete more theoretical proof-like material (both types of questions were instructive). Professor Luli is very approachable, well-intentioned, and fair and is a passionate and clear teacher who is able to give eloquent and insightful lectures without the use of his notes. Math 246 is good preparation for higher level courses in the mathematics department and is a good use of a credit for students from all majors who have a background in calculus and some knowledge of linear algebra.",
    "The course was very difficult and very proof based. Do not take it if you haven't had experience with differential equations before. Take ENAS 194 instead. This course is all about the teacher, and if Garving Luli is teaching, don't take it. He is impossible to learn from.",
    "If you're taking this class, chances are you're majoring in a hard science that has differential equations as a prerequisite. In that case, I'd recommend ENAS 194, which does a better job teaching the applications of differential equations. Only take this class if you're really looking for the theoretical math, and be prepared for proofs."
