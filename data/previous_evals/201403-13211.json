    "A poem a week. Weekly crits of classmates' writing. Some readings (although you absolutely don't have to do them). Everyone's poems get work-shopped weekly, which is fantastic. I would totally recommend it. McClatchy may rub you the wrong way at the beginning, but you'll learn to appreciate his sense of humor--if you can't appreciate it, then you'll probably be able to tolerate it. His comments are also on point.",
    "I would absolutely insist that any student who writes poetry should try to take this course. If you get in, you must take it. If you don't get in, you must try again. It will make you a measurably better and more confident writer. Before this course, I could hardly muster the courage to mention my poetry, let alone read it out loud. After this course, I'm more eager than ever to continue sharing my work and growing from the experience of sharing it.",
    "Absolutely fantastic. Put thought into what you write; the workshop format means that you get out what you put in. We spent equal portions of the class discussing various poetic forms or readings and sharing our own work. Actually do the readings, because they're beautiful, and they will help you write significantly better. McClatchy will push you to give your best, and will entertain you in the process. Take it with him; I have never improved so much as a writer in such a short time."
