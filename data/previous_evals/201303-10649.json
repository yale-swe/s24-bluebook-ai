   "comments": [
    "It's a good but very basic foundation in Music Theory. If you know nothing about music and want to learn more, or know a lot and want an easier class than 205, this is the class for you.",
    "This is a good way to get an introduction to music theory, but beware - it wasn't quite as much of a blowoff as some people have said. If you go into the class with zero music background I suspect it would be really challenging to catch up as you plow through the material. It was also surprisingly more work than expected - there are homework assignments for each class that were often quite time-consuming.",
    "This is a basic but comprehensive introduction to the rudiments of music. I would recommend this class to anyone who is interested in music even if he or she does not have a particular penchant for theory. Unfortunately the more interesting topics involving real music - Roman numeral analysis, study of chords and triads - does not come until the end of the semester, but other than that it is a good class.",
    "I would recommend this class if you have a curiosity about music. Personally, it opened up an interest in taking more classes within the music department.",
    "Great class. Enjoyable and enlightening.",
    "I would absolutely recommend 110 to anyone interested in understanding, analyzing, reading, and writing music. I took it without any music theory experience and barely any musical training. There were a lot of people in the class who began much stronger than I did, but it didn't really make a different after four or five weeks into the course. Also, Professor Moira Hill is truly, truly excellent. If you can, take this course with her.",
    "Take it. So worthwhile, not that much work.",
    "Highly recommended. Take this course if you are at all interested in music theory. The course teaches out of a book that will go through all of the fundamental concepts needed to get you started in music theory. Prior musical background can be helpful but many students seemed to do pretty well without it as the course is designed for people with no musical background. There is a decent amount of grunt work at the beginning but the assignments towards the end are a lot fun.",
    "Music 110 is a nice intor course. Having had extensive background in performing music but not really having all the theory down, I found it nicely complemented my music skill set.Also, Miss Hill is wonderful! Every class was a true delight (plus our class had some really fun dynamics and weird inside jokes). She understands that all the content of the prescribed syllabus may not be too exciting for all students and so she balanced these somewhat boring theory parts with a lot of hands-on demonstrations, singing, etc."
