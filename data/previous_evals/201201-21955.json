    "Good class. Freeman is wonderful and the readings are fascinating. The emphasis on the single paper is a little tough to handle, although Freeman is very supportive. Seminar discussions are also very unstructured and felt like something of a missed opportunity for deeper engagement.",
    "This is a fabulous class. Professor Freeman is very helpful in teaching you how to write (she goes over your paper with you) and she is very personable. The reading is fun and not too strenuous. It helped me that I have taken other history classes in the time period...",
    "There is a lot of reading in this class, but the characters really come to life both through the excellent books and through Professor Freeman's leading of discussion. Professor Freeman is phenomenal, truly one of the best history professors. She brings up really entertaining stories too! She listened closely to our observations, and her points were always so comprehensive and detailed in giving us a real sense of the period and addressing our questions. Everything, as we discovered, had a political undertone. For the paper, please select a topic that you are genuinely interested in and do research in advance. Go to office hours, even if you haven't really started researching. But then keep going and talking to her about your discoveries. She is extremely kind and resourceful, and office hours can be even much more productive if you bring more to the table. Please do not take this essay lightly.",
    "This class is great! Professor Freeman is such an engaging professor and she just gets so excited about the topic. Her excitement is contagious. I really enjoyed the class and learned a lot, even though this was probably one of my least favorite subjects in history before. There is a fair bit of work. The final paper is a huge part of class and is a lot of work. Professor Freeman is very helpful throughout it though!",
    "Do it for working with Prof. Freeman one on one, and take advantage of that. The seminar discussion was less interesting, but had its moments. Having a knowledge of what's going on in the period in a more detailed way than AP AmHistory before delving into these analyses of political culture would have enriched my experience.",
    "This class is a review of what American politics was like from the aftermath of the Revolution through the administration of James Madison. The reading list was usually pretty interesting. Some people may have loved this class, I didnot. If you're interested in the period, go ahead and take it. My only problem with the course is that I didn't find the discussions too enthralling. But the Professor--Joanne Freeman--is very good and very dedicated to helping you improve (she gives a lot of help on the papers, in fact, more than I've ever seen from a Yale professor). As I'm sure others are saying: be sure to start working on the paper early. The prospectus is due very early on, the draft is due right after spring break, etc. So just be sure you're ahead on your work if you take this class.",
    "This is a great class, definitely take it!"
