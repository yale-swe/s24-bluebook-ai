   "comments": [
    "Just an additional section for chemistry that does not help.",
    "Good class, nice that it is only freshmen and small so there is more individual attention and the professor actually knows your name",
    "a review session that depending on who the ta is really helpful or not at all",
    "Great intro chem class",
    "It is a great introductory chemistry course and you will definitely feel very comfortable in this class.",
    "It was additional support for the General Chemistry course. It's good to take advantage of it when you need help. So, I would recommend it.",
    "Obviously a requirement for most science majors and Dr G makes it fun enough, but I would say definitely read the textbook just for example practice problems (they walk you through step by step) and also check out Kahn Academy online for more thorough videos because some of the details don't come out very clear in lecture.",
    "CHEM Section straightforward",
    "Your experience in Chem 013 will all depend on who your TA is, how well he\/she teaches, and whether or not you find him\/her approachable enough to ask them questions. If you get a good TA, then this will probably be a great addition to your Chem 113 experience. If not, then going to section may feel like a waste of time, but I would recommend still going to ask any questions you may have and to see the material taught in a different way, but mainly ask Dr. G any questions you have during his office hours."
