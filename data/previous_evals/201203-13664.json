    "The lectures. Since they were all guest lectures, some of them were good but others were not. I think having a good number of guest lectures is great, but that this course could have benefited from some consistency. Maybe it would be good to have a guest lecture every other class, and consistent lectures given by the same person every other class. I feel like I got to understand the UNFCCC process well through my work with my client, but would not have otherwise. It would have been great to have one lecture on the AWG-KP, one on the ADP, etc. explaining how each track works, what issues are important in each track, the history of what has gone down between countries\/blocs in each track, etc. Also, a lecture on the cultural\/political context of our destination country (Qatar this year) would have been very useful. Also, the simulation was very well done and I got a ton out of it, but the course did not prepare us for it ahead of time; those of us who had no experience with the COP had to just figure out how things worked as we went.",
    "can not think of any.",
    "Although the number of speakers was great and provided a diverse set of views and backgrounds, there was a lack of formal introduction\/background provided for these speakers ahead of time. Many times, we were told who was speaking a few days or less before they came, therefore limiting the time we had to prepare questions and investigate their background.",

    "Ask questions - prepare! Read books on the history of international law and policy. Subscribe to blogs related to the topics. Follow them, but do not overwhelm yourself with trying to get \"caught up\". International law and policy is continually growing and is a largely complex topic. You will never know everything that is happening, so do not feel like you are not doing enough. Ask peers who have taken their course what they suggest you do to prepare or make the most of the assignments, collaboration and overall course. Ask others involved in the field about things you are curious or confused about (e.g., talk to a professor). Also, enjoy yourself. This is a fun course and if you get bogged down and frustrated, you will not be able to make the most out of it.",
    "The fact that students are expected to work with a real organization provides a unique opportunity that is very similar to having an internship with that organization. So it is a great course."
