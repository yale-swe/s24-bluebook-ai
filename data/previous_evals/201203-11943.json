    "If you're willing to deal with online homework assignments, and if you're prepared to be challenged every day to participate in class, take it. It's a fair amount of work, but it is taughtat a reasonable pace. One perk is that there is no major final exam -- just biweekly exams and a final project.",
    "I would recommend the class to another student!",
    "Yes. I really enjoyed it.",
    "Take it, but make sure not to be in a section which does this silly online exchange with German high school students. Impossible to coordinate, the German kids are always flaking, and you get graded on it! CHOOSE ANOTHER SECTION.",
    "German 110 will teach you to speak and understand German but does not place much emphasis on grammar. It is less work than the other L1 languages I have taken at Yale. If the online exchange program continues to be offered in future semesters, avoiding the sections that require participation would be advised.",
    "I would recommend it as it is an excellent introductory course",
    "Yes. German is a great language and the department seems really enthusiastic about its program and its students.",
    "From what I've heard and experienced, German is relatively easy, so if you're just looking to fulfill the language requirement, it's an excellent option.",
    "If you are going to take German 110, you should definitely take it with Jason Kavett. He is an excellent teacher all around - his lessons are very organized, engaging, and fun, and he teaches the material very well. He is always wiling to help if you need help, whether it is through his office hours or his quick email responses."
