    "Professor Harkemas wonderful course developed and improved many essential skills for me, both as a critical reader of published texts and as a writer of review essays. Thanks to her detailed instructions, I was able to learn how to truly decipher and analyze secondary sources, such as monographs, history books and collection of essays written by different authors. For instance, Professor Harkema demonstrated how one can detect the strengths and weaknesses of a particular monograph, via analyzing the authors presentation of his\/her theoretical framework, the types of academic interpretations that he\/she includes, and the manner by which he\/she acknowledges possible limitations in his\/her research. In this way, I was able to distinguish which types of secondary texts I should consult during my research, bearing in mind the investigative characteristics of each text I encounter. Furthermore, Professor Harkema introduced me to the writing of review essays, during which I was able to articulate my reactions towards a particular text and formulate them into coherent and critical reviews. Thus, Professor Harkema augmented my abilities as a novice researcher, not only in terms of analyzing primary sources but also in terms of analyzing and critically evaluating secondary sources. Additionally, Professor Harkema visualized how one could infer and interpret the current investigative situations of a particular academic field, via comparing and contrasting various, recently published monographs. Therefore, Professor Harkema truly furthered my academic growth as a novice researcher.",

    "I developed a greater knowledge of the current issues being debated within Contemporary Iberian studies, and more exposure to well-known theoretical essays and works.",
    "I learned how to write an academic review. I also learned how to construct my argument in the form of a book. This was very helpful to me.",
    "I got in touch with a vast bibliography I did not know until then learned a lot from class discussions with fellow students"

    "Professor Harkemas course augmented my critical abilities, via its diverse secondary source readings that concretized many frequently observed investigative tendencies. The variety of these readings, from monographs to published review essays, permitted me to compare and contrast them with each other and thus acquire knowledge of what research habits to emulate and which to avoid. In other words, Professor Harkemas course, utilizing these secondary sources, clearly explained and articulated how one is able to conduct a thorough and detailed research project. Furthermore, Professor Harkemas course effectively introduced another type of essential academic writing, the writing of review essays, via its incorporation of many review essays into the course readings and its written assignments of two review essays. Professor Harkemas guided and detailed explanation of the review essays read in class successfully demonstrated to students what consists of a professional review essay. The first written assignment, a six page review essay about a particular, academic monograph recently published, consists of a perfect and elaborate introduction to the writing of review essays. This is because students are able to directly and empirically learn the types of critical analysis they must conduct, in order to develop and formulate their opinions and reactions towards a text into a coherent review essay. Such skills are further developed and improved by the second written assignment, a twenty page review of three to five academic monographs, recently published, concerning a particular academic field. In this case, this assignment enables students to detect and interpret current research tendencies and factors that still await improvement, within the academic field itself. Thus, students are able to acquire knowledge of how they themselves can possibly contribute to the research field in question, within the future. Additionally, Professor Harkemas incorporation of two literary works, Sab and Reivindicacin del conde Don Julin, enabled students to apply the aforementioned critical reading skills to other types of texts, such as literary works with unique narrative styles. All in all, Professor Harkemas course consists of a comprehensive and detailed development of her students research abilities.",
    "The strengths are many: it covers the main critical currents of our days, the professor provides a very useful and overarching summary of such currents. One feels that the professor really wants to know ones point of view and, in consequence, one feels compelled towards a deeper engagement with the course through the readings. Also, the feedback provided by the professor was unparalleled, both during the sessions and with regards to the written assignments. The improvements could come in the shape of a little more diversity in the literarature covered by the critical materials.",
    "I thought one of the strengths of the course was its base in discussion, which required active participation on the part of the students. I also thought the readings, in particular those having to do with the instructor's area of expertise were very helpful. I did feel, however, that there weren't as many readings as there could have been with regard to contemporary Latin American issues; I don't know if that had more to do with the structure and timing of the course, but it did seem as though it tilted towards more Iberian than Latin American issues at certain times. I also appreciated the instructor's efforts to tie the course into departmental talks, because it helped make the issues we discussed more tangible and real.",
    "I liked that the class helped us engage with contemporary theory. It could be challenging, though, to read and evaluate theory that was not always in my area of specialty. That being said, I am glad to know more about the research being done in fields other than my own."

    "Yes, I would most definitely recommend this course to my colleagues who have yet to take it, since this course comprehensively teaches them to become critical and skilled readers of secondary sources and writers of review essays. Via enrolling in this course, they will be able to truly utilize and incorporate secondary sources into their research, due to their improved analysis and interpretation of different types of secondary sources. Furthermore, students of this course will be able to know how they can possibly contribute to the development of a particular academic field, because of their detection of research tendencies and rooms of improvement within the academic field itself, acquired thanks to the many readings and the two review essays. Also, every class of this course would serve as wonderful practice of presentation of ones opinions to others, since the engaging class discussions of this course expose students to various and profound opinions and teach them to respond and interact with them in a coherent manner. Furthermore, the class presentation concerning a particular monograph from the class readings improves students skills of articulate speech and explanation. Thus, this class would definitely improve various research skills of all students.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. The readings are as pleasurable as the meetings.",
    "I would recommend the course, especially because it gives the student the opportunity to lead discussion and to gain exposure to more information about contemporary Iberian issues.",
    "I would. The class is very different, but I think that is a good thing.",
    "Yes, because it is one of the few courses in the department with theoretical and meteoritical emphasis"
