   "comments": [
    "The trips to the Beinecke are the best parts of the class. You really feel immersed in the Renaissance when you see and touch the books from the era. The weekly readings for this class, however, are incredibly long. The assignments aren't too bad. They're reading responses, an educational treatise, a 10-min presentation, and a final research paper. Professor Leaman is very enthusiastic and knowledgeable about the material, so even if discussion goes off topic, you'll have something interesting to talk about.",
    "Childhood and Education in the Renaissance is a survey class on education from the middle ages to the seventeenth century, with a focus on the humanist education in the Italian Renaissance. Though the class is a survey class, students will still get to delve deeply into the readings for each week since the class is taught seminar style. Hans is the best, and he is mainly the reason why the class is so great. I would totally recommend this class to a fellow student. Readings are usually manageable, and class assignments are fair and fun. I really enjoyed presenting in front of the class on a primary source, which is one of the class assignments. If you're interested in education and\/or the Western humanities, this class is for you. You'll love, just as I and I'm sure many of my peers loved it. You'll also love Hans! Take the class, or at least shop it. You won't regret it.",
    "HIST 230J was a fantastic history seminar, and one of the few Renaissance history courses at Yale (unfortunately). The syllabus was phenomenal, and the assignments were creative and fruitful (writing and revising our own educational treatises, giving a in-class presentation, 6 reading responses, and a research paper at the end of the semester). Moreover, Prof. Leaman is a thoughtful and caring professor who was devoted to the class and clearly put a lot of time into his own preparation.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to anyone interested in education, psychology, or the Renaissance. I am very interested in education and was continually amazed at the similarities between the 16th century and today concerning the education realm.",
    "I would recommend if you're interested in changing perceptions of the child over time!",
    "Hans is a really sweet man who is willing to work with you to develop your research paper and is understanding when it comes to life. He is good at guiding discussion. However, know that this class is largely philosophy-based.",
    "Excellent class for people who really want to understand the history of education and really the point of educating ourselves at all. Highly recommended as a cure to the sophomore slump.",
    "Great course if you're deeply interested in the subject matter.",
    "This class deals with a very particular subject... I recommend it only if you are VERY interested in the subject matter and\/or have some previous knowledge of the renaissance. Without that, it is pretty disorienting. Professor Leaman is very kind, and cares a lot, and knows a lot though, which is great.",
    "This sounds like an oddly specific class, but it's actually very broad we discussed a time span even greater than the (already long) Renaissance. Childhood and education included a lot of more specific subsets including a study of the revival and components of the humanist education. I would recommend this class if the reading list looks appealing. Hans is a very kind professor though not the most engaging seminar leader, he gives lots of feedback on written work and makes a lot of effort to work one on one with each student. I really enjoyed writing the papers especially the final research paper, which was on an artifact of choice from the Beinecke.",
    "I would recommend this course to students who really love studying the Renaissance and works by scholars like Aristotle and Plato. Otherwise, this class can get very dense."
