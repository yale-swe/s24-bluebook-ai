   "comments": [
    "Andre is a good professor and has some very interesting stories. He probably spends too much time in class going through tedious derivations and very little time going through examples. The class is hard but manageable and you will come out of it thoroughly equipped to tackle many different types of ODE's and PDE's.",
    "I would recommend the material, but not necessarily the professor or the TAs, for the reasons above. This class also put a lot of emphasis on using the differential equations, which was frustrating for me, as someone who wants to know where all of my equations are coming from. Perhaps I would suggest Math 246 to a friend.",
    "The coursework taught in ENAS 194 is definitely difficult, and the majority of those taking this class are taking it solely because it's a requirement for a major. The difficulty\/pace of the class seems to vary on instructor, but definitely be prepared for a fast-paced course regardless.",
    "Most people in the class are probably taking it because it's a requirement for their major, so there isn't really a way out of it. If you're just looking for a math class to take for fun and want to learn ODE\/PDE, maybe shop the ODE or PDE course in the math department because this one isn't super well taught or organized. Levchenko is much easier than Stone though.",
    "Cramming ODEs and PDEs into a single semester makes this class very dense and at times difficult to understand. It also makes it very easy to fall behind and stay behind. This class is a lot of work and I generally wouldn't recommend it to any student who doesn't have to take it.",
    "194 is a difficult class, so I would only recommend it to students who are interested in the subject or need to take it for their major. I think Professor Levchenko is a great professor and you should definitely take the class with him. He goes very carefully through the lectures and is engaged with the material and his students.",
    "This course is very difficult, but I definitely learned a lot. Professor Levchenko was alright, but I would suggest trying to find some kind of outside resource to assist in learning the material, maybe even a different textbook. The problem sets are very difficult and take a long time, but were a really great way to learn.",
    "You have to take it, its going to be hard, and its incredibly useful. The psets take forever; get a study group and start early.",
    "This class was basically plug and chug on steroids. You won't take this if you don't have to so if you're reading this you probably have to take it. Professor Levchenko is not too bad. The lectures are bearable and not too confusing. The review sessions are really helpful, go to those! The psets are really hard and it always seems like you will never make it through but you do! The key (to success) is to work on it with friends. Don't pay too much attention to the derivations in class if it's too draining because you never really need to know those. Make sure you understand when and how to use each equation. That's 70% of the class, the rest is integration and algebra and sometimes series (oh dear!).",
    "Absolutely take this class with Levchenko and it was not only be manageable but you will learn a ton. He is the nicest guy ever and truly committed to making this a good experience.",
    "Excellent class with superb notes. PDEs were covered in a rather patchier manner than ODEs, but that's not that much of a flaw. Professor Levchenko is a very good lecturer, and the workload was reasonable.",
    "If you're reading this, let's be real, you've got to take this class for your major. Take it with Professor Levchenko. It's totally doable and you'll learn a lot. The professor is great and the material definitely gets harder towards the end. Pay attention and you might even enjoy yourself",
    "If you take the class, take it with with Professor Levchenko. He was very clear and good at teaching and listened well to student input. The course is not very bad, although I don't know how it compares to the math course. Honestly, though, the vast majority of people in this class are not taking it for fun, but rather because it is a requirement for their major.",
    "ENAS 194 does a good job of covering your standard bag of tricks for solving differential equations. Weekly psets aren't bad, and between the quality of Levchenko's notes and the textbook you'll find class attendance drops pretty quickly. Fair exam, and while some of Levchenko's lectures frequently go beyond what's expected for students to know, there are some jewels like the derivation for e^i(pi) + 1 = 0."
