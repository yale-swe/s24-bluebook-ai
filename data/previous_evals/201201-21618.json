   "comments": [
    "If you are interested in Quantum, take this class, but be prepared to work! Quantum is not easy for me to grasp, but I could still do well on the problem sets by spending extra time on them.",
    "Fair warning, only take this class if you have an extremely firm grasp on physics. Problem sets take 15-20 hours on average and the final is the hardest exam at yale. Demille isnt the most engaging individual and you get tested on material that you never actually learned.",
    "Tough but worth it. For intensive majors it's required but I recommend non-intensive majors take it too, at least if you want to keep graduate school an option. As I said, it's tough, but not impossible if you're willing to put in some hours.",
    "Lots of algebra in places but the problem sets are really manageable and the material is interesting and essential. Take the class if you're a physics major, intensive or otherwise, or even if you're a math major looking for a great science class.",
    "It can be a difficult course, but if you're interested in Quantum Mechanincs, it's very worthwhile.",
    "Take it if you have to. Professor DeMille and the textbook are both really good but the workload is very high.",
    "This class is a decent introduction to quantum mechanics. The textbook is very well written and almost makes going to class unnecessary. Psets are decently long, but not unbearably so.Obviously you'll take this if you're a physics major, but even if not, it provides a good understanding of a fundamental field of physics.",
    "It's a great course if you want to take quantum mechanics, I particularly enjoyed it with Prof. DeMille. Lots of work though.",
    "Boring course. Not very interesting, and too math-heavy.",
    "This course is basically a semester of applied linear algebra. The psets are endless calculations. This course does not really teach the qualitative aspects of the subject. But you do learn a lot. Demille's a good teacher, take it if he's teaching it.",
    "You have to take it if you an intensive major. I wouldn't necessarily take it if you're only interested in quantum mechanics, unless you're auditing it. The psets aren't fun.",
    "I would recommend it to a student interested in learning the principles of wave mechanics and quantum phenomena.",
    "Good intro to quantum mechanics. More like a math class than a physics class, and the math isn't particularly interesting either. Can be a bore but I suppose it is what you make it, and I didn't pay it much mind.",
    "Definitely take it, and don't be scared of the math. It's just algebra whose reputation as \"quantum mechanics math\" is overblown.",
    "Good intro to quantum course. Demille closelyfollows the book so as long as you keep up with the readings, you should be fine. Be careful with the p-sets, though. Start them early or you will likely regret it. The reason? The difficulty and length are often inconsistent, so you can't really make assumptions about how long they will take. Be especially careful near the beginning of perturbation theory. Thankfully, all but 1 pset allow for Wolfram Alpha, so although some of the psets do get extremely tedious, most of the time, you can skip the some of the hairy calculus and algebra. I would recommend it for anyone going into a physics-based major. It is work-intensive, so don't take it if you're a non-physics major with an already heavy-workload.",
    "It's a good course, but only if you're planning on taking more advanced classes afterward. The course material consists of a lot of drudgery and is not terribly fascinating, but it's an important foundation for future, more interesting classes. I now have a solid grasp of how to apply the Schrodinger equation to various scenarios. Professor DeMille is very competent, and he cares about his students, but he is not a charismatic lecturer."
