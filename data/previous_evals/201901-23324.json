   "comments": [
    "This course challenged me to really examine experimental design methods with a critical eye--and that, in turn, required that I dust off knowledge regarding statistical significance, sampling methods, and internal-external validity that I haven't really used in more than a decade. The course was also an excellent way of applying theories of cultural cognition and directionally-motivated reasoning in general to discrete, polarizing phenomena within the science communication environment.",
    "This course taught me to think critically about the design of studies and collection of information around science communication. It opened my eyes to an area of inquiry that I had not previously considered and made me appreciate the complexities of conducting research on science communication issues.",
    "This course really expanded my thinking about how people take in information and form their beliefs and ideas. I also learned about how to read, criticize, and write about a new field of academic literature (social psychology) that I had not studied before, which was a bit challenging but also interesting as someone with training in the natural sciences. I also learned interesting takeaways from different instances where \"science communication\" between experts and the public has broken down, and ways that it was either resolved or exacerbated, which I think can be useful to anyone in a field related to science and policy.",
    "Different points of views from the variety of students who take the course",
    "This class taught me how to critically investigate the principles and assumptions of science communication."

   "comments": [
    "Not cleanly--I was expecting far more examination of and lecturing on cognitive processes than we received, and not really expecting as much heavy design methodology critique as we practiced. This being said--I do not view the difference between my expectations and reality in a negative light. I am extremely grateful for having taken this course.",
    "This class exceeded my expectations in terms of the level of critical thought and discourse in the classroom, as well as the fact that it was basically a research criticism\/seminar-style course. I didn't take courses like this in specific subject areas in college until after years of studying the underlying concepts, so in some ways it was a little startling\/a bit of a crash course, but it was also a mind-opening experience.",
    "not very, thought it'd be very different",

   "question_id": "FS1004",
   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of the course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths: as indicated, does an excellent job of tying experimental design to classic cognitive theories to explain why polluted communications environments are polluted. Weaknesses: I really don't feel like I'm walking out of this class with any better of idea of \"what to do\" about toxic communications environments...and more of a sheaf of \"don't dos\". I think understanding effective communication strategies at an individual level, which the course does emphasize, is helpful...but I also think that most graduate students will be policy leaders in one sector or another, and will seek to one day take action in a polarized scientific domain (like climate change). I'm not certain that this course has especially prepared us for that day when it's on our shoulders to \"solve\" climate change.",
    "I found the first several courses really interesting and enjoyed the opportunity to have conversations and insightful discussions with my classmates. However, it did seem that the course became repetitive and that not much new information was presented after a certain point. The discussions seemed repetitive and it was difficult to stay engaged. I think it would be more engaging to do some sort of group project, mid-semester project, class presentation, etc in order to break up the discussion\/lecture format. We also made weekly posts on Canvas, but did not receive any feedback from the instructor for these. I would have liked to know his thoughts on my comments, especially when it came to writing the final paper and I had no feedback or grade from him whatsoever. The final assignment was rather confusing in terms of instructions and guidance, although Professor Kahan did meet with students individually and provide thoughts on their ideas and proposals",
    "One of my favorite aspects of the course was how it drew in students from all different graduate schools and Yale College who all brought different expertise areas and perspectives to the table, while all having the same common interest in scientific communication and cognition issues. However, the discussion could be a little intimidating at times, and I wish it had seemed more ok to be wrong or uncertain in class, especially since some of the discussions were so conceptual and difficult to understand at least at first.",
    "It has potential but was too repetitive",
    "The strength of this course is that it challenges you to think critically and apply a scientific lens to science communications."

   "question_text": "What advice would you give to a student considering taking this class?",
   "comments": [
    "Understand that this course will likely leave you with more questions than answers--it breeds a critical eye both for \"what is known to science\" as well as for methods of testing \"what is known for science.\" If you are not prepared to do the reading--and it is substantial--then this class will be a waste of your time. You won't be penalized for not doing the readings, but that's beside the point: you won't be able to follow the arguments we discuss in class and thus miss the application of various theories to real-world problems, like understanding the drivers of polarization on climate change or gun violence.",
    "The topic of this course is interesting, but the material can become somewhat repetitive. The emphasis of the course is more on study design and validity than actually implementing science communication",
    "If you enjoy conceptual debates about how people think about science with a professor who is willing to push you, and reading academic literature about how people think about science (and then tearing it to shreds), then you will love this class! If you do not enjoy speaking up in class or don't feel comfortable jumping into debates where you aren't 100% sure of where you stand, then you may feel a bit awkward in the classroom environment. As someone planning to work in policy in an issue area related to science, I am glad that I took this class. I think that it helped me to work through some questions I had about why my issue area is so hard for so many people, although I still have several theories about why that we didn't get into in this class.",
    "It may be repetitive based on the topics brought up",
    "Definitely give yourself a lot of time to do the reading. It is dense and difficult and requires a lot of time."
