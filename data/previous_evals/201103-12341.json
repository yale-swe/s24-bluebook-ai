    "Independent research. All depends on your PI. Only requirements of the class are proposal (1-2 pages), mid-term report (a paragraph), final report or presentation (variable).",
    "BENG 471 is an independent study course, and its quality is therefore the student's to determine. The faculty is excellent and the opportunities for individual as well as group research projects are limitless. Equipment in the laboratories is top notch and the expertise and advising necessary for a successful project is at the student's fingertips. I would recommend without hesitation BENG 471.",
    "It's a wonderful way to get to do research! Find a good mentor (PI), it really makes the experience worthwhile and great!",
    "If you would like to do research for credit, do it.",
    "Research for credit was a positive experience. It definitely allowed me to make significant progress on my lab work."
