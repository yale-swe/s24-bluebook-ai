    "Great, great class. Ayala is amazing, and this class focuses a lot on literature, poetry, and Israeli culture. It's a lot more grammar than vocabulary. Quite a bit of homework, though it's never unmanageable. Quizzes aren't too tough either. The format of the class is a little unstructured, which can get frustrating, but if you've made it to L4, I really recommend this class.",
    "Ayala is awesome. This class is not particularly rigorous as language classes go, but if you put in the little extra effort, you can still get a lot out of it. I had a great time.",
    "YES! It was fun, not too much work and we learned a solid foundation of Hebrew.In HEB-140, we mostly fine-tuned our grammar and learned the passive forms. We also analyzed more short stories and learned how to correspond by email in Hebrew.",
    "Hebrew 140 was a really great class! It was a lot of fun and I learned a lot. I really felt my Hebrew improving, reading, speaking, writing, listening, grammar and vocab. The class covered many different aspects of the language, and my I think my Hebrew improved a lot, but it wasn't too toilsome. Even the lessons on grammar were interesting and not boring. The pace of the class was good, and the topics covered were really interesting and diverse. The class was pretty relaxing, like sitting down to lunch with a bunch of friends and a really nice professor. This is a good class to take to refine your Hebrew skills and to gain more comfort in the language before moving on to L5, or even before spending time in Israel. There's a good amount of work, but the regular assignments pay off in terms of getting you to see marked improvements in a short amount of time. There are also so many assignments that it's not as big of a deal if you miss some or hand some in late.Ayala is absolutely wonderful! She is such a good teacher, really good at explaining things and keeping a professional yet fun classroom environment. She was so understanding and friendly, and I felt really comfortable talking with her about things related to coursework as well as if I needed an extension on something. I really wanted to work hard in the class, as she created an atmosphere that made you want to learn a lot and that kept you interested throughout the course. She is a wonderful professor.We had Amit as a section leader - he is awesome! He was such a fun section leader, and he helped us learn too. He made things really clear, and he was easy to understand. One could tell that he put thought into what we did in section. He was also like a friend, and I believe we all felt comfortable with him and had a lot of fun in section. The section was a great addition to the course, since it gave us another chance to practice speaking. Amit was also always willing to help us and to explain things to us, even if it was over lunch at the Hebrew tables.",
    "there is a lot of homework and you should feel comfortable speaking basic hebrew before taking this course",
    "If you're reading this, you're likely already set on taking Hebrew and just finished or placed out of L3. To you, all I can say is that it's not a bad course. Ayala is very nice and most say she is a good professor. There's a good chunk of work, but no more than you'd expect from an intermediate language class. The tests are fair and the grading is fairly easy. We did the future tense and grazed over the passive binyanim; we didn't focus much at all on vocabulary. You write a lot, mostly analyzing stories or songs, plus the journal from L3.But to the two of you that are deciding whether to start Hebrew at Yale and are checking through all the classes to see what's ahead of you, all I can say is: pick something else. You will not learn nearly as much as you will in other language classes. It's not worth your time."
