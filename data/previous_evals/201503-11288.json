   "comments": [
    "I would not recommend this to another student. The idea is good, but the execution just doesn't turn out the way that you would hope. With the non-seminar like format, it means that you don't need to do the reading (something I only found out after the end of the course really...) and can still chime in. The use of laptops is distracting and mean that people have no incentive to pay attention. The reading list is very weak. Much of what we are reading is just not good writing (Mike Morrell's book is a prime case of this) or repetitive (Zarate's book is a great example of this) and we would benefit from chapters of these books, rather than the entire thing. The policy memo seems like a great idea - and it likely was - but some of the topics are simply too large as they are described to be handled in an 800 word policy memo. These could benefit from some refinement. Some of them could benefit from narrowing down. I do believe that using current events as appropriate (OPM Hack, attacks in Paris) is very important and I'm grateful that the course did use what we had learned in order to look at these topics.",
    "This is an excellent course with a manageable course load. It's a great opportunity to get to know one of Yale's most distinguished alumni.",
    "I will certainly recommend this course to fellow students."

    "The course provided me with a better understanding of some of the most significant issues affecting the United States and the international community."
