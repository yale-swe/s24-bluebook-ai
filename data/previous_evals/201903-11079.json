   "comments": [
    "Political Science Theory",
    "Great class. Taught intro to politics of the last 50 years.",
    "Survey of modern cold war era history",
    "This course gave a really good overview of how politics have developed in other major countries and big issues to consider going forward like Africa-China relations and early development in Russia.",
    "I gained some more understanding of events in modern politics and history.",
    "This class is fantastic, one of my favorites I have taken at Yale. Its the perfect blend between history and political science. Professor Shapiro introduces and uses theoretical premises to explain why events since the collapse of the Soviet Union occurred as they did. From NATO and the Rwandan genocide to the 2008 crash, this course will tell you why!",
    "I developed general knowledge regarding the last 25 years in history. Furthermore, I developed a more nuanced understanding of today's political climate and its root causes and what to do when moving forward.",
    "A whooooole bunch about so many things. Great class for recent history as well as a peak into what goes on in politics. Possibly one of my favorite lectures at Yale",
    "I learnt a lot about Professor Shapiro's theories on democracy",
    "I gained a concrete understanding of relevant international relations\/domestic politics history and learned about theoretical frameworks through which I can assess such history as well as current events.",
    "I've gained a thorough insight into global political developments following the fall of the Soviet Union, including those in China, Africa, the Middle East, various European countries, and America.",
    "Information about world politics over the last thirty years. Lots about the interesting and insightful views of Professor Shapiro",
    "I have a broad understanding of some of the major international social and political trends of the past three decades.",
    "I learned so much this semester in P&P. I feel like I have a good understanding of the state of the world for the first time in my life and that's pretty great.",
    "I learned about politics from the 1980s until today.",
    "I learned a lot about the dynamics in the word post Cold War while also improving my writing.",
    "Learned a lot about the global fight against communism",
    "It was the first history and poli sci course that Ive taken at Yale, and I learned a lot about the history of major powers in the world and how theyve interacted in the last thirty years",
    "The course covered the history and politics of the post-Cold War period. We studied how global power has evolved in the wake of the fall of communism. It was a thoroughly international course, as we studied political movements, similarities, and differences, around the world.",
    "Wide range of knowledge gained about international relations and world affairs since the collapse of the Soviet Union.",
    "I learned how to evaluate political science through a historical perspective. Additionally, I learned that it is insightful to examine political developments across borders.",
    "An overview of power and politics over the past 50 years",
    "A very comprehensive overview of foreign affairs, international relations, and the shifts in global power since the end of the Cold War.",
    "I learned more about the scope of global politics",
    "I learned more about the recent history regarding political power and global politics since the end of the Cold War. We touched on issues in Asia, Europe, Africa, and the United States, which provided a great base for understanding why the world has continued to change since 2016. Overall, I feel like I am much more informed about how business and governments coexist and\/or clash in their quest for political power.",
    "Knowledge of the global transformation of politics and economics post-Cold War",
    "A wide-ranging, surface level understanding of geopolitics of the last 30 years.",
    "This was the first Polisci course I've taken at Yale, and I thus learnt about various frameworks and methods of analysis unique to the field. Lots of the topics we discussed I had read\/heard about, but I thought we gained a lot of new and interesting insights that made me really enjoy the course. Very interesting lectures of South Africa and China too.",
    "This course was an extremely interesting summary of the history of the post-Cold War world. If you are at all interested in the shaping of today's world, definitely take this course.",
    "I learned about the political and economic underpinnings of politics today. I learned to write thoughtful essays on world politics.",
    "I learned so much about modern geo-politics, as well as domestic socio-economic politics.",
    "I learnt about the power dynamics of governments in the word and how they interacted with each other in situations of global crises.",
    "I learned how to better connect ideas between various political events and facets.",
    "I believe I improved my writing skills and gained a better understanding of the current global order.",
    "I learned a ton by taking this class. I think the class overall stayed true to it's mission to take us from post Cold War enthusiasm about democracy to today's pessimism. I never expected the answer to be so varied and complex, moving from things like the rise of the new Right to the Financial Crisis or even China in Africa. We covered so many fascinating topics, and since each lecture was on a different topic, they were never boring. Professor Shapiro does an amazing job looking at these events, and I feel like I have a much better understanding of the politics of today and how we got to where we are.",
    "I learned a lot about the importance of different political coalitions and interest groups in deciding policy outcomes. I also learned some basic principles of political science theory.",
    "By taking this course, I furthered my understanding of global politics and world history, specifically in relation to the US.",
    "An overview of the major moments that shaped today since the end of WWII.",
    "Better knowledge of modern history and solutions to political problems",
    "Literally so many things about international politics, US domestic politics, and comparative government since the Cold War. Specifically the factors that shaped the political climate since the end of WWII to the end of the Cold War and the things that caused the rise of todays politics of insecurity.",
    "Power and Politics greatly informed my understanding of recent political history, a period often warped by the biases of the lens through which it is looked at.",
    "My writing and time management improved as it would with any course that assigns large essays with significant grade impact. Although admittedly I didn't get to all the readings because of the sheer volume and my slow reading speed, my reading speed and comprehension improved. Often we were assigned hundreds of pages per week that got into minute details. At first my reading was bogged down absorbing these details, but eventually I got better at focusing on the big picture and zipping through. As a 19-year-old from Seattle, my worldview expanded dramatically."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths - interesting lecture Weaknesses - even though this is a 100 level course, understanding the lectures seemed to necessitate a background in political science theory \/ a lot of general knowledge about recent history",
    "It was really easy to not go to lecture because the course was recorded. I would have liked to have section for the class to reinforce what we learned in lecture.",
    "could have benefitted from a section; the lectures were decent but there was very little communication about expectations or what the content of the final exam would be. It seemed like the tfs weren't really sure either",
    "Strengths - Shapiro is a really good lecturer and has a lot of insight to add Weaknesses - We never really knew the grading unless we went to office hours, the final exam was strangely specific to the last few lectures and had typos, the guest lecture from the TA was incomprehensibly fast, we never got in depth with any topic because we covered so many",
    "Topic is very interesting but lecture style is unorganized and hard to follow\/engage with. Shapiro is all over the place and could do a better job establishing a foundation of more complicated topics considering this course is primarily undergrad.",
    "It was a lecture course and there was little room for engagement with the professor. I wished there were sections that met because a lot of these topics lend themselves to discussion.",
    "Professor Shapiro was a good lecturer, but very little engagement was required\/expected which made it very easy to not go to class and hence not get anything out of the course. Obviously this was on me, but section or something like that may have forced more engagement which overall would have made the course more of a learning experience.",
    "I found the volume of reading slightly intimidating, though when I did do it what Shapiro assigns is diverse and very interesting. I also really enjoyed the no-section-but-having-a-TA aspect of the class: for someone who likes to meet with TAs to run through papers etc. this was great because I was able to meet with someone even though the class was huge and open to the public. It would have also suited someone who prefers a more hands off approach. Christina, the head TA, is great. She was communicative personally and to everyone from start to end, and was very clear about lecture, paper, and final details.",
    "The lectures are very interesting which is a clear strength, however it is easy to have low engagement because of the large class size and I had wished that there would be discussion sections, that would help me better learn and understand the material",
    "This course gives a pretty good overview of the last 25 years of history from a political science perspective. However, I didn't really get the \"point\" the professor was making until the last few classes, which is confusing because he seemingly jumps through unrelated topics every other lecture. This course definitely needs more signposting. Furthermore, there is an insane amount of reading for this course (which is never touched upon in class except for one time), which essentially means that you don't need to do the reading. Some weeks it can amount to 400 pages, and other weeks it's only about 100 total. The final was also pretty narrow in its topics (there was one short answer question about a very specific theory about political parties mentioned probably once in class), and I didn't think that was really conducive to evaluating students' overall understanding of the material. I also didn't really know how to write a history\/polisci style essay before coming into this class and neither the professor nor the TAs gave any real guidance\/feedback on how to structure an argumentative paper, which I thought was a major flaw.",
    "The course is very unorganized and tries to tackle too many topics in one semester.",
    "Some lectures felt pretty isolated or didn't seem to fit with Prof Shapiro's narrative throughout the course. I think the course could be improved if Prof Shapiro spent more time each lecture tying the topic of the day into the greater narratives of the course.",
    "Great lectures and content No real weaknesses. Maybe have sections for discussion? This is the only class where I wouldve wanted to go to section",
    "The readings were fascinating, and the lecture mostly engaging. The only weakness of the lecture was that there was an occasionally excessive level of detail in historical events. I do not believe it was necessary to go over 15 Supreme Court rulings to illustrate one point or even a trend, particularly when the readings for that class had already gone over the details. A major weakness of the course was that it did not have section. Perhaps this was because it is not just for undergrads. However, I feel that section would have helped me engage with the readings a bit more, as it was not always clear how the readings and the lecture complemented each other.",
    "strengths: interesting material weaknesses: class was way too long and covered too much information, difficult to engage due to lack of section",
    "The course could be improved if lecture topics were better connected to each other.",
    "The main strength is that it's extremely in-depth, but the amount of information can be extremely daunting especially when you approach the final season",
    "Section",
    "It was too broad to be helpful or illuminating about any specific trend or event.",
    "The biggest strength is that there is so much quality information provided that you can expose yourself to. The biggest weakness, however, is that you only get out of this class what you put into it, and thus I think a lot of people walked away without having learned much.",
    "The content was interesting but the lectures themselves were long and often dull.",
    "It can be improved through adding sections or having more direction to the students in how to get a good grade.",
    "Strengths- low workload interesting lectures Weakness- none",
    "Strengths: few assignments, friendly and helpful TFs, Prof Shapiro is extremely knowledgeable, lectures organized well, learned a lot about the world Weaknesses: lectures can be a little slow at times, but great for the most part!",
    "The course's strength is its breadth, its weakness the pace. We could have moved more quickly through some parts of the syllabus. However, it was an interesting and comprehensive look at the subject it deals with.",
    "Professor Shapiro is an amazing lecturer and is incredibly knowledgable on a very wide range of topics. The readings, although lengthy, are super interesting and definitely contributed to the value gained from the course. The paper topics were also very engaging and I genuinely enjoyed writing the papers. No real weaknesses at all! All around fantastic course!",
    "The strengths of the course were the structure and number of the lectures, which allowed for a deep dive into the period. The course could be improved by shortening the lectures and providing sections.",
    "Weaknesses: wide scope of material Strengths: engaging lecture",
    "Strengths only. Truly a fantastic course, very intuitively organized and structured, extremely engaging, legendary professor. I am a senior Economics major, and this was the best course I have taken at Yale.",
    "Lots of interesting material, interesting paper prompts, sometimes disengaged class just by virtue of being a massive lecture with no discussion and some of the tax law stuff was somewhat dry",
    "I liked the lectures and Professor Shapiro did a fantastic job presenting the material in an easily-understandable manner. The lectures were always informative and engaging. I was pleased with the essay topics and the amount of choice we had in choosing a topic that interested us. However, the final exam was not well executed. There were no review sessions and seemingly little planning from the TFs. Additionally, it did not feel like the exam was well-tailored to the course material.",
    "Very lecture heavy, structured sections with TFs could have been helpful",
    "This course would benefit from having student discussion sections with the TAs. The office hours did not represent an opportunity to discuss ideas with other students, and a more regular and organized session would benefit learning.",
    "In terms of strengths, I think Prof. Shapiro is a great lecturer who clearly has years and years of experience in the field. He was extremely knowledgeable and open to answering questions. I also liked how varied the topics included in the course were - we travelled the world in terms of recent political affairs and gained great insights on how everything tied together. The course, however, was a bit hard to follow at times. Prof. Shapiro uses his own language to simplify lots of concepts, but I found that sometimes things got tricky. The IDs on the final exam (I took it on the second available day) were also harder than the ones offered on the first day (after speaking with friends) - this was definitely surprising.",
    "The strength of the course is that it is very pertinent and well-thought out. The downside was that the readings were very dry and I don't think many people did them. Also the TA's need to be picked more wisely.",
    "I wished there was more direction as to how to study for the final. A final review session with our TA's would have been really helpful.",
    "This is a fantastic lecture. I learned so much. It would have been helpful to have some more information on what we are expected to know\/be able to articulate going into the final.",
    "Weaknesses: some of the readings were too long and complicated and some of the terms used in class were complicated as well.",
    "I think the structure of the course was more lending to a purely lectural style as opposed to other courses.",
    "I believe that the course could have done better with a section in order to have students discuss the material rather than relying solely on office hours.",
    "Strengths amazing professor, fascinating lectures, not many assignments\/tests except two papers (during which I learned a lot) and the final (which was open notes) Weaknesses none",
    "The readings are great. Clips shown in class are also engaging. I wish there was historical reading followed by political science analysis instead of jumping right into the political science in a few cases like the readings about South Africa and the Northern Ireland. Also lectures overlap with readings a good amount. Maybe they could be separated slightly more.",
    "Strengths - all course material was provided online for reference (lecture slides, lecture recordings, readings) weaknesses - lectures were difficult to follow, seemed disorganized and rushed at times",
    "Great lectures!! Great course about a variety of important topics since the end of WWII. But you receive minimal feedback.",
    "Very interesting, but a lot of reading",
    "Strengths are the content of the course and the fact that professor Shapiro is amazing. Recordings of the lectures are posted online which is helpful for review. Weakness is that sometimes he goes a little too fast, assuming that students already know a lot of stuff but we dont actually... The last lecture of review is when I truly understood how everything pieced together. I would have appreciated if he kept reminding us of how each lecture fit into the big picture throughout the course.",
    "The class has weak communication, despite being the Devane lecture posted online. There was little to no communication about the final exam, and class-wide communications in general came monthly. Moreover, there was no feedback on assignments, and thus grade were incredibly inconsistent (as expectations were not communicated either). Improving this aspect of the class would significantly improve the course.",
    "Strengths: - Amazing lectures - Online lectures and office hours - Reasonable essay prompts and questions on the final (focused on concepts rather that memory recall and details; I brought over 20 pages of notes to the final but only referred to them once or twice) - Lots of readings and supplemental reading material available Weaknesses: - Readings were sometimes boring, dense, and long. Completing them in entirety would be a significant burden on my workload."

    "An interesting survey, but I'm not sure exactly what I will have walked out of it learning. It was my \"fun\" class, and I think there may have been other things I could have taken that I would have enjoyed more.",
    "Yes! It is important to understand the history of the last 5o years.",
    "maybe? i enjoyed the lecture but it didnt really have the structure of a typical course and i don't know how much i actually retained",
    "I would recommend this course to someone looking for an introduction to international relations or that wants to learn more about Russia or contemporary issues in American politics.",
    "I think the material itself is fascinating and something everyone should learn but the manner by which it is presented makes it more confusing than it needs to be.",
    "Yes it was a great overview of all these topics. Take if you are interested in the history of the world since the Cold War.",
    "Don't have much of an opinion either way. The course is okay and Shapiro gives interesting lectures. That said, I didn't get much out of the course. But it was easy if you need an easy fifth class.",
    "Yes, I would 100 percent recommend this course for anyone remotely interested in current affairs or recent history. Probably would recommend it to those who are not as well.",
    "Yes, I think that the subject matter of this course provides a strong historical overview of the past, current and future political climate, which every student should have a responsibility to know.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student if they wanted a general knowledge overview of the last 25 years in history. It's not really a great course in improving writing skills.",
    "Yes. I credit\/d it and that took off the grade edge. When you can sit and just listen, it really is a great class. Shapiro sometimes has a droning voice but his lectures are really really interesting. Take it to learn how our world works and why it is like this today",
    "Yes! It was very interesting to take a class that tried to explain broad trends in politics since 1989 while also delving into specific examples to highlight those trends.",
    "No.",
    "Yes, the course material is very interesting and relevant to understanding the current political climate and global trends.",
    "Yes, if you are willing to take a large amount of notes and write a lot for the essays and the final",
    "Yeah. Nothing special, but interesting material and not much work.",
    "Not really. You probably already know upwards of half the content if you pay attention to domestic and international affairs.",
    "Yes. It is a really interesting class that can provide you with useful and applicable information as well as new ways of looking at the world.",
    "Yes, if you credit D it. I think that it is very hard to get a good grade but if you want to learn it is a great course.",
    "It depends. I took this to learn about politics but if you dont understand anything you get confused. Shapiro doesnt explain what hes talking about he just expects that you know what it is",
    "Yes, if you are already interested in history\/poli sci or if you want to learn more about these topics",
    "Yes, if you are interested in contemporary global politics and the history that has shaped it.",
    "Yes! Super engaging if you're interested in international affairs. Professor Shapiro manages to cover a wide range of IR topics with great attention to detail in such a short time. Would highly recommend this course.",
    "I would recommend this class to another student if they were interested in the intersection of politics and history.",
    "Yes, it's a good summary",
    "ABSOLUTELY. Incredible course. My favorite course I have taken at Yale.",
    "Interesting\/pretty easy large history lecture",
    "Great Credit\/D. Interesting material and engaging lectures",
    "I would recommend this course because the information is quite pertinent to contemporary global politics and Professor Shapiro is a great professor.",
    "Yes, especially for anyone interested in comparative politics and historical background of relevant international issues we are witnessing today",
    "Yes",
    "Yes, it is easy to enjoy, and is a good opportunity to practice mid-length essay writing.",
    "Yes, if you are looking to gain an understanding of how politics has changed in the past 30 years. Lots of the topics are clearly relevant to what's going on today, and it was a pleasure to hear from such an experienced professor like Shapiro. The grading was also very reasonable and we got a lot of help from TAs.",
    "Absolutely, if you want to learn about today's world.",
    "Yes! The lectures are well organized and Professor Shapiro provides so many online resources to help you review what was covered in Lecture.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course. It is a phenomenal lecture--Ian Shapiro is interesting and engaging (and really, really smart), and gives a great, detailed overview of modern geopolitics--foreign policy\/relations and domestic economic policy. I think for any political conversation or debate I participate in, or decision I make about voting in the future, I will reference something I learned in this course.",
    "Yes! Its a great course, through which you can learn a significant amount of information about a large set of countries.",
    "I would recommend, but only if they have a strong interest in politics.",
    "I would recommend it. It is a great summary of the political developments in the world since the cold war.",
    "Absolutely. This has been my favorite course at Yale. Every lecture is fascinating and covers a different topic that plays into the course theme moving from optimism about democracy at the end of the Cold War to the pessimism of today. It's such a relevant class, and I feel like I finally understand so many of the landmark events of our times end of Cold War and Putin's rise to power, end of apartheid in South Africa, the new Right, Chinese modernization, problems of intervention in the Middle East, the Financial Crisis, etc. Professor Shapiro is an amazing lecturer. The readings can be a lot but you can just skim if you want the lecture's are key. Besides, the only assignments are two papers (interesting topics) and a final that is open notes. That said, I think that this class is best for people who already have at least some basic sense of recent history and politics and are somewhat passionate about the subject.",
    "Would recommend, it is a great way to get a sample of political issues today.",
    "Not particularly, because I found this course rather challenging and disorganized. It was difficult to communicate with TFs or the professor for assistance and clarification when needed.",
    "Yes, if you are interested in learning about economic and geopolitical events that have influenced and shaped policies today. You receive minimal feedback however.",
    "Yes. Its a pretty hard course in terms of intellectual challenge. Because of the amount of materials and the wide range of topics it covers, youre gonna run into things that youre very unfamiliar with. But in the end you develop a much better understanding of many things related to power and politics in todays world, ranging from political economy to comparative politics to military, etc.",
    "It was an interesting class, with a great lecturer and fascinating course material. Yet, the administration of the class is not conducive to supporting student learning.",
    "Yes, there was a lot of flexibility in how you receive the information and how in depth you wanted to take the material. It offered a great summary of the past 30 years of history."
