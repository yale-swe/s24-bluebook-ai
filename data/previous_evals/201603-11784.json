   "comments": [
    "I learned a lot about how identity categories functioned in the digital world, something I had never really thought about before. Like, how do gender or race affect how someone can engage with a platform like Twitter of Instagram? How does it affect the kind of content they produce and how it is received? I also learned a lot about disability, which I had never studied before, so that was extremely valuable.",
    "We learned about cultural and media studies, both in theory and in practice. We also had a practical lab designed to teach us about various mapping tool, along with other media skills.",
    "I gained a better understanding of the ways in which feminist critical theory exists in relation to other directions of critical thought, as well as a better understanding of how critical thought can apply to art.",
    "As an Art Major with a film concentration, I'm interested in thoughts about cause and effect. I've been very interested in marginalized communities. I selected this course thinking it might expand my understanding of what marginalizes and what keeps people in the margins. Little did I know that I would learn not only the how of what happens but also what can be done about it. This course carefully offers students tools that enable them to actively shape thought and culture around ideas of race gender and sexuality. I highly recommend the course as it goes much deeper to call students toward positive citizenship, it requires one to self-evaluate, to see the implications of not acting and to look deeper than what seems at first good enough on the surface."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The small seminar format was great for facilitating discussion. I think the professors also had reasonable expectations about how much of the readings we could actually accomplish, which made for good discussions as well. I also liked that this course assumed very sincere, individual engagement from each student right from the get-go, which made me want to put in that much effort. I think the course could be improved with better communication; sometimes it was hard to know what was expected of us for a given week, or a given project.",
    "There is certainly a strength in having three instructors because they contribute unique insights, so students can have many views on the same topic or hear something explained a little differently. I think the main weakness was the amount of class time - the seminar was two hours long, we'd have a two-hour break, and then we'd have an hour and a half of lab. Lab, while fun, wasn't always the best use of time, and the interim two hours weren't very useful because if you ate dinner, there wasn't much time left to work.",
    "This course offered a small group of students access to not one but two important leaders in the fields considered. The class succeeds as a workshop environment from which students can safely explore challenging ideas. This class asks a lot from students and office hours will likely be the best way to make the best use of assignments. This is hardly a weakness as the professors are actively available to students."

   "comments": [
    "Yes! It's a really different, fascinating lens by which to examine how identity works, and it's also so great to have a chance to really focus on art in the final digital project.",
    "As someone who didn't have much background in cultural\/media theory, this class was great. We started off with seminal works in the field, and the professors explained everything in an accessible way. We had a fun assignment where we researched social media platforms and presented them to the class, and the Digital Street Project, the major project of the course, was a fun way to apply the theory to any topic we wanted. So yes, if you are scared of theory and need practical applications of it in order to understand it, you should take this class.",
    "Yes. I believe this course could be useful to almost any student in promoting abstract thought, creative engagement, and imperative ideas about growing equality for all communities of people in the hearts and minds of the students enrolled."
