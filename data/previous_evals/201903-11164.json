    "Improved italian grammar, increased reading and speaking fluencey!",

    "Italian speaking and writing.",
    "I got a lot better at speaking in Italian.",

    "This is a great course! It is fun, interactive, facilitates student learning, and you learn A LOT. Not too much work other than the fact you meet every day, which definitely aids in the learning process",
    "Strengths: More speaking, I liked the online workbook exercise which help me to improve my grammar skills Weaknesses: None",
    "Sarah is a wonderful and caring professor! L3 with her is fun! Would have wanted a bit more incentive to study vocabulary.",
    "Its an engaging course, its super fun, the textbook is great. My only problem is that the textbook is WAY too expensive.",
    "Strengths- casual setting, community feeling Weaknesses- none listed",
    "I thought it was run very well.",
    "I think this course was overall very strong. I wish we had spent just slightly more time on the grammatical structures before each of the exams.",
    "Course workload is not overly demanding, exams are spaced well, conversation is encouraged. Even more practice with difficult grammar and vocabulary from ITAL 120 would have been helpful."
