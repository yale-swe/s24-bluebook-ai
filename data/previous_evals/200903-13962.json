    "A study of what the idea of the Western Hemisphere is. Looking historically through multiple disciplines - from cultural studies, historical cases, economic briefs, and primary letters - that allow the student to understand how the idea of the Western Hemisphere has evolved over time. The class requires a HEAVY amount of reading, and realistically it is impossible to do all - but as long as you remain well versed in a couple of them you will be fine. The short presentation is not demanding as long as you remain innovative and creative, and provide a point that connects multiple readings. The final paper leaves you with a satisfaction reflective of the amount of work you have put in the class. Professor Fein is a very passionate person in the material he teaches but he is sometimes very frank that at times makes some students feel awkward or targeted - he will call you out if you have not done the reading - but get over it and make up for it the week after. Be prepared to feel inadequate as Professor Fein explains very complex ideas in class - but approach the material with an open mind and try to learn something at every moment instead of feeling frustrated. In the end, a demanding but rewarding class that is pertinent to any scholar that plans to study and research the Western Hemisphere.",
    "YES! The course is challenging, but Fein has so, so much to offer. Certainly among the best courses I've taken.",
    "There were only 10 people in the seminar this semester which was somewhat difficult. Each person had to talk a lot and opinions were limited to so few of us that the conversations sometimes seemed repetitive. I overall enjoyed the class and would recommend it, but if you're kind of shy\/don't like public speaking, I'd recommend this class when it's a little bigger!",
    "Idea of the Western Hemisphere was a good course, and usually very interesting. The ways that the U.S. and Latin America thought about themselves in relation to each other are really interesting, and if you've studied one region or the other but not both (or even if you have studied both), the course will certainly make you a less provincial student of history. For that reason, I recommend it, despite the fact that it had one major problem, which was that frankly there was a lot of BSing going in in our discussions. There were two reasons for this: first, the course was about the history of the way people related to events that were occurring, which is more difficult to discuss intelligently if you don't really know the history of the events themselves. This would have been less of a problem if it weren't for the second thing, which was that by the end of the semester, for any given reading, for any student in the class, there was maybe a 30-50% chance that the student had read it. That isn't because we were lazy; the problem was that there was just too much reading, and it wasn't usually clear (especially later in the semester) how it was supposed to fit together into one semi-coherent day of discussion. This definitely made discussions (which were good) worse than they could have been, and was frustrating.",
    "The history of diplomatic, cultural, economic, and military efforts to unite the Americas under \u0093American\u0094 hegemony. After brief colonial ideas of the Western Hemisphere are discussed, the class becomes a history of the Monroe Doctrine and its cultural manifestations (in competition with narratives of the Americas in Europe and in Latin America). Films, music, literature, and artwork are among the primary sources. I would take the course both to learn the history of the Americas and to develop greater interpretative ability to apply in other areas. Seth Fein is a great professor and the syllabus is well composed--no reason not to take the course.",
    "Outstanding class. Learned a lot."
