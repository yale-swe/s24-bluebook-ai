    "You'll spend most of class time listening to presentations of other students\/ giving feedback and detailing plans for the thesis show. It's amazing with Lisa.",

    "Obviously you have to take this, but it's a good course! Hopefully your previous two seminars were better than ours were, but you'll finally get to collaborate on other majors' work and learn about artist statements, presenting on yourself, etc.",
    "req'd!",
    "It's required, but it's one of the better required art major courses that I've taken. Lisa is great, and it's nice to actually get to know the other majors in your year and their work."
