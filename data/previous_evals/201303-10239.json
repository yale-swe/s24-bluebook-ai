   "comments": [
    "If you have to take Math 115, I would recommend taking it with Professor Rolf. If you don't have to take it, I would not recommend it as a for fun class.",
    "If you are willing to be in a quasi-experimental math course with technology integration, this could be fun. If you don't think that'd be fun, choose another professor. Overall, Math 115 is difficult. It's fast paced, the problem sets are time consuming, and once the material is taught for the first time you will never seeit recapped again. If you love calculus, you'll be fine. If not, this course will make you rethink why you take math courses.",
    "It is integral calculus along with sequences and series. There are weekly problem sets, two midterms, and a final. There are weekly help sessions which are good, and you learn basic concepts in lecture. Take this if you like math. It is a lot of work and the exams are hard so if you don't want to put in a lot of effort, don't take the class.",
    "I really hated this class and dreaded going to it every day. I did not take AP BC Calc in high school (maybe that was the problem, I don't know) but the pace for this class was lightning-speed. The examples we did in class often confused me more rather than enhance what we were learning, and the problem sets were usually nearly impossible. The only way I survived this class was by having a tutor and going to office hours every week. If you have to take this class, take it with Rolf, he at least speaks good English. Overall, I would not recommend it, I left class every day with a headache and in need of a nap.",
    "Understandable if you take advantage of the resources and go to all classes--the problem solving sessions with Lam Pham are super helpful.",
    "It can break your spirit.",
    "I would recommend this class to other students, but only those who have already taken BC calculus. I was one of the only students coming in from AB, and even though the placement test put me here, it was a bit of a stretch. Only take this class after AB if you know you will have a lot of time to devote to keeping up with everybody else. This class is very fast paced and requires a lot of work on your end to stay on track.",
    "Definitely a worthwhile class, personally am thinking about math so I took this course just to refresh my high school math background. However, everyone should feel comfortable with basic calculus, therefore I recommend this class to everyone.",
    "Be prepared to work hard to stay afloat. Many students who had already taken BC found it difficult too since the class focuses more on concepts. If you have to take this class, take it with Rolf. He tries to make the material interesting and makes the classroom a more fun place to learn math.",
    "If I were to go back, I would only take this class if I took calc BC in high school. I really needed a professor who was good at explaining. The pace was extremely rapid and I found myself getting lost very easily in all of the material.",
    "a lot of people have taken BC before so if you havent you could be at a disadvantage",
    "This is not a great calculus class. The math is taught in class very quickly and without much explanation. The p-sets are reasonable, however the exams are much more difficult. The class is not taught as well as other classes.",
    "Take it only if you need it for some sort of requirement. Tests are hard (average is a C usually). Class is often hard to comprehend.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to anyone who is interested in Math. If you like math, and you can handle a break-neck pace, take this course (and definitely take it with Rolf). However, if math is not your thing, you might be wise to take something else.",
    "Math is NOT TO BE TAKEN LIGHTLY. This course , 115, is for people who have a STRONG hold of integration from high school math. It was incredibly difficult for me who happened to have a different teaching style in high school. It felt like every day and homework assignment was another struggle. Also, the tests are VERY HARD.",
    "I would recommend this class to another student only if they have a strong background in calculus already. If not, I'd stay away from it.",
    "No, I would not recommend this. Take any other QR credit if you need a qr."
