    "Good class, low work, interesting topic. The professor is very nice and receptive to feedback, but the class is overall a little disorganized even still. Also, I found his English a little bit hard to understand, though it was overall okay and not a lot can be done about that.",
    "This is going to be a difficult evaluation to write. The course covers extremely interesting material and is a reasonable amount of work, but I had a very hard time learning much from the lectures. Topics studied include numerical integration of ODEs and PDEs, sandpile models, phase portraits, self-organized criticality, model fitting, percolation, and chaotic systems. Those topics all show up on the problem sets. There were 5 programming focused psets assigned throughout the semester. I think everyone used MATLAB and that was what the professor used the few times in class when we talked about programming. The psets were very good in that they took a reasonable amount of time, were very interesting, and when I finished one I felt I understood the topics covered deeply and well. The problem was the lectures. I found I almost never learned anything concrete from the lectures, even after taking careful notes and paying attention the whole time. The first lecture was grade--the professor used some nice powerpoint slides and explained all the cool stuff we would learn in sophisticated but understandable language. After that they were uniformly worse. The professor was helpful during office hours, which was a godsend because otherwise the topics covered were difficult to even find online. Only take this course if you are extremely interested in the topics covered. Also, I had prior experience with MATLAB and I like the language a lot. If you don't have MATLAB experience or do have some but don't like it (how could you not like MATLAB?!?!), stay far away from this course. If you are on the fence, shop as many lectures as possible.",
    "This is a pretty neat class. I took it because I wanted to learn about cellular automata and chaos theory (since they are so cool!). We learned about those, but also numerical solutions to differential equations and inverse theory (essentially, curve fitting \"by hand\"--the actual algorithms for finding optimal coefficients to fit a curve to data). Those two things are really useful. I don't know why inverse theory is not a requirement in science majors: fitting a model to data is so central to science, and I don't think many science majors could describe the linear algebra behind how it works. Jun is a really good professor and the class is enjoyable. 9 AM in the G&G building is a lot, but it's OK. Go to class because participation is like 40% of the grade!",
    "A very cool class! There's not much else quite like it - this course is more or less a math class, taught by a G&G professor, and taken mostly by physics undergrads and a few E&EB grad students. That is to say, it's a fairly interdisciplinary affair, mostly dedicated to studying mathematical techniques with broad applicability in the sciences. Professor Korenaga assembles a list of topics that don't quite follow any textbook - the class is his own creation. It's a good survey of the topics listed in the syllabus, and even if you're familiar with some, it's not a bad way to review them and to build some formal foundations and\/or intuition. Remarkably, Professor Korenaga does a great job with both. You may be disappointed if you're hoping to study any one of the course's topics in depth; the class moves quickly and it's definitely a survey. But Professor Korenaga can recommend some good resources and guidance if you want to delve deeper into any part of the course. And a few IMPORTANT words of warning: Professor Korenaga's largest oversight is the list of prerequisites. The BlueBook states only that PDEs are required. In fact, the course requires a fairly in-depth knowledge of linear algebra. Do not take this course without having taken linear algebra - you will not be able to follow some lectures. And some lectures even go beyond what is taught in MATH 222\/225. These courses should be enough preparation if you are willing to play catch-up, but be prepared. Also, homework assignments require coding! Nothing too in-depth, but you will be unable to do the homework if you don't have some programming background. Matlab is best - Professor Korenaga will be most helpful if you work in that language. And on top of all that, PDEs aren't even a very important topic for the class. You might struggle with one or two lectures, but it certainly won't be a huge problem if you haven't taken MATH 247. The take-home message: You're best bet is to talk with Professor Korenaga about your preparation before committing to this class. But take it if you're up to speed!! You'll enjoy the class.",
    "This class covers a lot of interesting material, but lecture can be confusing and expectations sometimes unclear. Deterministic chaos, some renormalization group theory, and model fitting under uncertainty are all interesting topics often skimmed over in other classes, so I enjoyed being able to work with them here. While lecture did cover most of the necessary math, it wasn't always clear where the toy models we were using came from or what specific problems would the techniques we learned help with. Psets involve implementing the models\/techniques covered in class, so some background in programming is useful, but Prof. Korenaga is available at office hours and will teach you the Matlab you need (if you already know it, Python is also fine). Because they aren't assigned every week, the overall workload is pretty light, but these assignments are necessary for actually figuring out the stuff we cover in class. Grading is a little strange, with 40% of the grade coming from participation (attendance). Otherwise, grading on homework was lenient, but on the final was much stricter. This change was especially painful on some of the open response questions, where the expectations of the answer were unclear. Overall, I would recommend this class to someone interested in the material who doesn't mind some ambiguity in its presentation."
