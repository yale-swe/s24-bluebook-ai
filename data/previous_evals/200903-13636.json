    "I audited this course, and so cannot answer most of the questions. The material presented in class was clear.",
    "The knowledge from this kind of course is invaluable for an architect interested in urban planning.",
    "This course is VERY time intensive, but consistently so. Professor Tomlin was not clear at the beginning of the course that he wanted the assignments to explain your reasoning and procedure, so without this explanation many students were left with the understanding that he just wanted nice-looking maps. This is not the case, so in case he is not clear in the beginning of the class know that students should be very explicit in describing the process to get to the final answer.",
    "q.7: The Professor and TA were incredibly helpful. The Professor was always promptly responsive to questions. The Professor and the TA practically guided me through the entire course every step of the way.Q.10: This is a great course and increasingly an indispensable skill to possess!",
    "A course load is a little too much. I wish I could have spent less time on the assignments.",
    "Dana is an absolute champ. The weekly assignments can eat up an incredible amout of time if you let them, but there is always an opportunity to be more efficent. Dana is incredibly generous with his time and absolutely dilligent about answering emailed questions at all hours.A great introductory GIS course.thank you!",
    "The class is very relevant but the work load is very heavy, can be very frustrating without a helpful and very skilled TA - we lucky to have one who has all the qualities.",
    "Qu 4: The assignments were very time consuming relative to other courses.Qu 7b: The TA was overextended, I'm sure. He was very helpful, but there were too many of us competing for his time\/having issues with the assignments in the computer lab. There could be 2 TAs for this course.",
    "Our TA was extremely helpful and dedicated so much time to this course; he definitely needs to be commended for his availability and commitment.",
    "I was very happy with the course. The instructor was excellent while the TA was very helpful. One problem i faced was that since the course was more technical, it would have been helpful it we had at least an hour's work in the lab during the class session rather than us arranging a separate session with the TA to workout the tutorials. Besides, since my class clashed with the TA session, so i often found myself working on the assignments on my own. So it would be advisable to have at least some lab work during class session."

    "Professor Tomlin needs to be more explicit about what he expects in the assignments. He is very vague most of the time.",

    "It's hard to say what should be improved--the goal, I think, is to provide a basic instruction in vector-based mapping, and the course succeeds.",
    "A need to have all students seat at computer stations during the delivering of lectures. By computer stations i mean, students following up step by step on ArcGIS as the lectures are going on.",
    "The professor made a big deal of saying we shouldn't spend excessive time on the homework, but unless a student had worked with GIS before, it was necessary to spend upwards of six or seven hours\/week on each assignment to get even an average grade. The professor clearly knows this, because he has taught the class for many years. So, his constant \"plea\" to not spend too much time on the work started to get patronizing and made those of us who weren't GIS geniuses feel a little dense.",
    "Work load",
    "For the longer home works to go longer before they can be handed in",
    "can't think of a thing",
    "Grading system: much too difficult. It did succeed in making students put in extra effort, but I found that I was doing it at the expense of my other classes, and at times out of exasperation at being \"under\" or \"at\" average despite all my hard work.",
    "The pacing of the course was a little slow for me.",

    "excellent, very available",
    "Eric was very helpful and knew his material well. Once I started going to TA sessions, I found that I needed to keep going, because if I tried an assignment on my own, there was likely to be some aspect that I would miss (because assignments were very vague) unless I talked to Eric, who could nudge me in the right direction and remind me of things I was forgetting. I don't think this is quite fair, however--students should be able to complete the assignments to \"above average\" standard without the assistance of a TA. Also, Eric's hours were a little strange--I think some the day before the hw due date would have been useful.Dana was also helpful over email and willing to assist us anytime, any day.",

    "It is a very good tool course and for those interested in garnering tools in graduate school I recommend taking it early in the program so that it can be applied to other learning",
    "I am actually a joint law student, so GIS isn't a traditional course for someone like me to take. But, I studied wildlife and fisheries sciences before I entered law school and FES, and after I completed that program, EVERYONE wanted to know if I was familiar with GIS. The fact that I never took a GIS course in my wildlife program made me feel that it was a gaping hole in my education. I decided to go ahead and take this course to remedy that. Also, I want to practice land use law and will have future clients who use GIS on a regular basis. I think a working familiarity with the software will be invaluable in my future practice.",

ArcGIS has been shown to be very useful in supporting such processes and invariably sounder management decisions",
    "I feel like I needed this class for future work in land management. I wish we had had an end-of-semester project, rather than just another homework assignment, where we get to apply what we learned to a problem of our own choosing. That would have been helpful.",

I probably spent 15-20 hours on many or most of the assignments, aiming for \"average\" or \"above average.\" I've been told by previous students that the difference between the amount of work you have to put in for an H or HP+ as opposed to an HP is just not worth the effort. I don't know yet how well my effort will pay off, but I don't necessarily think I learned more by stressing out about all the little tricks I could add into my hw assignments. I think a better mastery of the basics should be a stronger focus of the assignments and the grading.",
