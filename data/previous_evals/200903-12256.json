   "comments": [
    "Essential, if you are interested in the way people use memory, or the change of memory over time, you should take this class. The possibilities for the final paper are vast, which is great, though the reading is not the most interesting I have completed in a history class.",
    "I would take it if you've just recently started thinking about shifts in historical memory over time and are intrigued. If you've been dealing with these \"problems\" for a while now, then it might be repetitive.It was a good course though. I got a lot out of some of the case studies and the theoretical work, whereas some case studies didn't really add to my general understanding of historical memory. I think I have a better understanding of how narratives work in general.I wish it dealt more with historiography relative to popular memory. In other words, I wish we had looked more at the writing of history itself as a \"problem in historical memory.\"",
    "Absolutely. It's a lot of work but so worth it. My classmates were brilliant, and I really liked listening to their experiences\/thoughts on the topic. Professor Blight is amazing. He knows how to have fun, challenge students, and stay down-to-earth. I feel really privileged to have tackled this course.",
    "If you can get in, take it! It was one of the best classes I've taken at Yale so far. The class really gets you to think, and the final paper can be on whatever memory-related topic you want, which makes it really interesting!",
    "If you get into this class, take this class. It has the potential to change how you view history. The readings are engaging and thought-provoking, the class discussions help you come to terms with the readings, and David Blight is a great professor, and a nice guy. The only thing I would recommend is that you start your major research paper early, and ask Blight to read a rough draft. The only weakness of this class is that unlike other popular junior seminars, there is no rough draft for the final paper. Otherwise a truly excellent class taught by one of Yale's best professors.",
    "Yes, especially if you are interested in the more philosophical aspects of historical memory.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS. two short papers and a final paper, great reading, blight is AMAZING - leads such interesting discussions. when i took this, the kids in the seminar were brilliant and i was consistently impressed with the level of discussion. he invites a seminar of kids who are humble but constantly contributing. DEFINITELY a yes.",
    "The class is about the intersection of memory and history and is very theoretical at the beginning. After the first four weeks, the class studies case studies, like how the Holocaust is remembered and how our memories shape may shape the history. The class is as much about history as it is about historiography, so prepare to be challenged in that way.I definitely recommend it, especially if you are very interested not only in specific examples in history but exploring what history is, itself.",
    "It starts with a few weeks of the theory of historical memory, which includes looking at the communal memory as well as the psychology of memory. Then you move into the case studies. You look at reparations, the OK city bombing and other memory conflicts. I found the conflicts based on american history far more interesting than the others and I would recommend that the others be dropped from the syllabus.",
    "Definitely. The class is not so much about historical facts-- each week provides a different case study after some very theoretical reading. But this was a cool, different way to approach history and allowed me to develop my own ideas. Work hard on the final paper, talk with Prof. Blight, and you'll be glad you did.",
    "Absolutely. If you can get in, take it.",
    "Great seminar. Blight's awesome. At least a book a week, 2 short papers, and one long research paper. So, it's challenging. Studying memory is a fascinating approach to studying history. I highly recommend the class, though it is often difficult to participate since most of the students are serious history majors.",
    "The course is divided into two parts: roughly one-third spent on studying historical theory and the remaining two-thirds spent on specific casestudies of controversial events in American history and how these events are remembered today. The historical theory readings can get a little dry, but the case studies are all fascinating. Professor Blight is an excellent teacher, and he really elevated this course to another level.",
    "Take this class. It is one of those rare courses where you will leave having learned something no textbook could ever teach you. You will discover an entirely new way of looking at history, and an entirely new perspective of your role, as an historically-knowledgeable individual, in affecting the general public's way of life."
