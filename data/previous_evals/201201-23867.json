   "comments": [
    "I found the class to be very interesting. More movies!",
    "This was a fun and engaging class, and a great way to learn from instructors who are actually working in the public health field on a day to day basis. I didn't learn as much as I had hoped from the class, and some of the assignments did seem to be repetitive.",
    "Keep refining that course! Every year I hear it gets better.",
    "This class has many strengths. First of all, the faculty are real public health professionals with a plethora of experience and knowledge that they bring to the field individually and as a team. The only weakness in this class is the limited amount of time that there is to cover all of the topics. The strengths of this class include peer interaction and collaboration, creative thinking\/project development and management, CDC and FEMA training modules, historical reference videos and risk communication overview.",
    "Sitting in this class, I would constantly ask myself, \"How did I end up back in high school?\" Perhaps there is a reason this class attracts so many undergraduates - it makes the transition from high school to college easier. This is the worst class at YSPH, and possibly in contention for worst at Yale.I base my evaluation on the following: the assignments and \"teaching.\"Unhelpful and impractical. Between the 5 instructors, there may have been about 0.35 of a standard YSPHteacher. The word teaching does not apply to this class. Assigning online courses from other universities is not teaching. Pressing play on a documentary is not teaching. Class time is not the time for documentaries. What graduate student wants to pay tuition to sit in a classroom and watch a documentary? This evaluation may not change the structure of the course, but please do not show the same documentaries. They were mostly filled with poorly outlined plots and commenters that were not even public health professionals. If you still want to take this course, let me tell you about the concept for most of the assignments. You will be assigned a fiction book, Albert Camus' \"The Plague.\" It is an excellent book that you should find time to read. But this is a terrible idea to use for class assignments. Every assignment prompt that is based on this book is impractical. You will be using the setting of this book, Oran, Algeria in the 1940s, to design plague investigations and surveillance. Thus, every assignment features arbitrary guidelines. You will be evaluated\/graded as if you are proposing an investigation in present day America, which makes no sense given the fictional setting that you must work with. Still unconvinced this class is a poor choice for any grad student? Let me shamelessly plug Public Health Surveillance currently taught by the head of New Haven DPH. There are pros and cons to every class, but PH Surveillance will give you flexibility to pursue your interests in surveillance. It goes into more detail and covers relevant material that will help you in your public health career. At this point, why even take a chance on Investigations? If you are looking to work in a PH department, it will be helpful to point to your transcript and say \"I took Investigation of Disease Outbreaks.\" Or you could point to Public Health Surveillance and also have the knowledge and skills that come with taking a properly structured course. Blue pill vs. red pill, Neo.",
    "At times, the grading policies were difficult to interpret. There was obviously a lot of time taken in grading assignments but some groups ended up with very low grades on particular assignments, so this may have been due to unclear criteria.",
    "Strengths: the protocol of outbreaks investigation and understanding the politics and regulations around investigating an outbreak, confidentiality, etc. Also if not trained to do so, learning how to create and give a good presentation. The book was also good too.Weaknesses: Because it is open to all majors, sometimes it was dumbed down for the undergraduates. Expectation of larger assignments were not always clear-I think the expectations of the instructors does not match what is being learned in class, which rely on too many powerpoint presentations. Not all the powerpoint presentations were uploaded and would like to be able to access them for personal use. The Oran projects were great in some ways but very confusing because we didn't know whether we could do something or not.Improvements: Understand that Yale is a heavily researched based school and that real life epidemiologist work is different and thus when creating epidemiological study designs, etc that we are trained in a more scientific, grant-based way. I understand the feasibility of the project we designed, but felt that it was never discussed how soon many outbreak projects are implemented and how long it takes. So instead of having outbreak presentations on XX disease, more on how to write up a proper non-academic report, study protocol, questionnaire and analysis. Also more group activities during class to understand how these investigations are run. The outline of the class could also have been done in a better way because it started off too slow and in a way that didn't prepare for the end projects.",
    "I found the subject matter was very interested and enjoyed the course format. I enjoyed all of the various scenarios since they were fun and interesting. Overall I learned a lot of practical knowledge.",
    "Good to get familiar of what outbreak investigation will be like in reality.Onlineresources is good.",
    "It was a well-organized course and I liked having a course taught from a different perspective: from 4 epidemiologists at CT dept of public health. However, the class was taught as if it was an undergrad class. We don't need to spend an hour discussing how to make a powerpoint presentation (just put it online and tell us to read it if we so choose). We don't need a powerpoint about the author of The Plague. Just tell us a few important things, but we don't need a slide with bullets about his date of birth. We have all taken epi 1 (and 2 for many of us) and so the instructors need to assume a higher level of knowledge. OF COURSE we know how to calculate an odds ratio, an incidence rate and how to do a 2x2 table. We don't need to spend a class session doing this 100 times for 100 different food items. This is a waste of time. Also, the assignments were VERY specific and were graded based on a checklist. We are grad students - you don't need to hold our hands. This is not to say I didn't enjoy the class. I did. It was one of the better courses I've taken at YSPH. The instructors were all clear, engaging and extremely knowledgeable. The videos were all interesting and I very much enjoyed the real-life case studies. However, I feel as though the course got very repetitive during the second half of the semester. We didn't learn anything new, nor did we go more in depth. It was just much of the same. For that reason, I think the length of the class is too long. 2 hours once a week (which many YSPH classes are) would be enough.",
    "This class was very disappointing.Weaknesses: Vague and ambiguous assignments. Very harsh grading for not including things that were never even remotely mentioned in the assignment text. Overlaps too much with the surveillance class. Lectures usually not engaging. Should not allow students without Epi I, and should be much more epidemiology-intensive.Strengths: One of the few applied epi courses at YSPH. Jim Hadler's guest lecture was a highlight lecture.",
    "This is an excellent course and really delightful. The instructors are all people that are working in the field and know what is important. They teach us in a very entertaining way, I really loved it. It is the kind of course that I feel always happy to be in class and did the homework having fun and not feeling a terrible pressure.",
    "Interesting course that gives a lot of practical public health knowledge that can be used in the real world. Although it is a long class period, the teachers usually did a great job of breaking up the class into more than just lecturing to keep things interesting.",
    "The first half of the class was better than the second half. The first half introduced new concepts and topics to the class through lecture and reading materials. However, the lecture presentations started to become repetitive in the second half of the semester since the presentations were based on the lecturers' experiences, most of whom work in the same field. Although I enjoyed the in-class projects, I would have also liked a review and discussion of brief concepts from the readings. This could have replaced the videos, which were interesting but could have been left out. Also, rather than basing the last few assignments on a fictional book, perhaps real situations could have been used instead.",
    "S: projects were instructive, and lectures, moviewIt would have been nice if the last required training (by FEMA) would have been better explained.",
    "Overall the course was interesting and was taught well. There were times however where there seemed to be unnecessary busy work. While the assignments were useful in general, some were not and it would have been helpful to find different ways of conveying material other than through assignments.",
    "Strengths: Really enjoyed learning about public health through the different trainings. The Salmonella in the Caribbean training, ICS, and isolation\/quarantine trainings were useful. Enjoyed the diversity of topics addressed. The midterm examination was fair. Really liked the first few weeks, bringing in real-life examples, and going through them. The videos chosen for us to watch in class and outside of class were very interesting. Having a team taught class was interesting here because it allowed us to be exposed to a diversity of skill sets and perspectives.Weaknesses:Unclear grading guidelines. Especially in the latter part of the semester when we were working on assignments associated with The Plague by Camus, there seemed to be a disconnect between what we were told was expected from us and what was actually expected. Given strict word limits, we cut information from our protocol on some assignments and then were docked for not fully outlining or justifying fully our responses because we were not allowed to. It often seemed as though the instructors only saw one potential way to conduct a study, though our classes throughout YSPH have indicated that there may be multiple ways to conduct a study appropriately. Also, the time warp thing for the Plague assignments was confusing. It was unclear if we should be envisioning ourselves as epidemiologists using 1940s\/current practices\/technologies. There was a lot of room for interpretation and confusion. Also, it would be good to diversify the class in terms of presentations. It seemed repetitive during the course of the semester in that much of the class would focus on going through powerpoint presentations of an outbreak that occurred. It would be better if these had been more interactive. Example: The ICS tabletop was useful. Maybe doing something like this with some preparation by all of us beforehand would be useful.",
    "The course topic is extremely interesting but the class was very long which made it difficult to stay on task the whole time.",
    "The fact that this is a team-taught course is a strength as students are able to hear from different professionals in the field. Also, the readings and screenings are very relevant and intriguing.",
    "The course was interesting and provided a good understanding of what outbreak investigations look like. I really liked the presentations on different approaches to real outbreaks. The class was not challenging but the grading was erratic. I wish they had not used the novel, The Plague, as much as they did. I liked the in class group work.",
    "I love the idea of this class; in practice it was a little disjointed, partly because there are so many (well trained and competent) instructors, so many students, and so many topics to cover. The assignments were wide ranging, but some were a total waste of time, and many were graded disproportionately to the amount of effort and intellectual engagement (the midterm was wicked easy and graded leniently, while the presentations we did were very time consuming and were graded quite harshly, for instance). Also, basing so many assignments on a fictional story was really frustrating on a practical level.",
    "It was very interesting to hear about the practice of public health from those people working at the state department who are doing just that every day. The case studies, although a bit hokey sometimes, also provided a good practical introduction to what public health work and disease investigation entails. The workload is very back-end heavy.",
    "Strengths: course teaches practical skills and strong basic understanding of disease surveillance and outbreak investigation. The incorporation of media, literature, and popular representations of epidemics, enriched the course a great deal. The interactive forum during an actual epi investigation was also fun and a good way to reinforce theoretical learning. Weaknesses: taught in a large-class format, it was difficult to get to know the instructors or have really productive discussions. Actual content and format of lectures sometimes was inconsistent with the syllabus."

    "Instructor: Matthew Cartter \u00a0Professor Cartter was very engaged in the course, and gave many real life examples from his work in the public health field. His lectures were not always as straightforward as they could have been, but he brought a lot of energy to the course that was definitely felt by his class.",
    "Instructor: Matthew Cartter \u00a0Our FIVE instructors were great. Carters' got the swag of a sage epidemiologist. Rabatsky offers excellent insights during class and Sosa has presented a few very interesting presentations of TB outbreaks, etc. Yousey is always a helpful presence in the classroom and tim styles always rocks the EIS Officer uniform like nobody's business.",
    "Instructor: Matthew Cartter \u00a0Dr. Cartter is a wonderful instructor and mentor for anyone entering the applied\/professional field of public health. He is extremely knowledgable and yet, he is still approachable. The same is true of Dr. Sosa, Dr. Styles, Terry, and Kim. Each instructor brings the major strength of having worked in the field of public health for several years. Each has his or her own unique knowledge and experiences that keep the weekly classesinteresting and interactive. Some of the lectures could be shortened but overall there are no remarkable weaknesses to report. They are all wonderful instructors!",
    "Instructor: Matthew Cartter \u00a0Dr. Cartter was very responsive and answered all of my emails quickly, which was appreciated.",
    "Instructor: Matthew Cartter \u00a0I think because Matthew Cartter is the primary instructor and has been doing this longer, he uploaded presentations and explained the work much better than the other instructors. I cannot comment as much on the other instructors other than the way they graded our assignments was sometimes harsher than expected. As stated before, their expectations versus what has been handed to a more academic-based group does not make for a project that meets to the standards of these state epidemiologists. Perhaps a grading rubric would help to ensure that we hit all the major points.",
    "Instructor: Matthew Cartter \u00a0I really liked Dr. Cartter and the Epi Squad and thought having several teachers allowed for a course with a large number of students to remain personable.Though I learned a ton from them, I do feel a little questionable about their grading. I don't know if this class will be on a curve or not but several assignments that I worked very hard on I feel were graded a bit harshly. What made this more of an issue was that I did real well on the midterm, so I'm not sure what exactly change to cause such a grade shift.If it is an issue that we the students are not providing the responses the instructors would like to see, I do feel the course should be changed in a way that makes it a little clearer on what you would want.",
    "Instructor: Matthew Cartter \u00a0Kind ascessible knowlegeble.Clear in instructing and demonstrating investigation methods.",
    "Instructor: Matthew Cartter \u00a0a great professor. very knowledgeable and patient.",
    "Instructor: Matthew Cartter \u00a0All instructors were good. All had experience and knowledge in different areas which was nice. My only problem was with the grading. If an answer didn't contain a very specific answer, then it was marked off. Epidemiology and public health don't work that way. There is room for interpretation. This is not an epi 1 numbers-based class. It is more about how to respond to outbreak situations and which measures to employ and which studies to undertake. There is room for choice and interpretation in all of this. If we don't agree with a specific measure that a CDPH epidemiologist would use, that doesn't mean that our answer is wrong.",
    "Instructor: Matthew Cartter \u00a0The structor is great. He is very kind, personable and has a deep knoledge of applied epidemiology. I can't see any weakenesses... They really think outside the box.",
    "Instructor: Matthew Cartter \u00a0All the teachers were great and each brought a different specialty to the course.",
    "Instructor: Matthew Cartter \u00a0The instructor has a lot of experience in the field. He and other instructors had very good presentations. However, as previously mentioned, the presentations became repetitive at the second half of the semester and reading material could be discussed and emphasized as well.",
    "Instructor: Matthew Cartter \u00a0S: talked to use about real life situations during outbreaksW: none",
    "Instructor: Matthew Cartter \u00a0Dr. Cartter was a wonderful instructor and was truly engaging and passionate about his work. He did a great job trying to galvanize students about the topics we learned.",
    "Instructor: Matthew Cartter \u00a0All instructors were clearly well-versed in the practical side of epidemiology, having spent a lot of time in the field. It was very valuable to hear their thoughts and experiences. Having it team taught was beneficial in that it offered us many different perspectives. It was useful in terms of being exposed to different ways in which practical epi can be approached.Unclear expectations on assignments.",
    "Instructor: Matthew Cartter \u00a0Really great, I really enjoyed hearing anecdotes about his past cases.",
    "Instructor: Matthew Cartter \u00a0Professor Carter is incredible when it comes to communicating with students. He constantly provides feedback and ensures the students understand the material he presents and how it is relevant in the world.",

    "Instructor: Matthew Cartter \u00a0All of the professor and TAs were good lecturers and great when taking questions. The grading was difficult to understand.",
    "Instructor: Matthew Cartter \u00a0Dr. Cartter is obviously really smart, knowledgeable, and good at his job, but he's not the best at public speaking or succinct delivery.",
    "Instructor: Matthew Cartter \u00a0All of the instructors provided valuable insight to the class. However, I did not feel that expectations were adequately explained, which led to poor grades in some cases.",
    "Instructor: Matthew Cartter \u00a0The instructor was effective, creative, inspiring, and sensitive to student ideas and feedback, though occasionally hard to reach (see issue with large class size). The teaching fellows \/ co-instructors were additionally helpful, and definitely improved the class."
