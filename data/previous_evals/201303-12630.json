   "comments": [
    "YES TAKE IT! A class with Heather is definitely not one to miss. She will get you loving English and excited about writing. Take if you want to improve your writing skills and enjoy the learning!",
    "Yes, if you like discussing very strange topics about childhood.",
    "Yes absolutely. I startedtaking this course because I didn't get into a section that I wanted to take. At first, I didn't have much interest in the topic of childhood. But after taking this course, the topic of childhood is very broadly applicable and Ms. Klemann brings in a lot of interesting conversations and arguments about childhood.If you are ready for hard work and eager to improve your writing, you won't regret taking this course.",
    "Yes, I would recommend It. I'd describe it as an scholarly essay focused class.",
    "English 114 is the basic english course that includes writing four papers (including a research paper that requires a large effort). This course teaches you how to cite correctly and how to have strong elements to a good paper. I would recommend this class to freshman to take in their freshman fall. It is a good class to take at the start of a college career. I would strongly advise students to choose their section of english writing class carefully as that can impact how you like the class.",
    "Yes",
    "The class was difficult to adjust to at first, but overtime you get get used to it. There was a lot of writing, but thanks to Ms. Klemann, I feel much more prepared to tackle college-level writing.",
    "I would say that English 114 is a great class, but one that has a fair amount of work. I spent a lot of time preparing for each English class, but it is all worth it in the end because I learned a lot of useful information to help me with my writing. I would recommend this class to other students because it is a good introduction English class that can help someone improve their writing.",
    "I think it's a great class to improve your writing and prepare you for any Yale course that requires writing",
    "This class is designed to help students hone their writing skills that they will use in other classes, so I'd recommend taking this class as a freshman.Taking a section of this class that really appeals to the student is key to enjoying it. Childhood is a fascinating topic to explore because, as the teacher puts it, us students are not far from childhood, yet we can also critically analyze our personal experiences.The four papers throughout the course are designed to have students practice the technicalities of writing that they see in the writings of scholars in their own work. If a student is willing to put in effort, he can strengthen his foundation for effective writing.",
    "I would definitely recommend English 114 to any Yale student, english or non english major. It is an excellent class, especially for freshmen, because it allows the student to learn how to write a good college essay."
