   "comments": [
    "We learned the present tense, imperfect, imperative, and composite past tense in L1. Using the Capretz French in Action program was super effective and the content was delivered well.",
    "I learned basic French vocabulary and grammar. This happened pretty fast with the help of a relatively immersive approach, good teaching and my background in Spanish. My vocabulary, writing and speaking skills are all still quite limited - my reading comprehension is a bit better.",
    "We learned how to speak and read French.",
    "French L1 conveyed a lot of information for an intro course. I took L1 spanish at yale and would say I learned more in french, even though I perceive the language as harder. We learned simple tenses to talk about the past, the present and the future and enough vocabulary to get by in every day situations.",
    "This course taught me the basics of French, including French vocabulary and grammar.",
    "Writing, listening and speaking in French.",
    "This course had a very heavy work load, but I think it really paid off. My skills in french grew immensely and I am excited about the language.",

   "question_id": "YC403",
   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The strength in the course is the active learning style. I usually hate \"active learning\" because at this school it's impossible to have that much energy. But with this class it's honestly fun and engaging to learn and practice together. The weakness is probably that it's exhausting at the end. Homework every night, class every day, a test and an essay every week... it can burn you out.",
    "The biggest strength is that you are working on the language every day so you are constantly learning. The instructor sometimes used more English than I would have liked, but this maybe have been necessary for students with less aural comprehension than I had because of my previous knowledge of Spanish. One weakness is that kids often don't watch videos for the required second time at home and thus aren't quite prepared for the lessons.",
    "I really liked the way the interactive learning worked; from the beginning you are constantly exposed to french native speakers through videos and the teacher, which gives you a sense of the language quickly. One downside was that homework was only checked once a week on tuesdays and quizzes were on monday, so it felt very heavy early in the week and I often times did all the homework on the weekend rather than every day a little bit as it is suggested by the course. I would prefer regular control like they do in spanish, even if it is online.",
    "A very well-structured, well-taught course. I do not have any substantial criticisms.",
    "The biggest weakness of this course was that at times there was a miscommunication between each section's teachers and the professor writing the tests. This led to at times being underprepared for and unexposed to aspects of the weekly tests.",
    "The course offers a strong grammatical foundation for French and is taught in an engaging manner - French in Action, although outdated, still provides an element of live accessibility that a textbook doesn't provide in the same way. As I mentioned, however, FIA is definitely outdated and I'm not sure how careful section leaders always are to remedy now-obsolete terms\/turns of phrase."

    "I highly recommend this course. I took it as a Junior who came here L5 Spanish. I filled my language requirement freshmen year and took French for fun. I don't regret it at all. As an MCDB major this was the easiest 1.5 As of my career at Yale. The workload was manageable and the tests were predictable. I easily scored 95+ on every one of them, and I had no prior French exposure. Just keep on the workload and you'll be speaking French in no time. Awesome class, my favorite one so far.",
    "Yes! The immersive approach makes the process of language acquisition exciting and manageable!",
    "Yes, French is a useful skill and well-taught at Yale.",
    "If you want to learn french at any point in your life, I cannot think of any better way to do it.",
    "Yes, this was a very good introductory language course and I feel that I am prepared for the next segment. I feel that I have basic French skills after only one semester.",
    "Yes. It's superb!",
    "French is very well taught at Yale and I would recommend the course to anyone who wanted to learn it."
