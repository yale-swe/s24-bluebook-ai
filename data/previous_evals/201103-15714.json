    "I like this course, since it is very important for PhD students. As a PhD student, reading papers and discussing with other persons are obviously very necessary; thus, this course gives us chance to study this ability. We can present some papers we are interested in and during the process of presentation some people can give us useful comments and suggestions which are helpful for our future presentations. Of course, their questions during the presentation are also helpfulfor our understand to the content of paper.I will recommend this course to PhD students and some undergraduate students who want to pursue research careers, because this course will teach them how to read papers and how to propose novel ideas. I personally think the course is really very interesting."

    "Of course the course is very important for my research. I need to give two presentations in the course, and this training is very help for my future research career. The presentations in the course are like the simulation of the presentations in the conferences, thus exercising us.In addition, reading papers and finishing the reviews of those papers are helpful for my research career. In the future, I will obviously help some conferences to review papers, and this course teaches us this ability. Another obvious thing is the course lets us to read many papers, and this thing is very important. As a PhD student, it is obvious that I need to read many papers, and the course helps me to do this."
