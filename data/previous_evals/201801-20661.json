    "Basic Chinese language speaking, listening, reading, and writing",
    "Chinese level 2 I feel like my speaking and writing ability have greatly improved by this time in the year",
    "greater ability to speak\/read\/write\/understand the chinese language",
    "Learned to write many new characters, worked on accent and new vocabulary.",
    "I improved my written Chinese to a point that I have enough grammatical context to interpret simple media created in China for Chinese people. I can now use authentic text to contextually learn new characters and grammars. There is still something to be desired in terms of my spoken Chinese, but that is something that only really comes with immersion, and a college language course can only do so much to provide that.",
    "A lot of insight into the Chinese language, also can hold a conversation to a degree after two semesters",
    "I am much better at reading, writing, speaking and listening to Chinese",
    "Intermediate Chinese grammar, vocabulary and pronunciation.",
    "Intermediate Chinese grammar, vocabulary, and pronunciation.",
    "Chinese vocabulary, pronunciation, character knowledge.",
    "I gained insight into basics of Chinese culture, grammar, writing, listening, speaking. This semester focused mostly on more advanced grammar patterns, compared to the previous which focused more on pronunciation. I specifically feel that I am now able to express specifics of: where, what, when, how, why. For a large number of concepts, I have a basic grammar pattern which allows me to express it. The course was completely transformative, I am now able to make jokes in Chinese, and use difficult concepts like the ba construction.",
    "The ability to effectively carry out basic communication in chinese",
    "Knowledge of how to read and write characters, grammar, pronunciation, and skills to engage in basic conversations via practicing dialogues."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "All around felt like an amazing course, I dont really have any ideas on how to improve it. Maybe offering more ways to consume Chinese media like music or tv",
    "none! great class",
    "Excellent professors, very involved and passionate.",
    "Given that the teachers and curriculum are the same style as for CHNS 110, this course is able to build well on an established knowledge base. This is both a positive and a negative, however -- it makes for efficient learning, but that implies very focused, topical learning. More engagement with Chinese media not created specifically for the course would make the experience a little bit more universal -- I don't feel like my Chinese exists much outside of the Li You Wang Peng universe yet, but I may just be impatient. Also, 120 is more grammar-based whereas 110 focuses a lot on pronunciation, and while this is a logical progression, pronunciation in Chinese must be drilled and drilled and drilled before it becomes natural, and some students forgot a bit of what they'd learned in 110 as the semester went on. The teachers, however, know exactly what an English speaker learning Chinese needs in the context and can answer pretty much any question that is asked, no matter how convoluted.",
    "Weaknesses: no curve which is very hard with chinese natives in the class and a lot of work",
    "I think it is great the way it is",
    "The course is structured very well to learn Chinese intensively.",
    "Very well structured course if you want to learn Chinese intensively.",
    "No weaknesses.",
    "Strengthes: Pacing, instruction, homework assignments. Weakness: There were too many students in the class.",
    "I honestly can't think of any weaknesses. The class is taught extremely effectively.",
    "The program is incredibly well designed. I cannot believe the amount I have learned since starting this course in the beginning of the academic year.",
    "Strengths- daily meeting and homework is effective in building a solid language platform, teachers are very encouraging and supportive, classroom is very interactive Weaknesses- memorizing dialogues is tedious, sometimes daily quiz content didn't match up with what was in the schedule, oral exams were unnecessarily difficult when we had to read instructions for correct response format and listen to audio simultaneously"

   "comments": [
    "If you took L1 you have to take this, but in any event, it's worth it.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student if they are interested in Chinese. This course is a lot of work so only take it if you are truly interested in the language.",
    "Yea definitely, I am convinced this is one of the best language programs",
    "yes!!!! teachers are great and make class very fun and interesting",
    "Yes as long as you are willing to put in a lot of time and effort, you will get a ton out of it.",
    "Yes! The Chinese department at Yale is amazing in how much it teaches you without drowning you in character learning and translation -- it's efficiently educational. A very well-organized entry level course.",
    "Yes definitely although its very hard you do learn a lot of chinese even as a omelette beginner",
    "Yes, the teachers are great",
    "Yes.",
    "Yes, it's a very well structured course if you want to learn Chinese intensively.",
    "Only if the student has a strong desire and clear reason to learn Chinese. Otherwise it is too easy to lose motivation and fall behind because it takes a lot of work to learn this language.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course. This is a unique, incredible opportunity. This course is incredibly valuable. I really can't imagine a better way to learn Chinese while living in the United States. The opportunity to engage with the professors and tutors, along with the pacing of the course results in an extraordinarily fast and efficient gain of skills. The professors are extremely good at teaching. I sincerely think Yale likely has the best Chinese program in the country.",
    "Perhaps the best teaching in any class I've taken in my four years at Yale. If you're interested in learning Chinese, this is a great way to do it.",
    "I highly recommend this course. It is a lot of work but it is worth it. Being able to communicate in another language is a super important skill and one that the yale chinese department will help you hone.",
    "Yes, if Chinese is a language they'd like to pursue and have enough time to dedicate to studying this subject."
