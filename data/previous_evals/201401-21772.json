    "If you are interested in the profession of philosophy in the 18th century and early 19th, this course is a must take!",
    "A course that I would definitely recommend. Gives a very good account of the philosophical problems that began to take the stage during the transition between the enlightenment and late modernity, as well as a firm understanding of the early figures in the Continental tradition. An area of intellectual history underrepresented in the philosophy department. Also useful for English majors who want to know where in the world Romanticism was coming from. Professor Franks is a good lecturer who ties the material together well and is approachable.",
    "Good class if you like philosophy, interesting readings with engaging assignments."
