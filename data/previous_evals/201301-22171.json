   "comments": [
    "I would not recommend this class. It was extremely disappointing.",
    "Easy WR credit, section was more important than class. One big paper with multiple drafts, but no HW whatsoever other than optional section preparation and exam studying.",
    "An overview of the Roman Empire from Julius Caesar to the early Byzantine Empire. Really interesting, especially for those people like me who had only done the Julio-Claudians before. Worth taking.",
    "fantastic class, Professor Matthews is funny and engaging and the class is very well organized. i recommend this course without reserve.",
    "Prof. Matthews' winding lectures, while rife with interesting facts, were really really hard to follow. I really wish this class had had more conceptual direction than it just following a 500-year-long timeline. The 15-20 paged research paper also sort of came as a shock, but the TFs are helpful in trying to navigate that, as long as you start early enough. I dunno, this class was really just so-so. It is very much just a series of events that don't always connect, and there really wasn't much in the way of a social history. On the positive side, Prof. Matthews is really kind, knowledgable, and approachable, and his lovely British accent was very pleasant to listen to each class.",
    "Better than CLCV 206, Roman Republic. Matthews is a good lecturer. However, there is a lot of information in this class.",
    "This class is great if you're a classics major, but as a science major I found it a bit difficult to keep up because it moves incredibly fast. I found that a lot of people taking the class already knew a tremendous amount about the topic. Professor Matthews is a great lecturer however, and I wouldn't miss a single one of his lectures.",
    "I enjoyed the course -- Matthews is great and endearing, and he makes Roman history interesting. Workload is very manageable, even when taken as a writing. That said, there's a lot more work towards the end of the course (final paper + final exam), but the paper wasn't too bad to write, and the exam was very reasonable (no obscure, out-of-the-blue ID's).",
    "This was an excellent class. I highly recommend taking it. Professor Matthews was a phenomenal professor--his lectures were always interesting and he clearly cared about the subject. The TAs were also good. Additionally, the subject matter is interesting, and there is not too much emphasis on memorizing minute details but on understanding major themes. The reading is primary sources, which is great because it gives you the most unblemished view of history possible. I also thought this was a great writing creditbecause there was only one term paper (4000-5000 words). Take it.",
    "Only take this class if you are a classics nerd and have pre-existing interest and knowledge in Roman history. The lectures are quite dry, and given that they are largely a discussion of events in chronological order, it is often very difficult to pick up important themes. There are too many emperors, and many of them run together. The course readings are very boring, and although I hardly touched them, some knowledge of them is necessary to do well in the class. This is not an easy class by any means, and the combination of an exam and a 15-page final paper with very vague guidelines is a lot to handle compared to other history classes. Bottom line, if this stuff does not already interest you, this class will do nothing to change that, and it will be a struggle.",
    "This is an EPIC and wonderful course. It's the Roman Empire, for god's sake. You will fall in love with classical history. Take it even if you aren't a history major. Reasonable workload if you take it for a non-writing credit: a midterm exam, a final exam, and lots of readings.",
    "Unorganized with very incoherent themes. The evaluation is also very random and doesn't make sense. I thought the class ruined the material.",
    "I would not recommend this class to another student because I think that there are better history courses at yale. The information which is covered is extremely interesting but the lectures do not provide enough insight to make it worth taking the class.",
    "The class is an overview of Roman history from when Caesar crossed the Rubicon and began a civil war that led to the founding of the Roman Empire to the sacking of Rome and the aftermath of the Empire. It covers the rise of Christianity and the economic and political aspects of the Roman Empire throughout its 4 and half centuries.",
    "The Roman Empire is a great course for anyone interested in the subject. Professor Matthews is engaging, and the workload is manageable, so I definitely recommend the course.",
    "CLCV 207 covers nearly all of the history of the Roman empire from Julius Caesar's revolution to the mid-6th Century in Justinian's Byzantium. I strongly recommend this class to another student because Professor Matthews is one of the best. You will learn abundant amounts of interesting information about the Roman empire.",
    "The Roman Empire is an interesting period of history and if you are ready to due the required course readings and take notes in class, this class should go smoothly for you. The 11 to 12 page research paper is a lot of work, but you are provided with a lot of support and advice from the T.A.s and there is a lot of information available about the Roman Empire. This class is useful not only because it teaches history but also because it helps you analyze bias in primary texts. I only recommend taking this if you are interested in Roman History, otherwise you will have no drive to go to lectures or do the work.",
    "Just make sure you know exactly what the course is about before you make a decision.",
    "I took this course as a second semester senior with an interest in classics and history, and it soon found a place in my top 10 favorite classes at Yale. There's a lot of material to cover, given the long history of the Roman Empire, but the workload did not feel like a burden. The professor is approachable, brilliant, and enjoyable to listen to. It's also amazing how relevant Roman history is to the rest of Western civilization.",
    "I thought that this was an excellent survey course of the Roman Empire, in particular for students with little background in classical history. Take this course with Professor Matthews, who is a most enthusiastic and engaging professor."
