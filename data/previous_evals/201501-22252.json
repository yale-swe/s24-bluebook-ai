    "Great lectures, great professor, only one paper, two exams. It is one of my two favorite classes I've taken at Yale. Glenda Gilmore is an amazing professor who's really good at keeping lectures interesting week after week.",
    "Yes yes yes!! Take this class. Im not even a history major and i loved it.",
    "HIST 131 provides a very good overview of the developments of US politics and society for the first half of the 20th century. Prof Gilmore does a great job drawing students in and keeping them engaged throughout the semester. Lectures and readings were both very interesting and Prof. Gilmore does a very great job balancing the line between teaching key material (that most students knew from high school) and new \/ more complicated interpretations (especially surround issues of race, citizenship, gender). One paper (10-15 pages), weekly readings, and two exams are all the course requires - a great lecture format paired with a reasonable amount of work. Overall a worthwhile course if you are interested in American history (especially if you plan on focusing your major in the area) or if you need to take a course with a professor who will be an awesome advisor \/ teacher. I would recommend you not take this course if you just need a history credit since you've probably covered much of it in high school.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student! This course gave me a great background on the great social movements that permanently marked American history. We looked at the Progressive movement, the labor movement, women's rights, Civil Rights and the impact of the world wars on public opinion. The period covered by this class is often overlooked in high school and I was pleased to learn more about WW1 and the connections between popular opinion and public policy. I gained great insights about propaganda and the pervasiveness of racist or sexist ideas in the speech and actions of American politicians.",
    "This is a great class if you're interested in American History. Professor Gilmore is great. This was a very interesting time period with applicable lessons to issues the US is facing today. Her lectures are engaging and interesting. The material is accessible to anyone from any background, and it's a good, thorough introductory survey class. It's neat to not just learn events and dates, but to also hear stories of people who lived through these events and understand the social, economic, and political context that shaped and influenced the course of history.",
    "Glenda was an excellent professor. This class was originally designed as a large lecture, yet only 8 students took the course so it became quite like a seminar. Glenda made an effort to demonstrate the personal dimension to this time period she often described specific times and events by tracking the lives of ordinary individuals. The class was quite informative and engaging. My favorite part of the course was its final paper. Professor Gilmore was very good at offering feedback and advice.",
    "I thought this was a fantastic class. The time period is fascinating and very relevant to discussions about where the U.S. stands today and where we are going. I learned a ton and have already engaged in several interesting discussions outside the class using what I learned. Methinks I will continue to for a long time. Prof. Gilmore is a gem. She is the most caring and hard-working professor Ive ever had. Basically the entire class met with her individually multiple times to discuss the single question paper and got her invaluable guidance. She provided in-depth, personal feedback on both exams and papers. Also, she was always open to mid-lecture questions and even willing to be corrected at points. In this way she was humble, flexible, and very clearly brilliant. The course was supposed to be a big lecture but ended up being smaller than most seminars Ive had. There were about 10 of us in a small seminar room. This, I believe, contributed to my favorite kind of class: the leminar. In this way, Prof. Gilmore lectured to us but we always felt personally engaged because of the intimate setting and, like I said before, it meant we got to participate in the lectures and ask questions. It was ideal. I think more classes at Yale should be like this. That said, if the class gets as good reviews as I think it will, I doubt this leminar format will ever happen again, which is a shame."
