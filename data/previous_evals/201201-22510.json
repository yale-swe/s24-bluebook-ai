   "comments": [
    "Its a good class, definitely one of the more practical global health classes at yale. Although the work load is the same as other classes at yale, something about the way the class is currently run makes it more stressful than it needs to be. You'll come out of it learning a lot but it would be nice if this goal was accomplished in a more relaxed way.",
    "Such an excellent class. You will learn incredibly practical life skills. The Curry, Bradley, Skoniezcy teaching team is absolutely great, and it is clear that they care about your success (which will, in turn, make you want to work really hard in this class - in a good way). Lots of really cool guests come in, and you walk out of the class more prepared to tackle the real world in general. Take it!",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to someone interested in working in global health in the future. Wealth of information to absorb.",
    "I highly recommend to anyone interested in global health-- regardless of whether the interest is in research or field-practice.",
    "Well, while the course will be changing quite drastically for the next batch of students taking the class, the core will be the same -- the strategic thinking process as championed by Bradley, Curry, and Skonieczny. This was probably my favorite class as an undergraduate here at Yale, especially given the applicability of the class and the new frame of thinking it provided. If you are in a position to take it, take it. If you don't get in, fight to do so. It is worth it, despite the time-consuming, sometimes-stressful work. It was a blast. You also learn how to navigate powerpoint presentations really well.",
    "Great introduction to how people have to work in the global health world. I'd recommend it with the change I addressed earlier.",
    "An interesting class to start thinking about solutions to global health problems. Although I wish it got more specific, I think it is a great opportunity to step back and address large problems in a systematic, strategic way. I definitely see how I will apply tactics I learned in this class to my future work.",
    "YES - if you are interested in global health. And if you are interested in learning how to approach problems, come up with a viable solution, and present\/ sell this to the client. Felt a bit like consulting cases!",
    "Yes, anyone interested in health, policy, NGO work, or leadership should take this."
