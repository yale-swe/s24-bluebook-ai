    "Familiarity with Moyen franais; with scholarly and historical commentary concerning Montaigne and his influences; with the life and writings of Montaigne. High level of discussion grappling with nuanced ideas.",
    "By taking this fantastic course, I learned an enormous amount about Montaigne, a philosopher to whom I had only been briefly exposed in the best. We discussed the origins of Skepticism and conducted fascinating close readings of Montaigne's texts in class. I learned so much every single time this class met.",
    "My written french improved immensely."

   "comments": [
    "This was an extraordinary course: Madame Brancher's mastery of Montaigne's oeuvre and her all-encompassing knowledge made for illuminating discussion and helped us to draw a wealth of connections across centuries of literature; the chance to work hands-on in the Beinecke was rewarding. My only request for this course, if it is to be taught in the future, is that we meet twice a week, rather than once. The more the better.",
    "This course had no weaknesses that I could see. Its strengths: the professor is absolutely brilliant, she does a masterful job of managing the seminar, and the course material is captivating."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "Without hesitation, on account of Madame Brancher's excellence and the subject matter. Montaigne is a writer whose gift for wordplay and ability to rest within the contradictions he exposes are unparalleled. A joy to read, and a joy to study with such an accomplished scholar.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. The professor is incredible -- maybe the best you'll have at Yale. Don't go in expecting a traditional Yale seminar; it's more in line with the European style, in which the professor talks for most of the class. It's kinda like a lecture, but with the professor letting everyone interject whenever they want and also asking everyone questions intermittently. You'll learn an enormous amount about Montaigne. And it's also just such a comfortable, casual setting. You will love going to it, and every time the class meets, you won't want it to end.",
    "If you are interested in Montaigne and love the French language, definitely take this course. I learned so much and the workload was very reasonable."
