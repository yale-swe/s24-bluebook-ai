    "Very good class. We read a lot of interesting material, including books that you would want to read for pleasure but don't have time because Yale life is too busy. We watched a good number of movies, which was also nice. The class is very relaxed, although there is a composition due every week of a page and a half. This class will most likely not improve your conversation skills, but it will keep you from forgetting Italian. I would most definitely recommend.",
    "I would definitely recommend this L5 class. It's a lot of fun, includes film and culture, and you forget that it's a class.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class to another student. You will learn so much without feeling stressed.",
    "Fun Italian class. Not too much work but a good way to keep up Italian skills. Interesting readings and movies.",
    "Take it! The class is fun and fairly easy, and definitely helps you to read and write Italian better (as for speaking, it didn't help me all that much, but maybe that's just me)",
    "Italian 150, like all the Italian courses, is great. The readings are actually quite fun--no more historical readings; the course is focused on modern-day issues and pop culture. Professor McCarthy King is a little tough on the composition grading, but your writing does get significantly better as a result. The only thing that disappointed me about this class (besides the fact that it was more work than in Italian 3 or 4) was that conversation wasn't quite as \"fun\" in class. It was very, very structured, unlike previous Italian classes in which we would go off-topic, but greatly practice fluency in our speaking as a result.",
    "Yes! This class is a really fun way to keep up your Italian without too much work.",
    "Not too much work, and a great way to keep up with Italian. The focus of the course is on conversing and there is virtually no grammer work. I highly recommend it."
