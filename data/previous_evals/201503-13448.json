I would recommend either less memos or scraping them entirely. Check-ins with faculty supervisors are more important and a better use of everyone's time",
    "back-and-forth with project advisor limited, advisor did not provide much substantive feedback",

If the project advisor or client needs something by a deadline, I will have completed that deliverable by that time.

Unfortunately, it's hard to suss out the good clients and projects at the beginning of the semester.",
