   "comments": [
    "MUSI 131 was an introductory musicology course. I would recommend it to other students, but I would take it Credit\/D because it requires more work than most would want to put into a course not in their major.",
    "This is one of the best classes I've ever taken at Yale! I looked forward to every single lecture and the 4 assignments were actually pretty enjoyable. Professor Kreuzer is an amazing lecturer and so knowledgable about the material. The TA's are also very wonderful. The exams were straightforward and easy, as long as you pay attention and take good notes in class!",
    "This was one of the best classes I've taken at Yale. The material is enlightening and incredibly interesting. The homework is to listen to beautiful classical music! What could be better? No weaknesses. This is a must-take.",
    "Great class. Really light workload. Tests aren't extremely easy like you might guess. You will need to actually study a lot if you have no music\/music history background.",
    "Definitely take this course! The professor and TAs were enthusiastic, approachable, invested, and effective at communicating the material. The course moved quickly, but was highly effective considering the breadth of material it covers. My one criticism is the claim that MUSI 131 can be taken by people without musical backgrounds. This is totally false. I've played piano for 13 years, but I had significant trouble picking up on the musical theory jargon that permeates this course. I would tell incoming students that having a background in music theory and\/or history is required for the course. However, the professor and TAs are very enthusiastic to help!",
    "Great class, you'll learn a lot and won't have to work that hard.",
    "Definitely take Music 131 if you are an amateur musician or music enthusiast. You will learn quite a lot from the course and Prof. Kreuzer is a great lecturer--enthusiastic and professional.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS! This was one of the best classes I've had at Yale. The workload isn't too much (4 easy listening responses, midterm, and final) and the readings aren't necessary for the exams (although they are very interesting!). Lecturers are very engaging - the professor is brilliant and really helps to make the music come alive. After taking this class, I now have a better understanding of the past 200 years of music history and have been exposed to many of the great composers since Beethoven. This is definitely a class not to miss!",
    "It's interesting material that is great to learn about. Not too much work, but the amount of material for the final really adds up.",
    "An interesting and straightforward class. Grading is reasonable and overall it's a fun and laid back experience.",
    "Very interesting, well-taught course. I don't normally take classes outside of my major, and I'm glad that during my last semester at Yale I chose to take this class.",
    "A very nice overview of music history of the time period. Not too in-depth, not too vague. I'd recommend it if you're interested and don't know much about the topic--if you already know a lot about it, you'd probably be better off taking the 300 music history instead. Not a gut, but not a ton of work either.",
    "MUSI 131 was such a incredible introduction to the history of music over the past 200 years. Professor Kreuzer's lectures were information-rich and she always managed to integrate music history with sociopolitical factors every single lecture. I feel much more well-versed in discussing composers from Western art music and would absolutely recommend this class!",
    "Very very nicely structured course taught by one of the nicest professors. The course and its exams really make you connect the dots of music history with social history. Take it. Best music course ever.",
    "The class is great if you want to take a nice survey intro course to music of all genres. Having some music background is helpful, but not necessary.",
    "Good class with not too much work, but the readings are pretty easy anyway. mix of history and learning about musical forms.",
    "YES! Take this class. Even if you don't have any music experience. It will teach you all the basics you need to know. Also, the homework is really minimal to none--- just make sure to do the listening assignments!",
    "Definitely take this course! It will enrich your life. Prof. Kreuzer is a phenomenal lecturer, and the music is breathtaking, and it is really not just a history of music, but a history of Western culture in the last two centuries. It will stay with you long after Yale.",
    "Amazing course which provides a detailed overview of the developments in music in the past 200 years.",
    "Take it it's amazing. Kreuzer is a great prof. She's incredibly knowledgable and friendly, and really loves what she does. Her classes move quickly but it's mostly because she is so passionate and has so much to say about the subject. Her enthusiasm in class is really refreshing and I'd highly recommend talking with her after class, I really enjoyed it.",
    "Take it. Wonderful class. You leave knowing and liking a lot of cool music. It takes classical music and makes it alive and compelling. Also, not that hard. One of the more rewarding classes I've taken here.",
    "intro to music from 19th and 20th centuries with heavy emphasis on identifying form and describing music in terms which you could use to a friend who has never taken a music course (i.e. no music theory, just comments on \"major\" or \"minor,\" tonal or atonal",
    "I fully recommend it, so far my favorite class!",
    "Take it for sure!! : )",
    "It's an excellent overview of music in the past 200 years! It's a great intellectual getaway for students from non-music and non-humanities majors. It makes me a more well-rounded person. It's very enjoyable. I would recommend it to other students, but I would warn them that it's not easy for students without any musical background."
