    "Take it if you want to improve your writing. Caz is great and super helpful, but be prepared to put in a lot of work and don't do it if you can't take criticism.",
    "Take this is you're serious about your writing. Caz can be intimidating and even scary, but he's approachable and loves to help you with your work, so you will feel pushed to do your best. Understand that he will expect you to focus on character in your stories--far more so than any other writing teacher you have encountered.",
    "A challenging and rewarding writing workshop--expectations are high, as they should be. You will certainly struggle and grow as a writer, especially in terms of crafting character: by his own admission, Professor Phillips cares much more about character than plot, theme, imagery, etc. He's a fair critic, but a harsh one. Don't take this course if you're precious about your writing; take it to push yourself.",
    "Great class if you want to improve your fiction writing. It is basically entirely a workshop class so you get out as much as you put it. Caz is a wonderful, no-nonsense teacher. You write two stories-- make sure you leave time to revise, revise, revise."
