   "comments": [
    "This is a good class to take if you've taken an HSHM class before and are looking for an interesting seminar with not that much work and a focus on discussion.",
    "Definitely recommend to any HSHM major. Awesome class",
    "Yes, I would highly recommend this course because it approaches women in medicine as both the healthcare provider and the patient in wonderful detail.",
    "It's a great class, and I would recommend it. It's dominated by pre-med science types who want to know more about the human side of things, but there were also some WGSS majors and HSHM majors which made the class an interesting mix. You read really interesting material that spans the course of American history, each week focusing on a specific issue related to women's role in science and medicine both as patient, healer, and physician. There was a lot of attention payed toward treatment of black women by the medical establishment, which was really interesting and important. The final paper was fun to write - a 15 page research essay on a topic of choice. Overall, a good class. You should definitely come in with a background in American history and women's history - it will make the class more useful to you.",
    "Solid readings-and-discussion seminar. Rogers emphasizes primary texts and pushes you to talk about them in nuanced ways, which is great. Reading can be heavier some weeks (but never more than ~100 pages), but the papers are well-spaced and not onerous (5-pager on a prompt drawn from class readings, 5-page close reading, 15-page research paper). Would recommend to science and humanities majors alike, as long as you're willing to do the reading and participate.",
    "Take this course. Especially if you are a woman and you are interested in medicine. Incredibly interesting topics and great course readings. It is a WR intensive course.",
    "I really enjoyed the class, but Professor Rogers is a tough grader (more likely than not I'm just a bad writer). The topics were so interesting and the discussions, although sometimes they reached the point of anecdotal bickering, were overall great. Take this class for sure, it's cool course material and Professor Rogers is absolutely brilliant.",
    "I would recommend the course. It was very interesting and you learn a lot about the issues concerning women's health.",
    "As a pre-medical student who has taken a very science-heavy courseload thus far at Yale, I absolutely loved HSHM 445. The readings were well-chosen and fascinating, the class discussions were very thought-provoking, and Professor Rogers was an incredibly kind and brilliant instructor. I thought the course load was very fair - weekly readings, 2 midterm papers, and 1 final paper. We were provided a lot of flexibility for our paper topics, which was wonderful because I was able to explore areas in the history of medicine that had always interested me, but I had never really had a chance to pursue prior to this class. Overall, I am so happy that I took this class. From taking this class, I believe that I have developed a more nuanced understanding of medicine, and have definitely improved my writing skills.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course. The reading is not bad at all - it's actually very interesting and very manageable each week. Professor Rogers is great and the material is fascinating. One of the best classes I've taken at Yale.",
    "Take this class. Professor Rogers is an amazing professor, and it is a great opportunity to learn about the history of women's health (both as patients and care providers) in the United States. The weekly readings are very doable and always so interesting (almost all primary sources from whatever time period you are looking at that week). Take it - it's so wonderful!",
    "I would highly recommend this course. It challenges you to think about women's health from a number of different perspectives and Professor Rogers does a great job of cultivating the materials and leading the course. The papers are very flexible and the course itself makes it really easy to pick topics that are especially interesting to you.",
    "HSHM 445 is a junior\/senior seminar that looks into the role of women as patients, curers, experimental subjects, activists, mothers, and healthcare providers throughout history. This gives you a lens through which to see issues and movements going on today. I would definitely recommend this course especially to students in the major. I think it helps you moving forward in the major and the readings are relevant to other courses or your senior project. Professor Rogers is a great person in the department to get to know.",
    "It is an overview course on the history of the female role in american medicine -- but selections, it is not representative (which is to be understood, given that the class is only 15 weeks).",
    "Yes, definitely. This class taught me so much about women in medicine throughout history - not just women as doctors. We discussed important issues that I never even heard or knew about before that are now relevant to my life. The workload is definitely manageable, and the readings are incredibly interesting. I looked forward to going to the discussions every week."
