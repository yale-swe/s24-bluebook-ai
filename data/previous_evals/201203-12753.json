   "comments": [
    "Take this class! If you are at all interested in history you have to take a class with Tim Snyder before leaving Yale (Since 1914 is supposed to be great two, I'd recommend the sequence). I took this class CR\/D and just went to the lectures and didn't do that much of the reading, and I still feel like I got a ton out of it. A great class.",
    "Take it. Snyder is a boss.",
    "A fascinating class on an under-appreciated area of History which is well-taught and examined in a challenging yet accessible manner.",
    "Yes. Take it. be ready though because you aren't allowed to have a computer",
    "take it if only to get to interact with professor snyder and TA kate, two of the greatest people ever. the material can be confusing, but you probably don't know a lot abou thtis subject so it can be fun!",
    "Great course to help put Eastern Europe in perspective and gives context to the state of affairs there today.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS. Timothy Snyder is a god among men, and you won't regret it. The workload is very light (unless you do all the reading), and you'll learn an enormous amount. Excellent class.",
    "I left each day feeling as though I had learned more in that one lecture than I had in entire semesters of other courses. Snyder's lectures are incredible; I wish I were able to describe them more effectively. You really walk out of this class with an appreciation, and understanding, about a fairly complex, and nuanced history. Hands down the best course I have taken in my five semesters at Yale.",
    "An excellent history class that is accessible to everyone. One of the best classes I've taken at Yale.",
    "This was my favorite course this term. It's an excellent history course taught by a wonderful instructor on a very specific region of the world. If you too have a preexisting interest in Eastern Europe (especially Poland), then definitely take this course. There are a lot of readings, which can get to be a good deal of work, but most of them are interesting.",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone interested in the region or just looking for a strong history lecture. Professor Snyder's lectures, particularly those on the development of romanticism, nationalism, and liberalism, were consistently engaging. Of course, since the class covers 1000 years of history and a vast geographic area, nothing can be covered in too much depth, but Professor Snyder did a good job balancing broader themes with illustrative cases. Overall, the workload is manageable, although the way grades are broken down is a little strange (the short essay on our final ended up counting for twice as much of our grade as the 10 page historiographical essay we wrote over the second half of the semester). But this oddity aside, a great course.",
    "Definitely recommend, the amount of material covered is enormous, so do your readings and attend lectures (they are so much fun), but the course is literary enlightening."
