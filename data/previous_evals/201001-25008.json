   "comments": [
    "If you want to go in depth on many different kinds of music from around the world, take this course. It is amazing what one will learn from it in such a short amount of time.",
    "If you get the opportunity to take a freshman seminar, TAKE THIS ONE! Prof. Veal is one of the coolest professors at Yale, and you will leave with a new appreciation for all music, not world music alone. One of the things I liked most about this course was that it was an ethnomusicology approach, which means that we studied all the music in their contexts of society, political history, and culture, rather than in some kind of sterile academic vacuum, which I loved and appreciated. This course is also a perfect way to round out a schedule - it is most certainly nowhere near a gut, but it's nice to have a course that is purely enjoyable AND academic, especially if your other classes are tedious and unrewarding. A caveat: Be careful with how you manage your time with the final papers - they can add up.",
    "Excellent course, take it if you have the opportunity, no matter what your musical background.",
    "It was an intro course to world music. I would highly recommend this class for anyone interested in music, or curious about non-Western music."
