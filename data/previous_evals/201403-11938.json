    "I felt challenged by SPAN 130, but it was a good experience. I can definitely tell that my speaking skills have improved. However, my writing skills are still pretty poor, and I really struggled to improve them.",
    "It's more or less what you'd expect. I'd recommend taking it if you're really excited about learning a new language and are willing to put up with the daily classes and make a substantial commitment to the class.",
    "Span 130 is a good class. You will learn a lot and have a decent amount of homework but it is manageable. I enjoyed having Professor Daz and would recommend him to anyone who wants to take 130.",
    "Take this course (you're probably required to) but take it with Sebastian! He is so friendly and genuinely interested in the progress of each student. He's also super funny and fun."
