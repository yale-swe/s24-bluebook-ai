    "I would definitely recommend this class. It was a nice break from conventional research papers and analytical essays.",
    "Take this course! I am not planning for heavy writing in my professional life, but I am so glad I took this class because it peaked my interest in personal writing. If you're interested in opening yourself up to new experiences, and perhaps for gaining a hobby even if you consider yourself a math\/science person, it's worth it.",
    "YES! Take this course. I am a science major and never really enjoyed writing much, but this class was extremely helpful and actually fun. DO IT!",
    "I would highly recommend this course to anyone who has any interest in writing at all (even if just for a writing credit), especially with David Gorin. The essays are perfectly manageable; actually having one due every week (or so) makes it easy to get in a rhythm and is not as taxing as may appear. Absolutely must take, you won't be disappointed.",
    "English 120 is a writing for craft class.",
    "wholeheartedly recommend him as a teacher; he has made this class a wonderful experience.",
    "English 120 is an incredible course with fantastic readings in which you write creative nonfiction. The near-weekly essays may seem daunting, but they are not in the least, even with a heavy course load (then again, I love to write, so the essays were my \"fun\" homework). If you don't already love longform or creative non-fiction, in general, (I didn't before 120), you surely will after taking this class. Be sure to actually participate in class discussions; it will make the class much more enjoyable and allows you to show that you actually have done the readings. If taking this class, by all means take it with Professor Gorin; he is one of the best professors I have ever had. He is incredible understanding, provides both critique and praise, and really cares about his students.",
    "ENGL 120 is a writing course where you can freely express yourself and whatever ideas you believe in without worry, unlike other writing courses where you have to write about specific topics. The course gives you the opportunity to explore with your writing, and develop as a result.",
    "English 120 is heralded as one of the Yale undergraduate program's \"crown jewel\" courses, and I do not believe it is undeservedly hyped. I recommend this course, because it will make you an infinitely better writer - and, if you put your all into it, a more effective person.",
    "Absolutely take this class with David Gorin!! He was an amazing instructor and my writing\/thinking\/reading skills improved incredible amounts. Our section was so much fun while being productive. He gives so much to the students with his extensive paper comments and his availability to chat and meet. The class felt relaxed and also inspiring. The readings are really great and with the support he provides, the papers don't feel too intimidating for difficult to write.",
    "I would recommend it to a student who enjoys writing and reading contemporary essays. I would recommend taking it C\/D\/F if you're not so comfortable with creative writing--the grading is not so nice due to the department regulations. But either way, if you have room for this course, totally take it, and take it with Gorin!",
    "Definitely!!"
