    "I think many FES students might think that multivariate statistics is not relevant to their career goals. I highly disagree. Throughout classes and even in the workplace we are constantly challenged to analyze data and think critically about what it means. This class, although math-heavily at times, 100% stretches both of those skills. It has given me a great appreciation for acquiring, analyzing, and presenting data.",
    "Jonathan is an excellent professor. In all honesty, I simply sat in on sessions that I found interesting or that were relevant for my particular research pursuits at any given time during the semester. My involvement was pretty minimal, but Jonathan's teaching style allows for this type of auditing. Thank you!",
    "Jonathan is a fantastic and engaging lecturer about a topic that can sometimes be presented in a rather dry way. I feel like I'm walking away from this class with some really useful multivariate statistic skills.",
    "Overall, i think you did an excellent job teaching the subject material. The thing I struggled with the most was applying the things we learned in class to the homework; partly because I struggled to use some of the computer programs, and partly because the outputs of those programs can be confusing. I almost feel like a flipped version of the class (or a partially flipped version) might be more useful; that students could spend time learning to use the programs with you and the TFs present to help.",
    "Professor Reuning-Scherer is a great instructor, dedicated to the learning experience of his students. The pace is fast, but he makes himself available providing many opportunities for students to ask questions.",
    "One problem I had with the course is that the TA's were not comfortable with the software (SAS) I was using. So when I ran up against problems I had to spend a lot of time trying to figure it out on my own or rely on the professor."

    "The examples and illustration of the concepts",

    "Useful material.",
    "I really enjoyed learning and applying advanced statistical techniques, and being able to use a data set of our choosing to complete assignments.",

The lectures move quickly - he packs a lot into the time so the videos are a lifesaver!",
