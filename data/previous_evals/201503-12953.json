    "Music 210 is not an easy course but it is doable. However, do not assume that it will be easy if you already know some music theory, because the nomenclature is entirely new. If you like music theory, it is a good course to take.",
    "If you want a foundation in analysis and composition, this is a good course for you.",
    "A solid course, and worth taking if you're considering lessons for credit. With the music theory and musicianship sequence, the quality of your course depends really heavily on who teaches it, so choose carefully. Peter Selinsky was very considerate and taught us all the material in a very logical sequential progression, so he would definitely be a good choice for this class. However, if you're just trying to learn some music theory for fun and don't plan to actually do anything with music, this probably isn't the class for you."
