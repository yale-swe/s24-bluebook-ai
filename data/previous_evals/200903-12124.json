   "comments": [
    "This seminar is very manageable. A reading response every week and a paper at the end of the semester is a pretty good deal, especially when class discussions are very open-ended; however much or little of the reading you do, you will be able to find a way to participate. If you are interested in the European Union and want to learn more about it, then this is a good class to take.",
    "It's a pretty easy course, you do a one-page response on the reading every week, participation counts, but unlike other poli-sci seminars, its only a 15 page paper at the end on whatever you want to write about relating to the EU.",
    "The European Union is a course that surveys the beginnings of the EU to current day policies. It is seminar driven by discussion and inputs from Prof. Cameron. The work\/grading structure is as follows: we have weekly 1-2 page reading responses on any of the readings, discussion, and the 15 page final paper. Each portion comprises a third of the final grade. In the beginning the course was TOO student based. Quite frankly, while I value peer input I would very much like to have input from the professor. Thankfully, Cameron was responsive, and mixed his lecture with student discussion. Overall, the class was engaging yet relaxed. Cameron is generous with grading, so long as you work hard and engage yourself in discussion.",
    "Very good and comprehensive political science seminar. Reading is really dull at the beginning, but it gets a lot better. The one caveat is that you have no idea what your grade is at any point during the course.",
    "For anyone who wants an in-depth study of the structure and policymaking of the EU, yes.",
    "Yes. Critical to understand the EU if you want to understand the world economy and the changing political landscape.",
    "if you are unwilling to do the reading then you shouldn't bother taking this class. it really shows during seminar.but if you are willing to put in the time to do the reading, this class can be fun and informative.",
    "If you have a decent background on the EU, you can improve this and get a good feel for the functioning and history of the EU. If you don't, don't take the class - it seemed like a lot of the class wasn't that interested in the topics.",
    "This class is not great because the teacher lets the kids who know a lot about the EU coming into the class do all the talking. As someone who knew very little, I had to do a lot of reading on my own in order to know what we were talking about in class. If you already have a good background understanding of the EU this may be a good class for you. Otherwise maybe find another course."
