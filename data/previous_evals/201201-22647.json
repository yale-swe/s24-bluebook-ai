    "Take it! You'll enjoy the beauty of the language. Though the grad student are good I hear, Maripaz was amazing!",
    "Yes",
    "I would recommend this class. You learn a lot of Spanish in a semester but it definitely does not move too fast. Sra. Garcia was great. She was very engaging in conversation and it never seemed forced. I hope to have more Spanish teachers like her again.",
    "Spanish 110 is a beginner level Spanish course that covers a lot of material in a short amount of time. This dynamic and pace is very rewarding: I went from no knowledge of Spanish to being able to talk in the present, past, and future about quite a few topics. With that said, some of the larger topics don't get as much time or focus as might be useful. The workload is light, but the class is a lot of fun. I would definitely recommend it!",
    "Great class - good intro, moves fast and leaves you with a basic profiency in the language after just four months."
