   "comments": [
    "Certainly would recommend.",
    "PLSC 540 is an opportunity to carve out time to work on a year-long project. Although the class time itself did not always seem useful, it is a great opportunity to have the time to research and have a structured way of getting feedback from multiple professors.",
    "I cannot recommend this class. I think it should be discontinued and converted into a 3rd year class for writing and workshopping the prospectus.",
    "It's a good chance to start working on a topic of interest independently.",
    "Obviously this course is mandatory, but I would recommend that the department rethink the way that it is operated and administered. While some of the blame falls on the instructors, the idea of moving from concept to research to publishable paper in 6 months is silly, especially as a learning process. R&W should be re-envisioned as a two year 'course' where the classroom section is dropped in favor of additional time working with a student's advisor(s). If the goal is to produce a publishable paper, the model of a master's thesis is well established and would be a significantly more positive experience than R&W.",
    "This course provides a useful way to get a sense of the publication process and focus on one project in a sustained way. I would recommend it to other students in the second or third year because I think it is good to have publication on our radars relatively early in the program."

   "question_text": "How did this course deepen your knowledge of your discipline\/profession? To what extent did this course contribute to your dissertation\/research?",
   "comments": [
    "Answered above.",
    "This course allowed me to explore my interests and I have become much more comfortable with my place in the discipline as a result.",
    "My primary takeaway from this class was that the publication process (and political science in general) rewards narrow, tractable papers based on off-the-shelf data. Students who wanted to collect original data were at a disadvantage unless they had already started in the 1st year. Throughout R&W, I felt that original or ambitious projects were being discouraged as impractical. Maybe this was the point of the class, but I came away feeling like what we were told during orientation -- about the importance of asking big and difficult questions -- was either untrue, or just a losing strategy.",
    "It encouraged me to work on an independent project earlier in the program.",
    "I think the most compelling\/unfortunate insight into the profession was the fact that Mini APSA--touted by the instructors as \"make or break\" professionally and a source of great stress-- was attended by essentially none of the faculty and only a few of the other graduate students. Frankly, if we had known this we would have spent less time on our projects and more time on the (relatively well attended) skit.",
    "I learned a lot about a particular topic and about what it would take to write a publishable paper. I am not sure that I will continue working on this project as part of my dissertation, but my research will benefit from the things I learned this year."
