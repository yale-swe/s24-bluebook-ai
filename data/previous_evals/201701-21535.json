    "This course was great for individual feedback on saxophone performance and general improvement. This course would be better if moved to the canvas or classes v2 website",
    "I was extremely excited to begin lessons. In the first lesson, my teacher talked too much and didn't let me sing enough. When I asked him what to practice he said singing in your normal daily life was enough. This was disappointing. Also I had to keep reaching out to him to get lessons. He was slow to respond and it began taking more and more energy to chase after him to send me songs and to schedule lessons. He also structured lessons around warm ups instead of around singing music. This was disappointing.",
    "Strength: enjoyed the studio classes; gave us a chance to hear\/critique our peers' playing and to be exposed to a variety of styles Weakness: none"
