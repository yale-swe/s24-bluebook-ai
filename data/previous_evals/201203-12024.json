    "A GREAT OPPORTUNITY TO WORK WITH NON-HUMAN PRIMATES. I WOULD ABSOLUTELY RECOMMEND IT FOR OTHER STUDENTS IF YOU ARE INTERESTED IN PSYCHOLOGY AND COMPARATIVE COGNITION.",
    "N\/A",
    "Research. Lots of research",
    "Directed Research it's cool, it's a nice switch up from the tedium of classes, just get on that 20 page paper early, otherwise you're going to be stressed out.",
    "Med school PIs are not nearly as lenient as undergrad profs. Keep that in mind when picking a project and location to work.",
    "I would definitely recommend it for another student. research was fun and I learned a lot about performing experiments on subjects who were less than cooperative. Every variable had to be accounted for.",
    "For my class, I worked in the SCD lab. 8 hours of lab time a week plus 1 hour lab meeting a week. I really enjoyed the lab meeting since we got to learn about the grad students' currant research\/read relevant papers. Lab time was ok. Most of time was spent doing tasks like calling to get participants\/filling etc. Best was when actually got to run studies. Also spending time with the grad students was great to learn about their experiences and grad school. End of term paper for 1 credit is 10 pages.",
    "Yes! If you have an interest in learning how Psych Research works. But I think it really depends on whom you work with. I worked with an AWESOME grad student and I had really interesting work to do.",
    "All psychology majors should do directed research. Putting your knowledge to use in a research setting is important for so many reasons. It solidifies your understanding of psychology, teaches you a more nuanced view than you typically get from course material, and it gives you a chance to see how the information you learn in class is actually produced.",
    "I would definitely recommend directed research to someone who is interested in doing research but does not have the time to do it as an extracurricular activity. Its a great way to get hands on experience and see what it is like in an actual lab.",
    "If you have been working with a lab and a mentor and you are genuinely interested in the work, a Directed Research independent study is the best way to gain firsthand experience in research. I would definitely recommend this option.",
    "It is invaluable to have the opportunity to get credit for research experience. Do research. It is the one of the few chances you have to go beyond just being a traditional classroom student in a traditional classroom setting.",
    "Great. Depending on your lab, it's time consuming, but a good experience and pretty easy if you put in the work",
    ".",
    "If you are thinking of applying to graduate school in psychology, then gaining research experience is the best way to both 1) improve your chances and 2) gauge whether you even enjoy research (research is altogether a very different experience from standard course work).",
    "This is a great way to fulfill your senior requirement for the psych major - you should definitely consider trying to do a semester during your junior year to get a head start. Just make sure you contact lab professors early and find one that you are genuinely interested in and with a professor you really connect with.",
    "I definitely recommend doing some research while in college. Great opportunity to get to know a professor and take part in the expansion of academia.",
    "Do it, obviously! Get credit for your research. Flexible requirements. The more you put in the more you get out of it. Not much more to say.",
    "Independent studies are awesome! You really get to pick the brain of a professor, and if you have one as knowledgeable and kind as Professor LaFrance, even better.",
    "Def take this class. My advisor was really lax as long as we completed all the hours for the week. At the same time, as a junior this lab experience helped me plan for my senior requirements and set the path for my thesis work. Professor Cannon is a very smart and personable professor, just make time to meet with him.",
    "Great. Do some research!",
    "Yes."
