   "question_text": "What knowledge, skills, and insights did you develop by taking this course?",
   "comments": [
    "This course helped me see literature as formulaic, rather than just art. It was so interesting to analyze the structure, tone, style and characters of a story instead of just talking about meaning and themes. I also learned how to think more creatively and make my own stories, which is seldom asked of students in English classes.",
    "Learned how to engage in a workshop environment for writing. Also, got to read some good books.",
    "You'll read a really diverse spread of books and genres, and this class is unique in that the focus is not on analyzing the works, but looking at the storytelling techniques of each work. How can authors more skillfully construct a story? How can one write the arc of a story in a successful way? I found it was a refreshing focus on the mechanics of fiction rather than on the underlying meaning of a body of a work.",
    "I essentially learnt how to structure a fiction story!",
    "I gained a more nuanced understanding of how I can learn from the fiction I read and apply this to my own writing without necessarily mimicking anything. Adam also did a great job of teaching us how to read our own writing the way we would someone else's and edit our own plots and characters accordingly.",
    "I learned how to boil down writing fiction (for better or for worse) into a learnable and workable skill, which, as a student who isn't experienced in the subject, I found super cool."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I loved the way we workshopped students' stories. I wish we had workshopped everything we read that way.",
    "This course was a must-take! It's so amazing that Yale offers a course where your homework is to read short stories and classic novels, do fun writing assignments and then write your own short story. Professor Sexton is such a helpful, kind guy, and he was always open to meeting with students after class. The workload wasn't too heavy and the readings were all pretty amazing (Sense and Sensibility, A Farewell to Arms, The Metamorphosis, Beloved... the list goes on). I could have done without Faulkner, but I know some people like him so that can't really count as a weakness of the course itself. Thee workshopping of our short stories that we did later on was so helpful for my own writing, and it was also cool to read and criticize other people's stories.",
    "I think the premise of the course was good, but in practice, it was a little shaky. I was under the impression that \"reading fiction for craft\" would be a touch more nuanced than what the class turned out to be, which was basically talking about \"PLOT\" and \"CHARACTERS,\" one large isolated chunk per week. The rules that were given to us about writing were mostly broken by the works of literature that we read, so their effectiveness as examples weren't so useful. Additionally, the two things that I like most about stories -- interesting ideas and good sentences -- were not encouraged or even discussed at all, which resulted in a lot of bland and very basic stories when it came time to workshop. I'm not sure that it could be made any different, and it may have been my fault for not understanding how the course was set up.",
    "Strengths: You'll get samplings of SO many different writing styles, from famous authors and also your classmates. Then you'll have the opportunity to write a complete short story at the end with all of the insight you've gathered, and workshop it to get feedback from other classmates. Professor Sexton is amazing: he's an engaging and funny professor, kind and understanding, and very socially aware (he varies the pronouns when speaking of hypothetical writers, using she\/her to refer to writers, which made a lot of people in the class surprisingly pleased. It's sad that this still surprises students in its rarity at Yale, but it's great that he's helping change stereotypes). Weaknesses: Not everyone in the class was engaged or truly interested in the \"craft\" of fiction, so the class felt very basic at times (people would raise their hand and say, \"I like this, I don't like this\" instead of offering real insight, which had the effect of slowing down the course and making some of the classes feel redundant or repetitive). The final few weeks of class, when we workshopped everyone's stories, felt long and repetitive... it's hard since everyone deserves a chance to be workshopped, but I didn't enjoy these classes as much.",
    "The main strength is the wonderful Professor Adam Sexton! I also really enjoyed how structured it was, and how his book essentially served as a guide for the entire class. I wish we got to workshop more!",
    "The strength I would want to draw attention to is the workshops. They were super helpful, and I think talking about each others' writing is a great way to start thinking about our own. I also thought the manner in which the writers aren't allowed to speak in the conversation until later on was well done.",
    "I think that there could have been more short story assignments, not just exercises. That way students have more the ability to revise more than just one story."

   "comments": [
    "If you like writing, absolutely take this course! One of the best courses I have taken at Yale!",
    "10\/10 would recommend. This was definitely one of the best classes I've taken at Yale, and I'm not even an English major! Take this course if you can get into it!!! (Also, be persistent if you're put on the waitlist. It's worth it.)",
    "I think this class is good for extremely elementary story construction. Much of the syllabus you've probably already read (quite possibly in high school) and the assignments themselves are quick. Comments and exercises were sometimes helpful, and I think would have been more helpful if they had been less focused on the basics and more on style and technique. If you've never written a story before, and want to try it out, this would make an acceptable fifth class.",
    "A highly recommended course! You'll get samplings of SO many different writing styles, from famous authors and also your classmates. Then you'll have the opportunity to write a complete short story at the end with all of the insight you've gathered, and workshop it to get feedback from other classmates. Professor Sexton is amazing: he's an engaging and funny professor, kind and understanding, and very socially aware, so the type of English professor you'll actually want to learn from! I will say, however, that if you're an advanced writer or considering majoring in English, this class might feel a little basic (even though it comes numerically after the 125\/126 sequence). Some of the students in the class weren't so engaged in the actual craft of fiction and were taking it because they enjoyed reading stories - more power to them! - but if you do want more of a challenge, you might want to consider the upper-level writing courses.",
    "A nice introduction to writing fiction for both English majors and non-majors. It's not intensive, and you get to read quite a diverse collection of literature. Professor Sexton is very kind, thoughtful, and helpful; highly recommend seeing him at office hours if you want to get extra feedback on your writing. Overall, it's a great, relatively low-key class for people who want a better grasp on writing fiction.",
    "Absolutely!",
    "I would absolutely recommend it, especially if you're looking to improve your writing and\/or if you enjoy reading fiction and want to have more time assigned to reading it in your academic life. It's a great balance for more stressful courses, I took it along with my thesis and doing the work was like a reward.",
    "If you are looking for some great fiction to read I definitely would. If you're looking to be doing extensive short story writing each week, this course would function as a good intro to that but may not be the best class to fulfill the need."
