    "I learned a lot about historical and contemporary identification and surveillance concepts and cases. I also developed new ways of thinking about, and analyzing, these topics.",
    "VERY interesting class",
    "Topics included human identification technologies, modern surveillance systems and many global examples of each.",
    "I learned about the development and use of certain technologies to create or establish identities.",
    "I learned about the global history of how identification strategies shaped societies.",
    "Learned about the history of identification and surveillance.",
    "I developed a strong sense of the history of surveillance technologies on a global scale. The course pushes students to think about all of the methods of identification and consequential surveillance of citizens that states have used throughout history, by also examining political and social occurrences impacting these themes around the world.",
    "A truly global course on the histories of technological surveillance and also identification methods!"

    "This was an excellent course. Professor Ragas taught the concepts very well, balancing between using a PowerPoint and engaging the class throughout each lecture. The syllabus and readings were organized really well, and facilitated productive discussions and lectures. I really enjoyed every single class. I wish Yale had more classes like this one!",
    "This course could have included more facts, names, dates, laws etc. it felt very vague and conceptual instead of a normal history class. The topics discussed and the examples used were very interesting though. I really appreciated that this class actually included many if not mostly global examples and not just an American perspective.",
    "The main strength of this class was that it was actually global history and the material was interesting. The weakness is that the course want organized.",
    "Very interesting subject, and the professor is knowledgable and engaging. The class could be better organized to trace themes between weeks in a different order. The class could also at times be a bit repetitive.",
    "The course has great breadth and includes perspectives from all regions including traditionally underrepresented ones."

    "I would definitely recommend this course!!! The workload is very manageable (a midterm, final, section w\/ a few weekly readings, and 4-5 page film paper). More importantly, the lectures and readings are super interesting, and Professor Ragas is a personable and insightful teacher. I wish Yale had more classes like this one!",
    "ABSOLUTELY.",
    "I would recommend it because it had interesting lectures, relaxed exams and paper and had amazing instructors (prof and TF were both amazing)",
    "YES! The material itself is quite fascinating, and will impact how you view the mess of technology around you.",
    "Yes! You learn a lot and all the information is very relevant and interesting. You cant learn it anywhere else.",
    "Yes. The course was on an interesting subject with a professor who cared about the material.",
    "I would 100000% recommend this course to another student. Professor Ragas and Sarah Pickman were both excellent instructors, and I felt as though each week and each theme perfectly challenged but intrigued the students. I left the course feeling extremely happy due to the amount that I learned, the fairness of the grading, and the thought-provoking discussions and readings.",
    "Absolutely. Professor Ragas is amazing!",
    "Absolutely! A highly interesting course."
