    "Knowledge about the theories of kinetics which allowed for analysis of reaction processes. some measuring techniques and information on how to evaluate and read research papers",
    "I learned the basic concepts regarding kinetics and modelling of reactors such as CSTR and plug flow. Also, the course was very helpful while giving the students more contact and familiarity with the literature."

    "the handout is sometimes not well organized.",

    "This course needs clearer structure. A syllabus with the order of topics and grade distribution would be helpful so that we know what assignments to expect. Also, getting grades back on homework assignments would help us know how we are doing in the class.",
    "Advantages: introduce more general stuff, cover a lot of topics. Disadvantages: some topics don't have details",
    "Strength: The note covered almost all the information. A lot of topics about reactions is included. Weakness: Demonstration of some process is too fast and simple.",
    "The course included many aspects about chemical engineering. But it could be better if some details were to be addressed.",
    "weakness: it appeared disconnected and there was no continuous flow of ideas. strength: the way of evaluation was good and allowed for overall testing of the subject matter",
    "Strengths: all the important concepts were exposed and the big picture of chemical reactions was well defined. Weakness: not many problem sets."
