    "The lectures were very clear and engaging, and I enjoyed discovering links between the fundamental physiology taught in the first half and the applications of the theory in the second half. Demonstrations of actual methods were great and I would have loved more hands-on or outdoor activities.",
    "This course was a great mix between lecture and discussion. I like that it was a small class, because that allowed for interaction between students",
    "Reading and discussing scientific literature.",
    "This course opened my eyes to w whole field of science I never knew. The instructor was conducting ground-breaking experiments in the field and kept us very up-to-date with the field. I really appreciated how the instructor was concerned that we students learned important things from this class and cared about the subject. Certain professors, such as Dana Tomlin, could learn tremendously from this young professor's interest in his students and care for FES in general. Also, the teaching assistant was great. I would recommend this class to anyone interested in plants.",
    "The combination of fundamentals and applied, particularly as explicitly interesting to the class!",
    "The structure of the class in the first half of the semester was very conducive to learning. I liked how class started out with a lecture or powerpoint and then transitioned into discussion of the readings. The hands-on part of the class was also very helpful to understand how many of the studies we read about later in the class were conducted.",
    "Class time outside with tools was great!"

   "question_id": "FS0044",
   "question_text": "What aspects of this course need the most improvement?",
   "comments": [
    "More structure\/background to contextualize the readings in the second half of the course - it was good practice for students to lead class, but those discussions also ended up being less focused.",
    "I liked it as is",
    "Prof. Brodersen needs to speak up; he swallows his words sometimes, making it difficult to follow. Also, the course could use a little more background about the field and plant biology before diving into the complex materials to be studied. The format of the course was strained a bit in the second half of the semester. We were to present several dry scientific papers for a several hour class period. Ideally this type of class should facilitate discussion, but we really needed more instructor leadership in facilitating the conversation.",
    "I think that there were plant terminology basics (as opposed to just water basics) that it would've been useful to review. Maybe just give us some of the extra intro material with plant parts etc that you use in the undergrad course?",
    "A crash course in plant physiology would be very helpful in the beginning of the semester. It could be an extra session held by the TA. The second half of the semester (the student lead discussion sections) were not always helpful. Three hours is a long time for students to lead a discussion on very technical research papers."
