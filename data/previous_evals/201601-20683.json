    "A lot of work with a huge payoff.",
    "Yes. Important texts, sometimes a bore to read, but still important. H&P is such a weird course, and your experience will really depend on whom you have for your section. Luckily, most of the profs are fantastic, and you'll learn a lot from any of them. Don't switch if you have Pincus - he's fantastic.",
    "Not a comprehensive course--but you'll learn a ton.",
    "A rigorous survey of the Western Canon in Historical and Political Thought. I would recommend it if you're interested in the subject and would like to observe how political theory developed over the course of history.",
    "This was probably my favorite DS section! DS Historical and Political Thought deals with the big questions about society, government, history, and human nature. This section is great because Professor Pincus does not rest until he feels that we have fully understood each author's thought and the complexities and implications of it. The section was a lot of work, but it was definitely worth it since I feel like I got a lot more out of the class than I would have if I did not have to prepare so well for Professor Pincus's class. Professor Pincus places a lot of importance on historical context, something I felt other sections did not do as much and which further deepened my learning experience. Definitely take this class!",
    "The papers will be harder, the readings will be *much* more interesting, and you'll get a ridiculous amount out of this class if you put the work in. Aside from a few duds here and there, the lectures are mostly super helpful (I finally \"got\" Marx only after hearing Prof. Benhabib explain his writing). You can skim almost none of this semester's reading--especially not Hobbes, Rousseau, Kant, Marx, or Arendt--and honestly, why would you want to? This is what you suffered through Polybius for; enjoy the fruits of your labor!"
