    "This course is perfect for someone who has a good grasp of most, if not all, of Shakespeare's plays. There is still a good deal of background and introductory discussion, but in order to really learn from the later discussions, it's best to have a solid foundation in place. That way, searching for some of the deeper difficulties and moments of tension in the play becomes exciting instead of repetitive.",
    "I would absolutely recommend the course to anyone interested in Shakespeare. In sum, the course is a careful exploration of Shakespeare's late works with an eye toward inwardness and character.",
    "Story time with Harold Bloom. If you can figure a way into this class, take it. I've never met a professor more capaciously brilliant or insightful as Harold. Completely unlike any other class at Yale, but well worth every minute.",
    "This is a truly unique Yale experience. If you get in, you must take it, and you must not take it as a normal class, but as an educational opportunity in the presence of one of the most (aged but) brilliant minds of academia. You will be expected to form a relationship with the works and with Bloom - Sunday office hours at his house are expected, and in some ways, are one of the best parts.",
    "Definitely!"
