   "comments": [
    "I learned a lot about the microbial communities\/microbiome research, which I had not read in depth about before I learned how to model much better I was really impacted by Alvaro consistently pointing out that we're looking for universal laws or truths, not just rules that apply under certain conditions. I think that this was a really important insight that I'm now taking forward throughout all my graduate school work.",
    "I learned about modeling communities, and how modeling microbial communities are different. I gained a better knowledge of potential explanations for microbial coexistence and diversity.",
    "I learned about microbial ecology and valuable coding skills.",
    "Concepts about microbial evolution and ecology",
    "My ability to read scientific articles efficiently and critically improved with this class. I improved my writing skills with the preparation of the mid-term review paper. I also learned about consumer resources models and how you can manipulate mathematical models to better describe your system of interest."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "For the first half of the course it would be better to be clear about the expectations for the readings beforehand. Sometimes they were and sometimes they weren't, but it would be helpful to always know which readings were the most important, and how closely to read each one. We also didn't really talk about microbial evolution much if at all. I feel like it would be good to incorporate more of that into the readings Also with the modeling project sometimes it was unclear what the final products were supposed to look like for each step of the way. This was most noticeable with the final report, where I wasn't really sure how to structure it or what the total amount of content should be. It may have been mentioned in class and I missed it, but that would be useful to codify and put on the website for reference as we're all writing our reports",
    "The topics chosen were interesting and had a good balance between depth and breadth. I disliked that the number of papers assigned prevented in depth discussion about them. The shift between primarily reading papers in the first half of the class and primarily doing a project in the second half of the class seemed abrupt. The professor was approachable, available, and helpful when questions about the project arose. However, those problems arose more than necessary because the amount of coding knowledge required was underestimated. Spending more time on teaching coding in class or recommending coding experience would have made the course run more smoothly.",
    "I think there could be a more hands on way to engage with the consumer-resource model and how to code it.",
    "Strengths: writing the review paper was a great exercise Weaknesses: instructions were often unclear, and I wish there was more instruction about coding in the class as promised, or the syllabus reflected that a strong background in coding was required. Expectations about the depth that papers needed to be read for class varied from week to week, which was very confusing.",
    "Strengths of this course: exposure to the breadth of environments where microorganisms exist via papers at the beginning of the course; computational component, which is relatively unique for a biology class. Weaknesses of this course: I felt that there was a lack of structure for the classes associated with the computational project. Instead of presenting progress each week, workshops might have been helpful."

    "Absolutely, for students interested in microbial ecology and modeling microbial communities",
    "I would recommend the course, but I would also warn them. The course seemed to figure itself out as it progressed- which is not a bad thing, but made the class difficult to anticipate. The course was more work and more coding than expected, but I feel I learned a lot.",
    "Absolutely, especially if interested in microbial ecology and coding.",
    "No",
    "I would recommend this course to another student because the topic was interesting. We also had an opportunity to do some mathematical modeling, which was a unique element to this course."
