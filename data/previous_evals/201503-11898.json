   "comments": [
    "This course is all about reading and understanding Old English literature, in the original. You don't need any background in Old English to take the course, though foreign language experience is helpful. It isn't a particularly difficult course -- do the translations, review your translations for the exams, and make an interesting presentation, and you should do just fine! You learn a lot about the English language as well as the Old English way of thinking. It's a fun and very interesting course!",
    "Wonderful course, highly informative, peppered with gems of knowledge of Old English History: but the real gem is being able to read manuscripts from the Exeter Book in the original. Truly a wonderful experience to be able to take a class with Professor Frank. She's so knowledgeable and understanding, and a strength is her real desire for you to love Old English as much as she does. Low course load, but keep on top of it, as it will certainly sneak up on you! Final and Midterm are not hard, but require study of all the texts from the semester. Presentation is really fun to do, and fun to see others.",
    "English 150 is a great course to take if you're looking for a unique but well-taught area of study. You simultaneously learn the historical interpretations of Old English manuscripts as well as their analysis from a literature perspective. By the end of the term, you will have a proficient understanding of the language. There are a lot of translation to do, but they go by fairly quickly, and are ultimately extremely helpful. Roberta Frank is a wonderful professor. She is patient but motivational and exceptionally sweet with a great sense of humor. As an expert at Old English, she understands the difficulties of the language, especially as this is an English class and not a Language credit. 10\/10 would learn from again. Careful for the very last exam, it sneaks up on you.",
    "I would recommend it! A relatively easy course, particularly if you read the evaluations and realize that you have to know the passages for the final. I recommend studying the vocab throughout the course and making flashcards - it would have made studying for the final much easier. For English majors, I took this after English 125 but if you take it before it will make Chaucer infinitely easier.",
    "I would recommend English 150 to anyone, English majors and non-majors alike. The workload is very manageable, and the assessments are not difficult as long as you put in the work.",
    "You start by learning the fundamentals of Old English grammar as well as some vocabulary. Next, you read prose and poetry from the time period in its original form and go over the translations in class. Finally, the class reads Beowulf in modern English translation towards the end.",
    "'Twas an excellent course! We read several fun texts (my favorites were the riddles), and Roberta is simply a delightful human being. I really enjoyed seeing where our modern language came from."
