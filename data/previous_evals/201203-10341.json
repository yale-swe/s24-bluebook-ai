    "This course was a survey in the Francophone African novel. The novelsthemselves were not chosen because they all apply to a specific theme, or center around common questions. They represent a diverse geographic range. The chosen texts were very rich, very engaging, very enjoyable to read. The discussions they provoked were as diverse as the texts. Great course. Would definitely recommend.",
    "African francophone texts, analyzed in light of post-colonialism, but without post-colonial theory taking over, which makes for a good balance. Would definitely recommend."

    "This might not be directly related to my research (that is, I don't plan on writing on the Francophone African novel), but I really admire the professor's approach. It also got me thinking about ways to incorporate colonial and post-colonial perspectives into my own work."
